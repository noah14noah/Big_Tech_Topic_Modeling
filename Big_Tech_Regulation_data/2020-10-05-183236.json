The deal that gave Facebook a stronghold in this fast-growing region followed a $5.7 billion investment that recently injected it with Reliance Jio, an Indian telecom giant.</p><p><br/>These actions are part of a series of investments made by the social network, which also included $400 million last month to buy an animated <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Graphics Exchange Format</emphasis> (GIF) company that is investing millions of dollars to build an underground fiber optic cable of nearly 38,000 kilometers around Africa. On Thursday, Facebook confirmed that it was also setting up a venture capital fund to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">invest in promising start-ups.</emphasis><br/>Other tech giants are taking similar actions. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple </emphasis>has bought at least four companies this year and released a new iPhone. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> has purchased <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">three cloud computing companies. Amazon</emphasis> is in talks to acquire a self-employed vehicle start-up, rented more delivery airplanes, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">hired 175,000 more people since March.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis> introduced new messaging and video features.<br/>Although the global economy teeters in a pandemic recession and dozens of companies file for bankruptcy, the most important technology companies\u2014still very profitable and with billions of dollars from years of corporate dominance\u2014are <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">laying the groundwork for a future in which they will be bigger and more powerful than ever.</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft</emphasis> are making risky new bets now that the coronavirus pandemic has made them almost <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">essential</emphasis> services because people turn to them to shop online, entertain themselves, and stay in touch with their loved ones. The large increase in their use has given these companies a new impetus to invest while other industries are contracting.<br/>Expansion is taking place as lawmakers and regulators in Washington and Europe warn about the concentration of power of tech giants and how they may have harmed their competitors and caused other problems, such as the spread of misinformation. Last week, EU officials were<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> preparing antitrust charges </emphasis>against Amazon for using its dominance in e-commerce to obstruct its smaller rivals, while the UK began an investigation into Facebook's purchase of the GIF company.<br/>Some of the tech giants have not concealed their intention to continue advancing a recession that has left more than 44 million Americans out of work and officials warn will be protracted.<br/>\"I've always believed that, in times of economic slowdown, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">it's best to keep investing in the construction of the future,\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">said Mark Zuckerberg,</emphasis>CEO of Facebook, at a meeting with investors last month. When the world changes rapidly, people have other needs, and that means <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">new things must be built.\"</emphasis><br/>By doubling the commitment to growth at a time of economic unrest, larger tech companies are maintaining a pattern. In previous recessions, those who invested when the economy was at its most vulnerable were almost always strengthened. In the 1990s, IBM took advantage of a recession to move from a hardware company to a software and services company. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google and Facebook </emphasis>emerged from the dotcom bubble about 20 years ago.<br/>Apple, whose iPhones now dominate the market, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">doubled its R&amp;D; budget</emphasis> for two years during the recession of the early first decade of this century. That led the company, which almost went bankrupt in the late 1990s, to create its iPod music player and iTunes music store, and later the iPhone, App Store and unbridled growth streak, said <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jenny Chatman,</emphasis>a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley campus.<br/>Ranjan Roy, a technology analyst at The Margins, an Internet industry blog, commented that it was clear that tech giants were not afraid to take any more risks now and that the power they were accumulating should make us reflect.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Without any opposition from regulators, big tech companies would almost certainly come out of the pandemic with greater power,\" he</emphasis> said. \"Many other sectors of our daily lives are starting to depend on their products, or they could only buy or copy the services they don't yet offer.\"<br/>However, companies are at risk when they invest for an uncertain period, said John Paul Rollert, a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Doubling and even tripling the bet when the casino is on fire is an exceptional move because they may not even be able to collect their chips later,\" </emphasis>he said.<br/>Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, who didn't respond to or refused comment requests, have a lot of money. According to a financial disclosure record, all boards are located above approximately $557 billion, allowing them to maintain a pace of acquisitions and investments similar to last year, when the economy was thriving. According to accounting firm PwC, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">they are among the companies that have invested the most in research and development for most of the past decade.</emphasis><br/>These companies have increased their activity since March, when orders to stay at home began. When Amazon, Facebook, and others adapted to their employees working from home, they experienced an increase in usage. The popularity of e-messaging and other software for teleconferences increased.<br/>That created opportunities. For example, Microsoft began promoting its <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Teams video conferencing services,</emphasis> which allows people to talk and collaborate online. In order to provide more technology to enterprises, in recent months, Microsoft also acquired three cloud computing companies: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Affirmed Networks, Metaswitch Networks, and Softomotive.</emphasis><br/>Google also updated products that people can use to work from home. In April, he said that his video chat service, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google Meet,</emphasis>would be readily available within Gmail windows and would be free for everyone whothey had a Google account. He also said that, in order to strengthen e-commerce searches, he would start listing, mostly free of charge, in the results of his shopping searches rather than merchants paying for all their products to appear in the results.<br/>Last month, Facebook bought the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Giphy</emphasis> Chart Exchange Format company for about $400 million. Giphy will integrate with Instagram, Facebook's photo sharing app. And last week, this social network invested millions in Gojek. Headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gojek</emphasis> is an application for<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> digital payments, transportation and other services </emphasis>that more than 170 million people use in Southeast Asia.<br/>Facebook is now working on its new venture capital fund, which will help you place new popular apps. Previously, it was reported on this fund in Axios.<br/>As it gets underway, Zuckerberg may be doing what a member of Facebook's board of directors, venture capital investor Marc Andreessen, said. In April, Andreessen wrote a blog post titled <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"It's Time to Build,\"</emphasis>in which he said, \"We need to demand more from our political leaders, our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors.\"<br/>Less than two weeks later, Zuckerberg said at the investor meeting that that was exactly what he did: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">build.</emphasis><br/>He noted that he felt \"a responsibility and the duty to invest\", adding, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"We are in a privileged position to be able to do so.\"</emphasis><br/>Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, in Palo Alto, California, on April 11, 2019. (Jessica Chou/The New York Times)<br/>Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are making new and risky bets now that the coronavirus pandemic has turned them into almost essential services and the huge increase in their use has given these companies a new impetus to invest while other industries are contracting.

The deal, which gave Facebook a bigger foothold in the rapidly growing region, followed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">a $5.7 billion investment</url> it recently pumped into Reliance Jio, a telecom giant in India.</p><p>The moves were part of a spending spree by the social network, which also shelled out $400 million last month to buy an animated GIF company and which is spending millions of dollars to build a nearly 23,000-mile undersea<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">fiber-optic cable</url> encircling Africa. On Thursday, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\"/>confirmed that it was also developing a venture capital fund to invest in promising start-ups.</p><p>Other technology giants are engaging in similar behavior. Apple has bought at least four companies this year and released a new iPhone. Microsoft has purchased three cloud computing businesses. Amazon is in talks to acquire an autonomous vehicle start-up, has leased more airplanes for delivery and has hired an additional 175,000 people since March. Google has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">unveiled new</url>messaging and video features.</p><p>Even with the global economy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">reeling from a pandemic-induced recession</url> and dozens of businesses filing for bankruptcy, tech\u2019s largest companies \u2014 still wildly profitable and flush with billions of dollars from years of corporate dominance \u2014 are deliberately laying the groundwork for a future where they will be bigger and more powerful than ever.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are aggressively placing new bets as the coronavirus pandemic has made them <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">near-essential services</url>, with people turning to them to shop online, entertain themselves and stay in touch with loved ones. The skyrocketing use has given the companies new fuel to invest as other industries retrench.</p><p>The expansion is unfolding as lawmakers and regulators in Washington and Europe are sounding the alarm over the tech giants\u2019 concentration of power and how that may have hurt competitors and led to other issues, such as spreading disinformation. This week, European Union officials were preparing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">antitrust charges against Amazon</url> for using its e-commerce dominance to box out smaller rivals, while <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Britain began an inquiry</url> into Facebook\u2019s purchase of the GIF company.</p><p>Some of the tech behemoths have made little secret of their intention to forge ahead in a recession that has put <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">more than 44 million Americans out of work</url> and that officials warn <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">will be protracted</url>.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that in times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is keep investing in building the future,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in an investor call last month. \u201cWhen the world changes quickly, people have new needs, and that means there are more new things to build.\u201d</p><p>In doubling down on growth in a time of economic pain, the largest tech companies are continuing a pattern. In previous recessions, those that invested while the economy was at its most vulnerable often emerged stronger. In the 1990s, IBM used a recession to reorient itself from a hardware company into a software and services company. Google and Facebook both rose out of the dot-com bust about 20 years ago.</p><p>Apple, whose iPhones now dominate computing, doubled its research and development budget for two years during the downturn in the early 2000s. That led the company, which nearly went bankrupt in the late 1990s, to create its iPod music player and iTunes music store \u2014 and eventually the iPhone, the App Store and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">an unbridled growth streak</url>, said Jenny Chatman, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>Ranjan Roy, a tech commentator for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">The Margins</url>, an internet industry blog, said it was clear the tech behemoths were unafraid to get more aggressive now and that the power they were accruing should give people pause.</p><p>\u201cWithout any pushback from regulators, big tech companies would almost unquestionably come out of the pandemic more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many additional parts of our daily lives are becoming dependent on their products, or they could just buy or copy the services they don\u2019t yet deliver.\u201d</p><p>Still, the companies are taking risks by spending in an uncertain period, said John Paul Rollert, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</p><p>\u201cTo double and even triple down when the casino is on fire is a remarkable move, because they may not even be able to cash in their chips later on,\u201d he said. </p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, which declined to or did not respond to requests for comment, have plenty of cash. Combined, they are sitting atop about $557 billion, enabling them to maintain a pace of acquisitions and investments similar to last year\u2019s, when the economy was humming, according to a tally of financial disclosures. They have been among the top corporate spenders on research and development for most of the last decade, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">according</url> to PwC, the big accounting firm.</p><p>The companies have ramped up their activity since March, when shelter-in-place orders began. As Amazon, Facebook and others adapted to their employees working from home, they experienced a spike in use. Messaging and other <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">teleconferencing software soared</url> in popularity.</p><p>That created opportunities. Microsoft, for one, started promoting its Teams videoconferencing service, which allows people to talk and collaborate online. Microsoft also snapped up three cloud computing companies in the last few months \u2014 Affirmed Networks, Metaswitch Networks and Softomotive \u2014 to offer more technology to businesses.</p><p>Google, too, updated products that people can use to work from home. In April, it said that its video chat service, Google Meet, would be easily available inside people\u2019s Gmail windows and free to anyone with a Google account. It also said it would start making listings in its shopping search results mostly free, instead of having merchants pay for all their products to appear in the results, to bolster e-commerce searches.</p><p>Amazon was initially overwhelmed with a surge of online orders and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">safety concerns over its warehouse workers</url>. In response, the company added more <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">than 175,000 jobs</url> to keep up with demand.</p><p>Amazon has since invested further. While aviation all but ground to a halt in the pandemic, the company said this month that it was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">adding 12 Boeing 767s</url> to its fleet of more than 70 delivery planes. It also discussed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">buying Zoox</url>, an autonomous vehicle start-up <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">valued at $2.7 billion</url>, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. The discussions were earlier <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">reported</url> by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Apple, with $193 billion in cash and debt, went on its own buying spree. This year, it bought DarkSky, a popular weather smartphone app; NextVR, a virtual reality company; Voysis, a digital assistant and speech recognition software company; and<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Xnor.ai</url>, an artificial intelligence start-up.</p><p>The company will soon hold a developer conference virtually and is managing a surge in activity on FaceTime and iMessage as people use those services to communicate in quarantine.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s activity has been the most pronounced. When the coronavirus swept through the United States in March, the social network was inundated with people flocking to its apps to use voice and video chat services. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook was \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">just trying to keep the lights on</url>.\u201d</p><p>But the company soon capitalized on the momentum. Mr. Zuckerberg accelerated the building of some products, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">introducing Messenger Rooms,</url> a group video chat service, in April.</p><p>That same month, Facebook said it was taking a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">$5.7 billion stake in India\u2019s Reliance Jio</url>. It was the company\u2019s largest investment in an outside company, giving it more access to one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing digital markets.</p><p>\u201cWe are committed to connecting more people in India together with Jio,\u201d Facebook said of the deal, noting that Jio had brought more than 388 million people online in less than four years.</p><p>Last month,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Facebook bought the GIF company Giphy</url> for an estimated $400 million. Giphy is to be integrated with Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook. And last week, the social network invested millions in Gojek. Based in Jakarta, Indonesia, Gojek makes an app for digital payments, transportation and other services that is used by more than 170 million people in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Facebook is now working on the new venture fund, which will help it spot new popular apps. The fund was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">reported earlier</url> by Axios.</p><p>In driving the activity, Mr. Zuckerberg may be taking a cue from a Facebook board member, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. In April, Mr. Andreessen wrote a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">blog post</url> titled \u201cIt\u2019s Time To Build\u201d and said, \u201cWe need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors.\u201d</p><p>Less than two weeks later, Mr. Zuckerberg said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">on the investor call</url>that he was doing exactly that: building.</p><p>He said he felt \u201ca responsibility and duty to invest\u201d and added, \u201cWe\u2019re in a fortunate position to be able to do this.\u201d</p><p>Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from Oakland, Calif.; Karen Weise from Seattle; and Erin Griffith from San Francisco.</p><p>PHOTOS: Among recent investments by the technology giants are purchases of companies by Microsoft, top left, Apple, top right, and Facebook, above left.

Apple has $193 billion in cash and debt, not $192 billion in cash.\u00a0 </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CORRECTION APPENDED</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAN FRANCISCO - Even as Facebook grappled this month with an internal revolt and a cascade of criticism over its refusal to take action on President Trump's inflammatory posts, the social network was actively making other bets behind the scenes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Late one Tuesday, as attention was focused on how Facebook might handle Mr. Trump, the Silicon Valley company said in a brief blog post that it had invested in Gojek, a \"super app\" in Southeast Asia. The deal, which gave Facebook a bigger foothold in the rapidly growing region, followed a $5.7 billion investment it recently pumped into Reliance Jio, a telecom giant in India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The moves were part of a spending spree by the social network, which also shelled out $400 million last month to buy an animated GIF company and which is spending millions of dollars to build a nearly 23,000-mile undersea fiber-optic cable encircling Africa. On Thursday, Facebook confirmed that it was also developing a venture capital fund to invest in promising start-ups.</p><p>Other technology giants are engaging in similar behavior. Apple has bought at least four companies this year and released a new iPhone. Microsoft has purchased three cloud computing businesses. Amazon is in talks to acquire an autonomous vehicle start-up, has leased more airplanes for delivery and has hired an additional 175,000 people since March. Google has unveiled new messaging and video features.</p><p>Even with the global economy reeling from a pandemic-induced recession and dozens of businesses filing for bankruptcy, tech's largest companies - still wildly profitable and flush with billions of dollars from years of corporate dominance - are deliberately laying the groundwork for a future where they will be bigger and more powerful than ever.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are aggressively placing new bets as the coronavirus pandemic has made them near-essential services, with people turning to them to shop online, entertain themselves and stay in touch with loved ones. The skyrocketing use has given the companies new fuel to invest as other industries retrench.</p><p>The expansion is unfolding as lawmakers and regulators in Washington and Europe are sounding the alarm over the tech giants' concentration of power and how that may have hurt competitors and led to other issues, such as spreading disinformation. This week, European Union officials were preparing antitrust charges against Amazon for using its e-commerce dominance to box out smaller rivals, while Britain began an inquiry into Facebook's purchase of the GIF company.</p><p>Some of the tech behemoths have made little secret of their intention to forge ahead in a recession that has put more than 44 million Americans out of work and that officials warn will be protracted.</p><p>\"I've always believed that in times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is keep investing in building the future,\" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in an investor call last month. \"When the world changes quickly, people have new needs, and that means there are more new things to build.\"</p><p>In doubling down on growth in a time of economic pain, the largest tech companies are continuing a pattern. In previous recessions, those that invested while the economy was at its most vulnerable often emerged stronger. In the 1990s, IBM used a recession to reorient itself from a hardware company into a software and services company. Google and Facebook both rose out of the dot-com bust about 20 years ago.</p><p>Apple, whose iPhones now dominate computing, doubled its research and development budget for two years during the downturn in the early 2000s. That led the company, which nearly went bankrupt in the late 1990s, to create its iPod music player and iTunes music store - and eventually the iPhone, the App Store and an unbridled growth streak, said Jenny Chatman, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>Ranjan Roy, a tech commentator for The Margins, an internet industry blog, said it was clear the tech behemoths were unafraid to get more aggressive now and that the power they were accruing should give people pause.</p><p>\"Without any pushback from regulators, big tech companies would almost unquestionably come out of the pandemic more powerful,\" he said. \"So many additional parts of our daily lives are becoming dependent on their products, or they could just buy or copy the services they don't yet deliver.\"</p><p>Still, the companies are taking risks by spending in an uncertain period, said John Paul Rollert, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</p><p>\"To double and even triple down when the casino is on fire is a remarkable move, because they may not even be able to cash in their chips later on,\" he said. </p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, which declined to or did not respond to requests for comment, have plenty of cash. Combined, they are sitting atop about $557 billion, enabling them to maintain a pace of acquisitions and investments similar to last year's, when the economy was humming, according to a tally of financial disclosures. They have been among the top corporate spenders on research and development for most of the last decade, according to PwC, the big accounting firm.</p><p>The companies have ramped up their activity since March, when shelter-in-place orders began. As Amazon, Facebook and others adapted to their employees working from home, they experienced a spike in use. Messaging and other teleconferencing software soared in popularity.</p><p>That created opportunities. Microsoft, for one, started promoting its Teams videoconferencing service, which allows people to talk and collaborate online. Microsoft also snapped up three cloud computing companies in the last few months - Affirmed Networks, Metaswitch Networks and Softomotive - to offer more technology to businesses.</p><p>Google, too, updated products that people can use to work from home. In April, it said that its video chat service, Google Meet, would be easily available inside people's Gmail windows and free to anyone with a Google account. It also said it would start making listings in its shopping search results mostly free, instead of having merchants pay for all their products to appear in the results, to bolster e-commerce searches.</p><p>Amazon was initially overwhelmed with a surge of online orders and safety concerns over its warehouse workers. In response, the company added more than 175,000 jobs to keep up with demand.</p><p>Amazon has since invested further. While aviation all but ground to a halt in the pandemic, the company said this month that it was adding 12 Boeing 767s to its fleet of more than 70 delivery planes. It also discussed buying Zoox, an autonomous vehicle start-up valued at $2.7 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. The discussions were earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Apple, with $193 billion in cash and debt, went on its own buying spree. This year, it bought DarkSky, a popular weather smartphone app; NextVR, a virtual reality company; Voysis, a digital assistant and speech recognition software company; and Xnor.ai, an artificial intelligence start-up.</p><p>The company will soon hold a developer conference virtually and is managing a surge in activity on FaceTime and iMessage as people use those services to communicate in quarantine.</p><p>Facebook's activity has been the most pronounced. When the coronavirus swept through the United States in March, the social network was inundated with people flocking to its apps to use voice and video chat services. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook was \"just trying to keep the lights on.\"</p><p>But the company soon capitalized on the momentum. Mr. Zuckerberg accelerated the building of some products, introducing Messenger Rooms, a group video chat service, in April.</p><p>That same month, Facebook said it was taking a $5.7 billion stake in India's Reliance Jio. It was the company's largest investment in an outside company, giving it more access to one of the world's fastest-growing digital markets.</p><p>\"We are committed to connecting more people in India together with Jio,\" Facebook said of the deal, noting that Jio had brought more than 388 million people online in less than four years.</p><p>Last month, Facebook bought the GIF company Giphy for an estimated $400 million. Giphy is to be integrated with Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook. And last week, the social network invested millions in Gojek. Based in Jakarta, Indonesia, Gojek makes an app for digital payments, transportation and other services that is used by more than 170 million people in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Facebook is now working on the new venture fund, which will help it spot new popular apps. The fund was reported earlier by Axios.</p><p>In driving the activity, Mr. Zuckerberg may be taking a cue from a Facebook board member, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. In April, Mr. Andreessen wrote a blog post titled \"It's Time To Build\" and said, \"We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors.\"</p><p>Less than two weeks later, Mr. Zuckerberg said on the investor call that he was doing exactly that: building.</p><p>He said he felt \"a responsibility and duty to invest\" and added, \"We're in a fortunate position to be able to do this.\"</p><p>Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from Oakland, Calif.; Karen Weise from Seattle; and Erin Griffith from San Francisco.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007183247</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:604H-HGS1-DYR7-C184-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1638\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 15, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

And once upon a time, that seemed to be true; carbon emissions dipped and surged along with the economy for decades. Today, with innovations in recycling and enough clean energy to support and help offset the trucking, air travel, and manufacturing that accompany economic growth, we know that businesses can do right by both shareholders and the planet. In fact, as a recent report by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate tells us, aggressive climate action could deliver $26 trillion or more in economic benefits through 2030. As businesses embrace a greener economy, women are leading the way.</p><p>Globally, they now hold the majority of leadership roles in corporate responsibility and sustainability divisions. This can't be an accident; a growing wealth of research shows that businesses with more women in leadership roles more successfully shift focus from maximizing short-term profits to achieving longer-term goals of growth and environmental sustainability. And the bigger the company, the more this can matter. While we often associate sustainability with hipster startups hawking felt sneakers and other eco-friendly products, the most impactful changes are happening precisely where we don't often expect them-at massive global corporations.</p><p>Sarah Chandler, the senior director of operations and environmental issues at Apple, is one such corporate good citizen leading the charge. She knew she wanted to work for planet Earth as a high schooler in the early '90s. Growing up on a maple-syrup farm in western Massachusetts, she saw how the weather affected production. \"I definitely give my upbringing credit for my professional aspirations,\" she says.</p><p>Chandler, who holds an MBA from Stanford University, started at Apple as an intern. It was 2006, and Greenpeace gave Apple a rating of 2.7 out of 10 for sustainability, citing the company's use of toxic chemicals, poor recycling program, and lack of transparency. But over the past decade, under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook, Apple has righted its course, reducing carbon emissions by 64 percent-even while the company's energy use has tripled. Today, 100 percent of Apple's operations-from data centers to offices and retail stores-are powered solely by renewable energy. And here's where that ripple effect kicks in_ Chandler and her team have successfully lobbied 44 of Apple's suppliers to commit to using 100 percent renewable energy for their Apple load as well.</p><p>Still, there's much work to be done. Apple sent 36.5 million pounds of waste to landfills in 2018, not to mention the hazardous manufacturing waste landfills wouldn't take (which nearly doubled from 2017 to 2018). Given increasing demand, the company is searching for innovative ways to minimize this waste. One such project_ a pair of Apple robots (both named Daisy-one in Austin, the other in the Netherlands) that disassembled and recycled a million spent iPhones last year. This recycling, along with the refurbishment of nearly eight million devices in 2018, helped divert more than 150 million pounds of materials from landfills. \"You can probably hear the pride in my voice,\" says Chandler of the duo.</p><p>Like Apple's Chandler, Google's sustainability officer, Kate Brandt, tackled environmental issues early in her career. In 2014, she was named the United States' first federal chief sustainability officer. A year later, Brandt moved to Google. In D.C., she saw how much of an impact she could have in the private sector. Auspiciously, on her first day on the job in 2015, Google joined with President Obama and other businesses to launch the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, a commitment to support the larger Paris Climate Agreement's goals for a low-carbon future, which Brandt had worked on at the White House. Google has been carbon neutral in its operations- using as much renewable energy as possible and purchasing carbon offsets to counter the rest-since 2007. But those offsets don't technically negate the massive amount of energy needed to power an estimated 5.5 billion Google searches each day and over 500 hours of YouTube video uploads every minute. No wonder one of Brandt's most urgent initiatives at Google has been to drive a \"circular economy\" that eliminates waste and pollution through the use of renewable materials across the company's operations. \"Our whole economy since the industrial revolution has been built on this notion of taking something out of the ground, manufacturing it into a product, and eventually throwing it away,\" she says. That model won't serve the future, so Google now resells millions of used components, helping to save the company millions of dollars and keeping materials out of landfills.</p><p>Brandt's strategy is not just to build sustainability into the company's internal practices and products but also to enable the public to make sustainable-living choices with tools like Google Maps and Project Sunroof. \"There's a huge sense of urgency. Science tells us we have 10 more years to turn this all around,\" says Brandt, citing a 2018 United Nations report on climate change. That urgency grows more acute with every environmental protection the Trump administration rescinds-from drilling and emissions regulations to energy-efficiency standards.</p><p>Google and Apple took a stand in 2017, soon after President Trump signaled his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. Along with leaders from nearly 4,000 public and private entities, they signed the \"We Are Still In\" Declaration, vowing a global effort to hold warming to under 2 degrees Celsius, with or without federal support.</p><p>Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, also signed on. Last fall, possibly under pressure from nearly 2,000 workers united as Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, he committed to a plan to meet the Paris agreement goals-10 years ahead of schedule. And in February, Bezos announced he would be dedicating $10 billion of his personal wealth to addressing the climate crisis. A key player in the development and execution of the Climate Pledge, which commits the company to reaching net-zero carbon through innovations and investments by 2040, was Kara Hurst, Amazon's head of worldwide sustainability.</p><p>\"I completely geek out on solving this challenge,\" says Hurst, a former CEO of the Sustainability Consortium. \"In small organizations, you don't have dissimilar problems, but the scale of the impact of your decisions may be much less.\" Hurst is helping Amazon-a company widely criticized for adding congestion and heat-trapping gases to our roads and skies and filling landfills with shipping materials-to solve challenges including how to choose the best ways to save energy and resources. With little time to waste to meet such ambitious goals, Hurst's team has pushed such initiatives as the purchase of 100,000 electric delivery vans. The company also launched a lightweight recyclable padded mailer, helping eliminate the equivalent of more than 100 billion shipping boxes.</p><p>Hurst's goal is not only to help Amazon become greener but also to share the tenets of its success with its many thousands of vendors. \"If Amazon can't mechanize a strategy for others along the line to replicate,\" says Hurst, \"it stops with us. And that's not a success.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MARCLA-MCX040120Wk_Profiles_lo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MARCLA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT4-TXY1-JCVJ-70BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312787</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1247\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hearst Communications Inc.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, has said that the edge needs both government oversight and market discipline over issues of aggregating and monetizing data without accountability, issues Washington needs to wrestle with \"right now.\"</p><p>While Warren initially left some room for companies to be big without being bad - her suggestion that edge platforms can't buy up other companies in other parts of the internet ecosystem without raising some flags - she has since said the biggest firms need to be broken up.</p><p>Warren said Amazon is both providing the marketplace for products and scraping information about those buying patterns. Amazon then uses that \"special information advantage\" to sell its own products in competition with others in the marketplace it provides, she has argued, effectively \"wiping out\" competitors' businesses.</p><p>That practice, per Warren, is \"a serious problem\" and one that should require Amazon to make a choice.</p><p>\"You've got to pick one business or the other,\" either platform provider or product competitor, she said. \"If you are getting a huge comparative advantage from the information you can collect as the platform provider, we no longer have competition going on.\"</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"p221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is making the case for breaking up \"big tech\" amidst her run for president.</p><p>FAANG data collection and sharing; privacy protection, or the lack of it; allegations of censoring conservative content; and the use of social media for anti-social behavior like sex and drug trafficking, terrorism and election meddling have combined to put edge providers in the sights of legislators on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Responses could include rethinking the legal liability carveout that social media sites currently enjoy for content posted by third parties.</p><p>The desire to cut Amazon down to size makes strange bedfellows of Warren and the man whose job she's seeking, President Donald Trump, who has also taken aim at the edge giant, as he did again last week, echoing the charges of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim also has his eye on the edge. But he has used public forums to do a little pushing back on the notion that monopolies - even big virtual monopolies - are necessarily bad. He's also focused on how they use their power.</p><p>Keynoting at the annual Silicon Flatirons tech policy conference at the University of Colorado Law School, Delrahim spent some time pointing out that web users have been found to prefer giving up their data for targeted advertising to paying for internet content and services.</p><p>\"For now, consumers seem to be willing to provide information about themselves so that they receive the product for free, even recognizing that their information will be sold to advertisers in exchange for a zero price,\" he said. \"Some consumers even may prefer receiving targeted advertisements that are more likely to be relevant to their needs.\" Those arguments are ones Silicon Valley keeps making as well.</p><p>\"The fact that successful companies can reap the benefits of their hard work encourages the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs and inserts the dynamic competition that best benefits consumers,\" Delrahim said. \"Therefore, as the Supreme Court explained [in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Verizon vs. Trinko</emphasis>], '[t]o safeguard the incentive to innovate, the possession of monopoly power will not be found unlawful unless it is accompanied by an element of anticompetitive conduct.' \"</p><p>The shakeup-but-not-breakup philosophy appears to be the approach of choice for the public at large, at least according to a new poll released by CNN.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big Tech Breakup Not Needed: Survey</emphasis></p><p>Asked if Google, Facebook and the like should be broken up, only 11% of survey respondents said yes. Among the subset of those who thought the edge needed more regulating (42% of those surveyed), 64% said that regulation should stop short of breaking up the companies.</p><p>One potential target of increased regulation could be the Section 202 carveout from liability over social-media posts by third parties. The carveout was adopted to keep the net a neutral platform and allow social media to flourish. But Silicon Valley has come under fire from Republicans for what they see as attempts to label conservative speech as inappropriate content - either as hate speech or comments that make their online communities uncomfortable.</p><p>No less an expert than Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg added fuel to the fire by saying in a Hill hearing that concerns about a liberal bias in Silicon Valley were legitimate, though he hastened to add his company had no policy of suppressing conservative voices.</p><p>Add some liberal Democrats to those calling for rethinking the liability exception, and edge providers could find themselves facing the kind of regulatory pressure that has been reserved for ISPs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCHNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCHNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPW-G341-DY5H-12J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241792</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Multichannel News</publicationName><volume>Vol. XL</volume><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 25, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Regulate, break up, above all proffer more power to the bureaucracy than to those private market actors.

For, sure, we can observe large companies out there and assume we've greater market concentration. But does that hold at that household level? One cute possibility is to look at the UK supermarket industry. Over the years we've had several investigations into whether the big supermarkets had carved up the country between them. There was certainly some evidence of oligopoly - British supermarket margins were globally regarded as immense at some 6 and 7%. From one of those reports[1]: In rural areas, 71 per cent of the population has access to at least one grocery store larger than 1,400 sq metres within a 15-minute drive-time (see Figure 3.10), and 13 per cent of the population has a choice of at least four stores of different fascia larger than 1,400 sq metres within a 15-minute drive-time. This indicates that a large proportion of the urban and rural population in the UK is able to choose between at least two larger grocery stores within a reasonable drivetime. Nevertheless, these national-level figures will mask substantial regional variations. In Section 6, we assess the extent to which local markets for grocery retailing are highly concentrated. We also take the extent of store choice into account when assessing the overall effectiveness of competition in grocery retailing in Section 10. That report is from 2008. Something a little more recent, 2016[2]: With the introduction of online grocery shopping, home delivery and click and collect in the nineties, the market was initially made up of the four major players on the British grocery scene: Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Tesco. Since then, online grocery sales have skyrocketed, with the United Kingdom forecasted to become the second largest online grocery market worldwide after China by 2020. With the introduction of new players, such as purely online retailers Ocado and AmazonFresh, the online grocery market share has changed with Tesco, Asda and Ocado the leading online grocery retailers in terms of edible grocery sales. Quite how many full service supermarkets are now available will be variable. One of those doing those deliveries might well be the same organisation which owns the locally accessible bricks and mortar store. But a reasonable rule of thumb would be that every household in the country, down to and including the most isolated rural hamlet, now has at least four supermarkets literally on the doorstep via those delivery vans. Four being an important number as it was the number the Competition Commission used to indicate that obviously, clearly, there's no competition problem here if that many choices exist. We can also look at other indicators - anyone pondering supermarket share prices will know that retail margins have collapsed in the past couple of decades. Again, sure, Amazon's a big company. But it's not obvious that it has led to increased concentration, less competition, in the retail market now, is it? So, our justification in trying to regulate it is what? Other than just that taste to find a justification for more regulation and plum jobs as regulators? As to the larger picture, just another proof of the contention that every monopoly or oligopoly eventually - eventually being a variable amount of time - will be destroyed by advancing and changing technology. It'll happen to all those we currently worry about, as it has happened to all those we used to.

It is quite a broad term, and as such, FinTech firms often have very little in common with one another. Although most people associate FinTech with crypto-currency, the reality is that it is much more than that. In fact, FinTech encompasses a diverse range of platforms, applications and service offerings for both individuals and corporates, including:</p><p>Lending, Peer to Peer (e.g. Beehive and Liwwa) and Crowdfunding Platforms that allow individuals and businesses to lend to and borrow funds from a variety of sources through an online platform (like Eureeca);<br/>RegTech: regulatory compliance software (including for facilitating 'Know Your Client' procedures, Anti-Money Laundering and fraud screening and detection, and real time monitoring of compliance with regulatory requirements). Prominent examples include Hummingbird and Azakaw;<br/>Payment Processing (e.g. Pay Tabs, Stripe, Fiserv and Paypal) and Subscription Billing Software (think Netflix and Uber);<br/>Budgeting Tools and Apps to manage personal finances (such as Mint \u2013 a free budgeting app that syncs users' bank accounts, credit cards and other accounts to help track incoming and outgoing money);<br/>Mobile Wallets (e.g. Careem Wallet) and Mobile Payment Apps (e.g. Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Alipay) which allow users to pay on websites, in apps, and in stores using the cards saved to their account (by simply tapping the back of a smartphone to the payment terminal screen);<br/>International Money Transfer and Tracking Software (e.g. CurrencyFair);<br/>WealthTech: Wealth Management and Investment Platforms and Tools, including Robo-Advisors (e.g. Sarwa, and Vanguard personal advisor services);<br/>Open Banking APIs used as a secure communication method between banks and authorised third party providers (e.g. TrueLayer);<br/>InsurTech: data analytics and software for re-insurers and companies selling insurance digitally (e.g. Bayzat, Democrance and BIMA \u2013 the latter, a Swedish company that promotes financial inclusion by offering insurance and mobile health services for low-income families, the vast majority of whom are accessing insurance for the first time and who live on less than US$10 per day);<br/>Stock-trading Apps (like Robinhood) which are relatively inexpensive and require low minimum investment amounts;<br/>Capital Markets analysis and infrastructure tools (e.g. Credit Benchmark) for financial institutions;<br/>Mortgage financing and digitisation platforms (such as Zoopla which reduces the mortgage application process from months to days, and the Dubai Land Department's proposed platform for conducting end-to-end real estate transactions online); and<br/>Blockchain technologies for financial services (e.g. HSBC MENA's Voltron which digitises the Letter of Credit process).</p><p>Unicorn, Sandbox, Chatbots.. What the!?</p><p>The technology industry (and FinTech is no exception) loves jargon. Here are some commonly used terms in this space (in order of appearance in this article):</p><p>Application Program Interface or APIs: allow one computer program to be used by another. Essentially, they are used as a secure method of communication between online banking systems and those of third parties.<br/>Neobanks / Challenger banks: fully digital banks with no branches (such as Monzo and Revolut) that operate through online banking or mobile Apps. Primarily, there are three types of neobanks: those that offer financial services under the licenses of traditional banks; those that have alternative licensing for offering bank accounts that have some limitations; and those that are a subsidiary of a traditional bank which aims to offer new products etc. but operates under its parent bank's licence.<br/>Unicorn: a privately held Start-up company with a value of over US$1 billion.<br/>Sandbox: a time bound regulatory process that provides FinTech firms and traditional banks the ability to develop and test their new product and service offerings in a controlled environment without having to comply with the regulatory requirements that would otherwise apply to it. The aim is to encourage innovation whilst providing regulators with an opportunity to understand potential implications of the solution to consumer protection and financial system stability, so that they can adapt the current regulatory framework to accommodate such innovative and disruptive solutions.<br/>Machine Learning: refers to computer systems that have been empowered by humans with the ability to 'learn' by themselves by using the provided data and to make accurate predictions and decisions. Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.<br/>Artificial Intelligence or AI: is an umbrella term that describes machines that incorporate some level of human intelligence / cognitive ability.<br/>Chatbots: software (such as Siri) that conducts a conversation with customers via audio or text, providing automated customer support.<br/>Robo-Advisors: are automated virtual financial assistants which use mathematical rules or algorithms to provide digital financial advice, make asset recommendations, and manage and optimise portfolios without any human intervention.</p><p>What's the Big Deal?</p><p>FinTech has, and continues to disrupt the financial services industry by providing better, cheaper, and more personalised offerings to individuals and businesses (including banks) often by utilising the internet, mobile applications, cloud services, software and other technology. Add to this the proliferation of user-friendly interfaces and frictionless customer experience (for example, being able to buy stocks or transfer money at the click of a button) \u2013 and it is no wonder that customers are increasingly transacting digitally and moving away from cash and visiting branches.</p><p>In Australia for example, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority's data shows nearly 300 branches closed around the country in the year to June 2019, up from the 201 branches closed in the previous financial year. Banks in the Middle East have been equally affected by this seismic shift in peoples' preferences when it comes to financial services, and they have responded by investing heavily in digital transformation. EmiratesNBD has been leading the charge, with an AED 1 billion digital transformation initiative aimed at improving its technology infrastructure so as to continuously improve its digital banking offerings and customer experience.</p><p>The impact of FinTech is evident with banks looking to appoint Chief Digital Officers who report directly to the Board. And their role is not just about automation; it is about transforming the whole bank (and not just automation) \u2013 this means streamlining existing operations, rethinking client journeys, creating new opportunities by building digital products and services, and most importantly reshaping the internal culture to one that is agile and focused on putting the customer at the centre of every single process.</p><p>FinTechs were initially considered a major threat to traditional brick-and-mortar banks and other financial services firms, with the expectation that banks would look to acquire lots of FinTech firms. In reality, this has not eventuated largely because of issues around incompatibility with the legacy technology infrastructure of banks, differences between the Start-up culture of FinTech s (driven by small autonomous teams tasked with delivering customer value) and the more conservative environment prevalent at banks, and competition law restrictions. Instead, the much touted rivalry has given way to a more collaborative approach with banks looking to work with different FinTech firms (including neobanks) and other technology vendors to accelerate the innovation process and co-create solutions that are customised to the needs of banks and which serve to fill a gap in servicing their existing and prospective customers.</p><p>The FinTech sector has experienced phenomenal growth in the last five years or so, with t FinTech deals having soared to approximately 1,700 deals (and a combined value of US$39 billion) in 2018. The number of FinTech unicorns globally grew from 25 (with a total value of approximately US$75 billion) in 2018 to 39 unicorns in 2019 (worth close to US$150 billion).</p><p>Although the MENA region accounts for a small proportion of venture capital investments in FinTech globally, the FinTech sector in the region is said to be growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 30 per cent. Also, on the consumer side, the region is an attractive market for FinTech firms, boasting a population of roughly 450 million people (half of which is below the age of 25 \u2013 presenting a strong base of early technology adopters). The challenge for foreign FinTech firms expanding in to the region will be maintaining their global brand whilst modifying their offerings to be relevant to the local market.</p><p>What are the Trends and Predictions?  Everyone, particularly the big tech companies (Apple, Google and Facebook) want to be a bank in a bid to increase revenue (essentially by offering financial services to their existing customer bases), however there are some competition law hurdles they will need to overcome, particularly if they wish to do it without partnering with a licensed financial services provider.<br/>Banking-as-a-service ('BaaS'): this is an extension of the 'as-a-Service' model that is prevalent in the technology industry and presents banks that have embraced digital to monetise their regulated infrastructure by granting access to FinTech firms that will pay fees to access a bank's BaaS platform via APIs. This in turn, enables FinTech firms to use the APIs to build new financial services solutions.<br/>Bundling of offerings and the dominance of 'super Apps' as consumers will find it difficult to (ironically) stay on top of multiple Apps, each with a different offering. Grab, WeChat and Go-jek in Asia have taken advantage of their strong customer bases and existing platforms to expand into new segments and provide consumers with a less fragmented experience that allows you to take a car ride, book hotels, order food delivery, get documents and parcels delivered, transfer funds, and make in-store and online purchases. Careem locally is moving to leverage its existing ride-hailing infrastructure to become the Super App of the region.</p><p>What are some of the Relevant Legal Issues? Regulatory Frameworks</p><p>By default, all entities will be subject to the existing legal framework in each jurisdiction. However, a number of jurisdictions in the region have established regulatory sandboxes, including the Dubai Financial Services Authority ('DFSA'), the Abu Dhabi Global Markets ('ADGM'), Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Although mainland UAE does not have a sandbox, the UAE Central Bank recently announced that it will be setting up a dedicated FinTech office to develop countrywide regulations in order to enable and facilitate FinTech activities in the country.</p><p>While each sandbox has its own rules, generally, to be admitted into a sandbox, an applicant needs to demonstrate that its solution is genuinely innovative (i.e. that its offering is significantly different from those that already exist, that it offers a new use for existing technologies or represents a significant scale-up in existing technologies), offers consumer benefit, is ready for testing and that it has a plan to exit the sandbox and deploy its solution in the market.<br/>Please see the related article entitled 'FinTech Space in the United Arab Emirates' from our banking team on the regulatory framework (including sandboxes and testing licenses) for crypto-assets in the UAE.</p><p>Right to object to 'Automated Data Processing'</p><p>Often, FinTech solutions adopt AI (including machine learning) technologies, mathematical rules or algorithms to automate certain tasks and make decisions. Such cases include Chatbots, Robo-Advisors, fraud detection and claims management software and predictive analysis in financial services.</p><p>Under some regional data protection laws (for example the Bahrain Data Protection Law), an individual may object to decisions that are made solely on automated processing of personal data intended to assess him / her (for example in the context of a loan application). Please see Andrew Fawcett's and Krishna Jhala's article titled 'Borrowers in Bahrain may be able to Object to Automated Loan Processing Decisions'.</p><p>Ethical use of AI</p><p>Guidelines have been developed around the world to provide a framework for the ethical use of AI. Regulators globally have in general sought to avoid enacting laws so as to avoid stifling innovation. Given the infancy of AI technologies, it is believed that a soft regulatory approach will help the industry flourish whilst enabling regulators to better understand the associated risks. The focus is more on working with business to develop an agile approach to regulation that is industry specific.</p><p>In large part, the various guidelines are focused on ensuring that AI is explainable, non-discriminatory, unbiased, fair, transparent and accountable. In the context of the automated loan processing example above, AI developers would need to be able to explain the algorithms they use so that 'black box' systems do not make arbitrary decisions that have a significant impact on a person's life. Also, they would need to be able to demonstrate that the data sets being fed into their AI systems are unbiased. Consider if the data set is taken from a loan officer who routinely rejected loan applications because of their race, religion, gender or some other factor that is not relevant to assessing their ability to repay a loan. If that data set were to be given to the AI system as a basis for assessing future loan applications, then that human bias and discrimination would be ingrained into AI systems, and similar applicants would have their loan applications rejected because of irrelevant factors, thereby resulting in algorithmic bias and perpetual discrimination.</p><p>Early this year, Smart Dubai launched its own guidelines on the ethical use of AI together with a toolkit that allows developers to assess their AI systems' level of compliance with Smart Dubai's guidelines. Although the guidelines are not legally binding, breach of certain principles could nevertheless amount to a breach of relevant national laws such as the UAE's Federal Law Combating Discrimination and Hatred.</p><p>Data Protection</p><p>Compliance with a raft of data protection regimes is a key concern for FinTech offerings as the underlying systems and applications contain vast amounts of data, including personal data. In the region, there are myriad of data protection laws that apply in various free zones (such as the DIFC and ADGM), as well as in Bahrain, Qatar and other jurisdictions with new laws expected to be enacted in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>From a data protection perspective, Banks, FinTech firms and other technology vendors will need to ensure they have, in place, appropriate documentation (for example privacy policies and data protection / transfer agreements for sharing data with one another as well as other data controllers and processors, both domestically and across borders) in addition to technical and operational measures so as to comply with regional data protection laws. A data breach incident can result in civil (and even criminal penalties), and in cases where the personal data relates to persons in more than one jurisdiction, it may result in fines being imposed by multiple regulators. We will discuss this issue in greater detail in a publication to be published in the next couple of months.</p><p>Cloud and Cybersecurity</p><p>The risk of data breach increases as banks and FinTech firms collaborate and novel business models such as BaaS become more common. Well known FinTech platforms could be an easy target for cyberattacks, and in addition to the measures noted above, FinTech firms and banks ought to ensure they have adequate cybersecurity and cyber insurance in place to meet regulatory requirements. Please see Zil Ur Rehman's articles in relation to proposed cybersecurity standards for Information Communication Technology ('ICT') service providers in Saudi Arabia that are likely to be relevant to telecommunications service providers who are looking to offer mobile or 'internet of things' wallets in conjunction with banks.</p><p>Open Banking</p><p>Open Banking started out as a regulatory initiative in the EU as part of a concerted effort to increase competition and innovation in the banking sector, which is now gaining momentum globally. In certain countries, such as Bahrain, banks are required to share customers' financial information with authorised third parties, resulting in numerous benefits, namely: (1) third parties can access consenting bank customers' financial information in order provide alternative or new offerings to such customers; (2) banks are able to deliver a better experience to its customers by enriching their offerings; and (3) customers can access their data in real time and share their information with other parties (for example, to get a better deal elsewhere or simply to get an amalgamated view of all their finances across various banks and FinTech firms within the one portal or App). It is yet to be seen, if and when, other countries in the region will follow suit. It is envisaged that Open Banking will lead to 'open finance' and ultimately 'open utilities' as the model can be replicated in other industries such as utilities and real estate. For example, the use of aggregated data and APIs will enable changes in a person's financial life to be identified (e.g. an annual increase in their rental payments) and personalised services to be solicited from comparison sites.</p><p>Technology Contracting Risks</p><p>Collaboration and outsourcing with FinTech firms and other technology vendors can unwittingly introduce new points of compliance failure for banks, particularly in an environment where the technology supply chain and ecosystem is becoming ever more interconnected and complex. The proliferation of numerous FinTech solutions, third party software, and cloud services etc. requiring configuration, integration and/or implementation with legacy technology infrastructure will require special contracting focus in order to ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate risk.</p><p>For further information, please contact Haroun Khwaja (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:h.khwaja@tamimi.com\">h.khwaja@tamimi.com</email> ).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/415/1352/14/158141960360.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/415/1352/14/158141960360.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/415/1352/73/158141960580.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/415/1352/73/158141960580.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/415/1352/35/158141960801.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/415/1352/35/158141960801.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAWUPD-166924991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAWUPD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y62-53S1-F11P-X0P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435466</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3133\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CPI Financial.

In the bill, the interplay between these distinct pieces of context explains why there is work to be done to improve this bill in its journey to becoming a law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The author thanks Graham Greenleaf for his helpful comments on this article.</p><p>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 is a creature of its environment. The substance of this draft law and the urgency with which it has been drafted are both more fully understood within this context. Less than a year after the government appointed the Justice B N Srikrishna Committee to draft the law, the bill has already been made public for comments, and its journey to Parliament seems imminent. Previous attempts have lacked this momentum, and even their outcomes seem to be fading from official memory (in 2012, the Justice A P Shah Committee suggested nine principles to codify the right to privacy).<br/><br/>In this article, I trace three distinct developments that are reflected in the substantive provisions of this bill, and the process that led to it.<br/><br/>First, the legal and political challenges to the government's Aadhaar project, which include the Supreme Court's articulation of the right to privacy in K S Puttaswamy v Union of India (2017), that was borne out of the Aadhaar litigation. Second, the overhaul of the European data protection regime that took place in favour of a stronger law with global ramifications, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). And, finally, the Indian version of the global \"tech-lash,\" shorthand for the growing suspicion and indignation against the dominance of some of the largest United States (US)-based tech companies at the expense of the domestic industry.<br/><br/>In the bill, the interplay between these distinct pieces of context in complementary and sometimes contradictory ways explains why an appraisal of the bill does not lend itself to absolute conclusions, and why there is work to be done to improve this bill in its journey to becoming a law.<br/><br/>Aadhaar and Use of Data<br/><br/>The government's national biometric ID project, Aadhaar, has forced an overdue conversation around the dangers of a purely technocratic vision of governance, and the muddled public and private incentives that drive it. Multiple legal challenges against the project have been heard by the apex court and are pending imminent verdict. It is Aadhaar's implications for individual privacy and state surveillance, however, that have already resulted in many steps forward for privacy protection in India, including the progress on the data protection bill.<br/><br/>In the course of legal arguments against the project, the government argued there was no constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy. This contradicted 40 years of jurisprudence from the Supreme Court that had proceeded on the basis that such a right exists. The government's lawyers pointed to a technical infirmity in the jurisprudence, and the Court acknowledged the error and constituted a nine-judge bench to resolve this question conclusively. Eventually, K S Puttaswamy v Union of India (2017) led to a verdict that not only reaffirmed the fundamental right to privacy as a core constitutional value, but went beyond that to establish a more expansive and progressive articulation of the right. The judges put forth clear limits on state intervention with the right to privacy, but they also asserted a positive obligation on the government to protect individuals from threats to privacy by both state and private actors. There was now a clear constitutional mandate, as well as a political imperative, for Parliament to pass law to safeguard individual privacy. In its wake, the lack of meaningful legal protections for data was left more glaring.<br/><br/>The more immediate trigger for the bill, however, was the government's commitment in 2017, in open court, that a law to protect personal data was forthcoming (Mahapatra 2017). The Aadhaar project already had to answer for much belat-ed parliamentary oversight. The project, which began enrolment in 2009, saw a law passed to govern it only in 2016 and, even then, controversially, as a money bill with a truncated parliamentary process (Sinha 2016; Greenleaf 2016). Proceeding with the largest data collection exercise in Indian history, in the absence of a data protection law, was an additional indictment. The government moved swiftly to constitute a committee, chaired by Justice B N Srikrishna, tasked with producing both a report and a draft data protection bill. The composition of the committee was also controversial. While it included the chairperson of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), it conspicuously lacked any critical voices from civil society (Mandhani 2017).<br/><br/>The bill's impact on Aadhaar cannot be read from any one particular provision, nor is the project explicitly mentioned. However, as a major data processing exercise undertaken by the government involving sensitive data, like biometrics, Aadhaar is subject to the law in multiple ways. To start with, the main obligations in the bill are enforceable against all data fiduciaries. \"Data fiduciaries\" is an expansive term to include private and government actors that \"process\" (a broad term covering collection, use, sharing and storage) personal data. As a result, the regulatory authority created by this bill has jurisdiction over the UIDAI and other government data fiduciaries on which it can levy penalties and even order compensation to be paid if the obligations are violated. These obligations, detailed in Chapter II of the bill, include processing only such personal data that is \"necessary\" to fulfil a clear and specific purpose (collection limitation), not using this data beyond these limited purposes (purpose limitation), and storing it only as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose (storage limitation). Could mandating Aadhaar for, say, marriage registration or HIV medication fall foul of the collection limitation as being unnecessary? Or, would it be relatively easy for both government and private users of Aadhaar to assert that, as a tool for unique verification, Aadhaar authentication is necessary because the particular entity deems it so?<br/><br/>The bill also requires that each act of data processing must be justified under at least one of a finite list of \"grounds of processing.\" While obtaining the user's consent is the primary legal ground on which companies can process data, the government is given significantly broader leeway. The bill creates separate grounds for processing data for \"functions of the state\" under which all data processing \"necessary\" for service or benefit delivery may be justified. As the Aadhaar project has demonstrated, the state has unique influence over setting the terms of what data inputs it deems \"necessary\" to govern. While the scope of necessity should be tested under the constitutional limits set by K S Puttaswamy v Union of India, it is unclear how far the data protection regulator will be able, or willing, to challenge the state's logic. Many of these very questions are before the Supreme Court in the Aadhaar litigation, and this decision of the Court will interpret whether the scope of the project exceeds constitutional limits.<br/><br/>A related question is whether the bill will allow individuals to opt out of having their data in the Aadhaar database. This is currently not an option for Aadhaar number holders and is also practically constrained by its requirement in a number of essential services. For consent to be valid under this bill, the corresponding opportunity to withdraw consent is required. However, as described above, as a government entity, it is unclear if the UIDAI will be held to the standard of consent. Instead, it could legitimise its activities as part of the separate ground for \"functions of the state.\" If consent was never taken, it might be argued that it cannot be withdrawn. The European law, GDPR, does create a legal remedy for such situations where consent is not the grounds for processing. The \"Right to Object\" provides individuals who may have legitimate objections to data that is being processed without their consent, an opportunity to prevent the further processing of their data.<br/><br/>The Justice Srikrishna Committee argued in its draft report that such a right would be \"unsuitable to Indian context\" with little explanation as to why. In its final report, the committee argued that other rights in the bill which allow individuals to correct inaccurate or misleading data already cover this ground (MeitY 2018). Despite these weak justifications, the absence of the right to object sticks out like a sore thumb, particularly given the looming uncertainty around the voluntariness of Aadhaar enrolment and its use in the future. Here, too, the Supreme Court's imminent decision is likely to provide a more conclusive answer.<br/><br/>Finally, the UIDAI would also certainly classify as a \"significant data fiduciary\" under this bill, categorised as such based on the volume and sensitivity of data processed. This would make the UIDAI subject to stricter requirements, including an independent audit of data practices. This could be one way to increase transparency in the notoriously opaque security practices around Aadhaar data.<br/><br/>GDPR: A 'Global' Standard<br/><br/>The final report makes the claim that its bill reflects a \"fourth way\" for data protection-distinct from Europe, the US and China-having relevance across countries in the global South. At best, this is an exaggeration of its distinctiveness from European law. It is substantially similar, although not identical, to the GDPR, both in structure and substance. The obligations in Chapter II of the bill borrow heavily from the European framework and are enforceable against public and private sector data fiduciaries. Limits on collection, use, and storage of data, meaningful notice, transparency, and, critically, the requirement to be able to \"demonstrate accountability\" to these obligations are all welcome imports from the GDPR. The fact that each act of data processing must be demonstrably \"lawful\" under one of the finite grounds of processing is also a uniquely European mark on the bill. Its identification of certain categories of data as sensitive and having stricter requirements is another. Finally, enforcement mechanisms like audits, appointment of data protection officers, and the ability to impose heavy fines (up to 4% of global annual turnover) replicate some of the tools in the European regulators' toolbox. These overlaps are not by coincidence. Indeed, there are multiple incentives at play for why this bill is modelled on the GDPR by design.<br/><br/>The European Union has been the global pioneer in establishing a comprehensive legal regime to govern data privacy across its member countries. The GDPR is the most recent iteration in four decades of European data protection laws, but it has been noteworthy for its global impact. On and around 25 May 2018, many Indian residents received email alerts from online services notifying them of changes to their privacy policies, informing them that their personal data would be deleted shortly, or even giving them options to opt out of certain kinds of data use. As companies began to update their data privacy practices and user settings to comply with the GDPR, it was not pragmatic to restrict these changes only to their European users and several companies chose to implement the law worldwide (Kak 2018). Large global companies also increasingly require international suppliers to be compliant with the GDPR, creating further incentives for businesses everywhere (Greenleaf 2018a).<br/><br/>There are other tangible ways in which the GDPR is influencing the legal standard for data protection globally. While the law came into force only in 2018, its provisions were made public in 2012 and have heavily influenced ongoing legislative efforts in other countries, notably Brazil and Algeria (Greenleaf 2012). This is partly due to the fact that the GDPR is a product of decades of evolution and has been deliberately updated to the needs of the digital age, and so governments have found it to be a safe source of inspiration. More fundamentally, however, the GDPR itself demands some amount of compatibility with the standards it espouses, by making the international flow of data outside Europe contingent on whether the country has \"adequate\" data protection norms (termed the requirement of \"adequacy\"), or provides alternative protections of equal strength. Europe and Japan may be in the concluding stages of regarding each other's data protection frameworks as adequate, which would provide a precedent for how such decisions on adequacy will be made in practice (Greenleaf 2018b). The bill's considerable compatibility with the GDPR, therefore, makes it possible that Europe will recognise India's legal framework as adequate, if it applies for assessment. At any rate, it gives the Indian government an arguable case to make, particularly if it is willing to make further amendments.<br/><br/>There are, however, notable departures from the GDPR in this bill. Some provisions are more prescriptive and, arguably, stricter than the GDPR is on companies. The GDPR creates separate legal grounds for processing data for \"legitimate interests\" of the business, but the parallel in the Indian bill is distinct and, I argue, corrects some of the flaws in its European counterpart. The grounds of legitimate interest were intended to capture specific cases where consent would be inappropriate for the user or overly burdensome for the data fiduciary (Article 29 Working Party 2014). While the GDPR does require that the interests of the business must be balanced against the rights of the user, this analysis is left to be self-evaluated by the data fiduciary. As such, there is ripe potential for abuse as a way to evade obtaining user consent, with little in the way of checks and balances. Take the case of a company claiming a \"legitimate interest\" to learn as much as possible about its potential customers so that it can better target advertisement about its products, without their consent. The European advisory body on data protection, the Article 29 Working Party, took this example to demonstrate that these grounds should not be interpreted to cover situations where controllers could \"combine vast amounts of data to create  complex profiles of the customer preferences without their knowledge\" (Article 29 Working Party 2014).<br/><br/>The Justice Srikrishna Committee appears to take lessons from this ambiguity, with the parallel \"reasonable purposes\" grounds in the bill limiting the scope for abuse. Unlike its GDPR counterpart, it requires the data protection regulator to specifically notify as to what will qualify as reasonable purposes, and lists a series of factors it must consider while making this decision. It also puts forth an illustrative list of reasonable purposes, including prevention of fraud, network security, whistle-blowing, and, more controversially, processing \"publicly available\" personal data.<br/><br/>Deficiencies in the Bill<br/><br/>Other aspects of the bill are decidedly weak in comparison, and dim the prospect of Europe recognising this law as adequate. Take the provision that covers when and how data fiduciaries should report when personal data is breached, say, if there is a malicious attack or an accidental disclosure or destruction of data. Unlike the GDPR, the bill does not require even high-risk breaches to be communicated to the affected users. Instead, in situations where the data fiduciaries have self-assessed that there has been harm to users, they are required to inform only the regulator, and not the user. The regulator has the discretion to decide-based on no objective criteria-whether or not to notify users. Mandating notifications for breach is a key feature of data protection regimes (US NCSL 2018; ENISA 2012) as a response to the general reticence of companies to notify their users of security breaches, which in turn creates distrust and can expose the vulnerable users to continuing harm. The provision in the bill leaves too much to the discretion of the regulator about when, how and whether a breach should be communicated to those affected.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the most glaring deficiency in the bill-and one that could jeopardise its approval by European officials-is the lack of independence of the regulatory authority from the government. Maintaining a high degree of independence from the government is crucial in ensuring fairness in enforcement. It is curious that while the bill includes many general safeguards for the independence of the executive wing of the regulator-including stipulated terms of appointment, composition of the committee for appointment of members, selection criteria, fixed tenure, etc-the adjudicatory wing has no such safeguards. Instead, appointment and tenure of the adjudication officers is left entirely to the central government's discretion. This makes little sense given that it is the adjudication officers alone who will decide penalties (including criminal penalties) and compensation. Moreover, Section 98 of the bill gives the government wide discretion to issue binding directions to the regulator on all \"matters of policy.\" Even the decision of what counts as \"matters of policy\" rests with the government. While this provision is commonplace in Indian laws that establish other regulators, like Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Competition Commission of India (CCI), this is unlikely to hold as a justification, particularly so to the European Commission that appears to place great emphasis on the independence of the regulator (Buttarelli 2017; Greenleaf 2018b).<br/><br/>The Indian Tech-lash<br/><br/>Earlier this year, the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica was found to have used deceptive means to gain access to intimate Facebook data of at least 50 million Americans with the goal of personalising political messages for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. There was global outrage at the deception that was made possible by social media platforms, leading to calls for increased regulatory scrutiny from the American establishment (Wong 2018), while the UK and European countries began investigations into whether these practices violated their data protection laws (Meyer 2018).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in India, Minister of Law and Justice and Electronics and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad threatened \"stringent legal action\" if Facebook was found to be misusing data of Indian citizens, and even threatened to \"summon\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg to India (PTI 2018). It was hard not to see this as an empty threat, given that the existing legal recourse in India under the Information Technology Act, 2000, remains woefully inadequate. Yet, the tone did mark the growing ambition of the Indian state to be tougher on large US-based technology companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple) many of whom have their largest user base in India. This narrative is more clearly observed in the recent calls for \"data sovereignty.\"<br/><br/>Multiple interest groups, both within and outside of the government, are speaking of reclaiming control over personal data from big tech companies either back into the hands of the user or shifting the control to Indian industry and/or the government. In a regulatory dispute with Apple, TRAI Chairperson R S Sharma famously accused the Silicon Valley company of being a \"data coloniser\" and making unilateral decisions about user data without allowing control (Doval 2018). Nandan Nilekani, as well as iSPIRT, the volunteer-run think tank he is affiliated with, have argued that given the first mover advantage accumulated by big tech, it is \"very difficult\" for \"new organizations to get millions of people to shift to new platforms\" (Johnson T A 2017; Nilekani 2017; Bhowani 2018). They support national policy that \"inverts the power of data and hands it to people to empower them.\" One might even see this become a rare technology-focused election issue. As the convenor of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) information technology cell recently proclaimed, \"If we [BJP] get re-elected in 2019, it will be total data sovereignty\" (Deep 2018).<br/><br/>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 could establish a key piece of this vision. It requires that a copy of all personal data of Indian residents be stored on servers in India, often termed \"localization.\" This goes beyond the GDPR, whose restrictions are limited to countries with inadequate levels of data protection, rather than this blanket requirement to store data within the country. In fact, this move can hardly be justified as a means to keep data safer, given that it only asks that a copy be stored in India. A requirement to store data in India will translate into financial and administrative cost on any company that does not currently store data here. This mandate, however, would not just impose costs on tech giants, but also on countless smaller internet companies the world over that may be faced with the difficult decision of whether to continue to offer services to Indian users under this requirement (Kesari 2018).<br/><br/>The nexus between a data localisation mandate and boosting the domestic tech economy is clearer in the government's recent draft of its e-commerce policy. A widely leaked copy of the policy proceeds on the premise that developing \"cutting-edge and innovative technologies in India\" requires \"ensuring access to data.\" The draft goes as far as to suggest that data stored on servers in India should be accessible not only to the government for pursuing \"policy objectives,\" but also to large-sized Indian start-ups. There has been a vocal backlash to the localisation provisions in the bill from various quarters, including civil society organisations who argue that this mandate does nothing to keep data safer and, in fact, makes it easier for law enforcement and surveillance agencies to access personal data, especially given the current lack of procedural safeguards.<br/><br/>Conclusions<br/><br/>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018, is a landmark document in many ways. It represents significant progress towards a comprehensive data privacy regime, one that is lacking and increasingly urgent in India. Despite some deficiencies, it introduces a series of obligations modelled on the GDPR that go a long way in holding corporate and state power accountable for their use of personal data. While the bill may provide some antidote to the pathologies associated with Aadhaar, the Supreme Court's imminent judgment could go further than a data protection law might in setting these fundamental limits. Finally, at a moment where personal data is increasingly the lifeblood for both modern economy and politics, the bill's provisions mandating national storage of data reflect the ambition of both Indian business and government to stake their claim. The next few months of consultation on the bill will be critical to ensuring that it is indeed the individual's interest, and their constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy, that is the guiding force behind this law.<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>Article 29 Working Party (2014): \"Overview of Results of Public Consultation on Opinion on Legitimate Interests of the Data Controller (Opinion 06/2014),\" 14 November, European Commission, Brussels, <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/press-material/public-consultation/notion-legitimate-interests/files/20141126_overview_relating_to_consultation_on_opinion_legitimate_interest_.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/press-material/public-consultation/notion-legitimate-interests/files/20141126_overview_relating_to_consultation_on_opinion_legitimate_interest_.pdf</url>.</p><p>Bhowani, Tanuj (2018): \"Data Democracy Takes Shape,\" Financial Express, 28 July, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/data-democracy-takes-shape/1261109/\">https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/data-democracy-takes-shape/1261109/</url>.<br/><br/>Buttarelli, Giovanni (2017): \"Opening Statement for Panel on Digital Rights and Enforcement,\" 10th Computers, Privacy and Data Protection Conference, 26 January,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/17-01-26_cpdp_2017_co\">https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/17-01-26_cpdp_2017_co</url>....<br/><br/>Deep, Aroon (2018): \"#NAMAprivacy: BJP's Vinit Goenka on Data Localisation, Sovereignty, and 800 Years of Slavery,\" Medianama, 11 September,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2018/09/223-license-patent-colonisation-bjp-vinit-goenka-namaprivacy/\">https://www.medianama.com/2018/09/223-license-patent-colonisation-bjp-vinit-goenka-namaprivacy/</url>.</p><p>Doval, Pankaj (2018): \"Apple Engaged in Data Colonization,\" Times of India, 8 August, <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/apple-engage\">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/apple-engage</url>....<br/><br/>ENISA (2012): \"Cyber Incident Reporting in the EU: An Overview of Security Articles in EU Legislation,\" Technical report, European Network and Information Security Agency,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu\">https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu</url>.</p><p>Greenleaf, Graham (2012): \"The Influence of European Data Privacy Standards outside Europe: Implications for Globalisation of Convention 108,\" International Data Privacy Law, Vol 2, No 2.<br/><br/>- (2016): \"Your Money or Your Life?

The first was delivered by Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray, The Threat Posed by the Chinese Government and the Chinese Communist Party to the Economic and National Security of the United States[2], Remarks delivered at the Hudson Institute (July 7, 2020). It sought to deveklop notions of U.S principles of international engagement through the lens of allegations of Chinese spying (suggesting good versus bad values). The second was delivered by Attorney General William P. Barr, Remarks on China Policy[3] at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, Grand Rapids, Michigan (Thursday, July 16, 2020).It sough to develop notions of complicity and collusion, as well as suggest markers of national loyalty measured by adherence to its values. The third was delivered June 24, 2020 by National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Bien, The Chinese Communist Party's Ideology and Global Ambitions[4], Remarks delivered in Phoenix, Arizona. </p><p>This sought to contrast the values basis of liberal democratic systems by contrasting them against his version of values inherent in Chinese Marxist Leninism. And the last, intended to put the four together, was that of Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Communist China and the Free World's Future,[5] Speech delivered at Yorba Linda, California, The Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum (July 23, 2020).My remarks today are the fourth set of remarks in a series of China speeches that I asked National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, FBI Director Chris Wray, and the Attorney General Barr to deliver alongside me. We had a very clear purpose, a real mission. It was to explain the different facets of America's relationship with China, the massive imbalances in that relationship that have built up over decades, and the Chinese Communist Party's designs for hegemony. Our goal was to make clear that the threats to Americans that President Trump's China policy aims to address are clear and our strategy for securing those freedoms established. Ambassador O'Brien spoke about ideology. FBI Director Wray talked about espionage. Attorney General Barr spoke about economics. And now my goal today is to put it all together for the American people and detail what the China threat means for our economy, for our liberty, and indeed for the future of free democracies around the world. (Michael Pompeo, Communist China and the Free World's Future,[6] Supra).The importance of the exposition of this political and ideological line ought not to be taken lightly. But like the ideological pronouncements of their Chinese Communist Party counterparts, the global intelligentsia will spend far more time engaging in clever complement than in carefully considering the meaning and consequences of the line itself. That has been a costly mistake in the context of understanding China; it will be an equally pathetic mistake by intellectuals (and their masters) intent on dismissing the content because of their contempt for the individual for are making them. But that has been the way of the intelligentsia for a generation. Still one ought not to be consumed by the folly of this group. Indeed, that exercise of dismissive criticism makes it easy to miss a number of quite telling points that mark a surprising similarity in approaches to the ideological lines of both the United States and China. First both are obsessed with the other; both view themselves measured against the other, the one to surpass the old empire, the other to ensure that the young empire does not undermine its own leading role. Second, both understand the process of politics as inherently values laden; that is that politics is a moral project. Built into that is the idea that values are themselves not autonomous items floating in free space, but particularized expressions of a unified approach to the organization of society through shared values and the expression of those values in law and policy. Third, each has constructed the other as the measure against which its own distinctiveness and value can be assessed. Whether one likes the line or not, whether it makes sense or not, whether it will work or not, the reality is that these three speeches, when aggregated, now represent the American political Basic Line respecting not just relations with the People's Republic of China, but the ideological basis for its approach to all problems of government (and governance affecting domestic and international American interests. If for no other reason, a careful study of the speeches will guide one in understanding both the approach and the limits of conceptual possibilities built into this ideological line. Indeed, that exercise of dismissive criticism makes it easy to miss a number of quite telling points that mark a surprising similarity in approaches to the ideological lines of both the United States and China. First both are obsessed with the other; both view themselves measured against the other, the one to surpass the old empire, the other to ensure that the young empire does not undermine its own leading role. Second, both understand the process of politics as inherently values laden; that is that politics is a moral project. Built into that is the idea that values are themselves not autonomous items floating in free space, but particularized expressions of a unified approach to the organization of society through shared values and the expression of those values in law and policy. Third, each has constructed the other as the measure against which its own distinctiveness and value can be assessed. And, indeed, they ought to be read the way one might read the speeches of Xi Jinping and his trusted officials, and the way one approaches the General Program of the Chinese Communist Party. They are all born of the same impulse--to carefully and transparently describe the fundamental premises through which one might \"look\" at the world, analyze and understand events, give meaning to them, and to craft and value approaches to respond. More importantly, the speeches provide the values system through which legal and policy tools will be deployed to attain the goals and preserve the principles at the core of the ideological system. For the United States that will likely mean both much less porous borders as barriers against penetration by enemies and strategic competitors, and much more porous engagements with friends and allies. It will mean, in short, that the Americans, like their Chinese counterparts, have begun to recognize the inevitability of the rise of two self-reflexive and competing imperial orders, and, like their Chinese counterparts, have begun to develop the basis for empire, this time \"with American characteristics.\" Mr. Pompeo hints quite clearly about the rise of a new multilatertalism built around a set of ideological values that will create a space in which a coherent values consensus based economic and societal ordering might be created, and protected against those who would threaten it, whose own values systems must be undermined. A mirror image of the emerging New Era ideological line in China. The generation of intellectuals, academics, officials, and civil society actors who have been brought up in the old order, and who have profited from successfully navigating its hierarchies, will not like this. And they will work diligently to either mock this to death (e.g., Analysts Blast Pompeo's China Speech as Unrealistic, Divorced From Reality[7]) or undermine it in the service of a unitary imperial vision that appears to linger only as an ember of history. For a time they will find refuge in Europe. But only for a while. But that is to be expected. None of it, however, will change much. Both sides, it seems, are now committed to a New Era world order. It is with this in mind that the three speeches are brought together below. Whatever one concludes (and I have been careful here to avoid any of my own conclusions--worried more about the inevitable gaps between ideology and action; an irony commentary on a key point in Mr. Pompeo's speech), the ideology is worth noting, and understanding, for however long it holds power over the minds of the governmental vanguard of the United States. But again, at the end of the day, this is ideology--the proof of its utility--and its value as a basis of accountability, remains to be seen. And that is a quite worthy aim of critique.Attorney General William P. Barr Delivers Remarks on China Policy at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum [8]Grand Rapids, MI ~ Thursday, July 16, 2020  Remarks as Prepared for Delivery Thank you, Andrew for that very kind introduction and for the excellent work that you and your team have done in protecting the people of the Western District of Michigan. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum \u2014 especially Director Elaine Didier \u2014 for hosting today's event. I'd also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today. It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century \u2014 that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future. Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that '[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.'[1][9] Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[2][10] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party. It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America's reengagement with the People's Republic of China, which began with President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong. At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: 'If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people . This last impression\u2014of the reality of China's colossal potential\u2014is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.'[3][11] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass. Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto: 'hide your strength and bide your time.'[4][12] That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving 'closer to center stage,' 'building a socialism that is superior to capitalism,' and replacing the American Dream with the 'Chinese solution.'[5][13] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived. The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg\u2014an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party's 'Made in China 2025' initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, 'Made in China 2025' sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether. 'Made in China 2025' is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China. The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats. Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's 'Belt and Road' infrastructure initiative. Although billed as 'foreign aid,' in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism. Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its 'Digital Silk Road' initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world's chess grandmasters. But the PRC's interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its 'Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,' a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence. The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[6][14] 'Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,' in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[7][15] The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer \u2014 allowing us to serve as the world's 'arsenal of democracy.' China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's 'arsenal of dictatorship.' How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion. Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled 'How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.'[8][16] The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing. Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers \u2014 including American companies \u2014 from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing. China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively 'creating their own competitors.'[9][17] America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as 'APIs.' As one Defense Health Agency official noted, '[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],' it 'could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.'[10][18] To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a 'high-value-added-industry' and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[11][19] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies. In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs. As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, '[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.'[12][20] Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps. If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, 'the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.'[13][21] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil. All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence\u2014even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion. Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences. For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized. In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the 'Ancient One,' a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that 'if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.'[14][22] Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say '[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.'[15][23] These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party. The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market\u2014both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier. But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood\u2014and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, '[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.'[16][24] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China. Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which 'liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.'[17][25] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China\u2014the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship. Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud. The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives \u2014 efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view. As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a 'friendly face' on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed. America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the 'guanxi' \u2014 or system of influential social networks\u2014necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the 'agents' of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[18][26] These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern. By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded 'Confucius Institutes,' which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands. In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength. Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values. In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces. I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a 'stupid mistake.'[19][27] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours. Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks. American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive. During the Cold War, Lewis Powell \u2014 later Justice Powell \u2014 sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. '[T]he time has come,' he said, 'indeed, it is long overdue\u2014for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.'[20][28] So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement. If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: 'Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.'[21][29] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule. The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before. If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we\u2014the American people, American government, and American business together\u2014can do it again. Our freedom depends on it. [1][30] Robert C.

Ford Presidential Museum [59]Grand Rapids, MI ~ Thursday, July 16, 2020  Remarks as Prepared for Delivery Thank you, Andrew for that very kind introduction and for the excellent work that you and your team have done in protecting the people of the Western District of Michigan. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum \u2014 especially Director Elaine Didier \u2014 for hosting today's event. I'd also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today. It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century \u2014 that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future. Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that '[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.'[1][60] Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[2][61] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party. It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America's reengagement with the People's Republic of China, which began with President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong. At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: 'If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people . This last impression\u2014of the reality of China's colossal potential\u2014is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.'[3][62] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass. Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto: 'hide your strength and bide your time.'[4][63] That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving 'closer to center stage,' 'building a socialism that is superior to capitalism,' and replacing the American Dream with the 'Chinese solution.'[5][64] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived. The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg\u2014an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party's 'Made in China 2025' initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, 'Made in China 2025' sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether. 'Made in China 2025' is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China. The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats. Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's 'Belt and Road' infrastructure initiative. Although billed as 'foreign aid,' in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism. Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its 'Digital Silk Road' initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world's chess grandmasters. But the PRC's interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its 'Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,' a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence. The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[6][65] 'Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,' in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[7][66] The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer \u2014 allowing us to serve as the world's 'arsenal of democracy.' China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's 'arsenal of dictatorship.' How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion. Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled 'How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.'[8][67] The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing. Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers \u2014 including American companies \u2014 from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing. China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively 'creating their own competitors.'[9][68] America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as 'APIs.' As one Defense Health Agency official noted, '[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],' it 'could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.'[10][69] To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a 'high-value-added-industry' and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[11][70] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies. In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs. As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, '[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.'[12][71] Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps. If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, 'the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.'[13][72] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil. All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence\u2014even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion. Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences. For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized. In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the 'Ancient One,' a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that 'if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.'[14][73] Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say '[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.'[15][74] These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party. The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market\u2014both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier. But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood\u2014and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, '[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.'[16][75] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China. Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which 'liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.'[17][76] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China\u2014the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship. Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud. The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives \u2014 efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view. As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a 'friendly face' on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed. America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the 'guanxi' \u2014 or system of influential social networks\u2014necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the 'agents' of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[18][77] These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern. By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded 'Confucius Institutes,' which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands. In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength. Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values. In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces. I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a 'stupid mistake.'[19][78] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours. Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks. American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive. During the Cold War, Lewis Powell \u2014 later Justice Powell \u2014 sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. '[T]he time has come,' he said, 'indeed, it is long overdue\u2014for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.'[20][79] So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement. If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: 'Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.'[21][80] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule. The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before. If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we\u2014the American people, American government, and American business together\u2014can do it again. Our freedom depends on it. [1][81] Robert C.

That was an extraordinarily kind introduction and for thinking of Kayla and her parents. We had them at the State of the Union. That was a very special occasion for the President and for all of us as Americans. What happened to Kayla should never happen to anyone, especially Americans. Thank you for remembering her today and for the support you have given her family. It is great to be here in Phoenix. Congratulations on the TSMC factory that is coming to Arizona. I can tell you there are 49 other governors that are a little jealous of Governor Ducey at this point. What a tremendous accomplishment for your administration and it's great for our national security to bring our supply chain home, especially when we are dealing with critical technology, computer chips, dual-use chips, that are not only important to our civilian world\u2014the phones we use, the computers we use, the dishwashers, the refrigerators we use\u2014but also to our military. You have some great aerospace companies who are doing work in Arizona that are going to benefit from having their suppliers closer to home. Congratulations to the people of Arizona. It is wonderful to be here at the Arizona Commerce Authority. Congratulations to you as well for the excellent support you gave the governor and his administration in not only bringing the Taiwanese here but also many other manufacturing companies returning to America are coming to Arizona\u2014great weather, sunshine. It is wonderful again to be back here on the west coast. Other folks around the world are coming to Arizona and the American West to see there is a whole other part to this country outside of Washington, D.C. and New York. As manufacturing returns to this country, Arizona will be at the top of their list. So congratulations, Governor.I bring you greetings from the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. I know he was here yesterday. It is privilege to follow in his wake. I think there is some other good news; you will be having the Vice President of the United States Mike Pence, my close friend, whose office is down the hall, will be here next week.I appreciate the kind invitation to come discuss an issue of great importance to American national security with you, Governor and your colleagues here in Arizona:\u2014the challenge the Chinese Communist Party poses to the United States and our allies is of critical importance to us right now. My remarks are the first of several speeches senior Administration officials will give on this matter over the next few weeks. You will soon hear from Secretary of State Pompeo, Attorney General Barr, and FBI Director Chris Wray on the subject.America, under President Trump's leadership, has finally awoken to the threat the Chinese Communist Party's actions and the threat they pose to our very way of life. For decades, conventional wisdom in both U.S. political parties, the business community, academia, and media, has held that it was only a matter of time before China would become more liberal, first economically and, then, politically.The more we opened our markets to China, the thinking went, the more we invested capital in China, the more we trained PRC bureaucrats, scientists, engineers, and even military officers, the more China would become like us.It was under this premise that we welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 with vast concessions and trade privileges. We downplayed China's gross human rights abuses, including Tiananmen Square. We turned a blind eye to China's widespread technology theft that eviscerated entire sectors of the American economy.As China grew richer and stronger, we believed, the Chinese Communist Party would liberalize to meet the rising democratic aspirations of its people. This was a bold, quintessentially American idea, born of our innate optimism and by the experience of our triumph over Soviet Communism. Unfortunately, it turned out to be very nave.We could not have been more wrong\u2014andthis miscalculation is the greatest failure of American foreign policy since the 1930s. How did we make such a mistake? How did we fail to understand the nature of the Chinese Communist Party?The answer is simple: because we did not pay heed to the CCP's ideology. Instead of listening to what CCP leaders were saying and reading what they wrote in their key documents, we closed our ears and our eyes. We believed what we wanted to believe\u2014that the Party members were communist in name only.Let us be clear, theChinese Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist organization. The Party General Secretary Xi Jinping sees himself as Josef Stalin's successor. In fact, as the journalist and former Australian government official John Garnaut has noted, the Chinese Communist Party is the last 'ruling communist party that never split with Stalin, with the partial exception of North Korea.' [1][116] Yes, Stalin - the man whose brutal dictatorship and disastrous policies killed roughly 20 million Russians and others through famine, forced collectivization, executions, and labor camps. As interpreted and practiced by Lenin, Stalin, and Mao, communism is a totalitarian ideology.Under communism, individuals are merely a means to be used toward the achievement of the ends of the collective nation state. Thus, individuals can be easily sacrificed for the nation state's goals. Individuals do not have inherent value under Marxism-Leninism. They exist to serve the state; the state does not exist to serve them.These ideas sound remote and outdated to us. They are, after all, old ideas\u2014they were born a century and a half ago in Europe. They were implemented a century ago by Russia, and then discarded 30 years ago as the most costly failed political experiment in history. But in China, these ideas remain as fundamental to the Chinese Communist Party as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights do to us as Americans.The Chinese Communist Partyseeks total control over the people's lives. This means economic control, it means political control, it means physical control, and, perhaps most importantly, it means thought control.'In Classical Chinese statecraft,' Garnaut has noted, 'there are two tools for gaining and maintaining control over 'the mountains and the rivers': the first is wu (\u6b66), weapons and violence, and the second is wen (\u6587), language and culture. Chinese leaders have always believed that power derives from controlling both the physical battlefield and the cultural domain.' [2][117] 'For Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Xi,' Garnaut writes, 'words are not vehicles of reason and persuasion. They are bullets. Words are for defining, isolating, and destroying opponents.' [3][118]Propaganda plays a central political role for the CCP.Beijing's efforts to dominate political thought are stated openlyand pursued aggressively. In 1989, the party began organizing itself around 'ideological security,' a term repeated frequently since then by CCP leaders. More recently, inApril 2013, the Party issued a policy on what they call the 'current state of ideology.' [4][119] It held that there should be, 'absolutely no opportunity or outlets for incorrect thinking or viewpoints to spread.' [5][120]So within China, this approach means mandatory study sessions on Communist ideology and the required download and use of smartphone apps that teach so-called 'Xi Jinping Thought.' It means complete control of all state media. Outside sources of information are banned\u2014from foreign newspapers to Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Allcontent generated within China is censored.It means jailing everyone from citizen bloggers, reporters, and lawyers to activists and religious believers for expressing any views contrary to the Party line.And indeed, just recently, between January 1 and April 4 of this year, nearly 500 individuals were charged with crimes just for speaking out about the Wuhan coronavirus, its effects upon the Party, and the Party's cover-up of the disease. [6][121]The Chinese Communist Party reinterprets religious texts, including the Bible, to support communist party ideology. It locks up millions of Muslim Uyghurs and other minorities in reeducationcamps where they are subjected to political indoctrination and forced labor, while their children are raised in Party-run orphanages. This process annihilates family, religion, culture, language, and heritage of the people who are caught up in these camps. Under the Chinese Communist Party, information is tightly controlled and expression is constantlysurveilled, so that it can be quashed or shaped by the state.Americans should be concerned. We should not be concerned only for the Chinese people but for ourselves. Xi Jinping's ambitions for ideological control are not limited to his own people. The CCP's stated goal is to createa 'Community of Common Destiny for Mankind,' and to remake the world according to the CCP. The effort to control thought beyond the borders of China is well under way.Over the past decade, the Party has invested billions of dollars into overseas propaganda operations to great effect.[7][122] The CCP has moved to eliminate 'unfriendly' Chinese language media outlets worldwide, and is close to succeeding. Nearly every Chinese language news outlet in the U.S. is either owned by, or works closely with the Party\u2014and it is making inroads into English language media as well. There are more than a dozen radio stations in cities across the country where Americans hear subtle pro-Beijing propaganda on their FM radio.Recently, Chinese propagandapersuaded so many Americansthat a U.S. solider had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan\u2014as opposed to Wuhan sending the virus to the rest of the world (a complete fabrication by the CCP) that this soldier and her family needed a personal security detail to protect them from death threats.This situation occurred in Maryland.On TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform with over 40 million American users\u2014probably a lot of your kids and younger colleagues- accounts criticizing CCP policies are routinely removed or deleted.Last week, Twitter announced the suspension of more than 23,000 CCP linked accounts for spreading propaganda on Hong Kong and COVID-19. This latest suspension was in addition to last August's removal of more than 150,000 CCP linked accounts that were used to spread anti-American disinformation and generate the illusion of popular support for Beijing's policies in the United States. These are just the accounts Twitter caught. How many are still out there undetected?In March, the CCP expelled American journalists working for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post, almost fully eliminating independent reporting from within China on the Wuhan virus.In addition toinfluencing what information American citizens receive regarding China, the CCP is increasingly using its leverage to police American speech. When the University of California at San Diego hosted the Dalai Lama as a commencement speaker in 2017, Beijing banned Chinese students from visiting UCSD on government funds.When the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted his support for the peaceful Hong Kong protesters, the CCP announced its team's games would not be shown on Chinese TV and usedits economic power to pressure others in basketball, including star players, to criticize the tweet on behalf of Beijing.Under pressure from the CCP,Marriott, and American, Delta, and United Airlines all removed references to Taiwan from their corporate websites. Mercedes Benz even apologized for posting an inspirational quote from the Dalai Lama on social media.Beijing has used its financial might and market access to pressure Hollywood into self-censorship, incentivizing directors and producers to avoid topics that might not make it past the country's censors in China. For example, the Japanese and Taiwanese flags were dropped from Tom Cruise's flight jacket in the upcoming Top Gun sequel 'Maverick.' MGM digitally changed the identities, post-production, of the invading military from China to North Korea in the 'Red Dawn' remake.The CCP is seeking leverage over individual Americans as well. The Party is collecting your most intimate data\u2014your words,your actions, your purchases, your whereabouts, your health records, your social media posts, your texts, and mapping your network of friends, family, and acquaintances.The CCP accomplishes this goal, in part, by subsidizing hardware, software, telecommunications, and even genetics companies. As a result, corporations such asHuawei and ZTE undercut competitors on price and install their equipment around the globe at a loss.This has the side effect of putting out of business American manufacturers of telecom hardware and has made it very difficult for Nokia and Ericsson. Why do they do it? Because it is not telecom hardware or software profits the CCP are after, it is your data. They use 'backdoors' built into the products to obtain that data.When the Chinese Communist Party cannot buy your data, it steals it.In 2014, the CCP hacked Anthem insurance, collecting sensitive information on 80 million Americans. In 2015, the CCP hacked the Office of Personnel Management, which holds security clearance information, acquiring sensitive data on 20 million Americans who work for the federal government. In 2017, it hacked Equifax, obtaining the names, birthdates, social security numbers, and credit scores of 145 million Americans.In 2019, the CCP hacked Marriot, gathering information on 383 million guests, including their passport numbers. And, in 2016, a Chinese company even bought the dating app Grindr to harvest its data, including the HIV status of users, before the U.S. government forced a divestiture on national security grounds. These are just a few of the instances we know about.How will the Chinese Communist Party use this data? In the same way it uses data within China's borders: to target, to flatter, to cajole, to influence, to coerce, and to even blackmail individuals to say and do things that serve the Party's interests. This is 'micro targeting' beyond an advertiser's wildest dreams. China, unlike advertisers, will not be stopped by government regulations. The Chinese Communist Party simply wants to know everything about you\u2014just as it likes to know almost everything about every individual living in China.In addition to propaganda and influence operations, the Chinese Communist Party uses trade to coerce compliance with its dictates. When Australia called for an independent investigation of the coronavirus' origins and spread, the Chinese Communist Party threatened to stop buying Australian agricultural products and to prevent Chinese students and tourists from traveling to Australia. When Australia refused to relent, Beijing put these threats into force, imposing an 80% tariff on Australian barley exports. International organizations are also part of China's plan. China has sought leadership positions within many global bodies. China now heads four out of fifteen UN specialized agencies, more than the U.S., UK, France, and Russia, the other members of the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, combined. The PRC uses these leaders to force the international bodies to parrot Beijing's talking points and to install Chinese telecommunications equipment in their facilities.For example, since Zhao Houlin of the International Telecommunications Union took his post he began to aggressively promote Huawei sales. Secretary-General Fang Liu of the International Civil Aviation Organization has blocked Taiwan's participation in General Assembly meetings and covered up a Chinese hack of the organization. The Party has used China's membership on the UN Human Rights Council to prevent criticism of its abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.The CCP's reach extends to heads of international organizations who are not themselves Chinese officials. Under Beijing's thumb, and at an unacceptable cost to human life, Director-General Tedros of the World Health Organization dutifully used Chinese talking points on the Wuhan virus. As late as mid-January, he claimed there was no human-to-human transmission of the disease. He opposed international travel restrictions. At the same time, Tedros praised China's own domestic travel restrictions on Wuhan residents. In other words, they could travel overseas, but they could not travel and potentially take the virus to Beijing or Shanghai. These CCP tactics in international organizations, as we have seen with the coronavirus, are a major cause of concern not just for the United States, but to the world.The good news is that under President Trump's leadership, we know what the CCP is doing, we are calling it out, and we are taking decisive action to counter it across the board. [8][123]First, President Trump prevented certain companies that answer to the CCP's intelligence and security apparatus\u2014such as Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei\u2014from accessing our personal and private data. [9][124] The Administration also imposed restrictions on U.S. semiconductor technology from going to Huawei.[10][125]Second, the State Department designated the U.S. operations of 9 Chinese state-controlled propaganda outlets as foreign missions.[11][126] These organizations are the mouthpieces of the Chinese Communist Party. This designation places reporting requirements and visa restrictions on these so-called media outlets.Third, President Trump imposed export restrictions on 21 Chinese government entities and 16 Chinese companies complicit in China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs and other minorities, and we have blocked officials complicit in these abuses from travelling to the United States. [12][127] The Administration has also stopped the illegal import of goods produced by Chinese companies known to use Uyghur forced labor.[13][128]Fourth, President Trump left the United Nations Human Rights Council to protest its cooptation by China.[14][129] He has terminated the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization, because its response to the pandemic showed that it is beholden to China.[15][130] Instead of funding the corrupt WHO in Geneva with over $400 million per year, the United States and its generous taxpayers will send that money directly to where it is needed most\u2014frontline healthcare workers serving in developing countries around the world.Fifth, President Trump limited the People's Liberation Army's ability to use student visa programs to place its officers and employees in our colleges and universities to steal U.S. technology, intellectual property, and information.[16][131]Sixth, the President moved to halt the investment of U.S. federal employee retirement funds into PRC companies, including Chinese military contractors and manufacturers of surveillance equipment used to oppress religious minorities. [17][132] He is examining the opaque accounting practices of Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. [18][133]This week, the Defense Department is submitting to Congress a list of People's Liberation Army-linked companies with operations in the United States so that the American people are fully informed about exactly with whom they are doing business.Now, these steps are just the start as America corrects 40 years of a one-sided, unfair relationship with China that has severely affected our nation's economic and, recently, political well-being. Just like the tariffs that were imposed by the President on unfair trade practices early in his Administration, there is more to come.President Trump understands that lasting peace comes through strength. We are the strongest nation on earth, and we will not bend to the CCP. As the foregoing actions demonstrate, the Trump Administration is countering CCP malign activity. The Trump Administration will speak out and reveal what the Chinese Communist Party believes, and what it is planning\u2014not just for China and Hong Kong and Taiwan, but for the world.Together with our allies and partners, we will resist the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to manipulate our people and our governments, damage our economies, and undermine our sovereignty. The days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.We will stay true to our principles\u2014especially freedom of speech\u2014which stand in stark contrast to the Marxist-Leninist ideology embraced by the CCP. Under President Trump's leadership, we will encourage diversity of thought, resistefforts to police speech or encourage self-censorship, protect Americans' personal data, andabove all, continue to proclaim that all women and men are entitled by right of God to liberty, life, and the pursuit of happiness.As I close, let me be clear - we have deep respect and admiration for the Chinese people. The United States has a long history of friendship with the Chinese nation. But the Chinese Communist Party does not equal China or her people.To the Chinese Communist Party, I say, as the recent Phase One trade deal has shown, it is possible for our governments to have a productive relationship. We want good relationships with China, but we do not want relations on the terms currently on offer from Beijing.As Americans, I am certain that we will rise to successfully meet the challenge presented by the Chinese Communist Party, just as we have responded to all the great crises over our history. President Trump is leading the way. And like President Trump, I firmly believe that our best days as a country remain ahead of us.Again, thank you for joining me here today. It is a privilege to be here in Phoenix, Arizona. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.NOTES: [1] John Garnaut, 'Engineers of the Soul: Ideology in Xi Jinping's China,' January 16, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in\">https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in</url>.[134] [2] John Garnaut, 'Engineers of the Soul: Ideology in Xi Jinping's China,' January 16, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in\">https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in</url>.[135] [3][136] John Garnaut, 'Engineers of the Soul: Ideology in Xi Jinping's China,' January 16, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in\">https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in</url>.[137] [4][138] 'Document 9: A ChinaFile Translation,' November 8, 2013, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translatio\">https://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translatio</url>[139]n.

GOVERNOR WILSON: Well, thank you very much, Chris. Most generous. I'm not sure your grandfather would have recognized me. I have the great pleasure - in addition to welcoming all of you to the Nixon birthplace and library, I have the great pleasure of introducing to you an extraordinary American who is here at an extraordinary time. But the fun of it is in introducing our honored guest, I also am welcoming him not just to the Nixon Library, but I'm welcoming him back home to Orange County. (Applause.) That's right. Mike Pompeo was born in Orange. (Applause.) He attended Los Amigos High School in Fountain Valley, where he was an outstanding student and athlete. In fact, I have it on good authority that among the fans of glory days of Lobo basketball, a reverent hush descends upon the crowd whenever the name 'Pompeo' is mentioned. (Laughter.) The Secretary was first in his class at West Point. He won the award as the most distinguished cadet. He won another award for the highest achievement in engineering management. He spent his active duty years, his Army years, in West Germany, and as he put it, patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1988 - excuse me - retiring with a rank of captain, he went on to Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Law Review. In 1988, he returned to his mother's home state of Kansas and began a stunningly successful business career. He was elected to the House of Representatives from Kansas in 2011, where he soon gained great respect for a reputation as one of the most diligent and astute members of the House Arms - excuse me, the House Intelligence Committee. In 2017, President Trump nominated him to be the director of Central Intelligence. And in 2018, he was confirmed as our 70th Secretary of State. You have to admit, that's quite an impressive resume. So it's sad there's only one thing missing, prevents it from being perfect. If only Mike had been a Marine. (Laughter.) Don't worry, he'll get even. Mike Pompeo is a man devoted to his family. He is a man of faith, of the greatest patriotism and the highest principle. One of his most important initiatives at the State Department has been the creation of a Commission on Unalienable Rights where academicians, philosophers, and ethicists advise him on human rights grounded in America's founding principles and the principles of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Rights. He is here today for a very special reason. The epitaph on President Nixon's gravestone is a sentence from his first inaugural address. It says, quote, 'The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker.' Richard Nixon received that title. He won that honor not only because he was acknowledged even by his critics to be a brilliant foreign policy strategist, but it was far more because he earned it. He learned as congressman, senator, president, and every day thereafter as a private citizen ambassador that peace is not achieved by signing documents and declaring the job done. To the contrary, he knew that peace is always a work in progress. He knew that peace must be fought for and won anew in every generation. It was President Nixon's vision, determination, and courage that opened China to America and to the Western world. As president and for the rest of his life, Richard Nixon worked to build a relationship with China based upon mutual benefits and obligations that respected America's bedrock national interests. Today, we in America are obliged to assess whether or not President Nixon's labors and his hopes for such a relationship have been met or whether they are being undermined. That is why it is of such great significance that our honored guest, Secretary Pompeo, has chosen the Nixon Library from which to deliver a major China policy statement. It will, I promise you, be a statement of complete clarity delivered with force and with belief because it is of critical importance. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor and pleasure to welcome to this podium and to this audience our honored guest, the Secretary of State of the United States of America, the honorable and really quite remarkable - honorable Michael R. Pompeo. (Applause.) SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you, Governor, for that very, very generous introduction. It is true: When you walk in that gym and you say the name 'Pompeo,' there is a whisper. I had a brother, Mark, who was really good - a really good basketball player. And how about another round of applause for the Blue Eagles Honor Guard and Senior Airman Kayla Highsmith, and her wonderful rendition of the national anthem? (Applause.) Thank you, too, to Pastor Laurie for that moving prayer, and I want to thank Hugh Hewitt and the Nixon Foundation for your invitation to speak at this important American institution. It was great to be sung to by an Air Force person, introduced by a Marine, and they let the Army guy in in front of the Navy guy's house. (Laughter.) It's all good. It's an honor to be here in Yorba Linda, where Nixon's father built the house in which he was born and raised. To all the Nixon Center board and staff who made today possible - it's difficult in these times - thanks for making this day possible for me and for my team. We are blessed to have some incredibly special people in the audience, including Chris, who I've gotten to know - Chris Nixon. I also want to thank Tricia Nixon and Julie Nixon Eisenhower for their support of this visit as well. I want to recognize several courageous Chinese dissidents who have joined us here today and made a long trip. And to all the other distinguished guests - (applause) - to all the other distinguished guests, thank you for being here. For those of you who got under the tent, you must have paid extra. And those of you watching live, thank you for tuning in. And finally, as the governor mentioned, I was born here in Santa Ana, not very far from here. I've got my sister and her husband in the audience today. Thank you all for coming out. I bet you never thought that I'd be standing up here. My remarks today are the fourth set of remarks in a series of China speeches that I asked National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, FBI Director Chris Wray, and the Attorney General Barr to deliver alongside me. We had a very clear purpose, a real mission. It was to explain the different facets of America's relationship with China, the massive imbalances in that relationship that have built up over decades, and the Chinese Communist Party's designs for hegemony. Our goal was to make clear that the threats to Americans that President Trump's China policy aims to address are clear and our strategy for securing those freedoms established. Ambassador O'Brien spoke about ideology. FBI Director Wray talked about espionage. Attorney General Barr spoke about economics. And now my goal today is to put it all together for the American people and detail what the China threat means for our economy, for our liberty, and indeed for the future of free democracies around the world. Next year marks half a century since Dr. Kissinger's secret mission to China, and the 50th anniversary of President Nixon's trip isn't too far away in 2022. The world was much different then. We imagined engagement with China would produce a future with bright promise of comity and cooperation. But today - today we're all still wearing masks and watching the pandemic's body count rise because the CCP failed in its promises to the world. We're reading every morning new headlines of repression in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang. We're seeing staggering statistics of Chinese trade abuses that cost American jobs and strike enormous blows to the economies all across America, including here in southern California. And we're watching a Chinese military that grows stronger and stronger, and indeed more menacing. I'll echo the questions ringing in the hearts and minds of Americans from here in California to my home state of Kansas and beyond: What do the American people have to show now 50 years on from engagement with China? Did the theories of our leaders that proposed a Chinese evolution towards freedom and democracy prove to be true? Is this China's definition of a win-win situation? And indeed, centrally, from the Secretary of State's perspective, is America safer? Do we have a greater likelihood of peace for ourselves and peace for the generations which will follow us? Look, we have to admit a hard truth. We must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come, that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not the Chinese century of which Xi Jinping dreams, the old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won't get it done. We must not continue it and we must not return to it. As President Trump has made very clear, we need a strategy that protects the American economy, and indeed our way of life. The free world must triumph over this new tyranny. Now, before I seem too eager to tear down President Nixon's legacy, I want to be clear that he did what he believed was best for the American people at the time, and he may well have been right. He was a brilliant student of China, a fierce cold warrior, and a tremendous admirer of the Chinese people, just as I think we all are. He deserves enormous credit for realizing that China was too important to be ignored, even when the nation was weakened because of its own self-inflicted communist brutality. In 1967, in a very famous Foreign Affairs article, Nixon explained his future strategy. Here's what he said: He said, 'Taking the long view, we simply cannot afford to leave China forever outside of the family of nationsThe world cannot be safe until China changes. Thus, our aim - to the extent we can, we must influence events. Our goal should be to induce change.' And I think that's the key phrase from the entire article: 'to induce change.' So, with that historic trip to Beijing, President Nixon kicked off our engagement strategy. He nobly sought a freer and safer world, and he hoped that the Chinese Communist Party would return that commitment. As time went on, American policymakers increasingly presumed that as China became more prosperous, it would open up, it would become freer at home, and indeed present less of a threat abroad, it'd be friendlier. It all seemed, I am sure, so inevitable. But that age of inevitability is over. The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change inside of China that President Nixon had hoped to induce. The truth is that our policies - and those of other free nations - resurrected China's failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that were feeding it. We opened our arms to Chinese citizens, only to see the Chinese Communist Party exploit our free and open society. China sent propagandists into our press conferences, our research centers, our high-schools, our colleges, and even into our PTA meetings. We marginalized our friends in Taiwan, which later blossomed into a vigorous democracy. We gave the Chinese Communist Party and the regime itself special economic treatment, only to see the CCP insist on silence over its human rights abuses as the price of admission for Western companies entering China. Ambassador O'Brien ticked off a few examples just the other day: Marriott, American Airlines, Delta, United all removed references to Taiwan from their corporate websites, so as not to anger Beijing. In Hollywood, not too far from here - the epicenter of American creative freedom, and self-appointed arbiters of social justice - self-censors even the most mildly unfavorable reference to China. This corporate acquiescence to the CCP happens all over the world, too. And how has this corporate fealty worked? Is its flattery rewarded? I'll give you a quote from the speech that General Barr gave, Attorney General Barr. In a speech last week, he said that 'The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States.' China ripped off our prized intellectual property and trade secrets, causing millions of jobs[1][167] all across America. It sucked supply chains away from America, and then added a widget made of slave labor. It made the world's key waterways less safe for international commerce. President Nixon once said he feared he had created a 'Frankenstein' by opening the world to the CCP, and here we are. Now, people of good faith can debate why free nations allowed these bad things to happen for all these years. Perhaps we were naive about China's virulent strain of communism, or triumphalist after our victory in the Cold War, or cravenly capitalist, or hoodwinked by Beijing's talk of a 'peaceful rise.' Whatever the reason - whatever the reason, today China is increasingly authoritarian at home, and more aggressive in its hostility to freedom everywhere else. And President Trump has said: enough. I don't think many people on either side of the aisle dispute the facts that I have laid out today. But even now, some are insisting that we preserve the model of dialogue for dialogue's sake. Now, to be clear, we'll keep on talking. But the conversations are different these days. I traveled to Honolulu now just a few weeks back to meet with Yang Jiechi. It was the same old story - plenty of words, but literally no offer to change any of the behaviors. Yang's promises, like so many the CCP made before him, were empty. His expectations, I surmise, were that I'd cave to their demands, because frankly this is what too many prior administrations have done. I didn't, and President Trump will not either. As Ambassador O'Brien explained so well, we have to keep in mind that the CCP regime is a Marxist-Leninist regime. General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology. It's this ideology, it's this ideology that informs his decades-long desire for global hegemony of Chinese communism. America can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries, just as the CCP has never ignored them. My experience in the House Intelligence Committee, and then as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and my now two-plus years as America's Secretary of State have led me to this central understanding: That the only way - the only way to truly change communist China is to act not on the basis of what Chinese leaders say, but how they behave. And you can see American policy responding to this conclusion. President Reagan said that he dealt with the Soviet Union on the basis of 'trust but verify.' When it comes to the CCP, I say we must distrust and verify. (Applause.) We, the freedom-loving nations of the world, must induce China to change, just as President Nixon wanted. We must induce China to change in more creative and assertive ways, because Beijing's actions threaten our people and our prosperity. We must start by changing how our people and our partners perceive the Chinese Communist Party. We have to tell the truth. We can't treat this incarnation of China as a normal country, just like any other. We know that trading with China is not like trading with a normal, law-abiding nation. Beijing threatens international agreements as - treats international suggestions as - or agreements as suggestions, as conduits for global dominance. But by insisting on fair terms, as our trade representative did when he secured our phase one trade deal, we can force China to reckon with its intellectual property theft and policies that harmed American workers. We know too that doing business with a CCP-backed company is not the same as doing business with, say, a Canadian company. They don't answer to independent boards, and many of them are state-sponsored and so have no need to pursue profits. A good example is Huawei. We stopped pretending Huawei is an innocent telecommunications company that's just showing up to make sure you can talk to your friends. We've called it what it is - a true national security threat - and we've taken action accordingly. We know too that if our companies invest in China, they may wittingly or unwittingly support the Communist Party's gross human rights violations. Our Departments of Treasury and Commerce have thus sanctioned and blacklisted Chinese leaders and entities that are harming and abusing the most basic rights for people all across the world. Several agencies have worked together on a business advisory to make certain our CEOs are informed of how their supply chains are behaving inside of China. We know too, we know too that not all Chinese students and employees are just normal students and workers that are coming here to make a little bit of money and to garner themselves some knowledge. Too many of them come here to steal our intellectual property and to take this back to their country. The Department of Justice and other agencies have vigorously pursued punishment for these crimes. We know that the People's Liberation Army is not a normal army, too. Its purpose is to uphold the absolute rule of the Chinese Communist Party elites and expand a Chinese empire, not to protect the Chinese people. And so our Department of Defense has ramped up its efforts, freedom of navigation operations out and throughout the East and South China Seas, and in the Taiwan Strait as well. And we've created a Space Force to help deter China from aggression on that final frontier. And so too, frankly, we've built out a new set of policies at the State Department dealing with China, pushing President Trump's goals for fairness and reciprocity, to rewrite the imbalances that have grown over decades. Just this week, we announced the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston because it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. (Applause.) We reversed, two weeks ago, eight years of cheek-turning with respect to international law in the South China Sea. We've called on China to conform its nuclear capabilities to the strategic realities of our time. And the State Department - at every level, all across the world - has engaged with our Chinese counterparts simply to demand fairness and reciprocity. But our approach can't just be about getting tough. That's unlikely to achieve the outcome that we desire. We must also engage and empower the Chinese people - a dynamic, freedom-loving people who are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party. That begins with in-person diplomacy. (Applause.) I've met Chinese men and women of great talent and diligence wherever I go. I've met with Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs who escaped Xinjiang's concentration camps. I've talked with Hong Kong's democracy leaders, from Cardinal Zen to Jimmy Lai. Two days ago in London, I met with Hong Kong freedom fighter Nathan Law. And last month in my office, I heard the stories of Tiananmen Square survivors. One of them is here today. Wang Dan was a key student who has never stopped fighting for freedom for the Chinese people. Mr. Wang, will you please stand so that we may recognize you? (Applause.) Also with us today is the father of the Chinese democracy movement, Wei Jingsheng. He spent decades in Chinese labor camps for his advocacy. Mr. Wei, will you please stand? (Applause.) I grew up and served my time in the Army during the Cold War. And if there is one thing I learned, communists almost always lie. The biggest lie that they tell is to think that they speak for 1.4 billion people who are surveilled, oppressed, and scared to speak out. Quite the contrary. The CCP fears the Chinese people's honest opinions more than any foe, and save for losing their own grip on power, they have reason - no reason to. Just think how much better off the world would be - not to mention the people inside of China - if we had been able to hear from the doctors in Wuhan and they'd been allowed to raise the alarm about the outbreak of a new and novel virus. For too many decades, our leaders have ignored, downplayed the words of brave Chinese dissidents who warned us about the nature of the regime we're facing. And we can't ignore it any longer. They know as well as anyone that we can never go back to the status quo. But changing the CCP's behavior cannot be the mission of the Chinese people alone. Free nations have to work to defend freedom. It's the furthest thing from easy. But I have faith we can do it. I have faith because we've done it before. We know how this goes. I have faith because the CCP is repeating some of the same mistakes that the Soviet Union made - alienating potential allies, breaking trust at home and abroad, rejecting property rights and predictable rule of law. I have faith. I have faith because of the awakening I see among other nations that know we can't go back to the past in the same way that we do here in America. I've heard this from Brussels, to Sydney, to Hanoi. And most of all, I have faith we can defend freedom because of the sweet appeal of freedom itself. Look at the Hong Kongers clamoring to emigrate abroad as the CCP tightens its grip on that proud city. They wave American flags. It's true, there are differences. Unlike the Soviet Union, China is deeply integrated into the global economy. But Beijing is more dependent on us than we are on them. (Applause.) Look, I reject the notion that we're living in an age of inevitability, that some trap is pre-ordained, that CCP supremacy is the future. Our approach isn't destined to fail because America is in decline. As I said in Munich earlier this year, the free world is still winning. We just need to believe it and know it and be proud of it. People from all over the world still want to come to open societies. They come here to study, they come here to work, they come here to build a life for their families. They're not desperate to settle in China. It's time. It's great to be here today. The timing is perfect. It's time for free nations to act. Not every nation will approach China in the same way, nor should they. Every nation will have to come to its own understanding of how to protect its own sovereignty, how to protect its own economic prosperity, and how to protect its ideals from the tentacles of the Chinese Communist Party. But I call on every leader of every nation to start by doing what America has done - to simply insist on reciprocity, to insist on transparency and accountability from the Chinese Communist Party. It's a cadre of rulers that are far from homogeneous. And these simple and powerful standards will achieve a great deal. For too long we let the CCP set the terms of engagement, but no longer. Free nations must set the tone. We must operate on the same principles. We have to draw common lines in the sand that cannot be washed away by the CCP's bargains or their blandishments. Indeed, this is what the United States did recently when we rejected China's unlawful claims in the South China Sea once and for all, as we have urged countries to become Clean Countries so that their citizens' private information doesn't end up in the hand of the Chinese Communist Party. We did it by setting standards. Now, it's true, it's difficult. It's difficult for some small countries. They fear being picked off. Some of them for that reason simply don't have the ability, the courage to stand with us for the moment. Indeed, we have a NATO ally of ours that hasn't stood up in the way that it needs to with respect to Hong Kong because they fear Beijing will restrict access to China's market. This is the kind of timidity that will lead to historic failure, and we can't repeat it. We cannot repeat the mistakes of these past years. The challenge of China demands exertion, energy from democracies - those in Europe, those in Africa, those in South America, and especially those in the Indo-Pacific region. And if we don't act now, ultimately the CCP will erode our freedoms and subvert the rules-based order that our societies have worked so hard to build. If we bend the knee now, our children's children may be at the mercy of the Chinese Communist Party, whose actions are the primary challenge today in the free world. General Secretary Xi is not destined to tyrannize inside and outside of China forever, unless we allow it. Now, this isn't about containment. Don't buy that. It's about a complex new challenge that we've never faced before. The USSR was closed off from the free world. Communist China is already within our borders. So we can't face this challenge alone. The United Nations, NATO, the G7 countries, the G20, our combined economic, diplomatic, and military power is surely enough to meet this challenge if we direct it clearly and with great courage. Maybe it's time for a new grouping of like-minded nations, a new alliance of democracies. We have the tools. I know we can do it. Now we need the will. To quote scripture, I ask is 'our spirit willing but our flesh weak?' If the free world doesn't change - doesn't change, communist China will surely change us. There can't be a return to the past practices because they're comfortable or because they're convenient. Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity. As I explained in Philadelphia last week, standing, staring at Independence Hall, our nation was founded on the premise that all human beings possess certain rights that are unalienable. And it's our government's job to secure those rights. It is a simple and powerful truth. It's made us a beacon of freedom for people all around the world, including people inside of China. Indeed, Richard Nixon was right when he wrote in 1967 that 'the world cannot be safe until China changes.' Now it's up to us to heed his words. Today the danger is clear. And today the awakening is happening. Today the free world must respond. We can never go back to the past. May God bless each of you. May God bless the Chinese people. And may God bless the people of the United States of America. Thank you all. (Applause.) MR HEWITT: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Please be seated. I'm Hugh Hewitt, the president of the library, and Secretary Pompeo graciously invited some questions as I was listening. Thank you for joining us, Mr. Secretary, at the Nixon Library. My first question has to do with the context of the president's visit in 1972. You mentioned the Soviet Union was isolated, but it was dangerous. He went to the People's Republic of China in 1972 to try and ally and combine interests with them against the Soviet Union; it was successful. Does Russia present an opportunity now to the United States to coax them into the battle to be relentlessly candid about the Chinese Communist Party? SECRETARY POMPEO: So I do think there's that opportunity. That opportunity is born of the relationship, the natural relationship between Russia and China, and we can do something as well. There are places where we need to work with Russia. Today - or tomorrow, I guess it is, our teams will be on the ground with the Russians working on a strategic dialogue to hopefully create the next generation of arms control agreements like Reagan did. It's in our interest, it's in Russia's interest. We've asked the Chinese to participate. They've declined to date. We hope they'll change their mind. It's these kind of things - these proliferation issues, these big strategic challenges - that if we work alongside Russia, I'm convinced we can make the world safer. And so there - I think there is a place for us to work with the Russians to achieve a more likely outcome of peace not only for the United States but for the world. MR HEWITT: President Nixon also put quite a lot of store in personal relationships over many years with individuals. That can lead wrong. President Bush famously misjudged Vladimir Putin and said so afterwards. You have met President Xi often. Is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party someone with whom we can deal on a transparent and reliable basis, in your opinion, based on your personal diplomacy with him? SECRETARY POMPEO: So the meetings that I've had and the meeting that the President - we've had - they've been good, frank conversations. He is the most powerful leader of China since Mao. He has also in many ways deinstitutionalized the Chinese Communist Party, thus giving him even more capacity and more power. But Hugh, I think the way to think about it is how I spoke about this today: It's about actions. And so how one evaluates one's counterparts sitting across the table from them - it's important to think about how you can find common understandings and make progress. But in the end, it's not about what someone says or the agreement that they sign, but are they prepared to lead, to do the things that they committed to? Are they prepared to fulfill their promises? And we've watched - we've watched this China walk away from their promises to the world on Hong Kong, we watched their - General Secretary Xi promised President Obama in the Rose Garden in 2015 that he wouldn't militarize the South China Sea. And Google the South China Sea and arms; you'll see another promise broken. So in the end, from my perspective, it's much more important to watch how leaders behave and how they lead than what it is you think when you have a chance to talk to them on the phone or meet them in person. MR HEWITT: Mr. Secretary, you said this is not containment. I heard that very clearly. I have read the three previous speeches by Ambassador O'Brien, Director Wray, Attorney General Barr, and now listened to you very closely. It isn't containment, but it is a fairly comprehensive, multidimensional, relentlessly objective candor. Is that dangerous in a world that's not used to speaking clearly about delicate subjects? SECRETARY POMPEO: My experience, and I think President Trump's experience too in his life as a businessman, is the best policy is always true candor, identifying the places that you have a redline, identifying places that you have a real interest, making clear if there's places where you don't, and there's things that you can work on alongside each other. I think the real danger comes from misunderstandings and miscommunication and the failure to be honest about the things that matter to you, because others will move into that space and then conflict arises. I think the world is a heck of a lot safer when you have leaders who are prepared to be honest about the things that matter and prepared to talk about the things their nation is prepared to do to secure those interests. And you can reduce risk by these conversations so long as you're honest about it. So I - no, I don't think it's dangerous. I think it's just the opposite of that. MR HEWITT: You also said - and I'm sure the speech will be known as the 'distrust but verify' speech - when you distrust but verify, that still premises verification is possible. It is still possible to do agreements and to verify them; correct? SECRETARY POMPEO: It is, yeah, you can still do it. Each nation's got to be prepared for a certain amount of intrusiveness connected to that. And it is not in the nature of communist regimes to allow transparency inside of their country. And so it's been done before. We've had - we had arms control agreements with the Soviet Union that we got verification that was sufficient to ensure that we protected American interests. I believe we can do it again. I hope that we can do this on these - I mean, the Chinese Communist Party has several hundred nuclear warheads. This is a serious global power. And to the extent we can find common ground, a common set of understandings to reduce risk that there's ever a really bad day for the world, we ought to do it, and it's going to require agreement and verification. MR HEWITT: Ambassador Richard Haass, who is now chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, said very recently - it may have been yesterday, it might have been this morning; I saw it this morning preparing - quote, 'Secretary Pompeo doesn't speak of China but of the Chinese Communist Party as if there were a China apart from the party. This is meant to antagonize and make diplomacy impossible. Quite a stance for America's chief diplomat to take unless his goal is to ensure diplomacy fails.' Is that your goal? SECRETARY POMPEO: (Laughter.) Ah, goodness. Hard to begin. Here's where I'll begin: It's a bit patronizing to the people of China to make such an assertion that they are not free-thinking beings, that they're not rational people who were given - I mean, they too were made in the image of God, right. They have all the capacity that anybody in the world does. So to somehow think that we ought to ignore the voices of the people of China seems to me the wrong approach. It is true the Chinese Communist Party is a one-party rule. And so we will deal with the Chinese Communist Party as the head of state for China, and we need to, and we need to engage in dialogue. But it seems to me we would dishonor ourselves and the people of China if we ignored them. MR HEWITT: Now, Ambassador O'Brien, whose speech you referenced, put heavy emphasis on the ideology of Marxist-Leninism. It was almost quaint to hear that conversation again; it's gone from our vocabulary. Does the American people, and especially American media, need to reacquaint itself with what Marxist-Leninists believe, because the CCP genuinely does believe it? SECRETARY POMPEO: I always get in trouble, Hugh, when I comment on the media. So I'll say this much: For those of us who have lived and seen and observed, there are other Marxist-Leninist nations today as well - and have seen - they believe - they have an understanding, a central understanding of how people interact and how societies ought to interact. And it is certainly the case today that the leadership in China believes that. We should acknowledge that, and we should make sure that we don't for a moment think that they don't believe it. It's what Ambassador O'Brien's speech was about. It was the fact - it was acknowledging that they believe it and recognizing that we have to respond in a way that reflects our understanding of the way they view the world. MR HEWITT: Let's not talk about the American media. I want to talk about the Chinese media for a moment. They are aggressive, to say the least, and right now they are aggressively defending, for example, TikTok. A small question within a large question: Is TikTok capable of being weaponized? Is that an example of what's going on? And generally, Chinese media has become far more aggressive than I've seen in 30 years since I was at the library the first time of watching it. Is that something you've noticed as well? SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, they're very aggressive. Two pieces to this, one you hit upon. One is I'll describe as their technology medium. Without singling out any particular business, our view of these companies is we're neither for or against the company; we're about making sure that we protect the information that belongs to each of you - your health records, your face if it's a facial recognition software, your address. All the things that you care that you want to make sure the Chinese Communist Party doesn't have, we have a responsibility to make sure that the systems that you're using don't give them access to that. And so whether it's the efforts we've made against Huawei or the work that we're doing on other software firms, the American task is to protect the American people and their information. The second piece of this has to do with their - what I'll call the state-sponsored media of China and their disinformation. You should know - and this is where I am concerned about the American media, too - these are state-sponsored media organizations that take their messaging from the Chinese Communist Party each day. When American institutions pick up those storylines and carry them forward, they are, in fact, propagating Chinese propaganda, and we all ought to be wise to that. There was an editorial in The New York Times yesterday by someone who had a clear view that was antithetical to the American way of life. The New York Times ran it straight-up without comment, forwarding - although albeit in the opinion section, but propagating Chinese propaganda. That is certainly not instructive when they're telling senators from Arkansas they can't simply talk about America and American freedom in that same media outlet. MR HEWITT: You mentioned that a lot of corporate America - and you mentioned specifically Hollywood - have got deep intertwinement with the Chinese economy. So I don't want to talk about soft power; I want to talk about soft appeasement. One of my favorite sports figures, LeBron James, falls silent when China comes up. In the new Top Gun movie, the Taiwan and Japanese patches are taken off Maverick's jacket. They're not going to be in Top Gun 2; they were in Top Gun 1. What do you say not to those individuals, but to everyone who has an American spotlight about their responsibility to be candid about the People's Republic of China? SECRETARY POMPEO: Here's our ask: Our ask is if you claim that you care about human rights or social justice or these things, if you make that part of your corporate theology, then you ought to be consistent. And you can't be consistent if you're operating there in China without talking about and acknowledging what the Chinese Communist Party is doing in certain parts of their country - the oppression that's taking place. Look, every business leader has got to make decisions for themselves. They've got to be able to live with the decisions that they make. You highlighted a few. I'd simply ask this: If you run an entity and the United States Government were to tell you you couldn't do something, put a particular symbol in your movie or put a particular name on your menu - if we were to tell you that, you'd say nope, that's not appropriate, and it, of course, would not be appropriate. It seems to me that if you permit the Chinese Communist Party to limit you in that way, it's got to be difficult for you to go home at night. MR HEWITT: Two more questions, Mr. Secretary. (Applause.) Because it is hot and it is warm, and everyone out here has been in the sun for a while. You're a West Point graduate, and as Governor Wilson noted, number one, so this might be tough for you. But we are an, like Athens was, a naval power. America is a naval power. And as like Sparta is, China is a land power. Do we not have to change how we approach defense spending to put more emphasis on our naval resources than on our Army resources? SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, that's tough for an Army guy to say. (Laughter.) MR HEWITT: I know. SECRETARY POMPEO: You're killing me. Look, I'll leave to Secretary Esper the details of this, but I can - here's what I can say. When President Trump set out our National Security Strategy early on in the administration, for the first time we identified China in a way that was fundamentally different than we had done - this isn't partisan - for decades. That was important because that was a signal to all of us, whether it's the State Department or the Defense Department, that we needed to reoriented our - reorient our assets. And so yes, you've seen the Department of Defense begin to do that. These are big things to turn. These budgets are multiyear. It takes a while. But if you look at how Secretary Esper and President Trump are positioning our military capabilities - not just the tactical, operational, and strategic capabilities, but our cyber capabilities, our space capabilities - if you look at how we're thinking about this and spending resources in year two, three, four, and five, I think you'll see that our focus has shifted pretty dramatically. It's not to say that our efforts to protect America from terrorism are behind us. We still have work to do there. But I think this great power challenge that presents itself is something that we have recognized and we begin to make sure that we allocate your money - our taxpayer resources that we have - to the appropriate ends to achieve American security. MR HEWITT: My last question has to do with a former secretary of state who was also an Army man, George Marshall. He gave a speech in 1947 at your alma mater, Harvard, in which he called on all the nations of the world to recognize that the world was in crisis and to choose a side. And he assured them in that famous address that if you chose the American side in (inaudible) Europe, you could count on America. So as you make the appeal you did today, not just to Europe, where it's relatively easy to be outspoken, though Norway has found it not to be outspoken, but to Taiwan and Japan and Vietnam and all of the - Australia, all of the nations of that region - can they rely on America in the way that people opposing the Soviet Union could rely on George Marshall's assurance in 1947? SECRETARY POMPEO: Undoubtedly, undoubtedly, Hugh. The only thing I'll say is when - this language of 'pick a side' does make sense to me, but I think about picking a side differently than picking America or picking China. I think the sides, the division - the shirts and skins, if you will - is between freedom and tyranny. I think that's the decision that we're asking each of these nations to make. (Applause.) And here's the good news of this. The good news is it does take American leadership often in these cases. To your point, they need to know that America will be there for them. I've seen the tide turn. In just - in just these three and half years of our administration, I've watched other nations have less timidity, become more prepared to stand up for their freedoms and for the freedoms of their people. We don't ask them to do this for America. We ask them to do it for their country and for their nation - the freedom and the independence and to protect the rights of their people. And when we do that and we tell them that America will be there, I am very confident in the end that this is a world that with the hard work applied will become one that is governed by a rules-based order, and the freedom of the American people will be secured. MR HEWITT: Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us here today. SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. MR HEWITT: Please join me in thanking the Secretary. (Applause.) SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.

YOUR FACE WILL REPLACE YOUR PASSWORD For a decade, we've been wondering when a 'Minority Report'-style facialrecognition service might arrive into the mainstream. With the arrival of Apple's latest iPhone X here in the next six to eight weeks, this moment may have finally come into being.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For those who missed it, Apple's new technology uses facial recognition to do most of the work, such as unlocking your phone, downloading an app or paying for something in a shop. It works pretty flawlessly, both in brightness or in pitch darkness.</p><p>The company looks set to roll it out to other iPhones, iPads and Mac computers later this year. And where Apple introduces a feature that works, it is often adopted as a standard in wider society.</p><p>Is it the beginning of the end of passwords? Maybe.</p><p>For the moment, however, those uncomfortable with the idea can turn the technology off and still use a passcode on iPhones if they so choose.</p><p>2. YOU'LL BE TOLD MORE OFTEN WHEN YOU'RE HACKED Last year's big EU tech law was the ban on mobile roaming fees in Europe. This year, it's data privacy. From May, companies all across the EU will have to own up right away about being hacked or losing customer data.</p><p>If they don't, or if they try to bury the leak in any way, they face fines of up to (EURO)20m or 4pc of annual turnover. This exercise in transparency should see fairly immediate improvements in datasecurity measures employed by services (online shops, banks, even government agencies) that you use regularly.</p><p>It also may create a rush of news around data breaches in the summer, giving an erroneous impression that 2018 is worse than previous years for companies screwing up your personal data.</p><p>The law, incidentally, is called the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>3. YOU'LL SEE FEWER TV SATELLITE DISHES IN YOUR ESTATE OR RESIDENTIAL ROAD Sky, which is Ireland's biggest commercial TV provider, has promised to let people get its Sky Q television service this year without the need for a satellite dish. Instead, you'll be able to get it over broadband. That should ease tensions with local authorities in urban areas, which often ask residents to take the dishes down.</p><p>4. EXPECT A LOT LESS HYPE OVER ELECTRIC CARS It seems incredible that up until a few months ago Ireland had an official target of 200,000 electric cars on the road by 2020. As we move into 2018, it's somewhere around 3,000 - a pathetic number.</p><p>Despite decent levels of marketing and investment from some of the car brands, Irish people can't hack the low mileage limits or 45-minute refuelling sessions of plug-in vehicles.</p><p>It's futile lecturing us that the majority of our car trips are under 50km - we simply like to know we can go longer if necessary - without a major planning exercise in refuelling strategy.</p><p>The poor performance of electric cars in Ireland is a shame as some of the new models from the likes of Nissan, Renault and BMW have much better, longerrunning batteries. The State has some responsibility here too, if it is serious about wanting fewer petrol and diesel cars on the road. Other countries have given drivers real incentives to make the switch. In Norway, electric cars get access to bus lanes and free parking in cities.</p><p>They also pay no road tolls. As a result, the Scandinavian country has some 135,000 electric cars on its roads, compared with 3,000 here. Both countries have roughly similar populations and levels of car ownership.</p><p>Meanwhile, virtually none of the vehicles purchased by Irish State bodies, institutes or agencies are electric. If Ireland wants more electric cars, it needs to make it happen, rather than hoping it will occur of its own accord.</p><p>5. WATCH FOR GROWING PRESSURE ON FACEBOOK If 2017 saw tensions between governments and social media companies rise, 2018 could see them get even more uncomfortable. With so many people now using Facebook as a utility for news, communication and entertainment, its influence in our lives has reached unforeseen levels.</p><p>In Ireland alone, the online giant has 2.4 million adult users, 1.7 million of whom use it every single day. Each month that passes also sees the amount of time we spend on the service grow.</p><p>But with great power comes great responsibility. Civil authorities are now starting to lean on social networks to take more responsibility for things such as national security and online safety.</p><p>Separately, there is also some pressure on Facebook over quality control around the news sources being widely quoted on its platform. As users, what we might see this year is more activity from the company in filtering (or banning) links that friends try to share with you (or you with them).</p><p>For an accompanying podcast on what to expect in tech in 2018, listen to this week's special edition of 'The Big Tech Show' With Adrian Weckler on Soundcloud, iTunes or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Independent.ie/podcasts\">www.Independent.ie/podcasts</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facial-recognition software, of the type that we saw on our screens with Tom Cruise in 'Minority Report', is going mainstream</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-133166843</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R9T-GCJ1-DY9P-N2NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 2, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The sun was shining, a gentle breeze was blowing and, at a Silicon Valley coffee shop, Rep. Ro Khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject: the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's some more humility out here,\" Khanna (D-Calif.) said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh. Chris Larsen was on his third start-up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley, if not the world.</p><p>\"Realizing people hate your guts has some value,\" he joked.</p><p>For decades, Democrats and Republicans have  hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way.</p><p>Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is  responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.</p><p>On a quiet weekday at a strip-mall coffee shop, the conversation between Khanna and Larsen turned to what went so wrong.</p><p>Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame.</p><p>\"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking.</p><p>Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as  co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district.</p><p>The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable. Boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year, Larsen's net worth had briefly hit $59 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world before the currency's value fell.</p><p>Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow.</p><p>\"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\"</p><p>At some point, Larsen and Khanna worried, something was going to break.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of American capitalism. But it was Donald Trump's election and the pent-up anger it exposed that left America's billionaire class fearful for capitalism's future.</p><h>'Middle of a revolution'</h><p>Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections.</p><p>Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late.</p><p>The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120 million conference center, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions . . . or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\"</p><p>Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p><p>Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution - not a guns revolution - but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said.</p><p>He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective started with 28 students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course.</p><p>\"What the trust surveys say is what I see,\" she said. \"They are really worried about the direction in which the U.S. and the world is heading.\"</p><p>A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading \"Winners Take All,\" a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas's book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government.</p><p>This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He slammed Mark Zuckerberg, taking aim at the Facebook founder's $100 million effort to fix Newark's faltering schools and his $3 billion push to end disease in a generation. \"I'm glad he's trying to get rid of all the diseases, [but] I wish Facebook wasn't a plague,\" Giridharadas said.</p><p>He trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\"</p><p>For many of the students, schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place, Giridharadas's ideas were both energizing and disorienting. Erika Uyterhoeven, a second-year student, recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when Giridharadas was finished.</p><p>\"So, what should we do?\" her colleague asked. \"Is he saying we shouldn't go into banking or consulting?\"</p><p>Added another student: \"There was a palpable sense of personal desperation.\"</p><h>Runaway capitalism</h><p>Khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district. He grew up in an overwhelmingly white, middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. After college and Yale Law School, he moved to Silicon Valley in 2003, hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world.</p><p>In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed - in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2 million.</p><p>\"The best thing that happened to me was that I lost my 2014 election,\" he said. \"Had I won . . . maybe I would've been a traditional neoliberal. It really forced my self-reflection and it pointed out every weakness I ever had.\"</p><p>In California, Khanna's home is a small apartment around the corner from a Dollar Tree, one of only two in his district. His wife and two children live most of the year in Washington, where home values are cheaper.</p><p>His days are split between meetings with billionaires and  his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance.</p><p>A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf.</p><p>The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.</p><p>As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were  eliminating much factory work; online commerce was decimating retail; and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think.</p><p>\"What happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor?\" said Greg Brockman, chairman of OpenAI, a company backed by several Silicon Valley billionaires. Such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research, said Brockman, 30. They could displace a large number of office jobs. Eventually, he said, the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live. Only Andrew Yang, a long-shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur, supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income. But the idea of a \"universal basic income\" was discussed regularly in the valley.</p><p>The prospect was both energizing and terrifying. OpenAI had recently added an ethicist - Brockman sometimes referred to her as a \"philosopher\" - to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations.</p><p>To Brockman, a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat, a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty. \"Once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing, my expectation is that we're going to look back at eating meat as this terrible, immoral thing,\" he said. The same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence. \"We'll look back and say, 'Wow, that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive,' \" he said.</p><h>A 'blueprint' for opportunity</h><p>Khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci-fi fantasy. His focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies.</p><p>The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent.</p><p>On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5 million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below.</p><p>Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a LinkedIn co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year.</p><p>Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of America could take part in the tech revolution.</p><p>The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, was a $100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of America. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said.</p><p>Khanna's blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions.</p><p>Khanna had a different view. He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity.</p><p>Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: Their grandparents had fought in World War II and helped build the country's industrial age economy. Now they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them.</p><p>\"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\"</p><p>Not everyone at the tech gathering was buying Khanna's analysis.</p><p>Atam Rao, a nuclear engineer, told Khanna that he had come to the United States from India 50 years earlier. Rao's son, who founded a successful video-game company in Los Angeles, was born in America. The day after Trump was elected, his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in India, just in case they needed to return someday.</p><p>\"Are we welcome here?\" he said his son asked.</p><p>He believed that Khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country.</p><p>\"They found someone to blame,\" Rao said of Trump and his backers. \"This is not going to be won by logic.\"</p><p>But that wasn't the America Khanna knew. It didn't fit with his experience growing up in suburban Philadelphia or arriving in Silicon Valley, where Indians had become rock stars and CEOs of companies such as Google. And it didn't comport with the results of the 2018 election, he said, now speaking directly to Rao.</p><p>\"The same country that elected Trump just elected the most diverse Congress in the country's history,\" Khanna said.</p><p>Khanna didn't deny the problem of racism, but like Sanders he saw the country's divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism's shortcomings and the economy, not race.</p><p>A few days after the meeting at the Cupertino mansion, Khanna was standing in front of 16,000 amped-up Sanders supporters. The San Francisco skyline rose in front of him and the Golden Gate Bridge spanned the bay behind him.</p><p>In his gray suit and pressed white shirt, the two-term congressman looked a bit out of place - an emissary from establishment Washington crashing someone else's revolution. Khanna gave a brief speech introducing Sanders, who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 Democratic primaries.</p><p>He bashed the billionaire class and its influence over American elections. \"Democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections,\" Sanders yelled in his Brooklyn growl.</p><p>\"We say no to oligarchy,\" he continued. \"Yes to democracy.\"</p><p>Khanna's eyes fixed on Steve Spinner, a big tech investor in Silicon Valley and major fundraiser for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Spinner, who chaired Khanna's congressional win, was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest.</p><p>\"We dragged him out here,\" Khanna said. \"He's about as far from Bernie as you can get.\"</p><p>Many of Khanna's billionaire supporters - even those who worried about capitalism and inequality - seemed genuinely puzzled by Khanna's affection for Sanders.</p><p>For Khanna it was simple: In Sanders, Khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country's most vexing problems: inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism.</p><p>Sanders wasn't a perfect match for Khanna. Sanders didn't really understand the tech industry - though he wasn't calling for the breakup of big tech companies like Warren and some other candidates. Warren's proposal, if executed, would hurt companies in Khanna's district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers.</p><p>Khanna wished Sanders would talk more about the greatness of the American economy and the power of the tech industry, when properly taxed and regulated, to lift people out of poverty. But on that score Khanna believed he could help Sanders.</p><p>\"We can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue,\" Khanna said. \"But I have no doubt that if Bernie Sanders was in the White House, he'd wake up every day thinking, 'How do I solve structural inequality in America?' ''</p><p>The 77-year-old socialist's speech had passed the one-hour mark and the crowd was still laughing, cheering, hooting and shouting.</p><p>\"We're probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations,\" Sanders said.</p><p>A voice in the crowd screamed an expletive.</p><p>\"That's okay,\" Sanders continued, \"I don't need, and we don't want, their support.\"</p><p>The congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd, which stretched to the back of the park. Khanna saw Sanders's revolution as an imperfect solution to a near-impossible problem. For now, though, it was the best he could find.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:greg.jaffe@washpost.com\">greg.jaffe@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-3e06ef90-5ed8-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VXX-GR11-DXXY-3194-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3095\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 21, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The sun was shining, a gentle breeze was blowing and, at a Silicon Valley coffee shop, Rep. Ro Khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject: the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's some more humility out here,\" Khanna (D-Calif.) said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh. Chris Larsen was on his third start-up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley, if not the world.</p><p>\"Realizing people hate your guts has some value,\" he joked.</p><p>For decades, Democrats and Republicans have  hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way.</p><p>Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is  responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.</p><p>On a quiet weekday at a strip-mall coffee shop, the conversation between Khanna and Larsen turned to what went so wrong.</p><p>Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame.</p><p>\"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking.</p><p>Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as  co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district.</p><p>The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable. Boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year, Larsen's net worth had briefly hit $59 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world before the currency's value fell.</p><p>Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow.</p><p>\"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\"</p><p>At some point, Larsen and Khanna worried, something was going to break.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of American capitalism. But it was Donald Trump's election and the pent-up anger it exposed that left America's billionaire class fearful for capitalism's future.</p><p>          'Middle of a revolution'          </p><p>Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections.</p><p>Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late.</p><p>The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120 million conference center, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions . . . or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\"</p><p>Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p><p>Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution - not a guns revolution - but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said.</p><p>He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective started with 28 students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course.</p><p>\"What the trust surveys say is what I see,\" she said. \"They are really worried about the direction in which the U.S. and the world is heading.\"</p><p>A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading \"Winners Take All,\" a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas's book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government.</p><p>This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He slammed Mark Zuckerberg, taking aim at the Facebook founder's $100 million effort to fix Newark's faltering schools and his $3 billion push to end disease in a generation. \"I'm glad he's trying to get rid of all the diseases, [but] I wish Facebook wasn't a plague,\" Giridharadas said.</p><p>He trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\"</p><p>For many of the students, schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place, Giridharadas's ideas were both energizing and disorienting. Erika Uyterhoeven, a second-year student, recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when Giridharadas was finished.</p><p>\"So, what should we do?\" her colleague asked. \"Is he saying we shouldn't go into banking or consulting?\"</p><p>Added another student: \"There was a palpable sense of personal desperation.\"</p><p>          Runaway capitalism          </p><p>Khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district. He grew up in an overwhelmingly white, middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. After college and Yale Law School, he moved to Silicon Valley in 2003, hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world.</p><p>In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed - in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2 million.</p><p>\"The best thing that happened to me was that I lost my 2014 election,\" he said. \"Had I won . . . maybe I would've been a traditional neoliberal. It really forced my self-reflection and it pointed out every weakness I ever had.\"</p><p>In California, Khanna's home is a small apartment around the corner from a Dollar Tree, one of only two in his district. His wife and two children live most of the year in Washington, where home values are cheaper.</p><p>His days are split between meetings with billionaires and  his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance.</p><p>A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf.</p><p>The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.</p><p>As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were  eliminating much factory work; online commerce was decimating retail; and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think.</p><p>\"What happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor?\" said Greg Brockman, chairman of OpenAI, a company backed by several Silicon Valley billionaires. Such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research, said Brockman, 30. They could displace a large number of office jobs. Eventually, he said, the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live. Only Andrew Yang, a long-shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur, supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income. But the idea of a \"universal basic income\" was discussed regularly in the valley.</p><p>The prospect was both energizing and terrifying. OpenAI had recently added an ethicist - Brockman sometimes referred to her as a \"philosopher\" - to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations.</p><p>To Brockman, a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat, a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty. \"Once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing, my expectation is that we're going to look back at eating meat as this terrible, immoral thing,\" he said. The same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence. \"We'll look back and say, 'Wow, that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive,' \" he said.</p><p>          A 'blueprint' for opportunity          </p><p>Khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci-fi fantasy. His focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies.</p><p>The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent.</p><p>On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5 million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below.</p><p>Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a LinkedIn co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year.</p><p>Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of America could take part in the tech revolution.</p><p>The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, was a $100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of America. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said.</p><p>Khanna's blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions.</p><p>Khanna had a different view. He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity.</p><p>Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: Their grandparents had fought in World War II and helped build the country's industrial age economy. Now they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them.</p><p>\"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\"</p><p>Not everyone at the tech gathering was buying Khanna's analysis.</p><p>Atam Rao, a nuclear engineer, told Khanna that he had come to the United States from India 50 years earlier. Rao's son, who founded a successful video-game company in Los Angeles, was born in America. The day after Trump was elected, his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in India, just in case they needed to return someday.</p><p>\"Are we welcome here?\" he said his son asked.</p><p>He believed that Khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country.</p><p>\"They found someone to blame,\" Rao said of Trump and his backers. \"This is not going to be won by logic.\"</p><p>But that wasn't the America Khanna knew. It didn't fit with his experience growing up in suburban Philadelphia or arriving in Silicon Valley, where Indians had become rock stars and CEOs of companies such as Google. And it didn't comport with the results of the 2018 election, he said, now speaking directly to Rao.</p><p>\"The same country that elected Trump just elected the most diverse Congress in the country's history,\" Khanna said.</p><p>Khanna didn't deny the problem of racism, but like Sanders he saw the country's divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism's shortcomings and the economy, not race.</p><p>A few days after the meeting at the Cupertino mansion, Khanna was standing in front of 16,000 amped-up Sanders supporters. The San Francisco skyline rose in front of him and the Golden Gate Bridge spanned the bay behind him.</p><p>In his gray suit and pressed white shirt, the two-term congressman looked a bit out of place - an emissary from establishment Washington crashing someone else's revolution. Khanna gave a brief speech introducing Sanders, who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 Democratic primaries.</p><p>He bashed the billionaire class and its influence over American elections. \"Democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections,\" Sanders yelled in his Brooklyn growl.</p><p>\"We say no to oligarchy,\" he continued. \"Yes to democracy.\"</p><p>Khanna's eyes fixed on Steve Spinner, a big tech investor in Silicon Valley and major fundraiser for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Spinner, who chaired Khanna's congressional win, was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest.</p><p>\"We dragged him out here,\" Khanna said. \"He's about as far from Bernie as you can get.\"</p><p>Many of Khanna's billionaire supporters - even those who worried about capitalism and inequality - seemed genuinely puzzled by Khanna's affection for Sanders.</p><p>For Khanna it was simple: In Sanders, Khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country's most vexing problems: inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism.</p><p>Sanders wasn't a perfect match for Khanna. Sanders didn't really understand the tech industry - though he wasn't calling for the breakup of big tech companies like Warren and some other candidates. Warren's proposal, if executed, would hurt companies in Khanna's district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers.</p><p>Khanna wished Sanders would talk more about the greatness of the American economy and the power of the tech industry, when properly taxed and regulated, to lift people out of poverty. But on that score Khanna believed he could help Sanders.</p><p>\"We can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue,\" Khanna said. \"But I have no doubt that if Bernie Sanders was in the White House, he'd wake up every day thinking, 'How do I solve structural inequality in America?' ''</p><p>The 77-year-old socialist's speech had passed the one-hour mark and the crowd was still laughing, cheering, hooting and shouting.</p><p>\"We're probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations,\" Sanders said.</p><p>A voice in the crowd screamed an expletive.</p><p>\"That's okay,\" Sanders continued, \"I don't need, and we don't want, their support.\"</p><p>The congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd, which stretched to the back of the park. Khanna saw Sanders's revolution as an imperfect solution to a near-impossible problem. For now, though, it was the best he could find.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:greg.jaffe@washpost.com\">greg.jaffe@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-3e06ef905ed811e9bfad36a7eb36cb60</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VXW-CWX1-DYX1-H194-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3107\"/><timeReceived>3:37 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 21, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The sun was shining, a gentle breeze was blowing and, at a Silicon Valley coffee shop, Rep. Ro Khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject: the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's some more humility out here,\" Khanna (D-Calif.) said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh. Chris Larsen was on his third start-up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley, if not the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Realizing people hate your guts has some value,\" he joked.</p><p>For decades, Democrats and Republicans have hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way.</p><p>Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.</p><p>On a quiet weekday at a strip-mall coffee shop, the conversation between Khanna and Larsen turned to what went so wrong.</p><p>Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame.</p><p>\"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking.</p><p>Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district.</p><p>The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable.</p><p>Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow.</p><p>\"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Middle of a revolution'</emphasis></p><p>Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections.</p><p>Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late.</p><p>The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120 million conference center, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions . . . or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\"</p><p>Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p><p>Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution - not a guns revolution - but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said.</p><p>He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective had started with 28 students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course.</p><p>A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading \"Winners Take All,\" a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas's book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have had eluded a plodding and divided government.</p><p>This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Runaway capitalism</emphasis></p><p>In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed - in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2 million.</p><p>His days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance.</p><p>A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf.</p><p>The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.</p><p>As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were eliminating much factory work; online commerce was decimating retail; and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A 'blueprint' for opportunity</emphasis></p><p>Khanna's focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies.</p><p>The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent.</p><p>On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5 million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below.</p><p>Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a LinkedIn co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year.</p><p>Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of America could take part in the country's tech revolution.</p><p>The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, was a $100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of America. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said.</p><p>Khanna's blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions.</p><p>Khanna had a different view. He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity.</p><p>Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: Their grandparents had fought in World War II and helped build the country's industrial age economy. Now they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them.</p><p>\"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\"</p><p>Not everyone at the tech gathering was buying Khanna's analysis.</p><p>Atam Rao, a nuclear engineer, told Khanna that he had come to the United States from India 50 years earlier. Rao's son, who founded a successful video-game company in Los Angeles, was born in America. The day after Trump was elected, his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in India, just in case they needed to return someday.</p><p>\"Are we welcome here?\" he said his son asked.</p><p>He believed that Khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country.</p><p>But that wasn't the America Khanna knew. It didn't fit with his experience growing up in suburban Philadelphia or arriving in Silicon Valley, where Indians had become rock stars and CEOs of companies such as Google. And it didn't comport with the results of the 2018 election, he said, now speaking directly to Rao.</p><p>\"The same country that elected Trump just elected the most diverse Congress in the country's history,\" Khanna said.</p><p>Khanna didn't deny the problem of racism, but like Sanders he saw the country's divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism's shortcomings and the economy, not race.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20190428Ar09800</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0D-94X1-DYJT-2395-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1964\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 28, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

But tensions are the default state at any company that has been acquired, and Systrom and Krieger had navigated those waters ably for six years.</p><p><br/> High-level corporate executive departures generally - and Facebook departures in particular - are stage-managed to minimize drama. A replacement leader is identified and named internally. A public-relations plan is developed and put into action. An anodyne blog post announces the news. At Facebook, the executive's departure is accompanied by well wishes, posted as status updates from Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and others.<br/> The Instagram founders' exit, by contrast, was as close as Facebook has ever come to the flight attendant who chugged a beer and pulled the emergency chute on his final day of work. The most striking thing in the immediate aftermath was the chaos: spokespeople at Facebook and Instagram didn't know what was going on, beyond the brief initial story published in the New York Times by Mike Isaac.<br/> Eventually, the choreography of the exit began to resemble something more Facebook-like. The founders posted a farewell note to the Instagram blog. (In a next-level stunt, Systrom used the corporate blog to very nearly confirm that he would form a new company with Krieger.) Zuckerberg offered a few words - though he posted nothing to his profile. Systrom and Krieger later tweeted their farewells, and posted valedictory 'grams. None of that could cover up for the fact that it all had been a rush job.<br/> (A rush job, incidentally, that created other rush jobs: The Wall Street Journal and Fast Company both had recent interviews with the founders in the can, and hustled them up before their words could go entirely stale.)<br/> As someone who knows the founders told me, Systrom and Krieger are very low-drama executives. So why leave in such dramatic fashion? What invisible line were they asked to cross? I suspect we'll find out eventually. (And if you know - or just have a theory - I'm all ears.)<br/> So what do we know for sure? And what does it tell us about the future?<br/> Most of the reporting done today traces that familiar narrative from post-acquisition life: simmering tensions that suddenly boiled over. As Kurt Wagner and Kara Swisher reported at Recode, a recent decision to remove Instagram branding from photos that are reshared to Facebook was among the slights that worsened the founders' relationship with their parent company.<br/> Deepa Seetharaman's account of how these tensions grew is the most definitive one I read today. Multiple reports today name the most proximate cause of the founders' exit as Zuckerberg's decision this spring to reorganize all product divisions under Cox, to whom Systrom would now report. This added a complicating layer between Systrom and Zuckerberg at a time when Instagram has become more important to Facebook's future than ever before.<br/> Here's Seetharaman:<br/> Mr. Systrom had previously technically reported to Mike Schroepfer, Facebook's chief technology officer, but that reporting structure wasn't widely known. Some within Instagram believed the new structure would give Mr. Systrom much less access to Mr. Zuckerberg, with whom he previously interacted frequently. \"It was always Kevin and Mark,\" said a person familiar with the situation.<br/> At the same time, a death-by-a-thousand-cuts dynamic was playing out between Instagram and its parent company. For years, Facebook had left Instagram more or less alone. Facebook was in hyper-growth mode, printing money thanks to its lucrative News Feed advertisements, and Zuckerberg was content to let his $1 billion acquisition grow at its own pace.<br/> Then Facebook hit its saturation point in North America, the sharing of original posts declined, and a series of crises related to the 2016 US presidential election battered its image. Only Instagram survived with its reputation mostly intact. As the crown jewel in Facebook's product lineup, it became the subject of regular meddling from the parent organization. (My colleague Chris Welch rounds up some of the most prominent examples here.)<br/> Some of the battles can appear petty from the outside. The decision to strip Instagram attribution from posts that are re-shared to Facebook, which took place earlier this year, was a very big deal to Systrom, I'm told. At the same time, he was fighting off all manner of Zuckerberg incursions - badged notifications inside Instagram begging people to open Facebook being maybe the most prominent example. None of them meaningfully improved Instagram; they were simply the cost of being acquired.<br/> Every ask leads to another one, and it seems clear Systrom and Krieger were spending an increasing amount of time asking themselves what they could live with. As Ben Thompson says, the founders' fate was sealed the day they sold to Facebook. But still: it didn't have to end like this.<br/> And what does it mean? For starters, this is the end of Instagram as we know it. Systrom and Krieger were deeply involved in day-to-day product decisions, and retained an unusual degree of autonomy over the company. For years, they were careful to the point of being obstinate. Even as they began to expand Instagram's suite of offerings, they remained deeply cautious. (Features for creating groups of \"favorites\" and a standalone messaging app have been in testing for 15 months and 10 months, respectively.)<br/> Many talented employees remain at Instagram, of course. It's a coveted job at Facebook, not least because of its ritzy new office in downtown San Francisco. Robby Stein and Vishal Shah, both directors of product management, and Ian Spalter, who leads design efforts, are frequently mentioned as rising stars in the organization. Adam Mosseri, who formerly ran the News Feed, is similarly well liked. But increasingly, their task will be to build a front end for Facebook's advertising network. The autonomy Instagram once enjoyed is gone.<br/> The founders' hasty departure leaves many projects in flux. IGTV, a pet project of Systrom's that was nearly killed for fear that it competed too closely with Facebook Watch, could be strangled in its crib. (It has been slow to take off.) As I first reported earlier this month, Instagram is building a standalone shopping app as well. The fate of Instagram Direct will have to be decided as well.<br/> Systrom - a new father - and Krieger will take some time off from tech, though one suspects not too much. Systrom has interviews scheduled with The Information and Wired in coming weeks, and perhaps we'll learn more about his departure then. (It seems likelier he'll demure. But maybe not!)<br/> Nothing can change the fact that this was an extraordinary exit, and one that has left Facebook employees reeling. Some unknown thing changed for the founders this week, and it pushed them out the door months or even years before they were ready. Prior to this week, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger were nowhere done building Instagram. And whatever they build next will have Mark Zuckerberg's full attention. Democracy<br/> Inside the private Justice Department meeting that could lead to new investigations of Facebook, Google and other tech giants<br/> Brian Fung and Tony Romm recap the meeting between Jeff Sessions and a group of attorneys general on the subject of heightened scrutiny for tech companies. It sounds like some kind of action is forthcoming:<br/> Most in the meeting agreed that the Justice Department would probably play a role in any legal action against the tech industry. Still, much of the group's momentum now appears to be driven by an emerging multistate inquiry - not the Justice Department - with Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson expected to coordinate the attorneys general's conversation.<br/> \"[The] AGs are really focused on understanding more as to what consumers are truly consenting to and what they may not know is going on with their data,\" Racine said in an interview.<br/>Google CEO Sundar Pichai to Meet With Top GOP Lawmakers<br/> Sundar Pichai has agreed to go to Washington, but just for a private meeting with Republican lawmakers.<br/>Facebook Has Removed More Than A Dozen Big Conservative And Liberal Political Pages<br/>Facebook found some fake accounts posting viral political content and shut down the related pages, Craig Silverman reports. They caught some big fish here, including the home of a reporter who got more engagement than any other on all of Facebook:<br/>Facebook has removed over a dozen American hyperpartisan liberal and conservative pages with more than 30 million combined fans after discovering they were administered by the same fake account and were in violation of policies against spamming, a company spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.<br/> All of the removed pages had recently, and almost exclusively, been promoting links to LifeZette.com, the conservative website founded by Fox News host Laura Ingraham. It was sold last year to Canadian billionaire Daryl Katz, though Ingraham maintains a minority stake in the company, according to CNN. LifeZette's content continues to be heavily promoted on Ingraham's social media accounts. (Her Facebook page and the main LifeZette page were not removed by Facebook. The company did not respond to requests for comment.)<br/> Big Tech's Business Model Is Broken, Report Says<br/> Former Facebook employee Dipayan Ghosh has a new report out arguing that Silicon Valley should be subject to tougher regulation, particularly around acquiring users, Deepa Seetharaman reports:<br/> Over the course of the year, the tech companies have announced changes to their privacy practices and have tried to take steps to shore up user trust. But those changes don't go far enough to address the deeper problems of the platforms, which are still reliant on maintaining user attention, according to Messrs. Ghosh and Scott, who wrote a separate report in January critical of the big tech companies.<br/> \"I think we both felt at the beginning of the year, there was potential to talk to the industry,\" said Mr. Ghosh, who previously served as a White House technology adviser under President Barack Obama. \"We are increasingly disillusioned now.\"<br/> Safari's \"Siri Suggested\" Search Results Highlighted Conspiracy Sites And Fake News<br/> Et tu, Safari?

The problem is unfettered data exploitation and its potential deleterious consequences - among them, unequal consumer treatment, financial fraud, identity theft, manipulative marketing and discrimination.<br/> In other words, asking companies whose business models revolve around exploiting data-based consumer-influence techniques to explain their privacy policies seems about as useful as asking sharks to hold forth on veganism.<br/>Google Names New Privacy Chief, Offers Framework for Regulation<br/> Keith Enright is Google's new chief privacy officer, arriving just as the company faces potential federal regulation for its handling of data.<br/> #ElectionWatch: Migration to Gab in Brazil<br/> Brazilians are embracing far-right Twitter clone Gab, according to the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.<br/> The migration to Gab started with Twitter hashtags. Hashtags promoting Gab appeared a few days after Twitter suspended both Brazilian accounts and that of right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The most popular hashtag, #MeSegueNoGab (Follow Me on Gab), was tweeted 25,000 times between August 20 and 23 and trended in Brazil.<br/> The hashtag was championed by Twitter profiles historically linked to Jair Bolsonaro. Among the main influencers sharing the hashtag were the Movimento Brasil Conservador (Conservative Brazil Movement), and hyper-partisan websites Conexao Politica and Portal Terca Livre. There was no evidence of automated amplification.<br/> Elsewhere<br/>Twitter releases new policy to ban dehumanizing speech<br/>Twitter's new policy will ban posts that \"dehumanize anyone based on membership in an identifiable group,\" even if it's not in a tweet that is targeting someone for abuse. In a novel twist, Twitter is soliciting feedback about the policy and how it will be implemented.<br/> How Twitter's New Safety Policies Are Created<br/> Louise Matsakis talks to Del Harvey about the new rules:<br/> Generally speaking, my view is that if there is a behavior that is likely to result in real-world harm we really should be looking at what are the guardrails around something like that. How can we do a good job of making sure that we are taking our role seriously in terms of trying to protect people?<br/> Part of the reason I think we're talking about this now is we've made a lot of changes over the last couple of years to really improve our enforcement options past just suspension. Some time ago, you were suspended or you were not suspended. That was pretty much all we had. We've tried to add a lot of new enforcement options. Now that we have some of those additional options, and now that we're working on developing more, it gives us the opportunity to really dig into some areas that were maybe grey areas in the past that we didn't have policy coverage for.<br/> Why Instagram's founders are resigning: independence from Facebook weakened<br/> Josh Constine's post about #Krexit includes these nuggets: Instagram's director of public policy, Nicole Jackson Colaco, and Instagram's AR/Camera product lead, Keith Peiris, both left earlier this year.<br/>Facebook's Carolyn Everson: Rebuilding Trust Is Company's 'Total Focus'<br/> Adweek interviewed Facebook's global head of marketing about trust:<br/> EVERSON: The way we think about it is it's a series of actions that you do every single day, just like if it was a personal relationship. That's how we talk about it internally. When you're sitting with [Facebook chief product officer] Chris [Cox] and [Facebook CEO] Mark [Zuckerberg], it's like, how do you build trust with a friend, a partner, a spouse? You build it every day by actually doing what you say, being very transparent, being humble, having full acceptance of responsibility.<br/> If I added up all the product things that we have done, everything from changing privacy settings to doing more education to consumers to giving them full control over how their data is being used to saying that if you want to take all your photos out of Facebook and move them out, you can do that.

If passed, it will do the opposite of restoring anything resembling freedom \u2014 it will repeal the current net neutrality rules which were enacted to ensure that Americans would have equal access to the Internet. If you're reading this, chances are you're already interested in the topic. Still, some quick background: Renamed 'Open Internet' a while back, net neutrality provided a regulatory framework that specifically prohibited: Blocking: Broadband providers may not block access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices. </p><p>Throttling: Broadband providers may not deliberately target some lawful Internet traffic to be delivered to users more slowly than other traffic. Paid prioritization: Broadband providers may not favor some Internet traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind. Internet service providers are also banned from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates. In its place the FCC is proposing to 'Restore Internet Freedom' as follows: Reinstate the 'information service' classification of broadband Internet access service first established on a bipartisan basis during the Clinton Administration. Restore the determination that mobile broadband is not a 'commercial mobile service' subject to heavy-handed regulation. Restore the authority of the nation's most experienced cop on the privacy beat - the Federal Trade Commission - to police the privacy practices of ISPs.What it means for agencies, advertisers and marketersWe'll get to the winners and losers below \u2014 and there will be plenty of each \u2014 but as something of a silver lining, this regulatory shift would open up a wide-range of opportunities for agencies, advertisers and marketers. This could be a perfect opportunity to pair programmatic creative with programmatic media buying. There will be hundreds of different rate plans targeted at specific cohorts. There will also be opportunities to create new consumer and brand experiences that include 'unlimited' bandwidth or 'free' bandwidth offers. The restoration of this version of 'Internet freedom' will change the media distribution landscape dramatically. It will be the perfect place for new creative ad units and offers. Think about how your brand can be positioned as a trusted, needed, content companion. It's an unintended consequence, but the FCC is about to give a lot of smart marketers an opportunity to shine. About those winners and losers, though: this is where the silver lining begins to tarnish.WinnersBig Internet service providers and wireless carriers such as\u00a0Comcast,\u00a0Verizon, AT...etc., come out on top. The bigger you are, the happier this makes you. These organizations will be able to craft any kind of data packages that the market will bear. They will be able to throttle bandwidth, lie about unlimited plans, favor big payer or affiliate partner traffic over competitive traffic. (Imagine Comcast favoring Xfinity over Netflix or throttling down your bandwidth if you were watching Star Trek: Discovery on CBS All Access.) Pricing will not be market driven; most ISPs are de facto monopolies in their specific territories. Alcatel-Lucent, Broadcom, Cisco, Corning, Ericsson, IBM, Intel,\u00a0NokiaSolutions and Networks,\u00a0Panasonic\u00a0Corporation of North America,\u00a0Qualcomm\u00a0and 50-plus other tech companies who signed the original letter against Title II (which the FCC is planning to repeal as well) also come out on top. As do lawyers, especially attorneys for well, just about everybody involved.LosersNetflix and every other content provider. The goal of net neutrality was to ensure that Comcast did not favor delivery of its own content over competitive content such as Netflix. Or Amazon. Or\u00a0Hulu. Content providers who do not own their own distribution are now at serious risk. The list of losers is long: Dropbox, Ebay, Facebook,\u00a0Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vonage Holdings Corp., Yahoo! Inc. and about 150 other companies that\u00a0signed this letter in favor of net neutrality\u00a0are among them. Less friction for consumers means better business for big tech. Although, it will be interesting to see whether or not big tech likes this particular recipe for restoring Internet freedom. They may. Small businesses and start-ups. If you can't afford high-speed bandwidth, too bad. If your start-up uses lots of data, or its new augmented reality app requires consumers to have access to enough bandwidth to use it, too bad. If fill-in-the-blank needs equal access to the Internet, too bad. If your online service competes with an online service that the big telecoms or ISPs favor, too bad. You. If you're a normal person and you want access to the Internet, get ready for all kinds of airline industry-style charges. You'll either accept a slower connection or pay extra for going over a threshold on your unlimited data plan. In practice, you're likely to get amazing speed and service for video content you don't care about and terrible service while trying to use the things you really want. The solution pay more.A few closing thoughtsI am not advocating for any specific type of government involvement with the Internet. I think government has proven that it has no business being in any business. But I believe we should govern America for the best possible GDP (as opposed to governing to enrich a big few big corporations). Al Gore may not have invented the Internet, but his metaphor about it being an information super-highway was pretty good. Imagine an America where a private company could close the left-lane of I-95 between NY and Hartford because they didn't have the money to maintain it, or worse, wanted to use it for themselves and their friends. How would that affect commerce on the I-95 corridor? Our world is digital - all digital. To make the most of it, my delivery truck and your delivery truck should have equal access to the same highway system and connecting roads. Just like we do in the physical world. Lastly, this is a huge topic that will impact every person in the United States. It's worth some of your time to go a bit deeper and to decide for yourself how the 'Restoring Internet Freedom' act is going to change your life - because it absolutely will.

The remedy for hateful and offensive remarks, that 1990s-vintage argument went, was more speech--or logging off.</p><p>This principle, which can be traced back through the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas and John Stuart Mill, was nicely captured in the U.S. Supreme Court's 1997 decision striking down certain speech-chilling provisions of the Communications Decency Act. \"Through the use of chat rooms,\" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, \"any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox. Through the use of Web pages, mail exploders, and newsgroups, the same individual can become a pamphleteer.\"</p><p>A generation later, Stevens' argument has been not merely discarded. It has been inverted.</p><p>Politicians now insist that the internet should be subject to increased regulations precisely because it allows that hypothetical town crier to speak with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any physical soapbox. The possibility of free-wheeling online discussions has been transformed, in other words, from virtue to vice. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube increasingly face demands that they restrict content. In some cases the demands are effected through public pressure, in others through outright government censorship.</p><p>The movement to stifle online expression is still in its early stages, but it represents a fundamental threat to the principles that have allowed the internet as we know it to grow and thrive. If these efforts continue, we may soon see the end of the free and open web.</p><p>EUROPE VS. BIG TECH</p><p>AT THE VANGUARD of the efforts to restrict online speech are, ironically, Western nations that have historically prized free expression--in particular, the European Union.</p><p>In March, members of the European Parliament approved a Copyright Directive. What's known as Article 13 of the measure (renumbered as Article 17 in the final version) will require technology companies to impose \"upload filters\" to scan user-provided content and remove material viewed as unlawful. If a service provider fails to delete \"copyright-protected works and other subject matter,\" the text says, it \"shall be liable for unauthorized acts of communication.\"</p><p>Internet pioneer Vint Cerf, World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder John Gilmore, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, and dozens of other prominent technologists denounced Article 13 as \"an unprecedented step towards the transformation of the Internet from an open platform for sharing and innovation, into a tool for the automated surveillance and control of its users.\"</p><p>Their arguments failed. An amendment that would have removed the upload filter requirement from the Copyright Directive was defeated by five votes.</p><p>In the short term, that will probably grant an unintended competitive advantage to large U.S.-based companies such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter, which possess the resources to devise, test, and implement automatic filtering technologies. Smaller startups will find compliance more of a challenge. Nonprofit efforts such as Wikipedia and websites run by individuals are likely to shoulder even greater burdens.</p><p>Other E.U. measures include last year's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposed new rules on how businesses can handle and use user data, and this year's socalled platform-to-business rules, announced in draft form in February. The latter step is less known but arguably reaches further: Slated to take effect in February 2020, these regulations will control the business practices of \"online platforms,\" including search engines, voice assistants, app stores, online marketplaces, price comparison tools, and some social media applications. They will be subject to new rules, including a ban on such \"unfair practices\" as suspending a user's account without explanation.</p><p>The French government applauded the draft rules in a statement, saying that the E.U. will now be able to \"steer the market in the right direction\"--though what the \"right direction\" is was left unsaid--while lamenting that they do not go further by regulating electronic devices too.</p><p>PRIVATIZING CENSORSHIP</p><p>IF BREXIT ACTUALLY happens and the U.K. manages to extricate itself from the European Union, Britain's internet users and businesses will be fortunate to escape the full impact of these efforts. But Westminster's elite have not been idle.</p><p>In April, the British government published a proposal, the \"Online Harms White Paper,\" that echoes the approach of the E.U. Copyright Directive by holding tech companies, in particular social media platforms, liable for what their users post or upload. Under such a legal regime, internet censorship would be effectively privatized, as businesses would have no choice but to monitor and restrict users.</p><p>Among the online \"harms\" the U.K. proposes to outlaw are \"extremist content,\" \"disinformation,\" \"violent content,\" and \"trolling,\" which could include anything from what a government agency decrees to be fake news to remarks critical of the Prophet Muhammad. Another offensive category is \"glamorization of weapons,\" which invites questions about how it may be applied to venerable British institutions like the National Museum of Arms and Armour, the nation's oldest museum.</p><p>In an April op-ed for CNN, Jeremy Wright, the U.K.'s secretary of state for digital, culture, media, and sport, argued for this adventure in online censorship by likening, without irony, adult internet users to young children. \"It is similar to the principle that when you take your child to a playground, you trust that the builder made sure the equipment was safe and that no harm will come to them,\" Wright wrote.</p><p>The U.K.'s free market Adam Smith Institute calls the \"Online Harms White Paper\" illiberal and incompatible with English principles of freedom: \"This proposal is about preventing Internet users from engaging in knowing and voluntary speech, and it's about recruiting vast armies of private sector policemen to patrol their thoughts.\"</p><p>Perhaps most problematic, the Adam Smith Institute points out, is that the U.K. proposes to restrict political speech that remains legal elsewhere in the English-speaking world. It is no exaggeration to say that \"glamorization of weapons\" is a popular hobby in the United States--and is fully protected by the American First and Second Amendments.</p><p>Other nations are edging in the same illiberal direction. Soon after the Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque massacre that killed 51 people, Australia enacted a new law punishing the publication or hosting of \"abhorrent violent material\" with up to three years in prison. According to the law, it \"is immaterial whether the hosting service is provided within or outside Australia.\"</p><p>Read broadly, this suggests that executives of U.S. and other foreign hosting services--at least those failing to strictly censor their services for Australian audiences--could face legal peril if they visited Sydney on vacation. The law also allows television stations to broadcast violent material while prohibiting Twitter users from posting an identical video online.</p><p>That was too much even for Australia's Labor Party. \"There needs to be proper consultation with not just the social media sector but also traditional media, who are also caught up by this bill and whose legitimate journalism and online news sites will also be impacted on by these laws,\" said Mark Dreyfus, a Labor representative and former attorney general, during the parliamentary debate. Dreyfus warned the law was being rushed through Parliament for political reasons \"as this chaotic and desperate government careen[ed] toward\" an election this spring.</p><p>For his part, New Zealand's Chief Censor David Shanksyes, this is an actual government title--ruled that the video recorded by the Christchurch shooter and his accompanying manifesto both fell under the category of \"objectionable\" material and would be illegal to watch or read. The censorship office's classification decision said the manifesto \"promotes and encourages acts of terrorism in a way that is likely to be persuasive to its intended audience.\" Merely viewing the document in electronic form, even if it is not downloaded to local storage, is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p><p>It is possible that New Zealand's censorship will prevent further extremist violence. But it is more likely that a formal ban will turn the Christchurch shooter into a kind of free speech martyr, bringing more attention to his loathsome ideology. Forbidden ideas have a tendency to draw the curious and the untethered.</p><p>THE UNITED STATES OF DEPLATFORMING</p><p>SO FAR, AT least, the U.S. government has yet to appoint a chief censor. But Silicon Valley's coastal elites have been eager to volunteer their services gratis.</p><p>The last year has marked a dispiriting new low in the \"deplatforming,\" or banning from various online channels, of dissident voices. The ax fell on Infowars' Alex Jones, actor James Woods, the editorial director of AntiWar.com, the director of the Ron Paul Institute, and radio talk show host Jesse Kelly. (Some of these accounts have since been reinstated.)</p><p>Lawmakers have encouraged these social media bans. Congressional hearings have been called to interrogate tech execs on how their products are being used. Last August, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) urged an even broader crackdown, proclaiming on Twitter that \"the survival of our democracy depends on it.\"</p><p>Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, must have been listening. In March, Thompson sent a letter to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Microsoft insisting that they remove \"toxic and violent\" content, even if it is legal to distribute in the United States. (The platforms already prohibit illegal content.) If the companies are \"unwilling\" to do so voluntarily, Thompson warned, Congress will \"consider policies\" to compel their cooperation. Left unexplained was how any such requirement could comply with the First Amendment.</p><p>The Fight Online SexTrafficking Act, better known as FOSTA, ended the federal government's laissez faire approach to internet companies when it was enacted in April 2018. Executives are now criminally liable if they own, manage, or operate a service \"with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person.\" The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of FOSTA, saying it muzzles constitutionally protected speech and is not tailored enough to comply with the First Amendment.</p><p>THE WORLD'S MOST EFFECTIVE CENSOR</p><p>WHATEVER THREATS FROM constitutionally challenged politicians the United States faces, it remains a beacon of freedom compared to China, which can claim the dubious honor of most effective internet censor in the world. Social media apps are blocked, political content is restricted, and activists and journalists who document human rights abuses may be arrested and held in lengthy pretrial detention. Anonymity is impeded, with real names required.</p><p>The country's constitution says that \"Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration.\" But the reality is that the internet in China is almost entirely subservient to government whims.</p><p>As Freedom House, a nonprofit group advocating for political freedom, reports, \"websites and social media accounts are subject to deletion or closure at the request of censorship authorities, and Internet companies are required to proactively monitor and delete problematic content or face punishment.\" In addition, \"officials systematically instruct Internet outlets to amplify content from state media and downplay news, even from some state-affiliated media, that might generate public criticism of the government.\" Hundreds of popular websites are blocked by the country, including Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Flickr, Tumblr, Dropbox, Instagram, Sound-Cloud, WordPress, and Pinterest.</p><p>In 2017, China reinforced its control of the web with a law that increased censorship rules and, more worryingly, required that user data be stored on the Chinese mainland. \"Data localization,\" as it's called, means that sensitive personal records will be easily available to police and intelligence agencies. U.S.-based companies such as Airbnb and Evernote dutifully moved Chinese user data to state-controlled companies. Last year Apple announced, without elaboration, that it was shifting iCloud operations for all its mainland Chinese customers to a government-owned local partner, Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry.</p><p>China is not alone in its efforts to control the internet. Instead, it is leading the way among authoritarian nations. Russia and Nigeria now have similar, though less comprehensive, data localization laws.</p><p>GETTING BACK TO OUR ROOTS</p><p>WHAT NEARLY ALL of these extrusions of governmental interference have in common is that they focus their attention on the large internet companies that act as common platforms.</p><p>A small number of massive, slow-moving regulatory targets is a delightful state of affairs, at least from the perspective of Brussels or Beijing. It's far easier to pressure a few huge multinationals equipped with risk-averse legal departments than it is to control millions of unpredictable internet users, some of whom are certain to ignore bureaucratic diktats--or to invent creative ways to circumvent them.</p><p>When the U.S. government decreed that encryption was a munition--essentially a dangerous weapon subject to federal rules for exporting arms and tanks--Microsoft and Netscape complied. But programmer-activists thumbed their noses at the rules by exporting the source code of popular PGP encryption protocols in book form. Others shrunk the RSA encryption algorithm to three lines of code in the Perl programming language, which they gleefully wore on T-shirts. The Justice Department declined to make an example of these scofflaws.</p><p>Today, there's keen interest in homebrew gunsmithing, whether local laws permit it or not, thanks to online code repositories, such as GitHub and Defense Distributed's DefCad. These sites offer design files that allow key components of working firearms to be manufactured at home using a 3D printer.</p><p>There is no natural law of computing that says search must be centralized in Google or Baidu, social networking must happen on Facebook or WeChat, auctions must go through eBay or Alibaba, and so on. What we're accustomed to today represents a historic shift, one that's difficult to overstate, from an earlier era of the internet. From the moment of its public release at 2:56 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on August 6, 1991, the World Wide Web was meant to be decentralized. Anyone could browse from any connected device. Every person with the technological means could set up his or her own website. The gatekeepers were gone.</p><p>It's true that centralized platforms have advantages, including improved security and better resistance to spam and abuse. They can also be quicker to build. But centralization brings costs with it, including providing a single convenient point of control for governments eager to experiment with censorship and surveillance.</p><p>There are some tantalizing hints that decentralization will return. Bitcoin and Ethereum, two blockchain-based computing platforms, are prominent examples. Solid--an open-source project backed by World Wide Web mastermind Berners-Lee--is intended to help you keep ownership of your own data by placing it under your control. The Internet Archive has hosted a pair of Decentralized Web Summits in San Francisco. Prototypes of distributed search engines, wikis, and Slack-like chat programs exist.</p><p>If a decentralized internet does return, it will likely arise only as a response to regulatory overreach by governments--and primarily because cryptonetworks provide developers and maintainers with economic incentives in the form of digital currency if they participate. A key advantage of open-source programming is developer friendliness: Twitter, especially, is notorious for disabling features that developers had relied on. Google's feature killing is memorialized at KilledByGoogle.com. When no one owns a platform, that sort of thing is much less likely to happen.</p><p>Chris Dixon, an entrepreneur turned venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, wrote in a well-read February 2018 post on Medium: \"Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms.\"</p><p>Decentralization is hardly a perfect solution to the internet's ills, but it's likely to be better than the unhappy situation we find ourselves in today.</p><p>DECLAN MCCULLAGH, a Silicon Valley writer and entrepreneur, is co-founder of Recent Media Inc.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-593029100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 593029100</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJM-1TP1-JCBJ-K2H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Reason Foundation</copyright><publicationName>Reason Magazine</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0048-6906</issn><volume>Vol. 51</volume><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New Zealand</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Free Speech &amp;

But I don't think the Googles and the Facebooks could have started here back then and they definitely couldn't now.\"Speaking to EG, she added that rather than the East Coast/West Coast battle, the age-old rivalry between New York and its European counterpart was one to watch instead. \"I don't think it is a case of New York against the Valley when it comes to tech actually. It's New York against London.\"To find out why, listen to the full podcast with Samuels here.To send feedback, e-mail <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:emily.wright@egi.co.uk\">emily.wright@egi.co.uk</email> or tweet @EmilyW_9 or @estatesgazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RBIEGI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RBIEGI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNW-P001-JCF2-H17Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274985</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"286\"/><timeReceived>12:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Reed Business Information Ltd.

Hi everybody, thanks for joining us,  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, September 5th just before 6:00a.m.  on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Theranos is dissolving, the blood testing company will be gone soon  following that fraud scandal.  We have all of the details coming up this  morning, breaking news from the Wall Street Journal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then technology on Capitol Hill today, Facebook's Cheryl Sandberg,  Twitter's Jack Dorsey will be grilled on possible foreign influence over  social media and political bias.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. GREG WALDEN (R-OR), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:   We  want to know who's behind the curtain, who's the Wizard of Oz if you will  that's pulling all the levers that may cause shadow ban, that may cause  censorship.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A preview of the hearing coming up this morning.  Meanwhile,  markets are lower this morning, take a look at Futures indicating a weaker  start for stocks.  Facebook is down two percent but the broader averages  looking lower.</p><p>Dow Industrials down one half of a percent this morning, 100 points lower.   The S&amp;P500 down 10 and the NASDAQ off about 30 points.  This after mostly  flat close for the markets yesterday.  Take a look, fractional losses with  the NASDAQ down a quarter of a percent, the weakest of them all.</p><p>In Europe this morning trading is very similar, as you can see down across  the board, the FT-100 in London is down a third of a percent, the CAC  Quarante in Paris down one and a quarter percent and the DAX Index in  Germany down almost one percent.  </p><p>Indications of a slowing economy in China, continued trade tensions with  the United States putting the Asian markets in the red overnight.  As you  see the worst performer, Hong Kong down two and a half percent.</p><p>Gordon has turned deadly, the tropical storm has killed a child leaving  thousands of others without power.  We are tracking the storm's pace right  now.</p><p>Then the trillion dollar club, Amazon joining Apple as the second company  to be valued at $1 trillion.  What the future holds for both technology  giants.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me, our own Dagen  McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing Partner Mike Murphy.  And former Home  Depot and former Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli.  Great to see everybody this  morning.</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER HOME DEPOT CEO:  Great to be here.  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>NARDELLI:  A lot going on today, huh?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure is.  We have a jam-packed show actually this morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Good morning.  Happy to be  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You too Mike, great to see you.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thanks Maria.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, ANCHOR:  So much going on.  I think  yesterday was the day that the left wing nuts officially lost their minds - -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- online on Twitter driving away potentially groups and groups  of voters for years to come because, again, I think people saw the kind of  bile belching lies that they will -- they will stop at nothing to basically  get what they want and to stop a conservative agenda, period.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that circus of a hearing yesterday when Senator Grassley  was trying to begin that hearing interruptions by the left wanting to just  stop the hearing altogether.  I think voters are going to get upset by this  going into November.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've seen -- I have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People want progress.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've seen -- I have seen preschool Thanksgiving pageants with  better acting than I saw yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It was a lot of acting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was a lot of bad acting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was theater.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And people don't buy it.  And, again, the shaming, we will  destroy people at any cost with lies just to get what we want because  Hillary Clinton lost.  That is the -- that's the gist of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's pretty extraordinary actually.</p><p>MURPHY:  It is.  And in the past, you know, screaming really loud has  really been able to get -- win votes for them and hopefully now people will  look past the screaming and see what the actual messaging is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well don't you think that now people are saying they understand  the strategy, the strategy of shaming and just calling you out on social  media just because you don't agree with someone.  And the name calling,  people are on to this strategy and I don't know that it's going to work the  way it has in the past.</p><p>We got a lot to talk about this morning.  Joining the conversation, the  Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Congressman Greg  Walden is leading the talks this morning.  The testimony with Jack Dorsey  and Sheryl Sandberg, he's going to join us first.</p><p>Billionaire Real Estate Investor Founder and Chairman of Equity  International Sam Zell with us this morning in the studio this morning.   Also in the studio, former Chairman and CEO of AIG, Hank Greenberg is going  to talk about China and what the U.S. and China's trade plans may be.</p><p>Plus, we got the former Prime Minister of Italy, Mario Monti discussing  border control as well as a flat tax in Italy this morning.  FOX News  Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano wraps it all up for us.  We  got lots to talk about with him, don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>We kick it off right here with this top story and that is Theranos is  bleeding out, the blood testing startup accused of executing Silicon  Valley's biggest scam announced in a letter to shareholders that it will  officially dissolve.  </p><p>The letter from Theranos CEO David Taylor admitting, \"We're now out of  time.\"  The move comes in the wake of criminal charges targeting founder  Elizabeth Holmes and her second in command for allegedly defrauding  investors, doctors, and patients out of hundreds of millions of dollars.  </p><p>The firm has been tarnished by that scandal, it will pay creditors the  remaining cash.  And we've talked about this a lot Dagen because the Wall  Street Journal did an incredible reporting on this, broke the news of the  fraud and now this morning breaking the news of the dissolving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Almost three years ago.  This was a company that the Journal  today, again, credit to a newspaper, credit to hardcore investigative  journalist.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real news.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John Carey who broke this story nearly three years ago, Silicon  Valley's biggest fraud.  And here's where it draws the line, again, the --  these fake blood testing machines and this fake blood testing technology  had been rolled out in Walgreens.</p><p>They were putting people's lives at risk potentially giving people the  inaccurate blood testing result of most of the blood test that they are  performing were actually on traditional machines.  But a lot of the testing  was wrong.</p><p>Here's where we draw the line between technology, an app that doesn't work  right or a database that the company basically oversells.  It doesn't put  somebody's health on the line.  This is what this individual did, Elizabeth  Holmes, again, she hoodwinked everybody from George Shultz to Henry  Kissinger and they're all on her board.</p><p>David (INAUDIBLE), again, their tactic was you have an army of lawyers and  you threaten to sue people into submission, into silence.  And we should  give credit.  I read the book that John Carey wrote about this and credit  deserves to go to Taylor Shultz, he's the grandson of the former Secretary  of State George Shultz who was on the board.</p><p>His own grandfather didn't believe him about what he was seeing working at  the company and he was the first employee to blow the whistle to a state  regulator about what he saw as troubling practices.  </p><p>Again, criminal charges have been filed and I hope that this forces people  in Silicon Valley, again, the code of silence, we're worried about not  getting a job somewhere else.  The code of silence, I hope it pushes people  to act when they see something wrong and so hideous. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's pretty incredible what went on because the truth is  she was sort of a mystery the whole time.  They would call her the Steve  Jobs of healthcare.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The way she dress, the way it was all sort shrouded in mystery  Bob.  But she really did (INAUDIBLE) all these important people to get on  her board and that helped her get other support and funding because they  said, \"Well, if Henry Kissinger is on the board, this must be something  big.\"</p><p>NARDELLI:  It's (INAUDIBLE) I just can't believe in today's world that we  allow a company like that to exist and to be able to, Dagen as you said,  jeopardize the lives of human beings, misrepresentation to investors, on  and on and on again.</p><p>I mean, it just where is -- where is the sanity and the integrity that, you  know, Mike you and I are so familiar with in the business community.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, totally.  And I think to Dagen's point, the Wall Street  Journal did an incredible job -- incredible breaking the story because when  it first came out I remember reading it and saying, \"Why are they attacking  this woman's success?  Why are they going after her?\"  We're not -- we were  venture capital --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because she was a fraud that's why.  Again, the pin prick, the  whole -- the whole con was we're going to take a little drop of your blood  because I'm afraid of needles and we will be able to run all of these  tests.</p><p>Stanford dropout, dressed like Steve Jobs which was this kind of part of  the con that developed over years will take just a little drop of your  blood and run these tests on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So you don't need all of that blood.  So it's crazy  that you have to go to the doctor and all of this.  And everybody thought,  \"Well, this is a great idea.\"  </p><p>MURPHY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want to switch gears to technology because they're getting  the grilling this morning on Capitol Hill.  As you heard here first weeks  ago Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey will testify this morning.  He's going to  testify before two panels today.</p><p>Also testifying is Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, she's testifying before  the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Both executives expected to face  questions on how their sites police users and content.  </p><p>I want to bring in Roger Kay Endpoint Technologies Associate Founder and  Technology Analyst.  Roger, good to see you this morning.  What could we  expect from these hearings this morning?  What are you expecting?</p><p>ROGER KAY, FOUNDER AND TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES  ASSOCIATE:   Well essentially I would say the most important piece of this is Jack  Dorsey and how he actually handles governance at Twitter.</p><p>So one of the things about Twitter is that people didn't realize when it  was started that it was going to be weaponized at some point.  So initially  it was about the Arab Spring and people telling each other where the rally  was going to be held so they could show up and protest the government all  this sort of good and helpful stuff.</p><p>And now it's become this kind of trashy but people going after each other  and all this misinformation and so on.  And it has the governance process  or it says it does and yet for some reason that governance process doesn't  always seemed to operate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KAY:  So people suspect that Jack Dorsey is in the backroom kind of putting  his finger on the scale from time-to-time and he said, \"Well, you know, OK,  I heard the committee did this, we had the system to do that but I think we  should do it this other way.\"</p><p>And then that's completely opaque.  So they're going to be asking him,  well, so how do you actually do this and how do you tell a difference  between legitimate free speech and some kind of trashing of another human  being like ad hominem for example.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the risks here Mike Murphy?  I mean, these are stocks  that are now, you know, up in the stratosphere.  Obviously Amazon followed  Apple's lead yesterday adding to the $1 trillion club.</p><p>Amazon now a $1 trillion company as well becoming the second company in  America to crack that incredible value.  In just 165 days the online  retailer group from $600 billion to $1 trillion but Mike, these valuations  not just Apple and Amazon, they're sky high Facebook, Twitter, and now  they're being questioned.  What are the downside risks here for investors?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think they're a lot bigger right now than I thought they were  six months ago.  And the reason is remember, it's not only investors, the  way a company like Facebook makes money is from advertisers, one of the  main ways they make money.</p><p>So if they can't be relied upon to bring positive -- to bring the correct  news and to police it properly, you're going to see ad dollars go  elsewhere.  If that happens, it's a major risk to the stock.  So, I think  coming out of the hearings today, the -- it's still in Facebook and  Twitter.  I think they'll be able to get through this and layout their  policies correctly.  But if they don't, it's major downside for the  companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a regulatory risk Roger?  I mean these companies as  big as they are, could they face forcing to get smaller?  You know, could  they face new fees, new attacks from government even if it's not a new  legislation?</p><p>KAY:  Yes.  No, I think absolutely.  And I think they expect it.  They  expect to be regulated and like many industries that were unregulated  became regulated, they would like to control how that happen.  So they're  going to be in there suggesting here's how you want to regular us.</p><p>And then the government representatives will say whatever they say which  is, \"OK, that's good enough for us\" or they'll say, \"No, they you need to  do more.\"  And so I think that's how the conversation will go.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Roger, Bob Nardelli here.  You just mentioned that they'll come  forward and say here's how we suggest being regulated.  But you're the  expert, what would -- what are the one, two or three things you would like  to see, you know, specifically regulated by these -- by these firms?</p><p>KAY:  Well, you know -- I mean, I'm kind of an old fashioned guy in this.   I mean, my thought is if you want to make a platform civil and correct then  you have essentially moderation.  So you have somebody curated.</p><p>But that means putting a throttle on the -- on the tremendous geyser of  information.  What people like about Twitter is they can just tweet and  they're done and it goes into the big pool.  But you would definitely slow  that if you had actual human moderator.  I mean, Facebook has already hired  a lot of people to do something pretty close to that.</p><p>And I think in general if you look at it, the more civilized forums are  ones where editors actually read posts before they go up and inflame  everybody and say, \"Oh, this one isn't true\" or \"This one is ad hominem so  we're going to intervene before it goes public.\" </p><p>I think that's not scalable and these guys have grown in scale, you know,  much, much larger than when they started out.  So I don't know that they  anticipated this problem.  I don't think that Mark Zuckerberg when he  started Facebook really expected it to be an enormous company like it is  today, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But -- and I don't think Dagen they expected them to be media  companies but they are very much media companies.</p><p>KAY:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  They've --</p><p>KAY:  So an example is do they get -- do they, you know, control -- are  they publishers?  Are they -- are they responsible for their messages or  are they common carriers?  Do they just simply end up being in some pipes  and people happen to do things to them and say, \"Well, we don't know  because we're just pipes and we don't pay any attention to that.\"  So  that's a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not just pipes if they're creating the algorithms.   You can't just blame it on an algorithm because somebody programmed that  algorithm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Internet -- I mean, that's been their excuse -- that's  been their excuse.  Again, that was Mark Zuckerberg's excuse when they  launched Facebook Live and people were killing themselves and other people  on Facebook Live.</p><p>Literally committing murder and Mark Zuckerberg's reaction was, \"I didn't  anticipate it\" which is just poppycock.  One thing that they ought to worry  about is in the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act going back  that these internet companies are shielded from liability for hosting  content produced by others.  That could change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KAY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.  That's really an important point --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That could change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- because this is one of the things that could come out of  these hearings.  Do you agree with that Roger?</p><p>KAY:  Yes.  I think that's absolutely.  If -- in other words, if the  government says to these -- to these companies, actually your publishers  you're responsible for your content, then that really changes things quite  a lot and they will have to do something.</p><p>I mean, they literally cannot let just anybody publish without looking at  what happen.  So then going back after the fact and say, \"Oh, somebody was  offended, we'll take that one down\" that's not sufficient if they're  actually responsible for the content.  As Dagen pointed out, somebody killed himself, they can't take that back.   So, you know, they have to do it before the fact.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there -- is there any way they -- is there any way Mike  Murphy that they're not going to say?  You're a publisher, so you're  responsible for the content?  I mean, isn't that obvious?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's not that obvious really.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  All right. </p><p>MURPHY:  Because I think there's two sides of this, I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're not quite so.  They're all trying to get into content,  how are they just pipes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we're all trying to figure out how -- what the best way to  please this?  This is without overreaching on the actual companies.  So I  don't know what and how it plays out but I think there are two sides.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're asking for it.  They're asking for it because they get - - being given so much leeway to police themselves for years and years and  years and years and they didn't do it and now Washington comes to calling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  As an investor, you want to stay away during these  hearings or what?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I want to stay away and see how it plays out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a quick break.  Roger, good to see you sir, thanks  so much.</p><p>KAY:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Roger Kay.  Stay with Fox Business, we're bringing you live  coverage of the technology industry hearings on Capitol Hill.  It all kicks  up at 9:30 a.m. this morning, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's going to be a busy day on Wall Street.   Take a look at Futures indicating a lower opening for the markets.  Dow  Industrials right now down 125 points, a lot of conversation about trade  given that the Canadian talks resume today and we are expecting new tariffs  against Chinese goods this week.</p><p>So a lot of uncertainty over trade has markets lower.  </p><p>Tropical Storm Gordon meanwhile has turned deadly as it makes landfall.   Cheryl Casone with the details there.  Cheryl, this is an incredible  beginning to this storm.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  It's the beginning of the hurricane season Maria which  (INAUDIBLE) telling us it's going to be pretty rough this year.  So this  storm is being blamed.  </p><p>We should say for one child's death when a tree came crashing on top of a  mobile home.  That happened in Pensacola, Florida.  The storm making  landfall near the Alabama-Mississippi border bringing winds up to 70 miles  per hour and torrential rainfall.  Some area as you can see, more than  eight inches of rain before all is said and done.</p><p>Well, a powerful typhoon ripping through Japan.  About 10 people killed so  far, that's the number that we have.  Hundreds of others have been injured.   This is the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Japan since 1993.  Heavy  winds blowing a tanker into a bridge, there's the picture there.  And one  of Japan's largest airports closed indefinitely after being flooded by this  incredible and destructive typhoon.</p><p>Well, a huge primary upset in Massachusetts, a progressive democrat  knocking out a 10-term Congressman.  Boston City Councilwoman Ayanna  Presley beat Mike Capuano by double digits and then she issued a warning to  both sides of the while that change is coming.</p><p>The stage is also set for a better Senate race in Massachusetts.   Republicans selected Pro-Trump state Representative Geoff Diehl to take on  the incumbent democrat, Elizabeth Warren.  That will be in November.  </p><p>This contest we should say seen as a referendum on the first term senator's  national profile as she openly has mold a run for the presidency in 2020 on  the democratic ticket.</p><p>Well, the controversy continues, Nike has pushed ahead with the dad  campaign that features embattled quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  The NFL has  now released a statement seeming to side with Kaepernick.  I'll let you  look at this.</p><p>\"The National Football League believes in dialogue, understanding, and  unity.  The social justice issues that Colin and other professional  athletes have raised deserve our attention and action.  </p><p>A controversy of billboard is not up overlooking San Francisco, that's the  city where he played as quarterback for the 49ers.  There you have it,  there is the billboard on top of that building.  That's in downtown San  Francisco.  Shares of Nike taking a tumble yesterday, they felt more than  three percent Maria.  </p><p>We should add a Dow component, the Dow only closed down by 12 points  yesterday but Nike was the logger of the index all day, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  That would be billion in market value loss there in  a day.  Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, road wars.  Mercedes takes on Tesla now unveiling an  all-electric SUV of its own.  How the German automakers appealing directly  to Tesla fans.</p><p>And then binged this from thin thick to hungry, we will tell you about the  buzziest new words now making their way to the dictionary.  Back in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Back to the negotiating table, the United States and Canada set  to resume NAFTA talks today when Canadian foreign minister Chrystia  Freeland meets with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.</p><p>The president signaled over the weekend that he would be willing to move on  without Canada in a new NAFTA agreement.  </p><p>Joining us now Senior Fellow at the -- at the National Taxpayers Union  Mattie Duppler.  Mattie, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting out of the two sides today?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, I don't think it's the pricing that were here this week  negotiating with Canada and Mexico after the self-imposed deadline for  Mexico and United States (INAUDIBLE) by last week.</p><p>This is really the first time we see Canada thinking they have leverage  only because that deadline now is gone.  Because it's unlikely Canada will  be able to alter the actual substance of the deal.  This is something that  they walked away from two months ago, we haven't had representation from  our northern neighbors at the table for those intervening months.</p><p>And Mexico and United States know exactly what they want out of this deal.   So for Canada to walk in now and make any demand, I think we know exactly  how the administration would characterize that which simply is that they're  not negotiating in good faith, they don't know where to go from here.  And  so it's unlikely that we'll see Canada be able to emerge.  </p><p>Now remember that Prime Minister Trudeau is in election cycle now.  He's  got a year until he has to stand for election once again.  So how does he  claim victory in these negotiations?  I don't think that's quite clear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bob Nardelli, what do you think?</p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.  So Mattie tell me, what are the biggest issues there we  were talking earlier about dairy?  You know, my experience dealing with  Canada was lumber coming through.  I mean, what do you think the biggest  areas of opportunity for breaking this log jam and moving forward?  What  does Canada want?  What do we need?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.  Well softwood lumber, of course, is one of the biggest  sticking points between the United States and Canada when it comes to trade  negotiations.  So Canada has said they need to maintain the dispute  resolution that's in place right now, Chapter 19.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.</p><p>DUPPLER:  The United States says that they want to walk away from that,  that seems --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, why would the United States want to walk away from that?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well simply because it's not -- the United States has viewed this  as not a fair way to negotiate different disagreement they say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where other partners in any trade deal can say, \"No, we're not  going to -- we're not going to follow this, we're going to challenge this  program.\"</p><p>DUPPLER:  Yes.  Exactly right.  And there's other dispute resolutions as I  understand it in the near framework that would take the place of Chapter  19, so it's not to say that there wouldn't be an environment in which  Canada and United States could negotiate conflicts like that.</p><p>But the question of whether or not top 19 serves the interests of the  United States and Canada, it certainly wants that Canada has a different  view on than the United States.  United States has talked a lot about  access to the dairy markets in Canada, Canada has a highly restricted dairy  system, quota system not unlike a lot of what we have here in the United  States where it's extremely restricted as to what the movement of dairy can  be between partners.</p><p>But, you know, when you look at the importance of Canada and Mexico, the  truly important thing here is how highly integrated all of our industries  are across Canada and Mexico and the United States.  Those supply chains  have had years in the making that neither (INAUDIBLE) to be preserved,  there's not a lot of destruction for American companies here.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.  I know -- I know from, again, my Chrysler experience, if  you do something on car tariffs you've got all of the Dodge projects, the  Charger, the Challenger, the 300 and the minivan are all produced in  Canada.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Correct.</p><p>NARDELLI:  So it would have a major impact on Chrysler.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  So Mattie, when you see this negotiating back and forth,  ultimately isn't this going to come down to an agreement?  I mean, is --  doesn't Canada need the U.S., the U.S. needs Mexico, we all need each  other.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Correct.</p><p>MURPHY:  So somehow some way we're going to work out a deal that everyone's  going to give in a little bit, everyone's going to take a little bit and  we're going to have some sort of an agreement.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Seems like that's what the markets are thinking.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Well economically that's certainly true and those market  observers are saying I think we'll see a deal because we've seen at least  movement.  Now remember two years ago when President Trump was elected he  had said repeatedly he was getting rid of NAFTA and it will be gone.</p><p>We're here two years later we're still negotiating of NAFTA so I think  that's a good sign.  But that all come down to politics.  The president, of  course, is closing on the midterms here, we had an election in Mexico where  the new president will be taking over in December and he has said he want  the NAFTA deal done and our remaining question is in Canada with Prime  Minister Trudeau standing for election in a year, how does he claim victory  now?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Speaking of -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was just going to say that the new deadline seems to be  September 30th.  That's when according to U.S. law the Trump Administration  needs to make public the final text for trade pact so it could be signed by  November 30th when Mexico's leader, the current leader Pena Nieto leaves  office.  So September 30th is your new working deadline.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And maybe that's a good thing given that now we see there's  more time.  You mentioned politics, what politics yesterday Judge Brett  Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings began yesterday but with so much partisan  back and forth, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  I welcome  everyone to this confirmation hearing on the nomination of --</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Mr.  Chairman.</p><p>GRASSLEY:  -- Judge Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>HARRIS:  Mr. Chairman?  Mr. Chairman, I'd like to be recognized to ask a  question before we proceed.  </p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Mr.  Chairman, we received 42,000 --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Judge Kavanaugh's many (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  -- documents that we haven't been able to review last night and  we believe this hearing should be postponed.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  We have  been denied real access to the documents we need to advise --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. Chairman, regular orders called for.</p><p>BLUMENTHAL:  -- (INAUDIBLE) which turns this hearing into a charade and a  mockery of our norms.  And Mr. Chairman, I therefore move to adjourn this  hearing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, mockery.  Yes, politics.  It was a mess.  Does -- do  things like this, these fights hurt democrats or republicans?</p><p>DUPPLER:  I certainly think they hurt democrats.  That's because you saw  the obstruction coming out of D.C., the thing that America agree they hate  most about D.C. the fact that we can't get anything done was off the hands  of democrats yesterday.</p><p>I mean, the theatrics that were happening in that hearing room were  absolutely unacceptable and, you know, you'll see today apparently we'll  have an opportunity to actually hear from the judge himself and get the  politics maybe out of the way.  </p><p>But I think that when you look at the data on who cares about this  nomination, who cares about getting the Supreme Court Justice seat filled,  people aren't as excited about Judge Kavanaugh himself as they are about  the process moving forward.  </p><p>And we've seen that with the negotiations the last couple of years, every  time there's a Supreme Court seat that opens up, Americans want to know  that Washington, D.C. can get things done at filling the Supreme Court and  making sure that seat isn't vacant is one of the things they want to see  then.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going into the midterms, so I don't know how people are going  to react to this but I thought it was just disgusting.  I mean, you can't  even have a hearing, you didn't hear a word from Brett Kavanaugh yesterday.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  And on social media, the shaming and silencing of some  people was -- it was -- I think that it was a turning point for the left- wing Nats, in terms of the bile-belching and the hate-spewing that we've  seen in recent years, this took the cake just right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.  Mattie, great to get your insight, thank you  so much.  Mattie Duppler, there.  </p><p>Coming up, clouds on the horizon, why some economists are now warning that  leaner times are ahead for the economy even though if it doesn't feel like  that now, and despite this market record highs.</p><p>Plus, a major makeover, Starbucks, changing its popular Frappuccino.  We'll  tell you about that, next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us, busy morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo, we're happy you're  with us.  It is Wednesday, September 15th -- your top -- September 5th,  rather, your top stories right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Trade under President Trump, concerns this morning, over negotiations with  Canada and China, are weighing on markets, Futures currently indicating a  decline of better than 100 points right out of the gate this morning.  This  coming after the Dow dropped just 12 points yesterday, notching its third  consecutive loss.  The markets were flat on the day as you see.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, European indices taking a cue from weakness on Wall  Street, FT 100 down a half a percent. CAC Quarante in Paris, down one  percent, DAX Index in Germany, down two-thirds of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed lower across the board, worst performer  was Hong Kong, down 2-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Well, the end is near for Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and Obama's  former White House Chief of Staff, has announced he will not run for re- election, in Chicago, next year.  The plans for his next chapter as  violence is erupting in Chicago, with over 1,000 people reportedly shot  since Memorial Day, a thousand people.</p><p>Taking on Tesla, Mercedes Benz unveiled its first all-electric SUV, as the  Tesla Roadster makes its debut, more on the electric car wars, coming up.</p><p>Then, the Starbucks Frappuccino, getting a makeover, major changes coming  to the frozen coffee drink, later this hour.  </p><p>And then hangry, the blend of words, hungry and angry, becomes an official  word in the Merriam Webster Dictionary.  We will tell you the other terms  that made the cut, coming up.</p><p>All that story -- all those stories coming up, but first, our top story  this half an hour, an economic sweet spot, growth in the Trump economy has  been astronomical, but now, top economists are warning that leaner times  are ahead.  I spoke with Federal Reserve President, James Bullard, about  this very topic, yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES BULLARD, PRESIDENT, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST. LOUIS:  I think the  projections are that the economy's going to slow.  But -- and I think  that's the right thing to base policy on that, that should be how you plan,  and then, you hope for the best.  </p><p>You hope that productivity will improve in the U.S. economy and you'll  actually get faster growth.  That would be great news.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The next fed meeting is September 26th.  We are expecting rates  to move higher at that time.  Joining us now to discuss that is  Bankrate.com Senior Economic Analyst, Mark Hamrick, Mark, good to see you,  thanks for joining us.  </p><p>The survey came from your firm, what prediction should we take to avoid an  economical halt and what is leading to this economic slowdown given the  fact that we just saw two straight quarters of four percent growth?</p><p>MARK HAMRICK, SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM:  Well, in a way, you  just answered the question.  Good morning, Maria, it's great to be back  with you.  I think, you know, the just completed second quarter with 4.2  percent growth in the U.S.  </p><p>And the fact that 2018 is widely expected to be the strongest year that we  have seen in some time, in the sense of roughly three percent and then,  whether it's our economists weighing in, whether it's the Federal Reserve,  sort of, projecting out into 2019-2020.  </p><p>You don't have any predictions for three percent growth in the coming year  nor the following year, and so, you take together the impacts of a front- loaded tax cut.  You know, we have the stock market down this morning  because of trade concerns.  We have this kind of uneven situation with the  U.S. economy and the economists overseas including our trading partners.  </p><p>And then finally, as we just referenced, the Federal Reserve does seem to  be on a trajectory of rising interest rates all the way through next year.   Now, we can hope, perhaps, that the fed will not necessarily be in that  mode to take so much accommodation away, but that's the expectation.  And  of course, we'll get that forecast.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I still haven't heard any solid evidence of any slowdown.   Mike Murphy, we are talking about four percent economic growth and all  these predictions of, you know, things are going to slow down so much in  the next two years.  </p><p>I'm just trying to get my head around it.  I don't understand how that  happens, when you're in this period, just because of higher interest rates?   What's causing the slowdown?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't think there's much to get your head around because I don't  see it either.  You know, so, you talk about rates going higher, but it's  not rates going higher by 25 basis points at every quarter, say, that's not  enough to grind this growth to a halt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  This isn't -- so we don't have growth that can't be even surpassed  next year.  So, I think a lot of this is pouring water in the economy, I  think a lot of it comes from people expecting two percent growth and  getting used to two percent growth.  Announcing four percent growth and  saying, this can't be sustainable, but I think, it actually is.  I don't  see anything out there either.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.  Let me ask Mark, Bob Nardelli, a question, you know, if  you go back to seven, eight or nine, we saw the financial meltdown that  brought everything, then, we saw a housing -- residential housing meltdown.</p><p>People now are talking about the auto industry slowing down, commercial  real estate slowing down, as a result of Amazon, a lot of retail malls, et  cetera, you know, having to close.  What are the two or three indices  you're looking at that would support, kind of, the information, as Maria  said, that came out of your survey?</p><p>HAMRICK:  Sure, well, I don't think -- first of all, the economists are  basing their forecast, let's say, for next year, on anything that's  happening at this very moment.  So what I would always be watching, of  course, the housing market as you referenced.</p><p>Although, we also know that typically, the future crisis is not going to be  just like the crisis that we had the last time around, and thank goodness  for that, but I would continue to watch consumer confidence, obviously,  that's very strong, retail sale strong, and business confidence.</p><p>And I think, if anything, we just saw what the ISM manufacturing survey  yesterday, we do continue to get a pretty strong body of commentary,  whether it's ISM, The Fed Beige Book, on the level of uncertainty that has  been injected in the business environment because of, let's say, trade  disputes and, you know, a lack of certainty about how all of this would be  worked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you just think things are going to slow down because  they're so strong now and there's just -- that's just what you're  expecting, you just say -- you're just saying, OK, well, things are really  strong right now, so it's just going to slow down, is that -- is that your  analysis?</p><p>HAMRICK:  I'll try to make it as simple as possible.  First of all, a  front-end loaded tax cut, you have the Federal Reserve predicting that  they're going to raise interest rates essentially up to six times over the  next year and a half, actually, less than a year now, and global trade  tensions.  </p><p>Those are three factors that the economists are looking at right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still not solid evidence, still not solid evidence, there.  I  mean, you've got the job's number out on Friday, Dagen, we're looking at  pretty good jobs picture, 3.9 percent unemployment.  Sure, things will slow  down at some point, but I just want to see what the catalysts are, that are  leaning to all these dire predictions, I don't get it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Politically, too, I think that the Democrats are overreaching,  trying to talk down an economy, trying to convince even hoodwink  individuals in this country who are benefiting from the tax cuts, who are  benefiting from this incredibly strong job market, and you see that in the  consumer confidence.</p><p>This is not -- these numbers aren't just pretty good, they are awesome.   They're 18-year high for consumer confidence, the factory sector of the  strongest growth that we've seen in 14 years, we haven't had three percent  growth in any one calendar year, in more than a decade.</p><p>So, again, to try and talk this down -- and this is -- this is a political  hammer that some individuals are trying to use, there's no evidence.  And  by the way, we haven't seen an expansion that did start in 2009.</p><p>We haven't seen a major, major boom in CAPEX, in corporate spending, in  lending or in housing, those are reasons to think that this expansion could  continue, maybe not north of four percent, but certainly, north of three.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the point, you keep saying it's a front-end loaded  tax cut, Mark, but everybody we speak with, in terms of the business  managers that are seeing impact, say that this thing, has a long runway,  that we haven't even seen the impact of the tax cut yet.</p><p>So, you're talking about it being front-ended, others who are actually  managing businesses and employees are saying, there's a long runway here.   So, again, I don't see the evidence.</p><p>HAMRICK:  Well, I mean, I think there are all kinds of estimates out there  including the Federal Reserve estimates, so, do you think that those are  valid?  That growth is expected to slow over the next two years?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know.  I'm just looking for -- I'm a numbers girl, I  like to see the evidence of it.  That's it.  We spoke with Robert Kaplan,  president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, and you're right, his prediction  was, that yes, we'll see three percent this year, but by the time 2020  rolls around, we're down to 1.9 percent.</p><p>But again, only because rates are going to move higher, nothing substantial  to actually indicate a slowdown and business managers changing their  decisions to put capital to work as a result of the regulation rollback.   So, we'll see.  We'll see who's right here.  Mark, it's good to have you on  the show.</p><p>HAMRICK:  I hope you're right, Maria, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Mark Hamrick, joining us there.  Coming up,  road wars, Mercedes is taking aim at Tesla this morning, unveiling an all- electric SUV of its own, how the German car maker is appealing to Tesla  fans, right now.</p><p>And then look it up, from hangry to guac, we will tell you about some of  the buzziest new words, now making their way to the dictionary.  Busy  Wednesday morning, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Arizona's governor talks former Senator Jon Kyl  out of retirement.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  The timing (INAUDIBLE), Maria, concerning they've got this vote  coming up in the Senate.  Kyl is expected to be sworn in today to replace  late Senator John McCain.  Kyl spent 18 years in the Senate before he  retired in 2013 -- he was one of the most powerful members of Senate in his  tenure there.  He is now coming to serving one year but he has no plans to  run again when that seat is up in 2020.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Rahm Emanuel's troubled time as Chicago mayor is coming to an  end.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL (D), CHICAGO:  This has been the job of a lifetime but  it is not a job for a lifetime.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Emanuel announced he's not going to seek a third term just  months February's election.  He didn't give a specific reason why but  remember, Chicago has been plagued by incredible amounts of violence during  Emanuel's watch.  </p><p>OK, Starbucks wants to take some of the sugar out of its Frappuccino;  they're testing a way to cut the drink's sugar content by 25 percent in  hundreds of locations Rhode Island, California, and Missouri.  Starbucks  says the trick is to add the flavor and the sweetness separately into the  drink.  It's all part of their promise to cut the amount of sugar in all of  their drinks by 25 percent by the end of the year 2020.  Shares of  Starbucks are down about seven percent so far this year.  </p><p>And have you ever felt mad about empty stomach, kind of, hangry, does that  sound familiar?  All right, that word is coming to your dictionary.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're little hangry.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm not hangry.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hungry and angry, you hangry.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Hangry is just one of 840 words that Merriam-Websters added to  dictionary.  A coupe of the others to bring you: TLDR, which stands for too  long, didn't read.  This one I love, bingeable -- I've already been saying  that for a long time, or having multiple episodes that can be watched in  rapid succession.  Instagraming -- with the -ing -- and airplane mode are  also going to be added into the new dictionary.  Bingeable, love it!  And  hangry.  Who hasn't been hangry, Maria?  Come on, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good one.  Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, more troubles for Tesla.  Mercedes is revealing an  all-electric rival.  Goldman says, sell the stock.  We break it down, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get ready for some major competition.  Tesla now not the only  star in the electric-car universe.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details.   Mercedes coming at them.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And the Mercedes all-electric car looks really good.  Let's  take a look at Tesla's shares this morning.  Investors feeling the heat,  shares are down another one percent, 286.10, this is on top of a four  percent drop yesterday.  The why?  There's a lot of why this morning, but  the biggest reason is competition.  Here it is, Maria.  Mercedes.  Their  all-new, all-electric SUV.  It's called the EQC.  It's due in year 2020.  </p><p>We don't know the price yet, but I can tell you that federal tax credits  will apply.  You're going to see two big 10-plus digital screens, 10-inches  plus in the front, beautiful, 19-inch wheels.  They put rose gold on there,  ambient lighting.  A potential negative, it's only getting a range of about  200 miles at charge.  But Mercedes is not the only luxury car maker who is  taking aim at Tesla right now.  </p><p>Next year, Jaguar, Porsche, and Audi will all have premium electric cars on  the market.  At the same time, for Tesla they've been getting subsidies,  the drivers can apply for them, they're going to expire.  That makes its  car more expensive for its drivers; they have production issues and these  are some of the reasons that Goldman Sachs reinstating coverage on the  stock, giving it that sell rating and giving it a price target of $210 --  that's a 30 percent drop from the 288 right now at the close.  </p><p>Tesla, hellbent on making the best cars, though.  Look at this.  This is  their new roadster, zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds.  A 620-mile range.  It is a  beautiful sports car.  It wants it to be the fastest and quickest  production car, period -- not the mention it's also all-electric.  This one  is going to set you back about $200,000.  They say it's going to be due in  2020 but we know how Tesla works with this sort of thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a beautiful car actually, but you know, I feel like, Bob,  you're a car guy for a long time running Chrysler, obviously, but electric  cars have been around but they haven't really resonated with buyers.  So,  are we now at a moment where this is going to start resonating?  </p><p>NARDELLI:  I think you've made an excellent point.  All of the O.E.s had  this technology and they were waiting for Tesla to stumble, to trip.   That's what happened -- the door opened, and they were going to come at him  now.  I think that they were looking, you know, Musk was out there on the  bleeding edge and they want to be on the leading edge.  You saw some of  this, you announced it, so I think you're going to see a lot more  competition.  You know, Dagen, you talk about they have to be luxurious, I  think you're going to see that in the Mercedes product.  And I think you're  going to see acceptance, but I think there's a transitional point that the  consumer, they want to see consumer acceptance pulling versus Tesla  pushing.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Are we really going to see soon gas stations with charging  stations, frequently?  </p><p>NARDELLI:  I think you will</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can charge at Whole Foods.  Well, you can charge your car at  Whole Foods.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Where else?  </p><p>NARDELLI:  The big problem with Tesla was: they promised them, and they're  not there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will consumers -- is this going to resonate with consumers, are  we really actually now seeing acceptance?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The connector is gas electric hybrids.  I drive a -- it is a  fancy sports car, it's used, but it's an I8 by BMW.  It's a gas electric  hybrid that is also rechargeable for short trips and it is -- it is the  most attention-getting car.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You love it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People in Brookneal, Virginia, I'm at CBS, and they are trying  to get in my car and asking me for rides.  [Laughter] </p><p>MURPHY:  I was getting up the Drake music blasting out of the windows,  Dagen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's because you're Dagen McDowell.  It doesn't matter what  you're driving, they want to get in your car.  You are Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They have no idea who I am, but it's got --</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, it's about the styling.  People are no longer waiting,  you know, for like Tesla to run away with it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  We want luxury electric cars.  Here they are.  Next year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead.  Attention drivers, Toyota now recalling more than  one million vehicles over fire risk.

Good Wednesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, September 5th.  Your top stories  right now, just after 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Tech goes to Capitol Hill today.  Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter's  Jack Dorsey will be questioned this morning on possible foreign influence  over social media and accusations of political bias.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't think it's about election.  I think what it's  really about free speech.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If the conservatives just leave, then only the liberal  voices will be on Twitter.  And Twitter's a very powerful tool.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are bringing you the hearings live this morning right here  on Fox Business.  Join us for that.</p><p>Plus, trade tensions with Canada and China weighing on markets this  morning.</p><p>Futures are off of the low right now, down about 80 points but still  underwater given this nervousness over the trade deals that we are waiting  for.  Dow Industrials set to open down about 80 points, S&amp;P 500 down 6, and  the Nasdaq down 20.</p><p>This, after a mostly flat close for the markets yesterday -- take a look at  market performance where The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down a quarter  of a percent with an 18-point decline.</p><p>In Europe this morning, similar story -- money coming out of equities.  FT  100 down a third of a percent, CAC 40 in Paris down almost 1 percent, and  the DAX index down one-half of a percent in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets also in the red overnight, worst performer Hong Kong, as you  can see.</p><p>Meanwhile Tropical Storm Gordon has turned deadly.

That is the warning from  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  You want to hear this.   The very latest on an outbreak as a result of Honey Smacks -- we will tell  you about it.</p><p>And all ages welcome here, a Starbucks staffed entirely by senior citizens.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to break  it all down -- our own Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff CEO and managing partner  Mike Murphy, and the former CEO of Home Depot and Chrysler Bob Nardelli.   Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO OF HOME DEPOT AND CHRYSLER:  Great to be with you.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The hour just ran by, this first hour.</p><p>NARDELLI:  It did.  It's amazing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Busy show.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apologies for acting like I got shot out of a cannon at 6:00 in  the morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, no, no.  You were talking about an incident that happened  yesterday in the Kavanaugh hearing.  And I want to hear more about that  because it went viral on the Internet -- Dagen.  And we saw the picture of  -- what was it -- somebody on his staff sitting behind Brett Kavanaugh when  he was sitting there in the testimony.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Zina Bash was her name.  And she was accused by many  people, left wing nuts I might call them this morning, accused of making a  white power symbol with her hand.  This perceived white power symbol  started out as an Internet hoax created to troll people.</p><p>Her husband, Zina Bash's husband is a U.S. attorney and he was forced to  issue a denial on Twitter.  It's really shocking what has happened.  Hold  on one second.  We're going to talk about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's ridiculous.  There's the picture.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's ridiculous.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to talk about this later.  But I want to just point  out that her husband has had to say \"The attacks today on my wife are  repulsive.\"  He goes on to say \"Zina is Mexican on her mother's side and  Jewish on her father's side.  She was born in Mexico.  Her grandparents  were Holocaust survivors.  We, of course, have nothing to do with hate  groups which aim to terrorize and demean other people.\"</p><p>That is part of what her husband had to say.  But again, I think this goes  to these hearing that we're going to -- that we're going to see on Capitol  Hill today from these social media companies, these executives because I  think yesterday was a tipping point where people are sick of this hate  spewing and the bile belching by people on the left just to get what they  want and they will stop at nothing when it comes to destroying people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Part of the issue, I think, and tell me if you agree, is  that this president is having really good outcomes.  And whether or not you  like his approach -- </p><p>NARDELLI:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- when you look at 4.1 percent and 4.2 percent economic growth  as a result of the tax cut plan and the rollback in regulations.  Or you  look at foreign policy and, you know, the judges that he's put on the  courts, people are feeling good about the outcomes.  And his skeptics, the  left, are going insane over that.  </p><p>NARDELLI:  I mean in business, Maria -- we always used talk about people  who do things make mistakes.  They never make the biggest mistake of all  which we saw in the prior administration -- do nothing.</p><p>And so, you know, there are some issues out there that people take  exception to.  But on the whole, 4 percent GDP, regulation rollback, taxes,  unemployment -- I mean, you just go down the list of favorability.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And so they're attacking -- now they attack a staffer  on Kavanaugh's team.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They are.  And I think people have to realize what you see on  social media, you have to read through it a little bit, like use some  common sense because a lot of it is just people trying to get you to think  one way a lot of times.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.</p><p>We've got all of that coming up this morning.  And joining the  conversation, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Congressman  Greg Walden is leading the discussion in the testimony with Jack Dorsey and  Sheryl Sandberg.  He's going to join us first.  Billionaire real estate  investor and Equity International founder and chairman, Sam Zell is here.   He'll give us his take on the economy and I think he is a seller.  Former  AIG chairman and CEO Hank Greenburg is here to talk China and the former  prime minister of Italy, Mario Monte walks in on the trade discussions  happening.  Plus Fox news senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano  weighs in as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off with this, big tech is testifying.  AS I first reported  right here, Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's chief operating  officer Sheryl Sandberg are headed to Capitol Hill this morning to face a  grilling from lawmakers over potential censorship concerns on social media.</p><p>President Trump weighed in last week on the importance of transparency when  it comes to sharing content online.</p><p>I also spoke with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about the issue on  \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Donald Trump, President of the United States:  I think that Google and  Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very  unfairly.  I think it's a very serious problem because they're really  trying to silence a very large part of this country.  </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CAL), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: If there's a  conservative being shut down, that voice is not being heard.  And if this  is where two-thirds of Americans are getting their news, it's not a fair  process and this country believes in fairness.  The Internet was created on  fairness.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us now to talk more about that is Mashable.com tech  editor Pete Pachal.  Pete -- Good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  Your  expectations today?  </p><p>PETE PACHAL, MASHABLE.COM:  Well, it's social media on trial part two, as I  like to think of it.  Like any sequel, it's probably not going to be quite  as satisfying and the story line might be a little more confused.</p><p>So basically the last time this happened, Mark Zuckerberg was testifying  and we were right in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  And  there was a big focus on data privacy and just fundamentals of how Facebook  works.  We had the top guy talking about it.</p><p>Now we have Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey.  They're both big players, no  question but now it's more general stuff about the election and what sort  of meddling may happen and sort of the steps they're taking about that as  well as what we've just been talking about, this sort of silencing of  conservative voices or at least, perceived silencing according to them that  sort of may be going on.  And they're going to have to answer for what has  been called shadow banning, at least in Twitter's case and other things  like that, to see if they really do care about like the quality of the  conversation on their networks and if they really are being true to the  idea of having all voices being heard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the downside risks today?  I mean What could we see?   What's the worst thing that could happen to technology companies in light  of all of this?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well, I mean, there's going to be some gaps, certainly.  There's  going to be some missteps.  But I mean the thing that they need to convince  the lawmakers today that they're doing is actually really trying to fix  their networks in both ways, really, and trying to sort of facilitate  healthy conversation which is what a term Jack Dorsey likes to use.  But  also ensuring that the sort of wide scale inauthentic behavior like we saw  the other week with Iranian and Russian sort of networks on Facebook.</p><p>And they were sort of ousted, trying to sort of set the stage for the  midterm elections or do some influence, sort of making sure that there's  open stuff for authentic behavior and they're shutting down the inauthentic  behavior.  If they can't show that or they can't be convincing about that,  there could be some issues either financially or with regulation down the  line.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The point I was trying to make earlier, that I was making badly,  ineloquently is that Twitter has a bigger problem I think and even Facebook  and other social media platforms, maybe Instagram to a lesser extent,  people are tired of swimming in the cesspool.</p><p>They're just going to turn away from it.  There's nothing that Twitter can  potentially do to solve that problem.  It is nothing but people hurling  hate across the political aisle.</p><p>And that goes for both sides.  And people are sick of it.  Because it goes  beyond just words.  It goes to they're trying to destroy people's lives.  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well I agree with you to a large extent.  Because, you know,  there's a question about just how much does Twitter even control Twitter?   Because basically these outrage mobs that we're seeing are an outgrowth of  some of the fundamental ways that Twitter works.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they knocked Candace Owens off of the platform.  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well yes.  And the stance (ph) -- here's what Twitter is really  inadvertently good at doing is amplifying extreme points of view; whether  it's on the left or the right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some of them are not so extreme though -- that's what I'm  saying, you know.  Some of the points of view are not extreme.  Wasn't  there a couple of instances where, I mean, they took things off for  absolutely no reason and then they said sorry, that was a mistake.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So Pete -- I would ask about that, with the algorithms.  Initially  they're set up by humans.  So, you know, Jack Dorsey's talked about it,  yes, we have a left-leaning bias at Twitter.  Is there a way to get Twitter  to a point where there is no bias or is it ok with the bias, in your  opinion?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well, I mean it's hard to say to what extent the bias exists.  I  mean certainly there is a bias -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he said -- he said yes, we're left-leaning.  </p><p>PACHAL:  Yes.  I mean the company is.  But can those algorithms be  programmed to be fair regardless?  I think they can to some extent.  And I  think they also need to -- I think Facebook actually does this better in  the sense that they want moderators in the regions of the places where they  are rather than having everyone in northern California make the call on  content and using like one filter.  They want multiple filters throughout.</p><p>Now, Twitter is a smaller company.  And they don't have the same resources  Facebook has.  But that kind of approach where you don't have like a bunch  of people in an office in northern California making these hard decisions  about content, I think it's probably the way -- a good start, anyway.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bob.</p><p>NARDELLI:  If there is to be regulation, you just mentioned some best  practices, should the government pick those best practices and impose that?   I mean what would you like to see coming out of this hearing?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Big question, yes.  I mean in terms of the government stepping in,  I think, you know, obviously you want to keep that to a minimum.  I think  stuff with regard to elections is probably the most likely regulation we're  going to see on the social networks.</p><p>But I would love to see a set of best practices come out from at least one  of these networks and I think Facebook is kind of leading the charge here,  mostly because they've been hammered the most and have thrown the most  resources against it and hopefully see other networks adopt that. </p><p>But Twitter sort of has a totally different role than Facebook.  I mean  it's similar but they're more of a news curator.  And like I was saying  earlier there's so many things inherent to Twitter that sort of go against  healthy conversation like we've seen it over the years with bullying, with  abuse, people getting kicked off the platform or just leaving the platform  because of all that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, this issue censorship, if you want to call it that, I know  that the people who quibble over censorship is when it's done by a  government.</p><p>But what Facebook does is more insidious.  They made money.  They've shown  reckless disregard for people's most personal information for years and  years and years.  And that's how they make money.</p><p>They basically are selling in one way, shape or form your behavior, your  most personal data about yourself and they let literally tens of millions  people's accounts were compromised because app developers were able to  access not only people's data who download the app but the friends' data as  well.</p><p>That data is out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's spread around the world.  Twitter -- not Twitter-- Facebook  doesn't even know where it is.  </p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, where is Google?  Where's Google in all of this?   Wasn't -- you know, during the California primary, if you Google California  GOP what are the ideologies?  A list of ideologies comes up and one of the  ideologies was Nazism.  </p><p>PACHAL:  Yes.  Google is such a -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not a coincidence.</p><p>PACHAL: -- vast, sprawling company at this point.  I'm willing to sort of - - like there were other accusations of Bernie Sanders versus Hillary  Clinton and there was a thing where the results that came up Bernie Sanders  was sort of disadvantaged.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if you Googled Hillary Clinton it was all good stories.   If you Googled Donald Trump it was evil, evil, evil.  I mean, you know, so  there's that as well.  It seems to me -- they're a media company, if they  abuse their power, there will be consequences.  Whether that's regulatory  or money, financial -- we don't know.</p><p>PACHAL:  Yes.  And I don't think there's a room at Google where people are  coming in and picking and choosing this stuff.  But I do think some of the  steps they take to, say, prevent misinformation, like if something is  written about you that's false, I would not like that to appear in an auto  complete or a search result.</p><p>So they have tools to sort of push that down.  But I do think some of that  does sort of get mixed in with this political stuff and that's where things  can get really dicey.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pete -- great to get your insights.  Thank you -- Pete Pachal.</p><p>Stay with us, live coverage of the Dorsey and Sandberg testimonies today;  they're testifying before Congress at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.  We'll have that.</p><p>Tropical storm Gordon slams the Gulf Coast.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are coming off of the lows.  We are  still looking at a lower opening for the broader averages.  Trade tensions  with Canada and China unnerving investors this morning.</p><p>Dow Industrials set to open down about 75 points.  The S&amp;P is down 5 and  the Nasdaq lower by 18.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, tropical storm Gordon is slamming the Gulf Coast  with heavy rain, powerful winds.</p><p>Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan is live in Orange Beach, Alabama this  morning with the very latest.  Steve -- good morning to you.  </p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>Over the last hour or so we've seen conditions gradually weaken here along  the coast of Alabama, some wind gusts of 10 to 20 miles an hour, big surf  behind me, four to six feet high, crashing into that pier.  The rain has  been on and off.  </p><p>Tropical Storm Gordon hit last night at 10:00 p.m.  It made landfall on the  border between Mississippi and Alabama as a powerful tropical storm.   Sustained wind speeds of 70 miles an hour -- that's just under a category 1  hurricane but not as bad as some people predicted.</p><p>As far as the damage goes, at least one person killed by the storm in  Pensacola, a tree came down on a mobile home, killing a child.</p><p>Here in Alabama, many people waking up to no power in their house, at least  20,000 people in Alabama without power.</p><p>The real concern now is from the rain.  It's been eight to twelve inches in  some areas.  But this is a quick moving storm and right now it is moving  north.  So we could see some rain and flooding across the state of  Mississippi over the next 24 hours.  Maria -- back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Steve -- we'll be watching that.  Thanks so much --  Steve Harrigan this morning in Alabama.</p><p>Coming up, Supreme Court showdown, we break down Judge Brett Kavanaugh's  confirmation hearing yesterday.  The circus that it was, protests from  Democrats across the board.</p><p>Then Toyota recalls over 1 million cars worldwide.  Details on the vehicles  plagued with a fire risk later this hour.</p><p>Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Well, it is a Supreme Court showdown.  Democrats tirelessly demanding to  delay judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation proceedings yesterday,  interrupting legislators, insisting for more time to review documents on  the nominee, protesters spiraled out of control, causing massive  disruptions, even before being escorted out by authorities.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Please vote no.  Please vote no.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kavanaugh must not be put on the court.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This (INAUDIBLE) is an attack on women's rights.  It's  an attack on democracy.  Shut the hearing down now, I urge you.  Shut the  hearing down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Police arrested at least 70 protesters yesterday.  This is the  first day of week-long hearings.</p><p>Joining us right now Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial  analyst.  Judge' it's great to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was only half of it.  When Grassley first welcomed  everybody -- the, you know, interruptions, wanting to just stop the hearing  all together from three senators.  It was just incredible.  Your reaction.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So I have a couple of views.  I think to the general public  it's government at its worst.  I think it really shows how low and base and  combative and unresponsive to the needs of the American people our elected  representatives can be.</p><p>If you go a little deeper into the weeds, I think the Democrats have  concluded that they're more likely than not to lose this and Judge  Kavanaugh will soon be Justice Kavanaugh.  So since they can't really lay a  glove on him, they want to attack the process.</p><p>Now, some of their complaints about the process are legitimate.  I mean  dumping 42,000 pages of documents on somebody 12 hours before the hearing  is a task impossible.  And many of those documents were stamped with may  not be discussed in public.  Well, what's the sense of surrendering a  document if it can't be discussed?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sort of like redacting everything.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  But I think the Democrats must have taken  a poll and decided that their base wanted to see this kind of acerbic, in- your-face, obstreperous, anything we can do to slow this down type of  behavior because it certainly didn't gain any traction with members of the  Senate.</p><p>There are three members of the Senate being targeted here -- Rand Paul  because the Democrats are hoping that on some of these documents there's  something Brett Kavanaugh said in the Bush years supportive of torture.   That would upset Senator Paul.</p><p>They're also looking for something that might upset Senator Collins and  Senator Murkowski -- and that would be some antipathy toward Roe versus  Wade.</p><p>They also understand that it looks bad if you hold back a document -- it  looks like you have something to hide.  I don't think he has anything to  hide.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It didn't hurt the FBI or DOJ yet.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's not his personal decision not to surrender this.  Under  the Presidential Records Act of 1974, an act that shortly after Richard  Nixon resigned the presidency, you need permission from two people to  release presidential records -- the person who was president at the time  the records are made and the person was president at the time the records  were demanded.</p><p>George W. Bush, who was the president at the time these were made, signed  off on everything.  He doesn't care.  Donald Trump said 100,000 of these --  I don't want the public to seem them.  I'm claiming executive privilege.</p><p>It's a little silly for him to claim executive privilege on a historic  document that precedes his presidency for 15 years, I think.  But he has  the right to do that.</p><p>Today, however, we're going to see the Q and A directly in his face.   You're going to see a very bright judicial mind, but one that is frustrated  because he doesn't want to reveal how he stands on hot button issues like  guns, like the administrative state, like abortion, like torture.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's getting in there -- Judge.  You know, Zina Bash, we talked  about this earlier, one of Brett Kavanaugh's former law clerks -- she's  under severe scrutiny.  Look at this picture right here.</p><p>A video circulated of her making -- she had her hands folded and some on  the left were saying it was a hand gesture.  They said it was a white power  sign that she was putting there. </p><p>Bash's husband is a U.S. attorney.  He came to her defense.  And he tweeted  this in part, Zina is Mexican on her mother's side and Jewish on her  father's side.  She was born in Mexico.  Her grandparents were holocaust  survivors.  We of course have nothing to do with hate groups which aim to  terrorize and demean other people.  Never have and never would.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me add to this.  He called the attacks on my wife repulsive.   \"Some of the Twitter comments have even referred to our baby daughter.\"</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know that there are good folks on both sides of the political  divide.  I hope that people will clearly condemn this idiotic and sickening  accusation.  And the people -- you know what, the people on the left who  are perpetrating this lie, perpetuating this lie online, this is what  people actually see.  They're not sitting and watching these hearings all  day long -- Judge.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well I -- first of all I agree fully with the defense by the  U.S. attorney of his wife's behavior.  I mean this is just over the top.</p><p>But it shows the decision of the Democrats and the hard left in this  country to do anything they can to tarnish this candidate.  What are they  really trying to tarnish?  The person who nominated the candidate.  What  are they really trying to undo relitigate, revote -- what ever phrase you  want to use undo election of 2016. </p><p>This woman is the last woman that would be showing a white power symbol in  that environment.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even the Anti-Defamation League had to come out and that said  this symbol thing is a hoax.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I have to tell you, though -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was created online.  By the way, all these people online, I  saw them, these are well-known individuals who should know better, passing  this information around while they're online.  Go on Amazon and see if can  buy a soul.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To me it seems like desperation.  I think they're worried about  the midterm elections.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think you're right.  They must believe that this type of in  your face, uncivil behavior will generate support among their base.  It  doesn't with me.  It doesn't with Republicans.  I don't know if it does  with moderates.  But somehow they think that this is going to help them  with their own people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's make a lot of noise so that you forget that your  paycheck is higher and the economic situation is a lot better.</p><p>Judge -- you know, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Thank you.  Call again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge Napolitano.  Coming up, former AIG chairman and CEO Hank  Greenberg is with me.  He's going to join me to weigh in, on the escalating  trade tensions with China, tariffs and a lot more.  He's up next.</p><p>Then, a wake-up call for your breakfast cereal.  Listen up.  The new CDC  warning for Kellogg's honey smacks.  Do not buy them.  Do not eat them.   Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  Good morning  everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Wednesday, September 5th.  Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the  East Coast.  </p><p>Trade talks with Canada starting back up today.  Investors are waiting for  another round of tariffs to hit $200 billion in Chinese goods.  That may  very well be executed this week.  The trade tensions are weighing on  markets this morning.  We're off of the lows but nonetheless we're  expecting the Dow Industrials to open down about 80 points, that's one  third of one percent.  The S&amp;P 500 down a quarter of a percent, and the  NASDAQ with av24 point decline down a third of a percent as well.  This  after mostly flat close yesterday for the markets, Dow Industrials gave up  12 points.  It was the NASDAQ that was down 18 the worst performer, a  quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower.  Take a look at the European  Indices with the worst performer in Paris, CAC Quarante down almost one  percent.  </p><p>The Asian markets also in the red overnight, worst performer was Hong Kong.   Hang Seng Index down 2-2/3 percent.  </p><p>Recall alert, more than one million Toyota vehicles are facing recall this  morning after reports that they could cause a fire.  Is your car on the  list?  </p><p>Then the CDC is warning do not eat, do not buy, the very latest on Honey  Smacks and an outbreak here for the cereal.  You'll want to hear the latest  from the CDC on that.  </p><p>And all ages welcome, a Starbucks staffed entirely by senior citizens.  All  those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  </p><p>But first this top story this half an hour, U.S.-China trade tensions front  and center.  President Trump considering additional tariffs on $200 billion  in Chinese goods as the United States looks to up the pressure on Beijing.  </p><p>My next guest has some words for Chinese leadership with the recent op-ed  in the Wall Street Journal, titled: Some Friendly Advice for Chinese  Leaders.  You can't expect to keep receiving favorable trade and investment  terms unless you reciprocate.  Writes, Hank Greenberg.</p><p>Joining me right now, is the former CEO and chairman of AIG and the current  chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr, Hank Greenburg.  </p><p>Hank, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>HANK GREENBURG, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, C.V. STARR:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Now, that op-ed obviously  comes after an incredible amount of experience.  You were the first  business person ever to actually set up shop in China and you've had an  incredible relationship with Chinese leadership.  How do you see the  current trade debacle?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, it's unfortunate.  China is the second largest economy in  the world now.  It will soon be the first economy in the world.  They have  a billion 400 million people.  We have 300 million.  On size alone and all  they've learned in the last 20 and 30 years makes them a candidate to be  the largest economy in the world.  They can't have the same benefits from  us on trade that they had at the beginning.  We helped them quite a bit.   The op-ed points that out.  And I would hope that the Chinese realize that  and we come to an agreement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we get into some of your solutions and the things that  you write in that -- in that piece.  Recently we learned that now, the  president of China, President Xi is dictator for life.  What does that mean  to America?  Let's talk -- this is a -- this is an important development.   You know, we've got a democracy.  We're going to be leading -- we're going  to be dealing with one leader of China for the rest of his life, certainly,  as a dictator.  How does that impact things?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, you said it all.  He made himself the leader for life.   Now, is that going to stick?  Remember, there's only about a billion and a  half -- million and-a-half communist members in China of a population of a  billion, 400 million.  Are they going to be satisfied with President Xi for  life?  Time will tell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, doesn't it -- they may be -- you know, satisfied  or not satisfied.  But doesn't that impact the way we deal with China?   Given the fact that he doesn't care.  He's going to be the leader  regardless.  He could wait and they're in -- and they're in it for the long  run, right?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, maybe.  Things change.  You know, he -- currently he's  the leader for life.  Will that -- will that hold?  Hard to say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know that China has been stealing intellectual property from  America for a long time, forcing this transfer of technology.  They haven't  really opened their markets.  Now they say in five years you will be able  to own an auto company or other -- couple of other industries in China out  and out, rather than having a 49 percent stake in a joint venture.  What's  your take on how fast China is moving in terms of opening its markets to  foreigners?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Very slow.  And as what I said in the op-ed, and I'd say that  to them face-to-face.  They have to have equality now.  They've been at it  long enough.  We've helped them for a long time and it's time -- it's time  the market would open for both sides.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in the op-ed you write the ways that the United States  helped China develop over the years.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they recognize that past assistance?  Is that going to be  helpful in these discussions?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  I think it will be.  Because I don't think, you know, many  people remember all the things we've done for China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does China remember?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Not to say.  I think we have to remind them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in terms of the intellectual; property theft, they will not  admit that they've been actually stealing I.P.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  They don't admit many things, obviously.  But, you know, that's  going to have to change.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, will it change, though, Hank?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  I think it will.  I think it will.  Will it -- will it be --  will they change enough to satisfy us?  Probably not.  But there'll be --  there'll be movement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What does the U.S. need to do?  How are you feeling about the  potential of an additional $200 billion of tariffs moving on this week?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Look, the tariff is only one part of trade.  Does trade create  jobs?  Does it help income?  There are many things that it does.  It's not  just the tariffs.  I mean, we have to keep that in mind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you heard from your colleagues in China the leadership in  China, to discuss the ongoing conversations with the U.S.? </p><p>GREENBURG:  Look, I discuss it all the time with China, with very high  level Chinese, and you know, they understand that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've met President Xi, obviously.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think he views China's future as an equal of the United  States or something more?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Could be something more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, tell us about that.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did does he view China?  What is he looking to do?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  He wants to make China back to what it was a couple hundred  years ago, the Middle Kingdom, at least.  And -- but it's going to go  beyond that.  He wants to control all of Asia, I believe, and, you know, he  occupied the South China Sea islands and they're not supposed to be  militarized.  They are militarized.  And so that's a concern.  So I think  we have -- we have problems with China.  We have to resolve them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, isn't it also true that they want to be the leader in  many of the industries that the U.S. is trying to be the leader in, like  A.I., like, you know, certain technology in terms of -- you know,  technology, driverless cars, whatever the leading technology is that we're  looking at as the growth industries of the future, that's what they want to  win.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, you can't blame them for wanting to do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, sure.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  That's a -- it's up to them.  Remember, many Chinese went to  school in the United States.  Thousands of them.  They go back, many of  them, better educated and more willing to do things that they weren't able  to do before.  That's normal.  But that doesn't mean we have to be enemies.   We have to have a constructive relationship with China.  </p><p>A world with the United States and China as allies is a much safer world  than if we're not.  And that's an important part of this whole  conversation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you want to say to President Trump as he deals with  the leadership in China right now?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  We've got to find a solution.  It can't be just increasing  tariffs.  I mean that's -- China has to recognize, they have to give  foreign companies equality in doing business in China, same as they want in  our country.  And that has to happen.  I think most Chinese businessmen  understand that now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because isn't it true that China is now using its economic  power for its military complex?  You know, we spoke with Devin Nunes, the  chairman of the Intel Committee on the House, and he basically said they're  creating military bases and complexes right up to sea level, getting their  -- the best position across the world, not even near Asia.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, I'm not too worried about that part of it.  I think what  they've done in the South China Sea is I'm concern.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?  Tell us about that.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Yes, these little islands that they claim that China over the - - over the centuries had owned, there's no -- there's no evidence of that.   If they went to court, in the -- in the world court, and they were denied  that they had the right to that, they went ahead anyway.  </p><p>And it was during the -- during the Obama administration, we did nothing.   And now it would be -- now it would be very difficult to extract them from  those -- from those islands.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In your view, will the U.S. be successful in opening up  markets, in getting to -- getting China to change its behavior?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  I'm not sure they'll change their behavior willingly but I  think there'll be change in many areas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And if there isn't?  They're the two largest economies in the  world.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Then we'll -- then we'll have a trade conflict.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GREENBURG:  And it's not in our interest, not in their interest.  I saw the  other day, -- you now, China is building this one road, one infrastructure  around the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GREENBURG:  I see that we're going to do $60 billion of that ourselves.  We  just announced it over the weekend. </p><p>And so, you know, we do have some conflicts.  That's inevitable.  But  doesn't have to mean that we're enemies.  Doesn't have to mean that we  don't try to solve these problems.  I think we can solve a lot of them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the infrastructure announcement was what specifically over  the weekend?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  That we're going to -- we're going to build, with a one -- with  one road, one belt, what the Chinese are doing, we're going to be competing  with them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Hank, it's great to get  your insights on these. </p><p>GREENBURG:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hank Greenberg is the chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr.  </p><p>President Trump is tweeting on Bob Woodward's new book this morning, here's  what he just wrote.  Isn't it a shame that someone can write an article or  book totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is  literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without  retribution or cost.  Don't know why Washington politicians don't change  libel laws.  </p><p>All right, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, Toyota is  recalling over a million cars across the world.  The new warning from  vehicles plagued with a fire risk coming up.  </p><p>And then a heartwarming cup of Joe.  Details on the first Starbucks  reportedly run entirely by senior citizens.  Back in a moment, right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An American hero killed in an insider attack in  Afghanistan.  Cheryl Casone with the detail, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Maria, 42-year-old army  command sergeant major Timothy Bolyard was killed by a member of the Afghan  National Police.  He was the highest enlisted soldier supporting the  Trump's administration new advisor brigade.  The command sergeant major  awarded the bronze star, the nation's fourth highest military decoration on  six different occasions.  Two were given with valor, meaning they were  granted for heroic acts.  He was on his 13th deployment overseas.  </p><p>Well, another headlines this morning, Toyota is recalling more than one  million vehicles to repair a problem with the electrical system that could  start a fire.  The affected models include Prius and C-HR Crossover, SUVs,  most of these were made in Japan between June 2015 and last May.  Toyota  spokesman says 192,000 Prius cars are going to be recalled here in the  United States.  </p><p>Taking a look at shares of Toyota, stock is trading almost one percent  lower in the premarket right now.  </p><p>Well, the CDC says that 30 more people have gotten sick after eating  Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal.  That's a total of 130 cases now over 36  states.  And that includes 34 people that have been hospitalized.  </p><p>Despite the salmonella contamination that was linked to the cereal Honey  Smacks is still being sold in some stores.  In June, Kellogg's recalled  over a million cases of the cereal from more than 30 states due to the  potential contamination.  </p><p>Well, now the CDC is adding three more states to the list that have  reported cases of illness now including Delaware, Maine, and Minnesota.   Shares of Kellogg are up about five percent so far this year.  </p><p>And here's a first, if you're a certain age, looking for a job, you're in  luck.  Starbucks is letting only senior citizens run one of its cafes in  Mexico City.  This is the first in the company's history.  This is a result  of a partnership between Starbucks and the National Institute for the  Elderly which offers of course, jobs to seniors.  Starbucks Mexico  reportedly plans to provide employment to 100 senior adults by next year.  </p><p>Taking a look at the stock right now, down seven percent this year.  </p><p>By the way, Maria, all of the employees, it's going to be an entirely  senior citizen run store, they have to be or they are right now between the  ages of 55 and 60 and they get medical benefits.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that. </p><p>CASONE:  My God.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We all love that.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  The nicest person I've run  into in an Apple store was this retired older gentleman who helped me and  who knew more than the guy who was maybe 50 years his junior.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.  Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, the economy under Trump, we are taking a closer look ahead of  the August jobs report. We got the preview Big Friday this week.  That's  next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets have been under pressure this morning.   Take a look at Futures, indicating a decline of 90 points on the Dow Jones  Industrial average and 27 points on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Second quarter growth was pretty impressive.  September though is  historically a slow month for markets.  What will help bolster their  confidence?  </p><p>Joining us now is Troy Gayeski he's senior portfolio manager of SkyBridge  Capital.  And Troy, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>TROY GAYESKI, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Yes, great to  be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you expecting a tough September for markets?  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, given the recent run-up we are expecting more  consolidation.  I mean, if you look at the path of this year we had a huge  run-up in January, then a correction and a long period of consolidation.   We've only recently made new highs.  And now some of the dark clouds are  gathering in terms of trade, other issues, slower growth overseas, emerging  markets are in the midst of almost a full-blown crisis now.  </p><p>So, we are expecting a slightly tougher month.  That being said, we don't  expect a correction north of 10 percent, maybe two to three percent, upside  to five.  So there's no reason to overreact in the short term.  Because the  fundamentals of the U.S. economy are still extremely strong.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO, ROSECLIFF:  I agree with you, Troy, on  your assessment.  But what I -- what I take a bullish stance on is that,  you're getting so many negatives in the market.  You know, you hear the old  expression in the markets climbs the wall.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  But we're nowhere close to where everybody is saying, you know,  sell your house, get in the market, you need to be in the market with  everything you have.  So I think as long as that concern and worry is out  there, it's a bullish sign for the market.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  We don't disagree over the medium to long term.  The point is,  over the next week or two, with some of these issues festering,  particularly overseas, you see Indonesia been the latest emerging mark to  get taken down last night and today, that just argues for softness over the  next week or two.  But over the medium to long-term, we expect this bull  market to continue and newer highs to be made.  </p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, CHRYSLER AND HOME DEPOT:  We were talking  earlier, some of the areas that you're now focusing on relative to  investment.  Why don't you share with us what those are?  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.  So, we continue to focus on the credit quality of regional  community banks.  You know, if you think of the massive regulatory relief  that's occurred there, the benefits of from tax reform, there's also  benefits in terms of better lending margins there than the larger banks.</p><p>What you have is a setup where you can make, you know, high single digit  cash flows.  Because these are floating rate securities, they're still low  dollar prices.  And at the same time, you're going to get paid your  principal back faster.  So, we think that's -- you know, a low teens type  return profile for the next several years with much less downside risk if  we do have a surprise bear market or recession.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We got the Friday job reports out this week.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The August jobs numbers.  You say if we see less or fewer than  200,000 jobs it signals a path toward overheating the market.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, the point there is if, say we get a 150 number and at the  same time unemployment drops 3.7 to 3.8.  What that means is there's a  little more pressure on the Fed to hike because we don't have as many  marginally attached workers to pull back in.  </p><p>That's been really the big success that, you know, that Janet Yellen has,  is pulling marginally attached workers and now Jay Powell back in the labor  force, running things little hotter than perhaps a lot of the Phillips  curve crowd would've thought in terms of inflation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want to short this market right here?  </p><p>GAYESKI:  No, it's a -- it's a losing bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Yes, because you look at where technology is, trillion  dollar companies, now Amazon joins the trillion dollar club.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes, shorting tech in the strike is the way to bullet fast.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good quote.</p><p>GAYESKI:  You just ask -- you just ask people from the 90s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Troy Gayeski.</p><p>Stay with Fox Business.

Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>REP. GREG WALDEN (R-OR), CHAIRMAN, ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Good  morning.  Good morning.  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your committee is going to be questioning Jack Dorsey as to  how his company's algorithms police its users and contents.  Tell us what's  most important in terms of what you are looking to solicit from Jack  Dorsey.  </p><p>WALDEN:  Well, we want to look at the wizard behind the curtain.  Who is  pulling the levers, who's turning the dials, how fair are these algorithms,  how do they work, you know, there are lots of reports of conservative  voices that have been shadow banned they alleged or have been shut down or  it goes on and on.  And we want to get to the bottom of it and find out  why.  Look, these are really important American companies.</p><p>They are iconic and they are the voice in Democracy now and they have  incredible responsibility it comes with this amazing power to communicate  that they brought to the public square. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, Congressman because people this morning are  wondering, you know, how you view this company, and the lot of people get  their news from Twitter.</p><p>WALDEN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you see Twitter as a media company?  </p><p>WALDEN:  Absolutely.  You know, we had five hours with Mark Zuckerberg  before the committee earlier this year and I asked that very question, what  is Facebook?  And when you get to the cut to the chase they are media  companies in many respects because they do determine what content flows  through at what rate and what speed and to what audience in effect because  they have algorithms that do that.</p><p>And, you know, in today's world, 280 characters moving around the globe  with the speed of light and electricity.  If you're left out of that  discussion for 24 hours while they fix a mistake, you're left out of that  debate.  I'm an old journalism graduate, I owned radio stations, I'm a  first amendment protector, I love free speech even when I disagree with it.   And these platforms now have incredible power to affect free speech.</p><p>And we need to make sure there is a thumb on scale against one viewpoint or  another.</p><p>MURPHY:  Congressman, it's Mike Murphy.  When you look at Twitter and  Facebook and Google, with your background, do you seem like the -- one of  the most a qualified people to make this assessment, do you think they need  more regulation?  New regulation?  Or is it possible they -- just no  regulation?  </p><p>WALDEN:  Well, Mike, we've grown up in the era of no regulation.  When you  look at the online companies, it's part of why they flourished and started  and have succeed here in America because of our first amendment rights and  our view, that speech should only be regulated in the most extreme  circumstances.  You don't -- you don't call fire in a crowded theatre.   Going forward, we want to be careful here that we don't we -- don't get too  much regulation.</p><p>The first thing you have to do is get to the facts.  How do these systems  work, how do these decisions get made.  Is there unfair influence inside?   Look, it's no secret, Silicon Valley tilts a little to the left.  And the  question is does that somehow seep into how these systems operate, they're  incredibly valuable companies, they're about incredibly important to  democracies around the world.</p><p>But when you begin to feel like you're being shut down whatever and we have  instances of that and they're generally on the Republican side that  conservative side, I've got colleagues that feel like they've been shut  down at least for a period of time or delayed or their ad didn't go up, I  very seldom hear from colleagues on the left that their stuff has been  delayed or shut down or whatever.</p><p>So they've got issues here, some of the companies have owned up to it, jack  has owned up to it in a couple of instances, so they have made mistakes, we  heard that Facebook made mistakes.  Our job is to figure out how does that  happen?  Are they mistakes, are they intentional?  How do we -- how do we  get them to self-regulate and if they can't, it's why Energy and Commerce  Committees doing the oversight.</p><p>We have the authority to do the legislation going forward if necessary.  </p><p>NARDELLI:  So, Mr. Chairman, Bob Nardelli here.  I mean, exactly to that  point when we hear about people being shut out or suspended, I mean, do you  think you will hear from Mr. Dorsey exactly how those decisions are made  and will that lead to Mike's question about regulation and transparency in  the future?  </p><p>WALDEN:  Well, We have Mr. Dorsey's testimony, it's up online on  energycustomers.house.gov/ -- the -- for the hearing today anyway,  energycommerce.house.gov site.  And you'll find the testimony there for  Jack Dorsey.  And you'll see he says, look, we don't, we don't use  political influence here, we've got algorithms, we try to be neutral, we  believe in, you know, the public health of the internet ecosystem.</p><p>But the question is, it happens and we hear it happening and we're trying  to find out how does it happen.  So this is about getting to transparency,  this is about getting to accountability before we get to any legislation.   It's really important here that we get to the facts.  That's what -- that's  what underpins our work.  We had a hearing in Energy and Commerce, we go  back on algorithms.  Just the general overview.</p><p>How do they work?  Most consumers don't think about what's behind what  brings up their feeds and the subjects in their feeds and the topics and  the coverage.  And I think they have a right to know in this platform.   These are, you know, you think about in terms of debate on the public  square and the importance of these media companies now and that's what they  really are.  Look, they sell advertising, they interconnect questions.</p><p>Are they kind of a common carrier in the internet age and I'm not saying  they are.  But wow, if you're the -- if you're the connecting points among  300 million people and you can alter what is seen, heard or said?  That's  pretty powerful censorship and that's a tool that I think needs public  scrutiny.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Congressman, it goes beyond  censorship -- it's Dagen McDowell.  It's also the reckless disregard for  people's privacy and their most personal information and how particularly  Google and Facebook make money off of that, and they're not being  forthcoming to those very users.  </p><p>Can you definitively say even before this hearing given the fact that  Google and Facebook control the vast amount of advertising that we  experience online, that is already too much power and too few hands?  </p><p>WALDEN:  Well, I'm not ready to say that today.  But I do believe when you  look at the concentration of online advertising among just a few companies,  it's enormous market power and share.  And you have to throw in Amazon and  some of the others, and I think these are the issues as these companies  have grown up rapidly, aggressively, effectively in this internet world we  that have to ask as representatives of the people.</p><p>Is there unfair competition here, is there is too much market concentration  here, is too much power in the hands of a very few people who literally you  could have a rogue employee shut down the Twitter account and of the  President of the United States.  Oh, I guess that happened, didn't it short  -- for a short period of time.  That's amazing ability.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  And so I think these are the questions we're trying to get answers  to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are -- where are the executives from Google and YouTube?   I remember a couple of weeks ago during the California primary if you  Googled GOP in California, ideologies, one of those ideologies that came up  on Google was Nazism.  </p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has that been fixed?  </p><p>WALDEN:  That's been fixed I'm told.  Kevin McCarthy has done a great job  elevating these issues into the bigger public square of debate and it is  drawing attention therefore fixings.  But why should we have to do that?   Why does that happen to begin with?  There's example after example.  And  believe me, I sent a letter about a month and a half ago to all these CEOs  saying it's better to come before our committee.</p><p>Before you're in middle of one of these crisis and talk to American people  through their elected representatives about how your platform or your  product really works.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WALDEN:  Privacy matters.  I don't people understands the goods for  services exchange here.  The goods is everything you put up, everything  about you, all that content, then is used.  The question is, are they  following their own disclosure agreements and -- with consumers?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  And I'm not sure they are.  And by the way, whoever reads those  pages of the privacy form, right?  And what are you going to do?  Not  click, yes, not click, agree?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WALDEN:  Because you have to be on platforms in today's world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And who's signing on the bottom line that yes, I agree, a 16- year-old.</p><p>WALDEN:  Fourteen-year-old, a 16 year-old, an 86-year-old.  Who knows,  right?  We're all doing it because you don't have an option.  If you want  to communicate in today's world you have to do this like having mobile  phone, it's like anything else.  Who's using that data?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, are these companies too big?  </p><p>WALDEN:  We're going to find out.  I mean, that's the thing.  Now, look, I  don't think big is always bad but when big becomes a monopoly , when big  becomes abusive or big overexerts, then you've got a problem some of which  can be dealt with the Federal Trade Commission.  But I want to know are  people putting phones on the scale, have they gotten to a market  concentration level where they squeeze out any competition?</p><p>Remember, they were they young upstarts a decade ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WALDEN:  Some of these companies didn't exist two decades ago, most didn't.   And so, I mean, you think about the rapid explosion, the incredible  concentration of power.  I go back to the old says, AT&amp;T and Judge Greene,  you know, at some point, you know, things do -- if people don't behave if  there's too much market concentration, things get broken up.  And so, I --  you know, I'm not that's where we're headed.</p><p>I want to lay the framework but Google and YouTube and Apple and these  other companies need to understand they will end up before a committee one  way or another before we're done with our work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it --</p><p>WALDEN:  It's important to hear from them, they should not fear this.  They  go out in public and public forums talk all the time than before Congress.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it could be where you're headed breakups.  </p><p>WALDEN:  I'm not saying that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>WALDEN:  I'm just saying let's get to the answers, let's figure it out, is  there adequate competition but, you know, I think about in my old broadcast  industry, you think about national caps and ownership and audiences and so  many stations in the market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And AT&amp;T was broken up.  Yes.  Now, I get it.</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, we're going to be watching.  Thanks very much for  leading this discussion today.</p><p>WALDEN:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we'll be broadcasting it live.  Congressman Walden, good to  see you, sir.  Thank you very much.</p><p>WALDEN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stay with us for live coverage Dorsey and Sandberg testifying  before Congress in the Energy and Commerce Committee this morning at 9:30  a.m. Eastern.  We will have it for you live.  Plus, coming up.  Theranos is  shutting its doors for good now.  Details on the reported end of the blood  testing firm, that's next.  Then, move over James Bond.  We check out the  smartphone that wraps around your wrist coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets are under pressure this morning.  Take a look at  futures down about 90 points.  There is uncertainty over the trade talks  with Canada which will resume today.  Christa Frieland is in Washington  talking with Bob Lighthizer about potential of a deal.  And then of course  we're waiting on any deal with China.  We may see more tariffs put in place  this week from the Trump administration.  That's where markets are lower.</p><p>Meanwhile this, a child is killed as Tropical Storm Gordon makes landfall.   Cheryl Casone with headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  What could be the first of  many large storms, Maria, this year.  This storm never reached hurricane  strength as feared but still it was deadly.  A tree crashing on top of a  mobile home in Pensacola, Florida that killed a young child. The storm made  landfall near the Alabama-Mississippi border, bringing winds at the 70  miles per hour, and torrential rainfall.</p><p>Some areas can see more than eight inches of rain before this storm is said  and done.  Well, the once high-flying blood testing firm Theranos taking  its final bow following a fraud scandal.  The company will formally  dissolve and will pay unsecured creditors its remaining crash in the coming  month, that's according to report in today's The Wall Street Journal.  All  of this coming after Federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against  Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.</p><p>And the number two executive alleging they defrauded doctors, patients, and  investors of millions of dollars.  Well, speaking of millions, Amazon  founder Jeff Bezos and his wife are making their first major political  contribution, $10 million.  This is going to go to a super PAC that aims to  help military veterans get elected to Congress.  The With Honor funds is  only a year old that backs veterans that are running for House seats in  both parties.</p><p>The super PAC's founder said that Bezos shared his group's goal of building  a cross partisan coalition of House members that are willing to work with  the other party.  Imagine that.  </p><p>And then finally there is this.  A modern twist on the old Dick Tracy wrist  radio.  A Chinese company has released a smartphone that you wear on your  wrist.  It plays, it plays videos, tracks your fitness and you can even pay  for purchases with it.  Nubia hopes to launch the phone by the end of the  year.  The price as much as $1,000.  But it's smaller than an iPhone X,  Maria.  There you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>CASONE:  You might keep your Fitbit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, Nike's polarizing decision.  How  the NFL is responding at the athletic company chose Colin Kaepernick as the  new face of its latest ad campaign.  Then, Italy's former Prime Minister  Mario Manti is here live.  He will weigh in on everything from the economy  to immigration and what's happening in Italy, how it looks like the U.S. in  terms of economic policy.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the new government in Italy already  marking 100 days in office from an economic standpoint to a stance on  immigration.  The parallels to the Trump administration are piling up as  well.  Joining me right now to talk about Italy, the E.U. and its  relationship with the U.S. is the former prime minister of Italy, Prime  Minister Mario Monti.  Mr. Prime Minister, it's good to see you again.</p><p>MARIO MONTI, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  What's your  take on how Italy is doing right now in terms of the economic policies and  that drive toward growth once again?  </p><p>MONTI:  This is a government of rapture composed of two with populist  parties, the league which is more on right wing and five-star movement  which is more -- a new form of populism.  The rapture consists of mainly in  two things, one, they want a new relationship with the European Union which  I'm afraid they don't understand yet very well in its functioning and in  its huge positive impact on each member state.</p><p>And then they would like to behave a bit as if the budget constraints,  fiscal discipline was not there.  Of course, these are two important points  of friction with the rest of Europe and with the Italian economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MONTI:  The jury is out.  I myself in the Senate abstained on the  confidence vote because I think it is fair to give them a chance.  And also  with the rather sclerotic capitalist system as we have in Italy with a few  exceptions.  It's good also to have a new forcing some change.  But the  point is that so far they've not done much, they've been divided between  the two parties.</p><p>And they put up more ambitious challenges and huge promises which would  bring any financial balance down for Italy with major problems for the  markets and for Europe.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, a problem for the market would be if you  actually do see an upset to the budget with so much spending.</p><p>MONTI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell us where the issues are, is it the spending issue or is  it a flat tax?  Italy's 15 percent flat tax is being talked about.  This is  something completely new and different than we haven't seen in Italy  before.  </p><p>MONTI:  Exactly.  And in Italy tax evasion, it's vital the progress of the  last several years is still high.  And I personally believe it will be  better to concentrate on further efforts to bring down tax evasion rather  than in making this opening.  Having said that, the overall tax pressure in  Italy is high, it needs to be brought down but more though cutting  expenditures first.  And there they have no idea on how to proceed.</p><p>Nevertheless I don't want to be too pessimistic.  Yesterday, the world for  the first time, a meeting of the leadership of the league as a component of  the government and that, Mr. Salvini apparently they came up with a rather  moderate proposal that they want to startle these reforms of flat tax  (INAUDIBLE) income but for the first time, they said we need further time  at least to stick with the budgetary constraints set by the E.U.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Overtime, do you think a flat tax, lower taxes in Italy even  though we know that, you know, you got to get the Italians to pay taxes but  I mean, lower taxes, will that bring in businesses to create jobs in Italy  in your view?  </p><p>MONTI:  Other things being equal, yes, but with the flat tax, I believe  that one major problem would not be saved that is the huge inequality of  income and wealth which is there throughout the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, sure.</p><p>MONTI:  But in Italy particularly so, and so I do not believe that the  overall climate in the country and the society would be facilitated by this  measure to further reduce the progressivity rate of the tax system.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Prime Minister, tell us what else is going on in terms of  borders because I know that the Italian populists are driving the E.U. to  tighten up and toughen policies on migration.  Angela Merkel under fire  because of open borders in Germany.  What has been the impact of the  borders and the changes there?  </p><p>MONTI:  The number of immigrants into Italy has been declining relative to  one year ago.  And is small relative to other E.U. countries.   Nevertheless, according to recent polls, Italians believe that the size of  immigration is fourfold relative to its real size.  So huge psychological  and political concerns.  Therefore, this is a primary call made by new  government on Europe to become tougher on immigration.</p><p>And at the same time, to redeploy to other member states, those part of  those flows of refugees which naturally because of geographical reasons  come into Italy.  The problem is that maybe because of their little  knowledge about the E.U. works, there is total inconsistency there because  for example, Hungary under Prime Minister Orban is a country which took  novelty in terms of its share of refugees.</p><p>And it would like Hungary the E.U. to have even smaller powers to force  others to participate in this.  What did Mr. Salvini who is interior  ministers -- plus deputy prime minister, well, he picked Mr. Orban as his  chief ally in internal diplomatic negotiations within Europe which is  totally inconsistent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What is your take on trade right now?  Do you think that  the leadership in Italy and in the E.U. are poised to do a new deal with  the U.S. in terms of trade?  </p><p>MONTI:  Yes.  But I must say that we are upset about the U.S. President's  conception of governments.  I believe that it is not even in the interest  of the still dominant U.S. in the world economy to maybe dismantle not only  specific trade agreements but the President recently mentioned we will stay  within the WTO under certain conditions.</p><p>In my view, a country which is so dominant but facing of course the up rise  of China is doing exactly the opposite of its own interests to keep America  first as much as possible which would be to reinforce not to bring down the  multilateral trading system.  Of course, Europe is particularly upset by  this position of President Trump because Europe was built after the war  very much so and under American influence and stimulation on a system of  gradually freer multilateral trade.</p><p>So, it's very hard for us to cope with this new wave of the U.S. under this  point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what will the Italians do then?</p><p>MONTI:  The -- you know, trade policies very much in the hands of Brussels  but each country can influence that Italy will be -- we don't know yet  because under the current government which seems to be a bit more  protectionist, Italy might be not so forcefully making E.U. liberal  position.  But honestly, they haven't expressed themselves very much so  far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post recently.  Europe  promotes competition more than America.</p><p>MONTI:  This is interesting.  A recent research of the (INAUDIBLE) school  of NYU has come up with the fact that consumers in Europe are at an  advantage in recent years relative to consumers in the U.S. which is  paradoxical because until 20 years ago, this country, the U.S. was the  engine of free markets, and consumer attention is much greater here.  But  it is true that Europeans with building up of the single market of the  Euro, and with a very strong competition policy, you might remember some  indicators of that strength.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I do.  I remember when you stopped the Honeywell and G.E.  deal, that's for sure.</p><p>MONTI:  And if we look ahead at the subjects hotly discussed this day, the  high-tech the big data regulation on privacy and antitrust applied to all  data.  It's easy to foresee that because competition enforcement is  stronger, less politically cyclical, more stable in the E.U. this will  cause problems because on the other hand, most high-tech companies are, of  course, is in the U.S. but they do a huge business in the E.U, so they're  under the compliance rules of the E.U.  And in the psychology of looming  trade wars, we must all be cold, rational, and work together to avoid that  the next time that commissioner (INAUDIBLE) in Brussels takes another  decision on Google or Facebook or Apple, that is perceived in the U.S. as  if it were a protectionist move -- a trade war it simply is not. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a very good point, and you refer, of course, to the big  fine that Google is paying right now.  And of course, we've got these  technology discussions in Washington today.  Mr. Prime Minister, it's great  to get your insights.  Thanks so much.</p><p>MONTI:  My pleasure.  Thank you (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Prime Minister Mario Monti.  We'll be right back.  Stay with  us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good to have you with us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   Back at the negotiating table, the U.S. and Canada are set to resume trade  talks later today in Washington.  This, after President Trump signaled over  the weekend he would be willing to move on without Canada in a new NAFTA  agreement, just the U.S. and Mexico.  Trade tensions taking a toll on  markets this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a decline at the  start of trading, up better than 100 points.  The NASDAQ, the S&amp;P 500 also  lower right now.  </p><p>Joining me right now is the founder and chairman of Equity International,  billionaire, real estate investor, Sam Zell.  Sam, it's great to see you.</p><p>SAM ZELL, FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN, EQUITY INTERNATIONAL:  Great to see you,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Do you worry about these  trade issues?</p><p>ZELL:  I think that the trade issues are issues that probably should have  been brought up a long time ago.  These agreements are old.  And, you know,  after 25 years of NAFTA which had a lot of foreign policy elements to it,  adjusting it makes sense.  It's hard for me to believe that any resolution  here is not going to include both Mexico and Canada.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  I mean -- you know, Canada is sticking to its guns and  basically saying, we can't lose this, we can't lose that, there are certain  things that it's not going to move on.</p><p>ZELL:  But the one thing they can't lose is NAFTA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  The one thing they can't lose is the deal with America  and Mexico, right?</p><p>ZELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think at some point, this will take care of itself?  Do  you think that's what markets think?</p><p>ZELL:  That's -- I mean, I'm -- I mean, obviously, I'm not privy to it, but  it feels -- it feels like it's going to get resolved.  I happened to talk  to one of the Mexican negotiators last week who was very enthusiastic about  getting it done.  So, I think, the momentum is in the same direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, your thoughts on the broad economic story.   We've been having a debate this morning, Sam, about, OK, we just saw two  quarters of four percent plus growth.</p><p>ZELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's this narrative that things are going to slow down  in the next two years, how do you see it?</p><p>ZELL:  Well, I think that, you know, everybody has been predicting the next  two year slowdown for about four years now.  So -- and for four years, you  know, we haven't had, you know, an end to \"the longest string of positive  scenarios,\" you know, almost 10 years of positive environment.  I think the  question and I asked a Nobel Prize winner of this question, about six  months ago, we have just come through eight years of subpar growth.  The  U.S. system is built for, you know, give or take a three percent growth  rate.  Now, that we've had 10 years of less than two.  Do you have an end  to it?  Or, do you have to have a catch-up before there's an end to it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ZELL:  I don't know the answer -- by the way, the Nobel laureate didn't  know the answer either.  But I think there's a serious question as to  whether the long period of subpar growth is delaying the normal cyclical  response.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, do you think just because we've -- we're seeing this  stability now and, you know, four percent growth, and perhaps three percent  for the year, that it has to reverse within a couple of years?  Just  because the Fed is raising interest rates?</p><p>ZELL:  The answer is, no, it doesn't have to.  History says, rising  interest rates eventually slow down the economy.  We're starting from a  very low base, so it may delay the impact for quite some time.  But  generally speaking, I think the economy is doing as well as it has because  there's been a change in attitude in Washington.  Some of you described to  me the other day, they're in a heavily-regulated industry, and prior to the  '16 election, every discussion with the regulator was how much the  punishment should be?  And today, the conversation with regulator is how do  we avoid a punishment?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>ZELL:  That's a huge, huge change of circumstance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's also a change of circumstances when you look at business  managers were sitting on capital for so long.  They were sitting on cash  unwilling to put it to work, and now, they're actually putting it in deals,  in I.T., in R&amp;D, you've been a seller of commercial real estate, you've  been telling us this now for a couple of times when you've been on the  show, you're still a seller.</p><p>ZELL:  I'm still a seller.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?  Tell us what you see happening in commercial real estate  right now.</p><p>ZELL:  Well, I think that, to begin with, we're experiencing supply.  I  mean, we came out of the great recession with no commercial real estate  activity.  We've never quite had that before, we had a three or four-year  period where there was no supply added.  And then, everybody kind of said,  well, maybe supply is OK.  And they're building (INAUDIBLE) they're  building in San Francisco, and they're, you know, adding 500,000  multifamily units in 2017.</p><p>So, I think we're about to see the impact of supply, and to some extent,  we've seen it already in the multihousing area like in New York -- you  know, with the growth rate has gone from -- you know, rents the gone from  maybe plus five to plus one.  And there's a lot of concessions and weakness  in the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How would you characterize residential real estate right now,  prices are going to come down there, too?</p><p>ZELL:  I think it very much depends on where -- I mean, I don't understand  these super, super expensive apartments in New York.  I've always felt that  it was a way of hiding money, not you know, not owning real estate.  You  know, on the other side of the coin, you know, we're seeing starter housing  not selling -- to a large extent is because at least in theory, people can  afford it, people have got, you know, student debt and other things that  are impairing them from taking advantage of starter housing.  So, we'll see  how that works out, but I think the magic as far as real estate is  concerned right now is supply. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet, you've been a buyer of things like, what, logistics,  waste, energy.  Tell me about energy, and where you think the opportunities  are right now.</p><p>ZELL:  I mean, we've been -- we're involved in a lot of different places,  we're involved in fracking in Bakken.  We're involved in logistics in the  Permian.  We're involved in the stack, buying up old depleted wells.  We're  building a -- we're building a company called PAR Energy which is a  refinery company and we're buying refineries that, you know, material  discounts, huge discounts to what it would cost to replace them.  That's  been a formula that generally has worked in real estate and any other kind  of heavy assets. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, tapping into the energy potential was a good  idea.  Because that's not just a job creator but it's an economic growth  stimulus.</p><p>ZELL:  Yes.  But remember that the response to this opportunity has been --  has in the past been to allocate enormous amounts of capital to it without  much discipline.  The thing that's, you know, separating '18 from '16 is  the fact that there's real discipline in the oil patch today that there  wasn't two years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about the stock market, Sam, where do you see that?  Is  that overvalued in your view, still?</p><p>ZELL:  Well, we ask -- when you use the word \"stock market\" what is the  stock market?  Is the stock market -- you know, the seven things stocks  which are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how about tech?  How about tech?</p><p>ZELL:  I look at trading at -- I mean, I just -- I think, in my own  judgment, was to do a little mathematics, if you take the company trading  125 times earnings that means in five years it has to be 25 percent of the  U.S. economy.  As good as those companies are, ain't none of them are going  to be 25 percent of the U.S. economy.  So, you know -- and by the way, the  last time, you know, I did that calculation was 1997 and the company was  Cisco.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We know what happened to Cisco.</p><p>ZELL:  And we know what happened to Cisco.  And I'm not portraying, you  know, gloom and doom, I'm just saying that 125 times earnings means that  you're willing to accept the return of significantly less than one percent  for your investment.  Maybe people out there who think that's terrific --  not me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A great analysis, Sam.  It's great to see you, thanks so much.</p><p>ZELL:  Great to see you, Maria.  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sam Zell joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back.  We want to turn out to a Democratic  primary shocker in Massachusetts yesterday, far-left candidate Ayanna  Pressley taking out a 10-term incumbent Congressman in a double-digit win.   Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.   Stu, what a day, what did you make of her win?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, what a margin of  victory.  I understand that it was supposed to be a very tight race, but in  the end, it was not a tight race, 59-41 is a gigantic margin of victory.   That's a real shock.  But the shock is how far-left the Democrat Party is  being pulled for the November midterm.  Looks to me like they're going into  that vote on the basis of supporting free college, open borders, Medicare  for all, and impeach Trump.  That seems to be the overriding position taken  by Democrats going into the midterms.  I'm not sure America is really ready  for that.  I just don't think it is quite frankly, and I'd be horrified if  it was to go for that kind of socialism but that's the writing on wall for  the Democrats of the moment.  I'd have to say that Nancy Pelosi is not  happy with the result yesterday in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's pretty incredible, Stu.  We'll see how this all plays  out come November.  And I know you'll have more on it in the top of the  hour.  Thanks so much.  We'll see you on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart.  Top  of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA, join Stuart and company,  coming up.  Coming up, first though, Amazon's new milestone, yes, a  trillion dollars.  Details on the e-commerce giant hitting a trillion  dollars in market value right after Apple did so.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  -- their plan on having  more models by the year 2022 in order to get in the new generation of  bikers, Maria.  So, this is something that they are doing, of course, we  know the controversy of them moving over some of the production over in  Europe, but this is about Silicon Valley and bringing it in, but what's  very interesting is that you won't even have a clutch, no clutch.  Twist  and go vehicles are coming.  Electric vehicles -- motorcycles from Harley- Davidson.  </p><p>Then we continue the story on Nike.  This is the controversy -- this just  as the football season is beginning, Nike dropped off more than three  percent yesterday, they're certainly getting plenty of free advertising,  people are jumping on the Nike boycott hashtag, burning their sneakers,  cutting their swooshes, but so many others are showing support.  The NFL  put out a soft statement talking about understanding in dialogue and are  communities.  At the same time President Trump came out and said -- saying  that he thought it was a terrible message, but it's their right to make up  their own business decisions.  Some of the analysts are mixed on this one.</p><p>Last but not least, Amazon trillion dollars, it hit it yesterday, it has  six straight records.  We're going to watch to see what's next.  Is it  Microsoft or Google?  But Amazon, an exciting day, now the second U.S.  company to break through that trillion-dollar mark.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  I know we're expecting a  lower opening for the broader averages.  We'll check that out when we come  right back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a picture of my dad and me making pizza with my sister  in honor of National Cheese Pizza Day.  Happy Cheese Pizza Day, everybody.   Let's get final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Bob Nardelli?</p><p>NARDELLI:  (INAUDIBLE) profound impact on our country.  Supreme Court  hearing and the whole thing on tech that we've been talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  Mark -- Mike Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY:  Watching the hearings in Washington, and technology will be very  interesting to see how that plays out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would like to see Twitter start selling souls to the people  who need them who are spewing hate on the social media platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stop the hate!  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  Dagen  McDowell, Mike Murphy, Bob Nardelli, great day.  Go seize that day,  everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, seize the day, Maria.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, Maria.  And good morning, everyone.  Great to be  back.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

One of Silicon Valley's most high-profile entrepreneurs, the 41-year-old founder and chief executive of both the microblogging service Twitter and the payments company Square is not one for personal chit chat. Perhaps running two companies does not give him the time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a public event in London earlier this month, Dorsey was asked a series of quick-fire, light-hearted questions by his interlocutor. \"Savoury or sweet?\" - that sort of thing. Nothing controversial, but Dorsey declines to be put on the spot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Both,\" Dorsey says in response to the question about his culinary tastes. The interviewer tries again: \"Cats or dogs?\" Once again, Dorsey responds \"both\", before eventually saying that he keeps chinchillas.</p><p>Dorsey is best known for founding Twitter 12 years ago. In March 2006 he published the first tweet (\"just setting up my twttr\"), before leaving the company under a cloud two years later, and returning as chief executive in 2015. One wonders if, given the company's growth since then, Dorsey\u00a0wishes the first tweet had been more profound.</p><p>It's not a question he is prepared to answer though, because on this occasion Twitter is another subject Dorsey declines to take questions on.</p><p>While peculiar for a chief executive to deflect questions about his own company, it is one of the dilemmas of Dorsey's dual identity. Twitter is off limits because he is in the UK to promote his other entity, Square. After Dorsey left the microblogging service, he struck up an idea with Jim McKelvey, a software entrepreneur who had run a firm in Dorsey's home town of St Louis, Missouri, where Dorsey had interned as a 15-year-old.</p><p>just setting up my twttr</p><p>- jack (@jack) March 21, 2006                                                                                  </p><p>McKelvey's career had taken an unconventional step into glass blowing, but he was frustrated at his business being unable to accept credit cards. Two years earlier the iPhone had just launched, but small businesses still need bulky equipment to take card payments. Dorsey and McKelvey hacked together a scanner that plugged into a smartphone's headphone jack, and converted its information into an audio signal that could be decoded by an app. Square was launched in 2010 as a way for small businesses to take credit card payments using a smartphone or tablet. It takes a 1.75pc fee on transactions, while its software lets businesses manage their finances. In the US, it also offers loans to small businesses that are then paid back by taking a cut of sales, as well as an app for consumers that lets them send money back and forth. Last year it launched its credit card reader in the UK,\u00a0although other parts of the business are US-only.</p><p>Dorsey has been chief executive since, even after taking the reins at Twitter for a second time three years ago. The dual roles have led to tension, most notably in 2015 when Twitter's board demanded he step down from running Square if he wanted the job. Dorsey refused to budge, and Twitter's directors eventually buckled.</p><p>The decision seems to have worked out, though. Under Dorsey Twitter's shares have arrested a lengthy decline since its 2013 flotation. Square, which went public in November 2015, has quadrupled in value since then. For a brief moment in November, its market value surpassed that of Twitter. Today it hovers close to it, worth $18.8bn (\u00a313.3bn) compared to Twitter's $21.4bn. Most of Dorsey's own $3.7bn net worth comes from Square, in which he holds a 15pc stake.</p><p>Not that financial gain appears to be Dorsey's main priority. In fact, he ascribes Square's success to taking a different approach to established financial companies, such as banks and payment handling firms. \"A lot of the institutions we came across [when starting Square] were optimising profit versus scale,\" he says.</p><p>\"We decided that we would include as many people as possible, so we took on a different mindset.\"</p><p>If profit is not the goal, what is? \"Our purpose is economic empowerment,\" Dorsey says. \"We saw the financial industry of the past exclude a lot of people, not necessarily intentionally but because they weren't using technology in the right way, they weren't using modern systems and we saw a real opportunity to solve a real problem.\"</p><p>He says when Square started only 30pc of businesses in the US that applied to accept credit cards were accepted. His company's figure was 99pc, because it was willing to take on more risk. \"It's just a very different mindset and we had the technology to back it up.\"</p><p>Dorsey is a clear introvert. He rarely gets animated when speaking, seemingly placing a lot more importance on the words he says than the way in which they are delivered. He is almost always dressed in black.</p><p>                   Bitcoin price: last 365 days                   </p><p>But it would be a mistake to interpret that as evidence of\u00a0a lack of enthusiasm. Dorsey is\u00a0known as a compulsive \u00ad&#x2028;self-improver - his daily routine involves waking early, meditating and walking the five miles to Twitter's San Francisco office listening to a podcast before spending the afternoon at Square, whose office is across the street.</p><p>One of his current obsessions is Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, a topic that many other financial industry executives have dismissed, and which institutions have distanced themselves from. Last year Square allowed users of its money transfer app to buy up to $10,000 in Bitcoin a week. The service does not exist in the UK, although Dorsey adds a telling \"yet\". And while the move may have been seen as a cheap attempt to cash in on the surge in Bitcoin's price last year, Dorsey insists\u00a0otherwise.</p><p>\"I believe we're the first public company to offer Bitcoin. It's technology that will definitely change our industry and we believe that we will help change it for the positive. Instead of waiting for things to happen\u00a0to us we wanted to help make them happen.\"</p><p>His other company, Twitter, banned cryptocurrency adverts last week, but Dorsey is far from modest in his expectations for Bitcoin.</p><p>He says finance is one of the few areas that remain controlled by a handful of institutions, and that the cryptocurrency, which runs on a \"decentralised\" network of computers rather than a handful of administrators, will change that.</p><p>\"I do believe that the world will utilise a global currency and I think the world will utilise one that is decentralised,\" he says.</p><p>\"The internet, which represents this unbridled communication network that the whole world can utilise at the same time, is going to require a currency and it likely will be Bitcoin.\" It's the sort of statement you are more likely to see on an anarchist's internet forum than from a billionaire. Is there a streak of that in Dorsey?</p><p>\"I think there's a sometimes healthy\u00a0and sometimes unhealthy distrust of every institution,\" he says. It has been a decade since the world fell out of love with financial institutions. The story of 2018 is that the same is happening to big tech companies, as regulators grow concerned over the influence they have on the information we consume, the data they hold and their effects on our minds.</p><p>                   Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA                   </p><p>\"I think we should always have questions about anything that we utilise more, or anything that we become dependent upon,\" Dorsey says, and one senses that he's talking about the technology industry itself here more than just Square.</p><p>Dorsey says he is not worried about the threat of regulation for tech companies. \"Our role is to help educate regulators around why or how a technology can help and to be very clear when it can't.</p><p>\"In Square's case, we see our job as constantly having to educate banking regulators around what this technology can do.\"</p><p>Even with a growing backlash against tech companies, Wall Street can still be a bigger enemy, but Dorsey says Silicon Valley has to change too, becoming more democratic and transparent about the decisions it takes. \"I think as an industry we probably haven't been great at being that open in the past,\" he says. \"But I'm excited and optimistic that everything is changing towards the positive.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-42786940</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0T-PWM1-JCJY-G20X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1370\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 1, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Thank goodness for stockmarkets</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNTIL RECENTLY the image of an entrepreneur was of a thrifty workaholic toiling away in a garage. Then came the \"founder\", as epitomised by the flowing-haired Adam Neumann of WeWork, an office-subleasing firm dressed up as a tech giant. More emperor than entrepreneur, he wanted not merely to start a business but \"elevate the world's consciousness\". He sought limitless funds. He broke norms. And he generated losses as fast as he raised revenues. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He was not unique. Like other charismatic founders, such as Travis Kalanick, co-creator of Uber, a ride-hailing service, he tripped over his own billion-dollar ego. On September 24th Mr Neumann was ousted as chief executive of WeWork's parent company, by his board, including his backers at SoftBank, the Japanese group, and its $100bn Vision Fund, which together own 29% of its shares. Days earlier the company's initial public offering (IPO) was postponed because of weak demand for its shares and the Wall Street Journal reported that he smoked pot on private jets. He will be replaced by two co-chief executives. </p><p>In such cases, attention invariably focuses on the founders' hubris. Their rise and fall is the stuff of bestsellers. But it is the venture-capital industry that helps spin the invisible yarn that creates the legends. Some of its biggest names, such as SoftBank, have been peddling valuations of companies like WeWork that border on the absurd. In their competition to fund the biggest deals, they have been in thrall to founders' excesses, rather than providing sober adult supervision. Good, then, that exposure to the dowdy stockmarket is at last knocking sense into Silicon Valley's moneymen (for they are mostly male). </p><p> The folly begins with a sound idea. Startups need scale to become global champions. Thanks to the internet, ideas spread quickly. Because of network effects, the more people use a service, the better it gets. The fastest-growing firms, like WeWork and Uber, \"blitzscale\", meaning they attempt to disrupt a whole industry before anyone can stop them, raising fortunes to acquire users. The pioneers of this, such as Facebook in America and Tencent in China, have become so valuable that everyone wants to emulate their success. At its height this year, WeWork was valued at $47bn, a staggering amount for a company which last year lost $1.9bn on revenues of $1.8bn. That is more than ten times the market capitalisation of IWG, a rival with bigger sales\u2014and a profit to boot.</p><p> When venture capitalists jostle with each other to write cheques of $100m or more on a daily basis, it goes to a founder's head. As is now common in Silicon Valley, Mr Neumann demanded more power for himself and his heirs via supervoting rights. He engaged in potential conflicts of interest, listed in the firm's IPO prospectus. The mountain of venture money available, including from mutual funds, enabled his firm to stay private for nine years, almost three times longer than the average tech startup in 2001. It entrenched bad habits.</p><p> When the firm tried to go ahead with an IPO, it ignored the implicit bargain of the stockmarket: that investors give companies capital in exchange for some influence. Mr Neumann sought to keep absolute control by having shares with ten times the voting rights of other shareholders. Rather than buying into a company run by a messianic overlord with an insatiable demand for cash, investors balked. A red-faced SoftBank lost faith in Mr Neumann. He will lose his majority control (but remain co-chairman). </p><p> The saga will have three ripple effects: on fundraising, governance and the wider economy. Startups with no recognisable route to profitability will find it harder to get cash. Even before WeWork's fiasco the taps were being tightened. In China the average volume of venture-capital deals has fallen from $28bn a quarter last year to $11bn a quarter this year, according to Prequin, a data provider. In America they fell from $32bn in the second quarter to $23bn in the third. Blitzscaling may become a dirty word. Cash-burning firms yet to join the rush to IPOs, such as micro-mobility ventures Bird and Lime, may find themselves stranded like their ubiquitous e-scooters. As regulators look increasingly askance at Big Tech, the very notion of blitzscaling raises competition and other concerns, which will make public investors yet more queasy. California's recent efforts to categorise drivers for gig-economy firms as employees rather than contractors has added to the post-IPO sell-off of Uber and its rival, Lyft.</p><p> Second, as money dries up, the balance of power may shift from the founders to investors, reducing the tolerance for supervoting shares and crony boards. It will be tough. Governance remains dull as ditchwater in Silicon Valley\u2014until something goes wrong. No one wants to crush a creator's zeal.</p><p>Lastly, business at large will feel the impact. It may doom Softbank's efforts to raise a second $100bn-plus Vision Fund to replicate its earlier one, which invested in companies like Uber and WeWork. Bulge-bracket banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which were to lead WeWork's abortive IPO, may end up looking gullible. Commercial-property markets may wobble as WeWork curbs its appetite for office space. For a while at least, there could be fewer of the breathtaking innovations such as ride-hailing that have transformed cities around the world.</p><p>That is not to say entrepreneurs or IPOs are gone for good. Shares of newly listed software firms that crank out at least some cash, such as Zoom Video Communications and Datadog, have rocketed this year. Airbnb, a lodging site with positive EBITDA, still makes investors swoon. The salutary lesson is that the public markets are doing their job, rewarding firms that generate cash or profits, shunning those that do not. After years in which venture capitalists have cast themselves as infallible arbiters of value, it is good to see public investors shouting when an entrepreneur, for all his chutzpah, has no clothes.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-0F86M2H</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4N-7S11-JBKN-B0PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Two weeks ago, the president <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/31/one-year-anniversary-startup-america-initiative-president-obama-sends-st\">sent</url> to Congress an agenda, prepared by Case's group Startup America, which proposed expanding visas for immigrants, doubling deductions for small companies, and many more worthy ideas targeted to the problem of entrepreneurship.<br/>Good ideas. We need to think even bigger. The broadest debate in Washington, and on the primary trail, is about whether government needs to step up to create jobs or step back to allow the market to work by itself. But what if we need both: A stronger safety net to lessen risk for wannabe-startups and purer free market approach for established corporations? <br/>That's the big idea, but let's begin with a smaller story.<br/>DREW'S STORY<br/>Here's a true story about my friend, Drew. Drew graduated from Brown University with a 3.98 GPA in economics. With three internships under his belt, he could have easily landed a job at a consulting firm like Bain, as three of our high school friends did, or at a big tech company, like more friends, or at a bank.<br/>Instead, Drew went to work on his couch. To a stranger, he probably looked unemployed.  He wasn't. He chose to not accept any of the jobs he could have landed in order to do something unique in our circle of friends: to become an entrepreneur.<br/>Given the option to work a regular job in exchange for tens of thousands of dollars a year, why did Drew decide to work in his living room? The first reason was probably personal: Drew doesn't like hierarchies. He always wanted to be his own boss. And the only way you can be your own boss at an entry-level age is to start something you can run. <br/>The second reason was intellectual: Drew tended to see the world as problems that needed fixing. I've always been the one to say, \"There must be an explanation for the way this works\" (this is what journalists sound like) and he's always been the one to say, \"There must be a better way to do this\" (and this is what entrepreneurs sound like).<br/>The third reason was community: Drew was fortunate to come from a wonderful and well-off family that could support him if everything fell apart. He was surrounded by friends who were eager to give start-up funding and hours of free advice. He had connections, through friends and parents of friends and friends of those parents, to an investment community. Being an entrepreneur is, paradoxically, a decision both to be alone and to be at the mercy of many people's generosity.<br/>As a country, we can't really hope to change reasons one and two. We can and should hope to increase the pool of college graduates, but we can't engineer a generation that hates hierarchies and believes it has better ideas than the rest of the world -- even though both qualities are important for an entrepreneur to have. We can, however, strengthen the safety net for start ups.<br/>Every year, millions of people try to start a company. In the last year, I've met dozens of them. The details differ, but the lessons rhyme. All entrepreneurs need a community of support. They need the advice and intuition of other entrepreneurs. And they need a safety net.<br/>SAFETY NETS AND CAPITALISM<br/>\"If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the number of successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude,\" the renowned inventor Paul Graham       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/bio.html\">wrote</url>. \"Somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.\"<br/>Until scientists invest such a thing for government procurement, the United States would be advised to do the second best thing and adopt a holistic policy to support startups. This isn't industrial planning. It's not about picking winners. It's making rules that increase the odds that entrepreneurs play the game in the hope that many of them will win.<br/>As a general rule, entrepreneurs don't win. They mostly fail. Trying to start a company is like playing a high-risk casino game with your career. It's roulette, except thousands of dollars, thousands of hours, and unquantifiable sacrifices are on the table. If we want more people to play startup roulette, we shouldn't focus on how much to tax them if they win $200,000. We should focus on minimizing the downside of losing so that startup roulette feels less risky. After all, startups shouldn't just be for rich kids who can afford to take a chance on a big idea.<br/>You can build a stronger safety net stitch by little stitch, by creating new tax deductions for startups or making long-term venture capital gains totally tax free. Or you can focus on the whole net. Consider health care. Fear of not having insurance keeps graduates from starting companies. Fear of losing coverage keeps entrepreneurial employees from leaving companies to start their own. A       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1305280\">study</url> from the RAND Corporation found evidence of  \"entrepreneurship lock,\" where workers resist leaving firms that offer subsidized health care due to the high premiums they would face in the individual  health insurance market. \"The self-employed are much less likely to have health insurance than are  wage/salary workers and even our sample of unemployed and part-time  workers,\" the authors wrote.<br/>\"The median successful age for an entrepreneur is 39,\" said Robert Litan, vice president of research at the Kauffman Foundation. \"When these people start things, it's under the table and on the side. To leave a paying job and lose health insurance is a plunge into the void.\"<br/>We could fortify welfare for startups as we disassembled the welfare state for corporations. The corporate tax code is more holes than Swiss cheese, which distorts business decisions and forces us to keep one of the highest marginal tax rates in the world. Reducing both the rate and the exemptions would raise taxes on some companies and cut taxes for others, but it might also level the playing field, attract more investment, and even raise more money for the government. Combined with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21547789\">our bloated, if well-intentioned, regulatory system</url>, corporate welfare saps the market of competitiveness and makes voters angry by what they perceive as favoritism among elites.<br/>***<br/>It would be naive to think we can cleanse the law of all biases. But what if the law were biased, not toward the oil and gas industry or the  cotton farmers, but toward the creative, the self-employed, and the entrepreneurs? What if we combined a liberal approach toward mitigating risk for startups with a conservative approach toward taxing and regulating established corporations? The result might be more people playing the entrepreneur's game, more entrepreneurs winning the game and ramping up their companies, and more companies to hire more workers.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-theentrepreneurstatesafetynetsforstartupscapitalismforcorporations253211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BBT-5N01-DYY9-J4TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1178\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

For those who are not familiar with the cases, the game developer - most famous for its hit title Fortnite and the 'Unreal Engine' that underpins much of the game (and movie) industry - is complaining that Apple and Google are thwarting competition from rival app stores and in-app payment processors.Supporters have been quick to see in these suits a long-overdue challenge against the 30% commissions that Apple and Google charge. Some have even portrayed Epic as a modern-day Robin Hood, leading the fight against Big Tech to the benefit of small app developers and consumers alike. Epic itself has been keen to stoke this image, comparing its litigation to a fight for basic freedoms[1] in the face of Big Brother:However, upon closer inspection, cracks rapidly appear in this rosy picture. </p><p>What is left is a company partaking in blatant rent-seeking that threatens to harm the sprawling ecosystems that have emerged around both Apple and Google's app stores.Two issues are particularly salient. First, Epic is trying to protect its own interests at the expense of the broader industry. If successful, its suit would merely lead to alternative revenue schemes that - although more beneficial to itself - would leave smaller developers to shoulder higher fees. Second, the fees that Epic portrays as extortionate were in fact key to the emergence of mobile gaming. Epic's utopia is not an equilibrium Central to Epic's claims is the idea that both Apple[2] and Google[3]: (i) thwart competition from rival app stores, and implement a series of measures that prevent developers from reaching gamers through alternative means (such as pre-installing apps, or sideloading them in the case of Apple's platforms); and (ii) tie their proprietary payment processing services to their app stores. According to Epic, this ultimately enables both Apple and Google to extract 'extortionate' commissions (30%) from app developers.But Epic's whole case is based on the unrealistic assumption that both Apple and Google will sit idly by while rival play stores and payment systems take a free-ride on the vast investments they have ploughed into their respective smartphone platforms. In other words, removing Apple and Google's ability to charge commissions on in-app purchases does not prevent them from monetizing their platforms elsewhere.Indeed, economic [4]and strategic management[5] theory tells us that so long as Apple and Google single-handedly control one of the necessary points of access to their respective ecosystems, they should be able to extract a sizable share of the revenue generated on their platforms. One can only speculate, but it is easy to imagine Apple and Google charging rival app stores for access to their respective platforms, or charging developers for access to critical APIs.Epic itself seems to concede this point. In a recent Verge article, it argued that Apple was threatening to cut off its access to iOS and Mac developer tools[6], which Apple currently offers at little to no cost[7]:Apple will terminate Epic's inclusion in the Apple Developer Program, a membership that's necessary to distribute apps on iOS devices or use Apple developer tools, if the company does not 'cure your breaches' to the agreement within two weeks, according to a letter from Apple that was shared by Epic. Epic won't be able to notarize Mac apps either, a process that could make installing Epic's software more difficult or block it altogether. Apple requires that all apps are notarized before they can be run on newer versions of macOS, even if they're distributed outside the App Store.There is little to prevent Apple from more heavily monetizing these tools - should Epic's antitrust case successfully prevent it from charging commissions via its app store.All of this raises the question: why is Epic bringing a suit that, if successful, would merely result in the emergence of alternative fee schedules (as opposed to a significant reduction of the overall fees paid by developers).One potential answer is that the current system is highly favorable to small apps that earn little to no revenue from purchases and who benefit most from the trust created by Apple and Google's curation[8] of their stores. It is, however, much less favorable to developers like Epic who no longer require any curation to garner the necessary trust[9] from consumers and who earn a large share of their revenue from in-app purchases[10].In more technical terms, the fact that all in-game payments are made through Apple and Google's payment processing enables both platforms to more easily price-discriminate. Unlike fixed fees (but just like royalties[11]), percentage commissions are necessarily state-contingent (i.e. the same commission will lead to vastly different revenue depending on an underlying app's success). The most successful apps thus contribute far more to a platform's fixed costs. For instance, it is estimated that mobile games account for 72% of all app store spend. Likewise, more than [12]80%[13] of the apps on Apple's store pay no commission at all.This likely expands app store output by getting lower value developers on board[14]. In that sense, it is akin to Ramsey pricing[15] (where a firm/utility expands social welfare by allocating a higher share of fixed costs to the most inelastic consumers). Unfortunately, this would be much harder to accomplish if high value developers could easily bypass Apple or Google's payment systems.The bottom line is that Epic appears to be fighting to change Apple and Google's app store business models in order to obtain fee schedules that are better aligned with its own interests. This is all the more important for Epic Games, given that mobile gaming is becoming increasingly popular[16] relative to other gaming mediums (also here[17]). The emergence of new gaming platforms Up to this point, I have mostly presented a zero-sum view of Epic's lawsuit - i.e. developers and platforms are fighting over the distribution app store profits (though some smaller developers may lose out). But this ignores what is likely the chief virtue of Apple and Google's 'closed' distribution model. Namely, that it has greatly expanded the market for mobile gaming (and other mobile software), and will likely continue to do so in the future.Much has already been said about the significant security and trust benefits that Apple and Google's curation of their app stores (including their control of in-app payments) provide to users. Benedict Evans[18] and Ben Thompson[19] have both written excellent pieces on this very topic.In a nutshell, the closed model allows previously unknown developers to rapidly expand because (i) users do not have to fear their apps contain some form of malware, and (ii) they greatly reduce payments frictions, most notably security related ones. But while these are indeed tremendous benefits, another important upside seems to have gone relatively unnoticed.The 'closed' business model also gives Apple and Google (as well as other platforms) significant incentives to develop new distribution mediums (smart TVs spring to mind) and improve existing ones[20]. In turn, this greatly expands the audience that software developers can reach. In short, developers get a smaller share of a much larger pie.The economics of two-sided markets are enlightening in this respect. Apple and Google's stores are what Armstrong and Wright (here[21] and here[22]) refer to as 'competitive bottlenecks'. That is, they compete aggressively (amongst themselves, and with other gaming platforms) to attract exclusive users. They can then charge developers a premium to access those users (note, however, that in the case at hand the incidence[23] of those platform fees is unclear).This gives platforms significant incentives to continuously attract and retain new users. For instance, if Steve Jobs is to be believed, giving consumers better access to media such as eBooks, video and games was one of the driving forces behind the launch of the iPad[24].This model of innovation would be seriously undermined if developers and consumers could easily bypass platforms (as Epic games is seeking to do).In response, some commentators have countered that platforms may use their strong market positions to squeeze developers, thereby undermining software investments. But such a course of action may ultimately be self-defeating. For instance, writing about retail platforms imitating third-party sellers, Anfrei Hagiu, Tat-How Teh and Julian Wright have argued[25] that:[T]he platform has an incentive to commit itself not to imitate highly innovative third-party products in order to preserve their incentives to innovate.Seen in this light, Apple and Google's 30% commissions can be seen as a soft commitment not to expropriate developers, thus leaving them with a sizable share of the revenue generated on each platform. This may explain why the 30% commission has become a standard[26] in the games industry (and beyond).Furthermore, from an evolutionary perspective[27], it is hard to argue that the 30% commission is somehow extortionate. If game developers were systematically expropriated, then the gaming industry - in particular its mobile segment - would not have grown[28] so drastically over the past years:All of this this likely explains why a recent survey[29] found that 81% of app developers believed regulatory intervention would be misguided:81% of developers and publishers believe that the relationship between them and platforms is best handled within the industry, rather than through government intervention. Competition and choice mean that developers will use platforms that they work with best.The upshot is that the 'closed' model employed by Apple and Google has served the gaming industry well. There is little compelling reason to overhaul that model today. Final thoughts When all is said and done, there is no escaping the fact that Epic games is currently playing a high-stakes rent-seeking game. As Apple noted in its opposition[30] to Epic's motion for a temporary restraining order:Epic did not, and has not, contested that it is in breach of the App Store Guidelines and the License Agreement. Epic's plan was to violate the agreements intentionally in order to manufacture an emergency. The moment Fortnite was removed from the App Store, Epic launched an extensive PR smear campaign against Apple and a litigation plan was orchestrated to the minute; within hours, Epic had filed a 56-page complaint, and within a few days, filed nearly 200 pages with this Court in a pre-packaged 'emergency' motion. And just yesterday, it even sought to leverage its request to this Court for a sales promotion, announcing a '#FreeFortniteCup' to take place on August 23, inviting players for one last 'Battle Royale' across 'all platforms' this Sunday, with prizes targeting Apple.Epic is ultimately seeking to introduce its own app store[31] on both Apple and Google's platforms, or at least bypass their payment processing services (as Spotify[32] is seeking to do in the EU).Unfortunately, as this post has argued, condoning this type of free-riding could prove highly detrimental to the entire mobile software industry. Smaller companies would almost inevitably be left to foot a larger share of the bill, existing platforms would become less secure, and the development of new ones could be hindered. At the end of the day, 30% might actually be a small price to pay. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F27%2Fthe-epic-flaws-of-epics-antitrust-gambit%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Epic%20Flaws%20of%20Epic%E2%80%99s%20Antitrust%20Gambithttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F27%2Fthe-epic-flaws-of-epics-antitrust-gambit%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Epic%20Flaws%20of%20Epic%E2%80%99s%20Antitrust%20Gambithttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F27%2Fthe-epic-flaws-of-epics-antitrust-gambit%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Epic%20Flaws%20of%20Epic%E2%80%99s%20Antitrust%20Gambithttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F27%2Fthe-epic-flaws-of-epics-antitrust-gambit%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Epic%20Flaws%20of%20Epic%E2%80%99s%20Antitrust%20GambitThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F27%2Fthe-epic-flaws-of-epics-antitrust-gambit%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Epic%20Flaws%20of%20Epic%E2%80%99s%20Antitrust%20Gambithttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F27%2Fthe-epic-flaws-of-epics-antitrust-gambit%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Epic%20Flaws%20of%20Epic%E2%80%99s%20Antitrust%20Gambithttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F27%2Fthe-epic-flaws-of-epics-antitrust-gambit%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Epic%20Flaws%20of%20Epic%E2%80%99s%20Antitrust%20Gambithttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F27%2Fthe-epic-flaws-of-epics-antitrust-gambit%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Epic%20Flaws%20of%20Epic%E2%80%99s%20Antitrust%20GambitThe</url> post The Epic Flaws of Epic's Antitrust Gambit[33] appeared first on Truth on the Market[34].

Moore discussed how the Federal Reserve will drive volatility across asset classes next year. She also explained BlackRock's overweight on emerging markets, weighed in on the trade war, and broke down her firm's other major themes for 2019. Kate Moore[1], the chief equity strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, spoke with Business Insider senior investing editor Joe Ciolli about Federal Reserve-driven volatility, emerging markets, the ongoing trade war, and investing themes for 2019[2]. Following is a transcript of the video. Joe Ciolli: I'm here with Kate Moore, the chief equity strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute. Kate, you guys just published your 2019 outlook[3], and I wanted to see what you're thinking about the Federal Reserve. </p><p>It seems like something that's been popping up a lot in your outlook. There's a lot of uncertainty around it. Can you explain sort of how that's gonna lead to volatility across all asset classes?Kate Moore: One of our big themes for 2019 is more about policy uncertainty and getting closer to neutral with the Fed, but frankly not being able to perfectly predict monetary policy in every other country. A lot's gonna be dependent on what happens to US growth, the labor market, inflation, and whether or not we get a pause from the Fed in the first part of the year, or in the second part of the year. Interest rates have been weighing heavy on investor minds, even though we don't think they're at a level that holds back activity or should really stop companies or individuals from investing. It's been a common excuse throughout 2018. For why people are worried about being at the end of the cycle. So I would say focusing on the Fed, and all of the language and communication they give us over the next couple of months \u2014 what their plans are in March and in June, in particular. I think that will really dictate and really sort of help frame how people think about risk assets throughout the year. Ciolli:Fed Chair Powell mentioned that maybe rates were a little bit under where they wanted them to be, and that was interpreted as sort of a dovish slant. Maybe a little more dovish than we're used to from him. Moore:Yeah. Ciolli: And we saw the stocks rip higher because of that. What do you make of that? Is it just an example of the volatility we're gonna see, or is it gonna be a straight leg up for us? Moore: So I think equity investors, and sort of risk assets in general, really like to feel like there's nothing standing in their way. And as I was mentioning before, it feels a little bit like market participants have been worried about higher rates \u2014 holding back or curbing activity in 2019 and onwards. With Powell saying they're closer to neutral rates than not, I think that's something we already knew. We knew that there were more yesterdays than tomorrows when it comes to the rate hiking cycle. That wasn't news, but the way he framed it gave confidence that there wasn't going to be a significant overshoot in terms of policy rates. That really holds back activity. I think we're just tweaking things on the margin, changing the language a little bit. But it doesn't really change the fact that we are still in a sustained, we believe, economic expansion. And that while the pace of growth is going to be slower, the Fed will continue to have to adjust monetary policy to reflect that growth. Ciolli:Got it. And the US has been outpacing it's European and Asian counterparts for alot of the last year or so, and I wanted to see if you think that gap is gonna close at all? Will we see sort of a convergence of asset returns, or is the US gonna continue to sort of dominate the rest of the world? Moore: Yeah, we've been really favoring the US over Europe and Japan for much of the last 12 months. In fact, I'll tell you we got a little bit of heat for upgrading the US in the first part of 2018 and downgrading Europe and Japan. Because people said hey look, if you're right about a synchronized global economic expansion, shouldn't that be good for all of these stocks? The truth of the matter is that both European and Japanese indices are made up of much more value stocks or traditional type of value plays than the US, which has more of a growth tilt to it. We think investors are still going to be paying up for growth, and that the US has a better market composition for this stage of the cycle. Frankly, we wouldn't expect Europe or Japan to significantly outperform, unless economic growth significantly accelerates. The second derivative of growth gets much more positive. And that's not our forecast for next year, or for the beginning of 2020. So we're sticking with our overweight of the US for now. Ciolli:So you mentioned these value stocks, which have clearly been downtrodden \u2014 value investors have gotten hurt. I'm wondering if you think that they're going ot make a comeback at any poin. Is that in the cards? And when that does happen, is it something that could life Europe and Japan versus the US? Moore: Yeah, so value is a really tricky topic, and something we've debated a lot \u2014 most recently at our BlackRock Investment Institute Year Ahead forum. I just want to say there are lots of ways to think about value. There's value as the overall equity style. There's value as the factor, which often times is sector neutralized so you're not getting that additional market exposure. And then there are lots of different ways to define value. So, sometimes when we're talking about value, we're all talking about different things. Our view is that value the style does best in these periods of economic expansion, or the acceleration, as I was mentioning a moment ago. It seems unlikely that the style is gonna considerably outperform. I would note that some of the stock that looks cheap in the market right now is cheap for a reason. And I don't want to say it's all structurally impaired, but disruption and changes in consumption patterns and this uncertainty we were talking about before in terms of monetary policy outlook, makes it difficult to buy some of the just-cheap-from-a-multiple-perspective stocks. Some of the stocks that are more expensive frankly deserve a premium. We have better clarity on earnings, better clarity on the business model, and they might be market leaders in their industry. Ciolli: And one area internationally that you actually favor, according to your outlook, is emerging markets. Amid the trade war and all these tensions, we've seen emerging markets get hit this year. Why the comeback? Why is that an area you're going overweight going into next year? Moore: I'm gonna do full mea culpa on this one and tell you that we've been overweight emerging markets throughout all of 2018, despite the significant underperformance we've experienced. And that was really based on a solid global macro backdrop. The fundamentals being good, the earning story, the margin story, the sales-growth story in the EM looking very solid, particularly relative to non-US developed market peers. Valuations not being demanding, and sentiment not being overdone. A lot of the tourist money that was in emerging market stocks at earlier times in the post-crisis period had left. We felt pretty good. What was impossible to predict, though, is what was going on in terms of policy and the trade war and positioning and tweaks. With all of that in mind, we don't see actually a deterioration in fundamentals even though EM has de-rated more than other regions. And so we're sticking with our overweight call for 2019. Ciolli:Got it. Moore: It is absolutely true that a trade war, or an escalation of the trade war in 2019, would be an obstacle. But I think we're starting to see companies react and think about their supply chains, think about their relationship, andsort of hedge some of their positions to provide a buffer against any of the potential economic downturn from that. Ciolli:And in your asset allocation strategy across all of these different assets, you have a barbell approach. I know on one side you like high-quality assets, but what about the other side? Can you break down this barbell approach and what it means? Moore:We think we're in the later stage of the cycle. So let's be clear, our barbell approach doesn't mean just hold an anchor in high quality, which we think you should, and then just swing for the fences and lower quality assets that seem to be de-rated. That would be great if we didn't have any worries about policy \u2014 both the monetary side as well as the trade policy to consider. But what we think people should be focused on are companies that have excellent balance sheets, that have business models, that are sustainable through all parts of the cycle. That's where we're not expecting to see huge amounts of earnings volatility, even if we continue to have a sequential economic growth slowdown. Although again, still above-trend, so still pretty good. But also think about what areas of the market, whether it's industries or assets, have really fallen out of favor, like emerging markets this year. Places where the fundamentals haven't deterioriated, and be willing to take a bet on some higher-volatility, slightly riskier assets as well. So this barbelled approach, don't take risk entirely off. But if you need to sleep at night a little bit better, make sure that there's big quality nut to rest on. Ciolli:We keep talking about the possibility of an economic recession, but it does not seem like it's in your base case for 2019. However, you do mention that the table may be set for something in 2020. Can you outline your recession view and what, if anything, people can do next year to prepare for that if it does transpire in 2020? Moore:I think actually it's consensus at this point that 2019 is not the year that we have the US-led recession. I also just want to note something here. A lot of times when we talk about recession in our outlook, and then also talk about recession in the market, it does tend to be a little US-focused. And that we need to recognize that different regions and countries and markets are at different points in their cycle. I think about this a lot as an equity person. The profit cycle is really different, region from region. And we had seen some profits recessions in non-US markets, even while the US continued to make new highs. So, that aside, in 2020 and onwards, we think that recession probability increases for the US. Part of that is because we are just at the later stage of the cycle. We also know that it takes some time for tighter monetary policy to really play out in the economy and have an impact. It's possible that we'll see a slowdown in activity at that point, or greater inflationary pressure, frankly, from higher wages feeding through. It's not our base case at this moment, but it's a non-zero probability. We recognize that investors need to be positioned for that eventual slowdown, well in advance. As you know, equity markets tend to price in these changes in economic growth far before we would actually get the data. We just want to have quality portfolio construction and make that a significant thing that we're focused on in 2019. So that we don't get to 2020, when the economic data starts to soften a little bit, and find ourselves flat-footed. Ciolli:One last one \u2014 if you had to pick one asset or one geography, what's your big pick for next year? Moore: Are you asking me this on a risk-adjusted basis, or do you just want me to swing for the fences a little bit? Ciolli:Let's swing for the fences. Moore:I would say Chinese tech. It's really underperformed this year for a variety of different reasons, mostly because it's been hit from sentiment on trade. But also because there's been a sort of a significant headwind from policy and regulatory adjustments throughout this year. That was limiting both sales and earnings growth for a lot of the big tech companies. I think if we have an easing of trade tensions, growth is strong, and there's a lot of backlog of demand on the Chinese consumer part for tech services, hardware and content, we're gonna see solid earnings growth in 2019. I think the sector could re-rate. It's a bold and potentially highly volatile call, but that's what you asked for.Now read:100 BlackRock investing pros got together to formulate a game plan for 2019 \u2014 and we got an exclusive look

So it is telling to note that, in aggregate, the amount the leading tech companies spent on buying up other businesses tailed off last year.</p><p>But even if the headline-grabbing takeovers have been few and far between, the smaller deals are still flowing as the tech leaders round out their capabilities in key areas. And a diminished deal-flow may not make much difference to their headlong expansion into new markets: acquisitions had already come to play only a small part over the past half-decade.</p><p>It was easy to miss news earlier this week that Big Tech\u2019s largest acquisition of 2019 had slipped through, unheralded. It came on the latest earnings call from Google parent Alphabet. Explaining the reason for a jump in headcount in the final months of last year, the company pointed to the December closing of its $2.4bn purchase of Looker as a factor in the increase.</p><p>A well-regarded data analytics company, Looker has been folded into Google\u2019s cloud computing division. This is a market where Google is well behind Amazon and Microsoft, so it\u2019s not as though Google was acting to freeze others out of the market. </p><p>But the deal was still enough to attract the attention of regulators: the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority said it was open to hearing comments from anyone who thought this deal would hurt competition. The deal closed with that preliminary review still going on, meaning that Google cannot integrate Looker into its business until the regulators have had their say.</p><p>That the relatively small acquisition of a little-known analytics company should be the most prominent deal by a group of companies sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash speaks volumes about the limited M&amp;A ambitions of Big Tech.</p><p>Regulatory filings in recent days show that the five most valuable US tech companies \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 spent only $7.2bn between them on acquisitions last year. That is only around half as much as each of the previous two years, and well below the $29bn of 2016.</p><p>So does this show that they are running scared of the trustbusters? Perhaps. But it\u2019s not as though a critical avenue of growth has just been closed off to them.</p><p>For a start, big acquisitions have been scarce lately. Over the past five years the number of transactions worth more than $1bn can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Besides Google\u2019s Looker deal and its $1.1bn purchase of parts of HTC\u2019s smartphone business, they comprise Microsoft\u2019s acquisitions of GitHub ($8.4bn) and LinkedIn ($27bn), and Amazon\u2019s of Whole Foods Market ($13.2bn).</p><p>You have to go all the way back to 2014 to find a year when the Big Tech M&amp;A departments were all working full-swing. Along with Facebook\u2019s purchases of WhatsApp and Oculus, acquisitions that year included notable names such as the smart home company Nest (by Google), the headphone maker Beats (Apple\u2019s biggest deal), the games streaming company Twitch (Amazon) and the video game <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Minecraft</emphasis> (Microsoft).</p><p>These deals point to one type of acquisition that regulators hope to head off in future: those that enable today\u2019s leaders to dominate the next big markets when they are still in formation. </p><p>But are regulators in any position to make accurate judgments about what those new markets will be, and which small acquisitions will provide the key to unlocking them? It will also be hard to ban deals in the booming <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/understanding-cloud-computing\"> cloud computing</url> market, where an oligopoly has been forming. As the UK\u2019s review of Looker shows, the regulators are sure to kick the tires to see what is permissible as new tech markets take shape. Whether they will act is another question.</p><p>At the other end of the size scale are the many smaller deals that slip under the radar, but which have been instrumental in consolidating Big Tech\u2019s grip on important new technologies. Chief among these is AI. Since Beats, Apple has spent less than $1bn a year on dealmaking \u2014 but it has been mopping up small AI companies as it tries to match the big lead of Google and Amazon.</p><p>The next phase of competition in the tech sector probably won\u2019t be defined by megadeals. But that doesn\u2019t mean M&amp;A won\u2019t play an important part in shaping how Big Tech consolidates its position.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-adb03d1248fa11eaaeb3955839e06441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y55-W6H1-JB77-K389-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Margrethe Vestager, the commission's lead antitrust regulator, believes the company wants a \"data advantage\" and is buying Fitbit to get it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clearly the corporate shopping spree for tech acquisitions has become increasingly fraught, as regulators at home and abroad catch up to practices that have been allowed to run amok for years.</p><p>Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram got plenty of attention during the Congressional hearing last week, amid accusations that the social network bought companies to stifle competition.</p><p>Now it's Google's turn, as the Fitbit deal lands under the EU's microscope. And it's not the only concerned party. Last month, as many as 20 advocacy groups - including Public Citizen in the U.S., Europe's Access Now and the Brazilian Institute of Consumer Defense - filed complaints, hoping to block the sale.</p><p>It's natural to see the Fitbit purchase as more of a play for data, rather than any desire on Google's part to become a wrist gadget maker. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company had already purchased another tech player that made smartwatches, Motorola, then promptly sold it to Lenovo in 2014.</p><p>Fitbit also doesn't come with obvious competitive hardware advantages at this point: While it was once considered one of the market's top wearables companies, today it ranks in fifth place behind Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Huawei, according to IDC's latest Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker. Last year, Fitbit accounted for less than 5 percent of the wearables market.</p><p>But the acquisition target sits on health and fitness data covering 28 million people, enough to supercharge Google's digital advertising and search platforms. The information could allow for a more fine-tuned targeting of ads, while giving Google's own Android health apps valuable insights.</p><p>The potential interplay matters. Fitbit would become part of a sprawling organization, alongside YouTube, Android and Chrome browser development, as well as divisions for Wear OS, smart homes, Google Pay, Google Fit and AdSense, among many others. When taken together, the contours of the business take on epic proportions, and they're slotted in next to parent company Alphabet's other groups, including an early-stage venture arm and a growth equity investment fund.</p><p>Critical pieces of this empire started as Google acquisitions, including YouTube, Android and Nest. The roster seems to be growing by the day: On Tuesday, the company revealed that it nabbed a $450 million stake in home security firm ADT, which will help boost Nest.</p><p>Google's ad business seems to float above or beyond its other array of products and services, like a north star for the operation. In the last quarter, advertising pulled in $29.9 billion out of its total revenues of $38.3 billion - a dip compared to other quarters, but still the majority of the company's overall haul.</p><p>Now Vestager contends that Fitbit would give Google's already enormous ad business an unfair advantage.</p><p>This is what keeps the commission up at night, and it has for years. Since 2017, Google has been penalized numerous times, to the tune of some $9.5 billion, by EU antitrust regulators. And through it all, for better or for worse, the company's business practices remain resilient.</p><p>A third fine for anti-competitive behavior, intrusive privacy rules, and yet Google is still dominant across the online ad ecosystem. Perhaps privacy rules and fines... aren't working? <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/yRNZmSiyM1\">https://t.co/yRNZmSiyM1</url></p><p>- Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1108346331276419073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 20, 2019</url></p><p>Google is far from alone. Apple was hit with roughly $15 billion in back taxes, after breaks it received in Ireland were deemed unfair, although that ruling was overturned by the EU's second-highest court last month. Facebook's 500,000-pound fine by the U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office over the Cambridge Analytica scandal seems relatively small in comparison, but it follows a 5 million euro fine by Italy's Competition and Markets Authority and a $5 billion penalty imposed by the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., to name just a few.</p><p>Amazon's not off the hook, either, as it faces antitrust charges in Europe over its treatment of data from third-party sellers. The e-commerce giant could face penalties amounting to tens of billions of dollars, expressed as a percentage of its annual revenue. In fact, all of these companies are still under investigation in the EU, as well as the U.S.</p><p>Whether such punitive measures actually change things is another matter, and that may take the sting out of this latest probe.</p><p>The European Commission relies on penalties and forced mandates. The General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect last year, made a big impression, largely because of its broad adoption and the sweeping powers it gave end-users to control their own data. But other piecemeal efforts seem less effective in actually curbing Big Tech's behavior.</p><p>For the world's most valuable technology companies, huge fines wind up being a cost of doing business. A few policies may change, but core business practices typically don't - even when executives make direct promises.</p><p>Case in point: During the House Judiciary hearing, U.S. Rep. Val Demings (D., Fla.) skewered Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google parent Alphabet, about a similar pledge the company made when it bought DoubleClick, an online ad services firm, in 2008. At the time, the company said it wouldn't combine DoubleClick's cookie data with Google account data.</p><p>The acquisition was before Pichai became ceo of Google in 2015, but what followed happened during his tenure.</p><p>With concern about connecting people's identities with their browsing activities, Demings said, \"Google chief's legal adviser testified before the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee that Google wouldn't be able to merge this data even if it wanted to, given contractual restrictions. But in June of 2016 Google went ahead and merged this data anyway - effectively destroying anonymity on the Internet.\"</p><p>It sounds like hyperbole, but consumer harm could be incalculable at such a grand scale. For search alone, Google has an 86 percent global market share, as of April 2020.</p><p>Now Google's making a new pledge, saying, according to Osterloh, that \"We've been clear from the beginning that we will not use Fitbit health and wellness data for Google ads. We recently offered to make a legally binding commitment to the European Commission regarding our use of Fitbit data.\"</p><p>But Vestager's simply not buying it.</p><p>The fact that sensitive records are involved doesn't help. Fitbit data could deliver health information, location data, even certain behavioral patterns. Meanwhile, in a separate deal, Google is making a play for financial data as well.</p><p>Google unveiled six banking partnerships last week, bringing the total to eight banks that will provide digital checking and savings accounts to Google Pay users sometime next year. In doing so, the company stated that it won't host the accounts, but it will have access to the data necessary to give customers insights into their finances.</p><p>A company spokesperson explained, \"We had confirmed earlier that we are exploring how we can partner with banks and credit unions in the U.S. to offer digital bank accounts through Google Pay, helping their customers benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools, while keeping their money in an FDIC or NCUA-insured account.\"</p><p>The institutions will serve U.S.-based users, so the partnerships are not part of the European Commission's scope. But it's notable that Google is actively expanding its services - and the type of user information it can collect - while it knew that both the U.S. and Europe were investigating antitrust concerns and its use of data. It's a bold move, if nothing else.</p><p>Vendors and partners have some ability to block their data from being used in ad targeting. Subsidiaries much less so.</p><p>European investigators are on a three-month timeframe, so the findings of the probe into the Fitbit deal are expected in December. What happens after that may not give critics any real satisfaction, though, because regulators may be limited in what they can do. The commission won't, and likely can't, block an agreement between two U.S.-based companies. And while it can enforce its rules on Google, violations may simply amount to more fines.</p><p>For Google and its tech cohorts, however, this investigation and others should be seen as more evidence that regulators won't look the other way - whether abroad or at home.</p><p>\"Break up big tech\" has become a drumbeat among elected U.S. officials on both sides of the political aisle. While that would be a messy, complicated affair, it may pose enough headaches to compel the search giant and others to rethink how they approach privacy, competition and any potential attempts to consolidate power.</p><p>The likes of Google or Facebook haven't actually faced such consequences in decades. But if one giant does, the sheer shock could make for a seismic wake-up call for the rest.</p><p>More from WWD</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-trends/gallery/spring-2021-mens-trends-1203693313/\">Spring 2021 Men's Trends</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WOWEDA-1203693689</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WOWEDA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HM-BF61-JC3V-62D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434863</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>WWD</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001U7O</classCode><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>XIAOMI INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>PUBLIC CITIZEN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This week s hearing revealed clear tensions on several key policy issues</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taylor Owen is an assistant professor of digital media and global affairs at UBC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twenty years ago, another young Silicon Valley tycoon was grilled in front of the U.S. Congress. Then, as this week, Congressional leaders grandstanded, asked long-winded questions, and showed at times shocking ignorance about how technology worked. And then, as this week, a tech CEO was contrite, well-rehearsed, and obfuscated on key aspects of his business practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the hearings had consequences. They led to an anti-trust lawsuit brought against Microsoft by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Attorneys General of 20 U.S. states. Instead of trusting <person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>and Microsoft to behave better or act differently, the government punished them for perceived wrongdoings.</p><p>This is how democratic governance is supposed to work. We don't have to simply trust citizens and corporations to act in the benefit of society; we impose rules, regulations and appropriate punishments to incentivize them to do so.</p><p>In the years since Mr. Gates's testimony, a new generation of digital technology monopolies has emerged, reshaping online life and concentrating activity on a series of giant, global platforms. And they have done so in a policy context virtually void of regulation.</p><p>But in 2018, it's hard to ignore the many troubling cases of abuse regularly perpetrated on and by platforms, from the manner in which the Russian government used the tools provided by companies such as Facebook and Google to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, to the way in which hate groups in countries such as Myanmar have organized mass violence against minority populations.</p><p>Both the government and <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>know that citizens are finally paying attention to the political impact of Facebook and its effect on our elections, that citizens are understandably concerned about the way Facebook has repeatedly and consistently flaunted and neglected user privacy, and that they are concerned about the hateful and divisive character of the civic discourse that is a result of Facebook's business model.</p><p>And so this week the era of Silicon Valley self-regulation came to an end. It's now time for a difficult debate about how the new internet - an internet of multinational corporations, and of platforms - will be governed.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the internet has shown flashes of its empowering potential. But the recent Facebook revelations also demonstrate what can happen if we fail to hold it accountable.</p><p>While Congressmen and Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>appeared to agree that they could work together to develop the \"right\" regulations, this week's hearing revealed clear tensions on several key policy issues.</p><p>First, while Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>says that Facebook now supports digital advertising transparency laws that they had previously lobbied against, it is unclear whether the proposed Honest Ads Act will go far enough or whether it will even pass.</p><p>Second, on privacy: The world is watching the response to Europe's General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR), and while Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>argued that the privacy tools that Facebook will roll out in response to GDPR will be available in other markets, the U.S. (and Canada) still seem unwilling to enshrine the punitive mechanisms that will be needed to ensure these new data rights.

Therefore, at a time of rapid changes in the financial sector, it is important that regulators pay close attention to what is happening and take appropriate action.</p><p>After discussing key areas of concern for Canadian regulators, I recommend that they should:</p><p>(i) Require the explainability of machine-learning models used for lending decisions. As it is, artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in lending decisions at both regulated and largely unregulated institutions. If not properly examined by internal risk managers, it can lead to unsafe lending decisions.</p><p>(ii) Take care not to rush into open banking regulations, for example regarding money-moving apps, that could increase the likelihood of bank runs.</p><p>(iii) Collect better and more timely data by type of financial institution on types of credit and short-term financing.</p><p>(iv) Extend the coverage of stress tests to examine stresses related to rapid new borrowing from non-bank financial institutions, or shadow banks, that are not prudentially regulated.</p><p>At the micro level, regulators will have to weigh closely the costs of new regulations against the benefits of financial innovations. At the macro level, however, the steps suggested in this Commentary should have little or no effect on the vast majority of digital financial innovations that are underway or contemplated in the near future. Therefore, there would be no real trade-off\" between the increased stability coming from these actions and the increased competition, efficiency and range of financial services that should come from digital financial innovation.</p><p>Digital financial innovation seems to be everywhere. Whether one focuses on artificial intelligence, including machine learning, or changes that could come about by the adoption of open banking, such innovation has been accelerating.</p><p>It has the potential to provide both businesses and consumers with lower costs and a greater range of financial services. Concurrently, digital financial innovation has raised the question of what risks these changes pose to consumers, individual financial institutions, the financial system and the economy at large, and how Canadian financial regulators should respond to those risks. (1)</p><p>Digital financial innovation can increase risks connected with privacy, cyber security, third-party technology providers and financial stability (Financial Stability Board 2017,2019). This Commentary focuses only on the part of financial stability that concerns the major macro-level risks that might arise, and sets out to answer three questions. What do we know from economic history about financial innovation in general and banking crises? What are some key areas arising from current and future digital financial innovation that regulators need to examine? And what are the implications for actions by Canadian regulators?</p><p>In answering these questions, I look at the importance of credit booms historically, including those supported by various types of financial innovation both in credit granting and financial institution funding. I document the dominant influence of credit supply, examine changes in credit supply decisions stemming from machine-learning models and look at the introduction of particular open banking regulations that might increase the prevalence of bank runs. Recommended actions by regulators include requiring the \"explainability\" of machine-learning models used for credit decisions, taking care not to move too quickly away from the \"stickiness\" in retail bank deposits, requiring better data collection by type of non-deposit-taking financial institution on sorts of credit and short-term financing, and using stress tests for the overall financial sector.</p><p>ECONOMIC HISTORY, FINANCIAL INNOVATION AND BANKING CRISES</p><p>Paraphrasing numerous authors, banking crises (2) can be summarized in the following way: \"Every crisis is different. Every crisis is the same.\" Economic history focuses on what is the same across crises. In their writings, both Charles Kindleberger (1978) and Hyman Minsky (1982) put significant emphasis on financial innovations as a potential cause of subsequent banking crises. For Kindleberger, this conclusion remains as true in more recent times as it did 40 years ago (Kindleberger and Aliber 2011).</p><p>Financial Innovations Historically</p><p>Historically, the range of financial innovations leading to credit expansion and potential banking crises has been extremely varied. In some cases, these innovations have been linked to the development of assets that are substitutes for traditional types of money. Examples include bills of exchange and eurocurrency deposits. In other cases, the innovations have occurred through the introduction of poorer-quality credit, including junk bonds and some types of securitized products (Kindleberger and Aliber 2011, chap. 4).</p><p>For a more recent example, one can consider the role of financial innovations in causing the global financial crisis of 2008-09, which has come under much scrutiny. In particular, there has been significant emphasis on innovations creating new types of loans or securities, such as:</p><p>* securitization and tranching (slicing and dicing) of prime, alt-A and subprime mortgages;</p><p>* collateralized mortgage obligations;</p><p>* asset-backed commercial paper (Kacperczyk and Schnabl 2010);</p><p>* repurchase agreements (repos) collateralized by the above (Gorton and Metrick 2012); and</p><p>* money market mutual funds.</p><p>The first four of these techniques, together with overcollateralization and equity and lower-quality tranches held by loan originators and others, created long-term and short-term AAA assets. These assets, desired by both the financial sector and the non-financial sector, enabled an increase in the supply of both US subprime mortgages (themselves an innovation) and other mortgages.</p><p>Concurrently there were innovations in the techniques financial institutions used to look at risk. First, value-at-risk calculations, which quantitatively measured the amount of risk in a portfolio of securities and loans, were rising in importance and were often based on very short samples and statistical distributions that did not allow for fat tails. (3) Second, the increase in financial institutions' use of experts in quantitative analysis, who developed and used value-at-risk calculations. These experts differed from many traditional fundamental risk managers, who historically have been able to step back from all the math and statistics and ask whether everything about a particular loan, investment or way of funding makes enough sense to proceed with it. As a result of overreliance on both of these innovations, the risks taken on by some financial institutions, particularly investment banks and other banks, were greater than they appreciated at the time. Thus, they were willing to expand their balance sheets significantly and create more credit.</p><p>The Roles of Credit Growth, New Borrowing and Debt Service</p><p>Since the global financial crisis, research drawing on insights from Kindleberger and Minsky has provided stronger empirical evidence that excessive credit growth could lead to crises. This research has been part of a larger research agenda using financial variables that can be taken to describe a financial cycle to predict financial crises, growth of gross domestic product (GDP) and recessions. The private-sector credit variables studied include the growth of credit, the growth of the ratio of credit to nominal GDP, the detrended ratio of credit to nominal GDP, new borrowing relative to nominal GDP and debt service (interest payments and repayments of principal) relative to nominal GDP. (4) Other financial variables include the growth of real asset prices--especially house prices and stock prices.</p><p>Because countries have few banking crises--by one often-used measure, Canada has not had one in the past 50 years (Laeven and Valencia 2018)--and a limited number of financial cycles, it is important to look at cross-country studies to predict and understand the causes of crises and economic downturns linked to the financial sector. (5) Fortunately, because Canada is one of a small number of countries with relevant annual and quarterly data over long historical periods, it is included in all of the studies discussed below.</p><p>Cross-country research on the prediction of banking crises that focuses on credit (and real asset prices) developed in an important way at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), both prior to the global financial crisis (for example, Borio and Lowe 2002) and since (Borio and Drehmann 2009; Drehmann, Borio, and Tsatsaronis 2012). More recent BIS research notes that credit booms were useful in predicting crises as long as five years ahead while not always leading to a crisis. In contrast, debt-service payments (interest payments plus repayment of principal) were better short-term predictors of crises as long as two years ahead (Drehmann and Juselius 2013). More recently, Drehmann and colleagues show that flows of new borrowing have had some persistence. These flows, as expected, lead debt service, which builds up over time as the stock of credit continues to increase (Drehmann, Juselius, and Korinek 2018). The net flow of borrowing--the flow of new borrowing less the flow of debt service--tends to remain positive for some time, but to decline as debt service rises, eventually becoming negative. This pattern of net flows was first associated with an increase in the growth of real consumption and output, and then by a decrease, likely because many borrowers are constrained by their disposable incomes plus their net flows of borrowing. (6) Consistent with the story, the authors find that new borrowing and debt servicing are more important predictors of output growth and financial crises than are traditional measures such as the ratio of credit to GDP. Ambler and Kronick (2020), in a paper focusing on Canada, similarly conclude that these two key variables are good predictors of Canadian output growth and financial stress.</p><p>The persistence of the effects of shocks to new borrowing on output likely is less in countries, like Canada, with a higher prevalence of floating or short- to medium-term interest rates on debt (particularly mortgages), than in countries with long-term fixed interest rates. This is because the average interest rate on outstanding debt is more responsive to changes in the monetary policy interest rate, which itself, all else being equal, responds to the output effects of the net flow of borrowing. (7)</p><p>The BIS research focused on quarterly data for advanced and some emerging market countries since the 1970s. At the same time, another group of researchers were putting together an annual database since 1870 for 14 to 17 industrial countries, depending on the study (see, for example, Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor 2013; Schularick and Taylor 2012). They too found that, even over this longer period, credit flows were extremely important in predicting banking crises. As well, the researchers found that recessions associated with financial crises were more serious than other recessions. Moreover, even if credit booms did not lead to banking crises, they were typically associated with economic slowdowns, a finding that has been used to show that financial booms have leading information on recessions (Borio, Drehmann, and Xia 2019).</p><p>An important commonality in findings from the two databases is that both total household credit and household mortgage credit tend to be much more important than business credit or overall total credit in predicting crises and GDP booms and busts (Drehmann, Juselius, and Korinek 2018; International Monetary Fund 2017; Mian and Sufi 2018; Mian, Sufi, and Verner 2016; Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor 2015, 2016). The GDP booms associated with household credit are, however, lower in countries with: stricter financial supervision and regulation, greater capital account openness and flexible exchange rates (International Monetary Fund 2017). These factors, of course, are all present in Canada. Moreover, the tighter regulation of risk-weighted capital, leverage ratios and liquidity (through the liquidity-coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio) under the Basel III global regulatory framework is likely to reduce the possibility of credit booms leading to banking crises.</p><p>Part of the explanation for the link between credit booms and subsequent recessions is the importance of shocks to credit supply, as opposed to credit demand (Mian and Sufi 2018; Mian, Sufi, and Verner 2016). Thus, one observes that credit conditions--as measured by interest rate spreads between, say, mortgage rates and comparable sovereign yields, and non-price indications of credit availability (8)--typically ease, not tighten, when credit booms take place. (9) Increases in supply can, of course, be underpinned by financial innovations, as was the case to at least some degree during the global financial crisis. (10) Future credit-supply-induced booms (and crises) perhaps could be mitigated by a more anticipatory regulatory culture, empowered by legislation and by the advocation by leaders of financial institutions of more cooperative relations with regulators. (11)</p><p>The Role of Runnable Short-term Funding</p><p>Bank runs at individual institutions or panics across institutions or markets have often occurred just before bank failures and full-fledged banking crises. Historically, the emphasis was on runs on core short-term bank deposits, but as deposit insurance was instituted, that became less likely. The global financial crisis showed that significant runs could occur not only from short-term wholesale deposits at banks, but also from short-term financing of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs)--more popularly known as shadow banks. Two examples are financial commercial paper (Kacperczyk and Schnabl 2010) and repo transactions supported by dodgy collateral (Gorton and Metrick 2012). (12) As well, in the case of the United Kingdom, there was a run on core deposits at Northern Rock against a background of the absence of 100 percent deposit insurance up to a significant level (Shin 2009). Over a long period, when increases in the ratio of bank loans to deposits--likely indicating an increase in other types of short-term financing--accompany credit booms and real house price booms, a banking crisis is more likely (Richter, Schularick, and Wachtel 2017). (13)</p><p>The experience of the global financial crisis was consistent with the association of runs with concerns about the credit quality of a financial institutions asset portfolio--especially its mortgage portfolio--and its ability to continue to attract funds. In some cases, these concerns were well founded; in others, such as that of Canadian banks, runs in interbank funding seemed to reflect unfounded contagion.</p><p>The Role of Capital and Earnings Cushions</p><p>The global financial crisis also reinforced the idea that capital and annual earnings can cushion the effects of provisions taken on non-performing loans. Indeed, the simple leverage ratio--the ratio of a bank's equity capital to its total assets--tended to be a good predictor of which banks would get into trouble during the crisis (Haldane and Madouros 2012). To the extent that financial innovations reduce bank charter values and the annual earnings of banks in cases where business moves from the banking sector to NBFIs, banks will have fewer buffers against unexpected shocks. (14)</p><p>Lessons for Today</p><p>The lessons I draw from the historical experience for the likelihood that today's digital financial innovation will cause financial instability are threefold. First, this risk will be higher if it leads to an easing of credit conditions overall that, in turn, leads to a credit supply boom. Based on previous experience, this is likely to be more problematic if the boom is in household mortgage credit. Moreover, it likely will be no less a problem for the overall economy if it occurs in the NBFI sector. Second, the risk will be higher if it leads to increased probability of runs on short-term funding from financial institutions. Third, it will be higher if digital financial innovations cause business to move away from banks to NBFIs, thus reducing bank charter value and earnings cushions. In all three cases, however, regulators need to examine the full context of what is happening.</p><p>SOME KEY AREAS REGULATORS SHOULD EXAMINE</p><p>Because past financial innovations have often been associated with either the easing of credit conditions and credit booms or the creation of new runnable deposits, it is important to look carefully at current and contemplated innovations that will affect these two areas. To that end, I look at the potential effects of the use of machine learning on credit decisions and the potential effects of one possible open banking initiative on bank runs.</p><p>Machine Learning and Credit Decisions</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has many useful contributions to make in increasing the safety and efficiency of financial institutions. One branch of AI, machine learning, is being used in lending decisions at both regulated and largely unregulated institutions. It typically uses data on many borrowers and potential borrowers and a multitude of their characteristics (Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority 2019).</p><p>The use of machine learning in lending decisions, if not properly examined by internal risk managers, auditors and regulators, can lead to unsafe lending decisions. (15) Consider, for example, the hype about \"big data\" in recent years. Big data has allowed machine learning to increase the efficiency of verification and other decisions. But big data for lending decisions can pose big problems if it is analyzed with a \"black box\"--in which all the interest is on the inputs and outputs without concern for the logic of the internal workings--comes from a short period of time (a short sample) or is not big or broad in all relevant dimensions.</p><p>Consider the nature--the length and breadth of credit scores of past borrowers--of various data samples that might be available to actual and potential lenders, as shown in Figure 1. Traditional lenders have long samples (the blue horizontal rectangle in the figure), but the range of their measure of the credit quality of borrowers might not be as wide as that of newer lenders, and the range of characteristics of borrowers available for their long sample also might not be as wide. Some traditional lenders at some point might have broadened both the range of credit quality at which they have been willing to lend and the range of borrowers' characteristics they have gathered (the gold square in the figure), although at the expense of shorter sample periods. Even more recently, some new lenders using AI techniques might have further broadened the range of borrowers'characteristics they have gathered and the range of credit quality at which they are willing to lend (the gray rectangle in the figure). Yet again, however, the sample period shortens.</p><p>Models estimated over short samples are problematic because they are likely to be very unstable over both business and financial cycles. This is somewhat similar to the short samples in value-at-risk models and other models that experts in quantitative analysis used prior to and during the global financial crisis. If a sample does not contain significant economic and financial downturns, it is unlikely that the model estimated over that sample would perform well during a future downturn.</p><p>Large data samples are not necessarily better if they are not sufficiently big and broad in all dimensions. For example, data samples might have too few loans to those on the current lending/no-lending boundary. In that case, it might be difficult to know whether credit conditions can be eased for a new class or type of borrower.</p><p>For all these reasons, Explainable AI (XAI) has increased in popularity. XAI does not accept decisions made by a black box that is not understood. Rather, it employs techniques such as examining the effects of variables in the lending model one at a time to see if the effects are of the right sign (and of a believable size) or if there is a plausible explanation. XAI is needed most if final loan decisions are totally computerized, without any human input. Prudential regulators should require the use of XAI or similar approaches in computerized models on which loan approvals are based. They should also require more risk-weighted capital at an institution if they are unsatisfied with the approaches taken and if loan growth at that institution is accelerating. Macroprudential regulators should focus on whether the increased use of AI lending is leading to an acceleration of overall credit.</p><p>The above discussion raises the question of model risk when big data might not be as big and broad as it seems at first glance. Bank regulators, who consider model risk as a key non-financial risk, do indeed spend time looking at this (Gully 2019). Some lenders, however, are not regulated for prudential purposes. Model risk, especially unappreciated model risk, can lead to the crystallizing of credit risk. But before the risk crystallizes, one might see credit accelerating at an individual financial institution in the regulated sector, in the non-regulated sector or in the overall financial sector. This would tend to raise the risk of a subsequent economic downturn, especially when the risk crystallizes. Macroprudential authorities need to keep their eye on financial innovations that are causing large changes in the non-regulated sector, especially when overall credit begins to accelerate.</p><p>Open Banking, Money-Moving Apps and Runs</p><p>Open banking typically is defined as a system that gives users data from financial institutions through the use of computer applications (apps). In particular, read/write open banking allows hands to move from one account to another (Open Banking Limited 2018). Read open banking, for example, allows an app that receives a customer's financial data to perform such activities as data aggregation. Write open banking takes it a step further, and allows, for example, an app to modify customer data, including making payments.</p><p>Suppose that it becomes legal to create and use open banking apps to which individuals can delegate the right to move their money from bank to bank, perhaps on a daily basis. (16) With permission, the app would gather information on the amount of the individual's deposits in all chequing and savings accounts--and perhaps money market mutual funds and commercial paper as well. Given this account information, what the individual shared on upcoming planned payments and the app's knowledge of bank (and other) interest rates and account requirements, the app would move the individual's money to maximize interest earnings.</p><p>In principle, then, if such apps were widely adopted, retail accounts would no longer be \"sticky,\" and cash management at banks would become more difficult. More important, bank runs could become more likely--in response to errors banks make in posting their interest rates and account rules or to errors apps make in interpreting the information. (Such runs, one hopes, would be short lived, but could lead to rumours and contagion at a time when there is financial stress for other reasons.) As well, regulatory liquidity requirements likely would be harder to set because the degree of stickiness of deposits initially would be hard to gauge, as competition likely would cause interest rates (and many of the account requirements) across institutions to converge.</p><p>All this suggests that regulators might want to move slowly in some areas of open banking, especially those that could lead to large increases in liquidity risk.</p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR ACTIONS BY CANADIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATORS</p><p>The above analysis suggests that Canadian prudential regulators should require the explainability of models used in lending decisions --typically with allowance for overrides by real people. The analysis also suggests, as just noted, that regulators exercise much care with some extremes of what open banking could mean, because of the link to liquidity risk for deposit-taking institutions.</p><p>In addition, macroprudential regulators should ensure that they have sufficient timely data to understand how financial innovations are affecting credit growth and short-term financing. To prepare for potential problems in the financial system as a whole, they need to undertake stress tests to understand how rapid growth in credit and short-term financing outside the banking system can lead to financial instability. (17)</p><p>Improving Data Collection on NBFIs</p><p>Canadian macroprudential regulators need to take seriously the fact that they have little or no data on many types of financial institutions that are not regulated for prudential purposes. These tend to be non-deposit-taking institutions and fall under Statistics Canada's definition of non-bank financial intermediaries, which includes, importantly, non-bank credit intermediaries (Statistics Canada 2019a, 2020). (18) Regulators should ensure that quarterly data on lending and short-term financing are gathered for each type of lender, whether regulated for prudential purposes or not.</p><p>Economic history suggests that these data should be gathered for each type of lending (consumer credit, residential mortgage credit, non-residential mortgage credit and other business lending) and for each type of short-term financing (asset-backed commercial paper, other commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, repo loans, securities lending and others). The data are needed--and likely will become more important in a world of rapid financial innovation and open banking--to analyze potential instability in the financial sector as a whole that might have implications for the overall economy that could feed back to affect the deposit-taking sector as well. Even though many of the non-deposit-taking lending sectors are currently small, there is no guarantee that they will remain that way in a world of rapid financial innovation. When a sector starts to grow rapidly, one wants to have the ability to understand what is going on immediately. This implies the need for quarterly data, short publication lags after the end of the quarter and sufficient disaggregation to understand which categories of lending and short-term financing are being affected. This allows for follow-up to understand changing business models in a given type of financial institution. It will be important to explain clearly the rationale for increased data collection to all the relevant players engaged in non-bank financial intermediation. There will be value to them in understanding what is happening to the growth of various types of credit and short-term financing across the economy, as well as in their own subsectors.</p><p>Some improvements have been made recently to Statistics Canada's annual \"non-bank financial intermediation economic account\" to show explicitly data for mortgage investment corporations and mortgage finance corporations, as well as some leasing companies. The Bank of Canada has been closely monitoring the rapid growth in lending by mortgage investment corporations (Bank of Canada 2019). However, data for 2018 on this sector only became available in mid-January 2020 (Statistics Canada 2020).</p><p>The disaggregation of the lending and short-term financing data is also not sufficient to understand what is happening in the NBFI sector overall--for example, mortgages are not disaggregated between residential and non-residential. Data have also been enhanced on quarterly flows and stocks of securities (Statistics Canada 2019b). Unfortunately, however, there is insufficient disaggregation across types of financial institution.</p><p>A new source of lending being closely watched is lending by Big Tech--the Googles and Amazons of this world--especially to small and medium-sized businesses (Bank for International Settlements 2019; Financial Stability Board 2019). This kind of lending differs from traditional trade credit as it does not primarily finance the payment of bills to the Big Tech companies themselves. As this lending has the possibility of growing rapidly and becoming a significant source of finance for Canadian small and medium-sized businesses, Statistics Canada and macroprudential regulators should ensure that data on such loans are gathered separately, not just subsumed in other categories of lending. (19) Online peer-to-peer lending for both households and businesses is another area that should be watched carefully, as it too has potential for accelerating credit growth.</p><p>It takes time to institute new or improved Statistics Canada surveys, so the time to design and fund the needed new surveys is now, not when the beginning of an episode of financial stability is already suspected to be underway. It is now more than ten years since the heart of the global financial crisis, which was partly due to behaviour by NBFIs. It should not have taken so long to ensure that all of the relevant data were gathered. The Senior Advisory Committee to the minister of finance should also be considering whether, for systemic risk reasons, it should have access to the types of data mentioned above on significantly large individual NBFIs. This could be done in conjunction with provincial regulators.</p><p>Extending What Stress Tests Cover</p><p>Rapid growth in overall credit, especially household credit, coming from the non-bank sector potentially poses problems for the macro economy and for the banking sector as well. Therefore, Canadian macroprudential authorities would be well advised to construct and carry out stress tests that incorporate such a scenario. For example, this scenario could incorporate substantial new borrowing in the form of uninsured mortgages from institutions that are not prudentially regulated. This scenario would need to incorporate all the relevant connections among different parts of the financial sector, including any bank lending to the financial institutions providing the new mortgages, as well as the effects of changes in the macro economy on the banking sector. While not necessary, timely data collection would help in the construction of the scenario.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Economic history gives us many examples of instances when financial innovations, rapid growth in credit supply and increased reliance on short-term financing have led to financial instability and crises. Therefore, at a time of rapid changes in the financial sector, it is important that regulators pay close attention to what is happening and take appropriate action.</p><p>Canadian prudential supervisors should require the explainability of machine-learning models used for lending decisions. The major steps macroprudential regulators should take are as follows: take care not to rush into open banking regulations that could increase the likelihood of bank runs; collect better and more timely data by type of financial institution on types of credit and short-term financing; and extend the coverage of stress tests to examine stresses related to rapid new borrowing from financial institutions that are not prudentially regulated.</p><p>Microprudential supervisors will have to weigh closely the costs of new regulations against the benefits of financial innovations. At the macroprudential level, however, the steps suggested in this Commentary should have little or no effect on the vast majority of digital financial innovations that are underway or contemplated in the near future. Therefore, there would be no real trade-off between the increased stability coming from these actions and the increased competition, efficiency and range of financial services that should come from digital financial innovation.</p><p>David Longworth is a Term Adjunct Professor, Department of Economics, Queen's University, and a former Deputy Governor, Bank of Canada.</p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>Ambler, Steve, and Jeremy Kronick. 2020.

An earlier version of some of the analysis in this Commentary was given as a slide presentation at the CDIC Conference \"Deposit Insurance in the Digital Age\" in Ottawa on May 9,2019, under the tide \"History, Innovation and Regulation.\"</p><p>(1) The Competition Bureau (Canada 2017) has recommended how regulators might foster innovation through competition.</p><p>(2) \"Banking crisis\" is used in this Commentary as short-hand for a financial sector crisis that includes major difficulties in some part of the banking sector. For greater clarification, it excludes sovereign-debt and foreign-exchange crises.</p><p>(3) Fat-tailed distributions, as opposed to normal distributions, incur outlier events with higher probability.</p><p>(4) At times, total private-sector credit is disaggregated into household and business credit, or mortgage credit and other credit. When household credit is used, it is often as a ratio to personal disposable income.</p><p>(5) Calomiris and Haber (2014) claim that Canada is one of only six countries (of the more than 100 surveyed) that have had a crisis-free, stable banking system, as well as abundant credit.</p><p>(6) More generally, borrowers typically have higher marginal propensities to consume out of income and wealth than have lenders, which is consistent with the relationship found between the new flow of borrowing and consumption growth.</p><p>(7) In the data, debt servicing peaks more rapidly when mortgage rates are flexible rather than fixed (Drehmann, Juselius, and Korinek 2018).</p><p>(8) The Bank of Canada's Senior Loan Officers Survey measures both price and non-price elements of credit conditions, but focuses on business lending. The price and non-price elements tend to move in the same direction.</p><p>(9) When the increase in the quantity of anything (here, credit) is associated with a decline in its price (here, credit conditions), it must be because positive supply shifts have been larger than any demand shifts.</p><p>(10) Mis-selling, as was the case with some US subprime mortgages that had extremely low interest payments in the first few years, might (in some cases) be the source of increases in credit supply.</p><p>(11) Thanks to an anonymous referee for suggesting this point.</p><p>(12) Researchers have shown that the pricing of money market debt is fundamentally different from the pricing of stocks, and that such debt goes from a situation where its price is not sensitive to new information to one where it is very sensitive (see, for example, Holmstrom 2015).</p><p>(13) As well, an increase in the share of funding that does not come from deposits indicates increased financial instability (Jorda et al. 2017).</p><p>(14) A bank's charter value is the value (part of its share price) of its ability to carry on its banking business in the future.</p><p>(15) The internal logic of previous credit adjudication technologies typically was very clear, but this might not always be the case for machine learning, as described later in the text.</p><p>(16) The federal government is just beginning to examine open banking and its regulation (see Canada 2019). It has not yet made any proposals regarding payments functionality.</p><p>(17) As a referee pointed out, another important issue for regulators is how to deal with firms that cut across banking, insurance, securities and more. Canada's current regulatory system, especially its federal-provincial dimension, makes this difficult.</p><p>(18) Non-bank credit intermediaries comprise mortgage investment corporations, mortgage finance corporations, consumer and business transportation leasing and other leasing and financing companies.</p><p>(19) Big Tech companies could grow to become international, systemically important financial institutions, which would raise the question of their supervision and regulation.</p><p>Caption: Figure 1: Samples Available to Various Lenders</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-621689403</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 621689403</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRK-PCF1-JCBJ-K23R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 C.D.

This talk was accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation. Please follow along with the full event video or the PowerPoint PDF, both located in the right sidebar. MICHAEL KEARNS: Thank you all for coming. </p><p>My name is Michael Kearns. This talk is about a book[1] that I wrote with a close friend and colleague at Penn, Aaron Roth[2]. Both of us are card-carrying career researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) generally, but specifically in machine learning, more on the algorithm design side, thinking about what the right core algorithms are and what the principles underlying those algorithms are. We do a fair amount of experimental research as well. Many people in my field have watched with some combination of surprise and alarm at the developments of the last 10 years or so. The field that I've been working in for many decades went from a relatively obscure corner of computer science to permeating all of society with algorithms, particularly algorithms that are the result of a learning process\u2014machine learning\u2014making very, very consequential decisions about the lives of ordinary individuals. Just to make things very concrete here, I'm talking about things like algorithms or predictive models deciding things like: whether you get a loan or not, whether you are admitted to the college of your choice, human resource departments using these models to screen rsums, judges using risk-assessment models to decide whether an incarcerated individual should get parole or not, or what sentence they should receive in the first place. We have in a relatively short period of time\u2014primarily due to the rise of the consumer Internet, which has allowed all of us the opportunity to provide incredibly granular data about our movements, our interests, our fears, our hopes, our medical records, what we're Googling, etc.\u2014moved from making aggregate decisions about scientific systems like weather prediction or the directional movement of the stock market, to making very, very personalized decisions about you. Machine learning has experienced a lot of amazing success in the last 20 years or so, and I would crudely characterize what has happened in the last 10 years\u2014at least from a mainstream media standpoint\u2014as 2010-15 there was this rush of excitement as deep learning and related technologies made serious inroads into longstanding core technologies like speech recognition and image processing and the like. The last five years or so have been a little bit more of a buzzkill, as we've realized that those same systems and models can essentially engage in violations of privacy in a systematic way or result in algorithmic decision making that is discriminatory against racial, gender, or other groups. These days it's difficult to pick up mainstream media publications and not find at least one article a day on these kinds of phenomena. Many of you may have seen this one[3] just last week in Science magazine that got a lot of attention, where a model for predictive health care was systematically discriminating against black people. So, why did we decide to write this book? There were a number of good books before us\u2014three of which I've shown here\u2014that we admire, that we think do a very good job to a lay audience describing what the problems are, but we felt like they were a little bit short on solutions. These books all do a very good job at pointing out the ways in which machine learning can violate individual privacy or notions of fairness in prediction, but when you get to \"What should we do about this?\" in these books\u2014they all have a section that discusses this, usually toward the end\u2014their answers are basically, \"We need better laws, we need better regulations, we need better watchdog groups, we really have to keep an eye on this stuff.\" We agree with all of that, but we also think that there are things that can be done at a technical level. In particular, if algorithmic misbehavior is largely the problem, we could think about making the algorithms better in the first place\u2014better in the social sense\u2014like not engaging in discriminatory behavior, leaks of private data, and the like. We're not proposing these types of algorithmic solutions to algorithmic problems to the exclusivity of these institutional solutions. It's just we think, This is what we know about, first of all. We're computer scientists, we're not policymakers, social workers, or legal scholars. We also think, This can be done right now. Institutional change, laws, and regulations take a lot of time. Companies like Google, Facebook, what have you, can make their algorithms better right now, and they actually know how to do it. We are part of a growing subcommunity of the machine learning community that is taking these ideas seriously and thinking about, literally in the code of these algorithms, putting in conditions that prevent different types of anti-social behavior. We thought there was enough literature on this topic now and that it was interesting and important enough that we would write a general audience book, trying to explain what that underlying science looks like, what its promise is, and also what its limitations are. In the one sense, it is a technologically optimistic book. We are technological optimists, we're not technological utopianists. But we try to do a balanced job of saying: \"This is what we know how to do now. This is what we don't know how to do now. This is what we think we'll know how to do 10 years from now, and these are some things that we think algorithms should never do.\" That's what the book is about. Some people, when they hear the title of the book, think it's a conundrum or almost a contradiction. We've had the reaction before, like, \"Ethical algorithms? Isn't that like discussing ethical hammers?\" After all, a hammer is a tool designed by human beings for a particular purpose, and anything unethical or ethical about the use of a hammer, you can directly attribute to whoever wields that hammer. So, even though a hammer is designed for building stuff and pounding nails and all that good stuff, I could hit you on the hand with the hammer, and we might consider that an unethical use of this tool. But nobody would say, \"Well, the hammer was unethical.\" You would ascribe it to the user of that tool, not to the tool itself. We actually argue that algorithms are different. Yes, algorithms are human-designed artifacts and tools to solve specific problems, but especially the modern nature of algorithmic decision making when it's acting on particular individuals has a different moral character, a moral character that cannot be ascribed to the designer or the user of that algorithm. At a high level, what I mean by that is the way algorithmic decision making is done these days is usually not by explicit programming. If I am a large institutional lender and I am trying to build a model to decide to whom to give mortgages or not, depending on the data that's in your mortgage application\u2014and by the way, maybe a lot of other data about you that I got from somewhere else, like your social media activity. This is a thing if you didn't know it, to not just use the information on your application but to use any other data that I can buy about you to make that decision. Instead of a human being sitting down and thinking, Okay, based on all these different variables I know about you, what should the rule be about who gets a loan or doesn't get a loan? That's not how it works. It's all done with machine learning. So, I take a large, perhaps very high-dimensional, complicated data set describing previous loan applications that, let's say, I did grant a loan to, and an indication about whether you repaid the loan or not. This is my training data. I have these X/Y pairs; X is all the stuff I know about you, Y is whether you repaid the loan or not. And I want to use machine learning to learn a model to predict that, and that's what I'm going to use for making my decisions. This complicated data set gets turned into some complicated objective function or \"landscape\" in which I'm trying to maximize some mathematically well-defined objective, which typically\u2014almost exclusively these days\u2014has to do with predictive accuracy. I say: \"Find the neural network on this historical lending data set that minimizes the number of mistakes of prediction made,\" meaning people that the model would have denied the loan to who would have repaid the loan or people the model gave the loan to who didn't repay. You go from the data to the subjective function. The objective function is used to search through some complicated space of models\u2014like a deep neural network, for those of you who know what that means, but it doesn't really matter\u2014and it's that model that gets deployed. Even though every step of this process is scientific and the machine learning scientist entirely understands that \"Okay, what we're going to do is use the data to define this objective and then search through some space of models for the model that best meets that objective,\" that human designer isn't going to be able to tell you what this model will do on any particular input. [embedded content]So, if you ask the model, \"Here's a loan application. Do you think the model will give them a loan or not,\" the human designer isn't going to be able to say, \"Oh, yeah. Because I wrote the code I know that they'll get the loan or that they won't because on line 17 of the program they haven't been in their current job long enough.\" The designer's going to say: \"I don't know. Run the model on it, and we'll find out whether they get a loan or not.\" Maybe more to the point, if you ask the question to the designer, \"Well, is it possible that this model that you built systematically rejects the loans of creditworthy black applicants compared to creditworthy white applicants,\" again the answer will be, \"I don't know. Why don't we try it and see?\" Or, is it possible that just releasing the details of this model or even using it in the field might leak the private information about the individuals used to train the model? Again, the answer would be, \"I don't know, because I oversaw this pipeline, but I didn't specifically engage in the automated optimization of the subjective function defined by a very large, complicated data set.\" In this way, even though hammers and algorithms are both human-designed artifacts for specific purposes, algorithms are quite different from a moral and ethical standpoint in that any ethical misbehaviors about these algorithms are quite removed from the individual who oversaw this process. Also, their flexibility of purpose\u2014a hammer is designed under normal circumstances to do exactly one thing very well that everybody completely understands. An algorithm is much more complicated and has much greater flexibility of purpose, so it's much harder to assign blame to any part of this pipeline or to understand what the consequences will be. In our book, what we try to argue is that one important component of the solutions to these problems\u2014in addition to the ones I mentioned before that are more about social change or institutional change\u2014is that we need to embed social values that we care about directly into the code of our algorithms. If there's one takeaway from our book, it's that we're here to tell you that that is scientifically possible\u2014not in all cases, and there will also be costs and tradeoffs that I'll talk about a little bit\u2014but the road is clear to making our algorithms better than they are today. I didn't say perfect, but better than they are today. If you're going to tell an algorithm how to avoid violations of privacy or of fairness or other social norms\u2014you might care about accountability or interpretability\u2014the first step is not to go write computer code. It's to think extremely hard about definitions, because if I'm going to tell an algorithm\u2014the thing about algorithms is that you can't leave anything uncertain. You can't say, \"Well, you know, make sure that you're not unfair to this population.\" You need to really say, \"What does 'unfair' mean, and how do you measure an unfairness, and how much unfairness is too much?\" One of the interesting exercises about this kind of scientific research is that even though scholars and practitioners\u2014many centuries or even eons before people like me came along\u2014have thought very deeply about things like fairness, for instance. Computer scientists are late to the study of fairness. Philosophers, economists, and social scientists have all thought much longer and more deeply about fairness than computer scientists. What's different is that they never had to think about it in so precise a way that you could tell it to a computer program. Sometimes there's great virtue in just that rigor by itself, even if you don't go on and do anything with it. Sometimes thinking that precisely about definitions exposes flaws in your thinking that were only going to be exposed by being that precise, and I'll give concrete examples as we go. The basic research agenda that Aaron and I and our students and many others in the machine learning community have been engaged in in the past few years is going through this process of thinking about different social properties or ethical properties we would like from our algorithms. Thinking hard about what the right definition\u2014or, as it might be, definitions\u2014should be, and then thinking about how do you implement them in an algorithm, and then what is the cost to other things that you might care about. To preview one big message of our book, nobody should expect that by asking for \"fairness\" from an algorithm, or \"privacy\" from an algorithm, that you won't degrade its accuracy because it's an additional constraint. If the optimal model\u2014ignoring fairness\u2014for making loans accurately happens to be discriminatory against some minority, then eradicating that discrimination by definition is going to make the error worse. So, there are going to be real costs. There are going to be monetary costs for the company that adopts the solutions that we suggest, and hard decisions to be made about how much to adopt them in exchange for how much profitability, for example. You've noticed I've written down a number of social norms here in different levels of gray scale. The gray scale is basically representing how much scientific progress we have made on the algorithmic study of these different social norms. Our opinion is that notions of data privacy or algorithmic privacy are on the firmest scientific foundations right now. The feeling is that we've settled on the right definition on the one hand, and we have made a fair amount of progress at algorithmically implementing that definition. Fairness has quite a bit of progress. It's not just messier right now; it's going to be messier, period, going forward, in the sense that we're going to have to entertain multiple competing definitions of fairness. Other social norms that you might have heard about are accountability or interpretability or even morality in algorithms. We don't think that any of these are less interesting or less important, but we put them in a lighter shade because less is known about them. I promise you that \"the singularity[4]\" is written down there, but you can't see it because it's so light. What I want to do with my time is give you a flavor of what this research agenda looks like and where the science is right now for the areas of privacy and for fairness, and then just very briefly at the end talk about some other topics that are in the book. Let's talk about data privacy for a second. To highlight this point that I made about sometimes thinking very precisely about definitions helping you expose the flaws in your own intuitions about these topics, let me start by picking on the notion of anonymization of data, which unfortunately is by an extremely wide margin the prevailing definition of privacy that is used in practice in industry. Any tech company whose services you use that has some privacy policy statement is almost certainly using a privacy definition that is some form of data anonymization. I'm here to deliver the unfortunate news that not only are those definitions flawed technically, they're fundamentally flawed conceptually. They cannot be fixed. It's a waste of time. Let me tell you why. What does anonymization, first of all, mean? Anonymization basically means taking an original data set\u2014like this little toy example; this table, the top one for just right now\u2014and redacting certain columns from it or coarsening certain columns in order to reduce the resolution of the data. Another term that's used that sounds fancier but is basically the same, is \"removing personally identifiable information (PII).\" Here's a hypothetical medical record database of a hospital, in which they decided sensibly, \"If we're going to release this data for scientific research\"\u2014which is something, by the way, that we'd all like them to do; scientific research is one of the better uses of things like machine learning these days\u2014\"we're not going to include people's names. We're just going to redact that column entirely and reduce the granularity of the data. I'm not going to specify people's exact age in years, I will just group them into decades. I'll say whether you're a 20-30, 30-40, etc. I won't put your full ZIP code in, but I'll put the first three digits so researchers have some idea of where you live, and then maybe I include some medical fields without coarsening or redaction.\" What is the goal of this kind of anonymization? The primary goal is that if I had a neighbor, let's say, because she's my neighbor I know what her name is, and I know her age, and maybe I know or suspect that she has been a patient at this particular hospital, then I shouldn't be able to identify her medical record from that information. In particular, if I have a neighbor and her name is Rebecca and I know she's 55 years old and I know she's female, because of this redaction and coarsening in this top database, I go and look at this database, and there are two records that match the information I know about Rebecca\u2014these two that are highlighted in red. The idea is that, if there are enough matches after the redaction and the coarsening, I will not really be able to pick out Rebecca's medical record, and she should somehow feel reassured by this. Of course, in this toy example, you can see I've already learned from this that she's either HIV-positive or has colitis, and Rebecca might prefer that I not know that she has one of those or the other, but you could imagine, Well, in a real database, there would be tens of thousands of these records, and if I did enough of this coarsening and redaction, maybe there would 100 different medical records that matched Rebecca, and now I wouldn't be able to glean much information about her true medical status at all. The problem is, suppose there's a second data set that has also been coarsened and redacted for exactly the same purposes, and I also happen to know or suspect, because it's another local hospital that Rebecca might have been treated or seen there as well. So, I go to the second database, and I say, \"Okay, 55-year-old females, how many of them are on the data set?\" This time there are three matches after the coarsening and redaction. But when I do the join of these two databases\u2014when I take the red records from the top database and the bottom database\u2014I now uniquely know that my neighbor is HIV-positive. You might again argue, \"Oh, but if the data sets are big enough and I do enough of this coarsening\"\u2014the idea is just broken. What's fundamentally broken about notions of anonymization is\u2014and this is a technical consequence of this flaw\u2014they pretend like the data set that's in front of you is the only data set that is ever going to exist in the world and that there are no auxiliary sources of information or additional databases that you can combine to try to triangulate and reidentify people. Lest you think, Oh, is this a real problem? It's a real problem. Many of the biggest breaches of private data\u2014other than the ones that are just due to cryptographic hacks\u2014are exactly due to this kind of reidentification, sometimes called \"linkage analysis,\" in which I take the allegedly anonymized database, but then I combine it with even publicly available information about individuals, and then I'm able to figure out, \"Okay, this allegedly anonymized individual in the database is this particular real-world individual.\" This happens all the time. This is an example where thinking hard about a definition will cause you to conclude that there's something irretrievably bad about this particular one. You might say, \"Okay, well, what's your better idea?\" Again, to demonstrate the value of thinking in a very precise way, let me propose what I think we could all agree\u2014at least in my English description of it\u2014is the strongest, most desirable definition of individual data privacy that we could possibly propose. It would go something like this: Suppose I promised you that any analysis or computation that involved your private data, that no harm could come to you as a consequence of that computation or analysis. You can write this down mathematically, but I think the spirit of it is clear from the English. Any computation that involves your private data cannot result in any harm to you, no matter what happens in the future, including new data sets becoming available that we didn't foresee at the time of this computation. I want to argue that this is asking too much. It would be great if we could do it, but it's asking too much in the sense that if we enforce this definition of privacy, we'll never be able to do anything useful with data. Here's the example. This is the front page of a famous paper from the 1950s. Suppose it's 1950, and you are a smoker. If it's 1950, you are a smoker because in 1950 everybody is a smoker because there are no known health risks of smoking, there's no social stigma associated with smoking, it's seen as glamorous and fashionable, and everybody does it. Suppose you're asked by some medical researchers, \"Hey, would you be willing to let your medical record be included in a study about the potential harmful effects of smoking,\" and you say, \"Sure.\" This study is then done, and this study firmly establishes the correlation between smoking and lung cancer, and your data was part of that study, and you're a smoker. We can argue that real harm was caused to you as a result of this study, because now the world knows that smoking and lung cancer are correlated. And if we want to make these harms concrete, since you didn't hide the fact that you were a smoker from anyone, including your health insurer, and they know that you're a smoker, and now they know this fact about smoking and lung cancer, they might raise your premiums. Among other things, literal financial harm has come to you as a result of this study. If we adopt the definition of privacy that I suggested, we would disallow this kind of scientific study, which I think we can all agree is a good type of study. But here's an observation about this study and this definition, which is that actually the inclusion of your specific idiosyncratic medical record in this study was in no way necessary to establish the link between smoking and lung cancer. The link between smoking and lung cancer is a fact about the world that can be reliably established with any sufficiently large database of medical records. It wasn't like your medical records' inclusion was the key piece of data that really nailed the correlation. As long as they had enough data of smokers and non-smokers and their medical history, they were going to learn this correlation. This leads us to a slight modification of the definition that I gave that I'm claiming is too strong, which is instead of saying \"no computation that involved your data should create any harm for you,\" we'll say, \"no harm should be created that wasn't going to be created if the same computation was done with only your data set removed.\" This is what's called \"differential privacy,\" which was introduced in roughly 2005. The thought experiment here isn't like, Well, your data was included, does harm come to you or not? We start with a database of n medical records, and yours is one of the n medical records in this individual\u2014you are Xavier, the medical record in the file folder in red. We perform two thought experiments. We say, \"Suppose we perform this computation or study or analysis using all the medical records,\" and the counterfactual is that we consider the same computational analysis done with n-1 medical records, where the -1 is we remove yours. If the harms that can come to you downstream from including your medical record in the n and disincluding it in the n-1 are basically the same, then we're going to call that \"privacy,\" and the only harms we're going to protect are the ones where the harm really came from the inclusion of your data set versus the other n-1. Notice this definition allows the smoking study because you are a smoker, yes, but there were lots of smokers in the data set. The same conclusion was going to be reached if it was removed, but any harm that really relied on your particular data, that's going to be disallowed by this definition of privacy. This is called differential privacy. Differential privacy basically acts by adding noise to computation. It turns out when you think about this\u2014when you get under the hood of differential privacy\u2014it really requires that algorithms be randomized or probabilistic, that they flip coins during computation. Let me describe one of the earliest industry deployments of differential privacy, which was done by Apple. They were apparently so excited about this that a company that we normally associate with good design taste decided to do this incredibly tacky thing of renting out the side of a Best Western or Residence Inn in Las Vegas and put this big ad for themselves on the side. So, what do they do? If you are a user of a recent or later model iPhone or iPad, one of the things your phone periodically does is report to the mothership of Apple information about your app usage, statistics about your app usage. Maybe on a weekly basis, it says, \"How many hours did you look at your email? How many hours did you play Angry Birds[5],\" etc. Why is Apple interested in these app usage statistics? They claim they're not actually interested in your app usage statistics, they want to know aggregates, they want to know what are the most popular apps platform-wide. Their app developers, of course, are very interested in these popularity statistics as well. So, rather than report your detailed app usage statistics, like you played Angry Birds for 7.2 hours, you read The Wall Street Journal for 2.1 hours, etc., they'll take that histogram of your app usage, and they will add a lot of noise to it. They'll basically add random positive or negative numbers to each of your different app usage statistics. Maybe you read The Wall Street Journal for 2.1 hours, and it adds +5 hours to that, and maybe it takes your 7.2 hours of Angry Birds usage and subtracts 3.7 hours from that. It just adds noise all across the board. It adds so much noise to this histogram that actually if I looked at this post-randomized version, I wouldn't learn much of anything at all about your actual app usage statistics because there's so much noise. But, because this noise is independent\u2014we would say it's zero-mean; it could be positive, it could be negative, and it's symmetrically distributed around zero\u2014if I have 100 million users and I get 100 million noisy reports like this and I add them together, I get extremely accurate estimates of aggregate usage without compromising any individual's privacy. This is the core concept behind differential privacy. Where it gets interesting is when you want to make much more complicated computations or analyses differentially private. The good news is that many of the most useful kinds of computations that we do these days, including pretty much everything in statistics and machine learning, can be made differentially private. The backpropagation algorithm for neural networks, which is the core algorithm underlying deep learning technology, is not differentially private. It does not give any privacy promises of any kind. There is a variant of it that in carefully chosen places adds carefully chosen types of noise that provably obeys this very strong definition of privacy. You might say, \"Okay, great. So, Apple has a way of protecting your app usage statistics. This seems like a rather low-stakes application,\" and I would agree with you. A big moonshot test for differential privacy is in the works. The U.S. Census is constitutionally required to preserve privacy of individual data, but the U.S. Census has never before committed to a definition of privacy, so it didn't really matter. They had very ad hoc anonymization-style ways of implementing privacy in the past. Recently, the U.S. Census has decided to bite the bullet, and every single statistic or report that they issue from the underlying data of the 2020 Census[6] will be done under the constraint of differential privacy. This is a big endeavor because there are a lot of engineering details to think about here. In particular, one of the engineering details\u2014and one of the themes of our book\u2014is in this adding noise to your app usage statistics, there's a knob we can turn here. I can add a little bit of noise to your app usage statistics, but then people will be able to infer more about your app usage statistics. If you really played an extraordinary amount of Angry Birds this week and I only add a little bit of noise, I won't exactly know how much Angry Birds that you played, but I'm going to be able to look at this and say, \"You're playing a lot of Angry Birds.\" If I add a little bit of noise, I provide less privacy to you, but then the aggregate will be more accurate. Or, I can add much, much more noise, and then the aggregate will be less accurate. So, there's a knob provided by differential privacy which lets you choose the tradeoff between the promises you make to individuals about their level of privacy and the accuracy of the aggregate computations that you're doing. Differential privacy, by the way, is correctly silent on how you should set that knob because how you should set that knob should depend on what's at stake. Maybe we don't really care that much about how much Apple knows about our usage statistics, and so we're okay with relatively little noise being added, but maybe if it's our medical record or even our census data or our financial history, we want a lot more noise to be added. So, differential privacy provides you a framework to manage this tradeoff and think about it quantitatively, but it doesn't tell you how to set that knob. One of the big engineering details, of course, for the U.S. Census is how to set that knob and how to set that knob on different computations. This is all I'm going to talk about for now about privacy, but I hope this gives you some sense of how thinking in this field goes about good definitions and bad definitions and about tradeoffs between social norms like privacy and things like utility, profitability, and accuracy. [embedded content]The study of algorithmic fairness, and more specifically, fairness in machine learning, is in a much more nascent state than privacy, and in particular, differential privacy. But we already know it's going to be a little bit messier than privacy, where I think many people who have thought deeply about privacy have converged on differential privacy as the right core notion. There's not agreement on definitions in fairness. In fact, it's even worse than that. It is known that entirely reasonable definitions of fairness that each makes sense in isolation are provably mathematically impossible to achieve simultaneously. This was actually discovered through a controversy between a company that developed a criminal risk assessment model used in sentencing decisions and a watchdog group that audited that model. The watchdog group pointed out a particular definition of fairness which was racially discriminatory. The company came back and said, \"Well, we're very concerned about racial fairness, and we implemented racial fairness in our model. We used this definition of racial fairness.\" There was some back-and-forth between these two parties. Then some more mathematically minded researchers in the community said, \"Huh. I wonder if it's even mathematically possible to achieve these two things simultaneously?\" and they proved a theorem showing that it wasn't. Not only like in the study of privacy will there be these tradeoffs between fairness and accuracy. It's even worse than that. There might be tradeoffs between different notions of fairness or even the same notion of fairness in different groups. In particular, there's no guarantee that if I build a predictive model for lending and make sure that it doesn't falsely reject black people more often than it falsely rejects white people, there's no guarantee that in the process of enforcing that fairness condition, I won't actually magnify gender discrimination. To put it bluntly, something that we say early and often in the book is that when machine learning is involved and you pick some objective function to optimize like error, you should never expect to get for free anything that you didn't explicitly state in the objective, and you shouldn't expect to avoid any behavior that you didn't specify should be explicitly avoided. Because if you're searching some complicated model space looking for the lower error and there's some little corner of the model space where you can even incrementally, infinitesimally improve your error at the expense of some social norm, machine learning is going to go for that corner because that's what it does. But let me give you a quick visceral example of the ways in which machine learning can naturally engender unfairness or discrimination of various clients. Let's suppose that we're a college admissions office and we're trying to develop a predictive model for collegiate success based on, let's say, just high school grade point average (GPA) on the X-axis and SAT[7] score on the Y-axis. Each little plus or minus here is a previous applicant to our college that we actually admitted, so we know whether they succeeded in college or not. Pick any quantitative definition of success in college that you want. Let's say it's \"graduate within five years of matriculating with at least a 3.0 GPA.\" It could be \"donates at least $10 million back to the college within 20 years of graduating.\" As long as we can measure it, I don't care what it is. Each little point's X-value is the GPA of that past admit; the Y-value is the SAT score of that past admit. But then the plus or minus is whether they succeeded in college or not. I'd like you to notice a couple of things about this population of individuals. First of all, if you stared at this carefully, you'd notice that slightly less than half of the admits succeeded. There are slightly more than 50 percent minuses and slightly less than 50 percent pluses. That's observation number one. The other observation is that if I had to predict a model from this data, it's pretty clear that there's a simple model that separates the pluses from the minuses. If I draw this diagonal line and I say, \"Everybody whose combination of SAT score and GPA is above that line, I admit, the other ones I reject,\" I would make very few mistakes on this data set. There are a couple. There are some false admits and some false rejects, but this simple model does a pretty good job of separating the successes from the non-successes. But suppose in my data set there's also a second population and that their data looks like this. I want to make a couple of points about this population. First of all, they are the minority. There are many fewer of these red points than there were of these orange points. Observation number two is that this population is slightly more qualified for college. There are an equal number of pluses here and minuses here in this minority population compared to the majority. Observation number three is that there is actually a perfect model separating for pluses and minuses here, which is this diagonal line. Now, if I train a model on the aggregate data\u2014I've got both the reds and the oranges here now\u2014and I say just minimize my predictive error on the combined data set, well, because the red points are such a small fraction of the data, I'm still going to end up choosing the model, which basically is the best model for the orange population, at the cost of rejecting every single qualified minority applicant. You might ask, \"Can this really happen in the real world?\" Here's one story about why this might happen. The difference between the orange and the red population doesn't have to do with collegiate success. It basically is the case that the SAT scores of the minority population are systematically shifted downward, regardless of success of not. One explanation for that could be that the orange population comes from a wealthy demographic in which you pay for SAT preparation courses and multiple re-takes of the exam, all of which cost money. The minority population can't afford any of that, and so, even though they're no less prepared for college, they're less financially able to game this exam, and so they have systematically deflated SAT scores. This is one of several ways in which the natural optimization process of machine learning can result in visceral discrimination. There are a number of things you might say about this. You might say, \"If I just look at this data, I would realize it's not that they're less qualified, it's just that their SAT scores are lower, and there are very natural socioeconomic explanations for that. Why not just build two separate models? Why not use this model for the orange population and this model for the minority population.\" In fact, by doing that, I would avoid this tradeoff between accuracy and fairness. I would actually have a model that's both more fair and more accurate on both populations. The problem is many laws forbid the use of race, for example, as an input to the model at all, and a model that says, \"If you're from this race, then use this line, and if you're from this race, use that line,\" that is a model that is using race as an input. It's like a decision tree that says, \"First, look at the race and then branch right in one race and this way in another.\" A lot of laws that we have that are explicitly designed to protect some minority group can have the unintended effect of guaranteeing that we discriminate against that minority group if machine learning is the process by which we're developing our model. What's a fix to this? One fix to this would be to not enact laws that forbid the use of making these observations and building different models if it increases fairness. Another thing I could do is, instead of saying the objective is to minimize the error on the combined data set, I could basically specify a new objective that says, \"The goal is to minimize the error, subject to the constraint that the false rejection rates between the two populations can't be too different.\" The false rejection rate on the red population of this model is 100 percent; every red plus here is rejected. The false rejection rate on the orange population is close to 0. The most accurate model has the maximum possible unfairness. I could instead say, \"You can still have accuracy as an objective, but you have to find the single line that minimizes the error, subject to the condition that the fraction of red pluses that you reject and the fraction of orange pluses that you reject have to be within 1 percent of each other or 5 percent of each other or 15 percent of each other. So, now I have another knob. I have a knob that basically says how much unfairness do I allow?, and conditioned on that amount of unfairness, then you optimize the error. Right now, for this model, that knob has to be set at 100 percent. The disparity in false rejection rate is close to 100 percent. But as I crank that knob down and ask for less and less unfairness, I'm going to change the model, and it'll make the accuracy worse. This is not some kind of vague conceptual thing. On real data sets, you can actually plot out quantitatively the tradeoffs you face between accuracy and unfairness. I won't go into details, but on three different data sets in which fairness is a concern\u2014one of these is a criminal recidivism data set, another one is about predicting school performance. On the X-axis here\u2014if you could see what the X-axis is\u2014is error, so smaller is better; the Y-axis is unfairness, so smaller is better. In a perfect world, we'd be at zero error and zero unfairness. In machine learning in general on real problems you're never going to get to zero error, period. But you can see that on this plot there is this tradeoff. I can minimize my error at this point, but I'll get the maximum unfairness. I can also ask for zero unfairness, and I get the worse error, or I can be anywhere in between. This is where science has to stop and policy has to start. Because people like me can do a very good job at creating the theory and algorithms that result in plots like this, but at some point somebody or society has to decide, \"In this particular application, like criminal risk assessment, this is the right tradeoff between error and unfairness. In this other application, like gender bias in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics advertising on Google, this is the right balance between accuracy and fairness.\" At some point, this dialogue has to happen between scientists and policymakers, regulators, legal, and practitioners. We think that a very good starting point for that dialogue is to make these tradeoffs quantitative and really discuss the hard numbers around: When you ask for more fairness, how much accuracy are you giving up, and vice versa? What I've just described to you along with the introduction covers roughly the first half of our book, and our book is meant to be hopefully an engaging, entertaining, general audience, readable treatment of these topics. There are no equations in the book whatsoever. We try to populate it with many real-world examples. But it only covers the first half of the book. You might wonder, What's in the second half of the book? A big part of the second half of the book concerns situations in which algorithms are exhibiting behaviors that we might think of as socially undesirable, but it's not so easy to blame the algorithm exclusively. In the examples I've been giving so far, it's like, \"You got rejected for a loan or rejected from college, even though you deserved to get the loan or get in.\" You may not even know that an algorithm was making this decision about you. Or, you may not even know that your data was used to train the model that is making this decision on other people. To a first approximation it really does seem fair to think of algorithms as victimizing individual people. There are a lot of other modern technological settings where there's a population of users of an algorithm, or I might say more specifically an app, and the misbehavior is an emergent phenomenon, not of just the algorithm or app itself, but the incentives and use of that app or algorithm by the entire population. There are many examples of this. Let me give the cleanest one. The cleanest one is navigation apps like Google Maps[8] and Waze[9]. These apps clearly are taking all of our collective data, including our real-time Global Positioning System coordinates, so they know about real-time traffic on all of the roadways, and you type in, \"I want to drive from point A to point B. What's the fastest route?\" And it's in response, not in some abstract way by looking at a fold-out map and saying, \"This is the minimum distance,\" because that's not what you care about. You want to get from point A to point B the fastest. On the one hand, what could be better? What could be better than this app that in response to your particular desires right this minute, knowing what everybody else is doing on the roads, optimizes your driving route. Trust me, I use them every time I drive. But if you step back from this for a second, you might ask the following question: Is it possible that by all of us using these apps that are greedily maximizing our own selfish interests\u2014to use game-theoretic language because much of the second half of the book is about settings in which game theory is a valuable tool for thinking\u2014could it be that we're actually all worse off by using these apps? You might think, How could that happen? How could it be that everybody being selfish for themselves results in a collective outcome that's worse for many individuals or maybe even the entire population? If you've ever taken a game theory class, probably the first example you were given is prisoner's dilemma[10]. Prisoner's dilemma is the canonical simple game-theoretic model in which, by everybody being self-interested and optimizing against what everyone else is doing, the outcome for the two players is much, much worse for both of them than it could have been under some alternate, non-equilibrium solution. I think a very correct view of these types of apps is that, in game theory terms, they are \"helping all of us compute our best response\" in a game, and that is driving us toward the competitive or literally the Nash equilibrium[11] of these games, if you've taken some game theory. In fact, it is the case not just on paper\u2014in the book we give a simple mathematical example of where everybody optimizing selfishly for their driving time causes the collective driving time to go up by 33 percent. There are actually real instances of this in the world. For the locals here, there was huge concern about closing much of Times Square to vehicular traffic. People were like, \"Oh, my god! Are you out of your mind? The busiest urban traffic area in the United States, you're going to close that and make it a pedestrian mall?\" In fact, it's not that bad. In fact, maybe it has even gotten better. Just because you add capacity to a network of roads or take it away, people react to it in a game-theoretic, competitive, or self-interested way, and so you have to think not just about the capacity you've added or taken away but about what the equilibrium behavior that will result from it is. Much of the second half of the book is concerned with these kinds of things, and we take some liberties in this discussion that I think are not unreasonable. Another domain in which we have all become quite used to personalization, or what I would call the \"algorithmically aided computation of best responses,\" is in social media. There's an algorithm in Facebook's newsfeed that decides what content to show you: which of your friends' posts to prioritize, what ads to show you, what news or content to show you. It's like Google Maps and Waze. It's learning about your preferences and showing you the stuff that you like; the code word for this being \"maximizing user engagement.\" These models built by machine learning have discovered that it's better to show you, let's say, political news that you are inclined to agree with than political news that you find offensive or disagreeable. That increases engagement. Again, like Google Maps and Waze, what could be better? What could be better than, instead of my having to look at a bunch of stuff that I don't like or irrelevant stuff, what could be better than just having an algorithm tell me which route to drive or show me what content? The result, of course, is an equilibrium that we might not like. We might feel like, yes, each individual is having this app personally optimized for them. Maybe this has come at the cost, let's say, not to driving time in the case of Facebook's newsfeed but to a deliberative democratic society, for example. I think many people feel like that is in fact what has happened. What we try to do is put this on slightly firmer scientific footing, as thinking about this as a bad equilibrium that results from all this self-optimization enabled by apps. We do have algorithmic proposals for these kinds of problems as well. They're a little bit different than just going into the code, but again, there are things that could be done now. As a concrete example, if we don't like the equilibrium that Facebook's current newsfeed algorithm has driven us to\u2014trust me, the way machine learning works is that by the same reason that Facebook knows what content you like, that same model also tells it what you don't like, or what you like slightly less than what you like the most. It would not take a big change to their code to do a little bit more exploration and mix into your newsfeed some stuff that you might find less agreeable, or what we might call \"opposing viewpoints.\" They don't have to do this all at once wholesale. They could in fact just offer a slider bar to individual users that they could experiment with and say, \"Show me a little bit more stuff that's further afield than what I agree with,\" and this might help the algorithm nudge us out of this bad equilibrium that many people feel like we've gotten into. We also do talk about things that we think have a much longer way to go scientifically\u2014like interpretability of algorithms, accountability, morality\u2014and we do even talk a little bit about the singularity toward the end, but I'll leave that unspoken to entice you to go read the book. Let me stop there, and I'll take any questions.QuestionsQUESTION: I had one question regarding the constraints. You said that some of these sensitive variables by law cannot be included when we are modeling. Is it okay if you are using them in the constraints then? MICHAEL KEARNS: First of all, just to separate two issues, I basically think these laws are a bad idea. They're a bad idea for at least two reasons. One is the one that I discussed, which is that by refusing the use of race in a predictive model you might actually be ensuring discrimination against the very group that you were trying to protect by disincluding it. Second, you're fooling yourself. Maybe it made sense in the 1970s for credit scoring to forbid the use of race because such limited data was available about people. These days there are so many proxies for race that I can find in other sources of data. Unfortunately, in the United States for the most part your ZIP code is a rather good indicator of your race already, as well as many other things that would surprise you\u2014like what kind of car you drive, whether you're a Mac or a PC user. One joke is that 10 years ago or so I was at an academic conference, and academics are famous for their liberal politics. After a few drinks at a dinner, the host said, \"I want you all to think. Do any of you know a Republican[12] who uses a Mac?\" Everybody is absorbed in thought for a minute, and then I said, \"Actually, what everybody's thinking about is whether they know a Republican first, and then they'll think about whether they use a Mac.\" I'm joking, but the point is a lot of apparently innocuous attributes about you that you don't even think are particularly sensitive, can be very correlated statistically with things like race or even other things that you might not even know about yourself. I think that to \"get fairness by forbidding the use of certain features\" is a losing proposition and that the right alternative is to say, \"Use any data that you want. Don't racially discriminate.\" That's the right solution, not trying to get to it indirectly by assuming that the models work a certain way and that if you don't give them certain information that they can't discriminate. That has just proven to be a flawed way of thinking, especially in the modern, data-rich era. [embedded content]QUESTION: Thank you so much for a fascinating talk. With nanotechnology increasing the velocity of computation and the existence of both good actors and bad actors, how from an ethical point of view can the influence\u2014it might be very hard to undo something when it's happening at nano speed. How do we navigate this kind of territory? MICHAEL KEARNS: I don't think I have a general answer to what we might think of as the computational arms race. I think that arms race is being played out in many domains. In particular, computer security has this flavor all the time. In computer security you try to anticipate all of the ways in which hackers might breach your system or your data, but they have the luxury of figuring out your vulnerabilities and the things that you didn't think about in getting you there. I think that that area\u2014the more data you have, the more compute power you have\u2014that all helps, but at the end of the day the thing is fundamentally some kind of game between two players, and in the game it is harder to be the defender than the attacker. It's like a universal versus an existential quantifier: the defender has to protect against everything; the attacker just has to find the one thing you didn't think of. One concrete example where I think things do need to change is in the regulatory approach to tech companies. To the extent that large regulatory agencies in the United States want to get serious about preventing the kinds of harms that we discuss in the book on users, I think we are in a very flawed state right now. First of all, in defense of the regulatory agencies, they have very strong limitations on what they can and can't do right now. They are basically at a great disadvantage to the big tech companies. People think of it as a big win for the regulatory community when Facebook has to pay a huge fine for severe privacy violations. Then, the main remedy to that going forward is, \"You need to fix your internal processes and people.\" Imagine an alternative world where the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice or what have you actually is allowed internal access to the systems, data, and algorithms of a company like Facebook and can find misdeeds before they have widespread damage. This is going to require legal and regulatory change. Tech companies are going to be resistant to it, but there's nothing conceptual about it that's difficult. If an algorithm is exhibiting racial, gender, or other discrimination, there's a way of auditing those algorithms and discovering that with not great difficulty. Why not let the regulatory agencies have that access rather than waiting until the media or some other hacker group has to expose a flaw, and then there's a big fine and procedural change? I think that's an area where\u2014I'm not sure about nanotechnology per se\u2014in this battle between two opposing parties, there are concrete ways you could level that playing field I think in very productive ways. This is a longer conversation, but I also don't really buy the argument that this would infringe severely on the intellectual property of the technology companies. I think it could be done in a way that lets them have their intellectual property but provides much greater consumer protections. QUESTIONER: So that would be the same idea of the defender and the attacker. At a regulatory level, there would be the attacker, if they were able to go in\u2014 MICHAEL KEARNS: Maybe I wouldn't call it attacker and defender, I would call it an \"auditor.\" QUESTIONER: That's fine, whatever, but I understand the dynamic. Thank you for that. QUESTION: Parveen Singh, Carnegie New Leaders. There has been a big conversation on the West Coast with Uber and Lyft about shared mobility and the data that Uber, Lyft, and Waze collect being given to city and municipal governments[13]. As a New Yorker, we would love to have data-driven technology in our transit system. I want to get your perspective on what you think about city and local governments having access to the data that private companies collect for their transit systems. MICHAEL KEARNS: I'm generally a great believer in any socially good use of data, provided there are protections against the kinds of things that I describe here. I think it would be great if Uber and Lyft wanted to share their data with urban municipalities in order to improve public transit or mobility. You have to also be concerned about the privacy of the individual data that Uber and Lyft collect being shared with a wider set of people. You might already worry about them just having it in the first place. But in general, I'm very much in favor of that kind of effort. It just has to be managed and negotiated in a way that balances the tradeoff between the good that is caused and the potential harms. A lot of those types of things I think are negotiations that need to happen on the policy side and maybe are less technical than some of the more limited problems that we're discussing in the book, but I think it's all on the same spectrum. QUESTION: I have a question about the ethics in terms of collaborating and teaching techniques\u2014advanced techniques\u2014to people who are developing AI systems who don't incorporate these ethical elements, who are only concerned with optimization. Is there a trend within the academic world, or the world more broadly, to try to make sure that people are only collaborating with people who incorporate these? I'm thinking specifically in terms of international relations related to Chinese efforts to use AI to identify potential nodes of dissent, and how that's shifting. MICHAEL KEARNS: I don't have any special insight into Chinese governmental use of data. My view is probably no more informed than many people in this room, but it doesn't look good. It doesn't look good to have one party[14] setting policy with unfettered access. If we worry about the United States being a surveillance state, I think there it's not even an open secret, it's just open that it is. I don't have a lot to say about China in particular. I do think that the use of things like social media data to identify dissident groups and to use it for political purposes, or to disadvantage or harm your enemies, is the opposite of the kinds of applications that he was discussing over there, and so it should be disallowed basically. We've had our own versions of these things\u2014or at least claims of our own versions of these things\u2014in the United States that again seem small in comparison to places where that kind of data is used to really harm people physically, but again you don't want to walk down that slope at all. I don't like the use of people's social media data to target political misinformation at them, to the extent that that's happening. I think these are all bad uses of algorithms and machine learning. QUESTION: Thank you so much for your lecture. I really enjoyed it. I think my question is a little similar. I work for an organization. We are part of a global coalition called Campaign to Stop Killer Robots[15]. In essence, we advocate for international law to prohibit development of fully autonomous weapons, which basically means any weapons system that can deploy force without meaningful human control. I just wondered, on behalf of the campaign, if you had any thoughts about the use of algorithms in weapons systems or even in law enforcement. MICHAEL KEARNS: Yes. We talk very briefly about this in the last chapter of the book. Let me use your example to more generally ask the question that I think people individually need to think about and society as a whole needs to think about. Are there certain types of decisions that we just don't want algorithms to make, or certain types of things that we don't want algorithms to do?\u2014not even because of the problems that I'm identifying here, which is that they do them badly in some way or another, but even if they did them perfectly, we don't want them to do it because of the moral character involved. We reference in this part of the book this great book by Michael Sandel[16] who is a well-known ethicist at Harvard University. He is the source of these trolley car thought experiences[17]: What would you do? Should the car turn and kill the passenger or kill the school kids? He has a great book called What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets[18]. I was very influenced by his book in writing our book. His book is about economics, and his book is about the rise of economic and market-based thinking after World War II[19] and the gradual creep of markets into things that he, morally, doesn't think should be markets at all. He points out that sometimes when you make a market out of something, it changes the nature of the good being sold. I was very influenced by that because I felt like in many places in this book you could swap out the word \"markets\" for \"algorithms\" and \"things that shouldn't be sold\" for \"decisions algorithms shouldn't make,\" and it would make sense, and I think automated warfare is a good one. Even if, hypothetically, algorithms could make perfectly targeted drone strikes with no collateral damage whatsoever in an autonomous, unsupervised, no-human-in-the-loop fashion, maybe we think that shouldn't be done, just because only a human being can accept the moral agency or responsibility of the decision to kill another human being in a way that an algorithm just can't. So, even if it makes the decision perfectly, you change the moral character of the decision by having an algorithm make it. I definitely agree. There are domains\u2014and I would personally count for myself automated warfare as one\u2014where I would want to tread extremely carefully, even if algorithms are much better than human actors. I think I agree with the mission that you describe. QUESTION: Thank you again. I just wanted to ask, by the title of your book it seems like the \"ethical algorithm\" might exist, or at least that's what you're arguing. It's mentioned that fairness, for example, could be gained in these algorithms by introducing multiple constraints, but privacy could be considered an additional constraint. Then, when you go on to list the others, the more and more we introduce constraints into this optimization problem, there is going to be some utility tradeoff as mentioned. What evidence have you seen in your research would lend itself to say that? Even with as many constraints as we can think of in terms of formulating morality into an algorithm, how can we still get something that works and provides value? QUESTION: I have a question about privacy and fairness. One of the things you mentioned is that fairness might require knowing the variables like race or gender to make sure that the algorithm is fair. Do you think that could be at odds to privacy because the user may not want to reveal those variables in the first place? What do you think about that? MICHAEL KEARNS: I think these two questions are extremely similar. Basically, the more constraints you add, the more tradeoffs there are. If you ask for more fairness, you might get less accuracy; if you ask for more fairness, you might get less privacy; if you ask for more fairness of one type, you might get less for another. If you ask for all these things simultaneously, you might not be able to do anything useful with data, and that's the reality. When we say the \"ethical algorithm,\" we're not suggesting that there's going to be some master algorithm which encodes all of the social norms we might care about into a single algorithm that's still useful for anything. I don't think that thing exists. That's why I think science can take us to the point of making these tradeoffs explicit and quantitative. Then, society in the abstract and stakeholders in particular problems are going to have to navigate which of these norms they really care about and how much and make those tradeoffs and hope that there is still something useful to do with algorithms and data once they've specified their constraints. QUESTION: I just wanted to segue into policy a little bit. What do we do when\u2014for example, with Jonathan Haidt[20]'s \"foundations of morality[21],\" we've seen that there are very different ways that different cultures interpret morality, fairness, and even privacy to a certain degree. How do we think about social norms and policies that can be applied on a larger scale globally where we can actually try to come up with some sort of a social norm on anything\u2014be it on privacy or on fairness\u2014that is applicable culturally on a global scale? MICHAEL KEARNS: That's a great question, and we talk very briefly about this kind of thing. It really is true, especially in fairness, where there are multiple different definitions that are in competition with each other, each of these definitions is in some sense like received wisdom. Who decides what group should be protected, and what would constitute harm to that group? That might mean something very different in one culture or another culture. It might even mean something different to different people. As far as I can tell, there's very little known about ordinary people's subjective notions of privacy or fairness. There is very little behavioral work on this kind of thing. We did a little bit in a mini-project at Penn back in the spring, where we showed subjects pairs of criminal records from the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions data set and said, \"Do you think these two individuals are sufficiently similar that they should be assessed to have similar risk of recommitting a violent crime?\" We still haven't really grokked the data in detail yet, but the first thing you realize from this data is that different people have different opinions on this. Just in this pair-wise assessment task, some people have very restrictive notions of fairness that would cost a lot to accuracy if you implemented their fairness notions, and other people are more liberal, and you could build more accurate models and still satisfy their subjective notion. I think this line of work is basically absent in the literature that we're describing in this book right now, because we're trying to talk about the science. But to do science on this we have to know, first of all, what different cultures would think constitutes fairness or privacy and how it differs across different cultures. While I'm interested in doing this kind of research, I'm not a social scientist by training, and I think we need more social scientists by training doing this kind of work in multiple cultures and across multiple demographic groups and the like. So, I think it's a pretty wide-open landscape for this kind of stuff. I think it's going to be increasingly important because, especially once these received-wisdom fairness notions prove to really be costing you in other dimensions, then people are going to look hard at them and say, \"Wait. Who says that this is the group to protect and that this is what constitutes harm to them?\" I don't think there are great answers to that question. Thank you, everybody. I appreciate your coming out.

The App Store originally launched alongside the release of the 3G model - 12 months after the original iPhone. The store gave developers the opportunity to write third party native apps for the iPhone, as long as they paid the 30% commission to Apple. Unlike competing android devices, however, you can't load apps onto an iPhone unless you get them from the official App Store. </p><p>Installing apps from unofficial sources is known as ' sideloading '. Read more: For tech giants, a cautionary tale from 19th century railroads on the limits of competition This might be about to change. A recent court case has the potential to require Apple to open their device to sideloading of apps from outside of the App Store, overturning 10 years of precedent. Could Apple finally be losing their control over the way apps are installed on their platform? And was it ethical to have such a closed 'ecosystem' in the first place? Shifting from an open to a closed ecosystem When Apple first launched the App Store, the model they presented was quite unique. In contrast to the Macintosh platform that allowed anyone to download apps from anywhere and run them on their Mac, the iPhone store limited the apps that could be used. Developers were required to submit apps to the App Store for review. Apple could then check the security was up to the standards of its App Store Review Guidelines . This ensured no unintended functionality was introduced, and malware was kept to a minimum. Apple was often lauded for this decision. Known for higher quality and safer apps , they have built on this over the years by introducing stronger remote app deletion measures and developer signing requirements . But hanging over it all was the fact this process ensured Apple secured 30% of any app sales revenue - a figure that has surely propped up their services income . At the most recent worldwide developer conference ( WWDC ), Apple claimed they had paid over $100 billion to developers over the years, which means Apple would have made around $30 billion of their own. On top of this, the limitations on the App Store means some apps are not eligible. This has led to a continuing desire for some users to hack their phones through jailbreaking - a practice that allows users to run apps that aren't available in the store. Read more: Should monopoly businesses have an obligation to create competition? So, in spite of the security benefits, this limitation has caused some problems. And it's clear some users questioned the ethics of this closed approach. Why does this matter so much? The sandbox is fun, but sometimes we prefer the grass Something not often talked about in relation to the App Store is Apple's inability to bring this closed model to the Mac. Buoyed by the success of the iOS App Store, Apple eventually introduced a Mac variant in 2011 . But they struggled to reach a critical mass of apps in that store - partly because developers weren't used to these restrictions on the Mac. In particular, a feature called 'sandboxing' - which prevents particular apps from accessing other parts of your operating system - meant many of the most popular apps couldn't be added to the Mac App Store without extensive modifications. Although Apple appears to have reversed this decision at the most recent WWDC , the damage is clear. The Mac App Store is nowhere near as popular as the iOS equivalent, in part due to this lack of flexibility. The closed ecosystem has also led to some other problems for Apple. For instance, the restriction that all purchases needed to be made in the app so Apple gets their 30% cut has caused a headache for services such as Spotify , which already have a service customers pay for outside the app. The issue reportedly led to an investigation by US antitrust regulators in 2015. Read more: 'Big Tech' isn't one big monopoly - it's 5 companies all in different businesses Should Apple be salty about the Pepper lawsuit? Which leads us back to the recent lawsuit, brought by Robert Pepper et al - a group of iPhone users suing over anti competitive behaviour. The class action suit seeks to change the way Apple runs the App Store. Despite being dismissed several times since originally being brought in 2011, the suit has made it to the Supreme Court and will now be heard over a nine month window starting in October. In what might turn out to be a landmark case, Pepper is asking to be allowed to sideload apps and avoid the Apple cut on their purchases. This presents a problem for Apple, because it means they lose control of the system. On the positive side, this could mean more exciting apps for consumers, but it also might mean more malware. Either way, it will mean big changes for Apple, who seem to genuinely believe the closed model is best. The bigger question is what this might mean for Apple's culture. The company is famous for controlling all aspects of their vertical integration. What happens if they're forced to become more flexible? Will they buck against this, or will we see a more open, adaptive Apple in the future? Only time will tell, but it's clear that after 10 years of the App Store, this case could mark a change that makes the future quite different from the past.

She has decided to launch two new antitrust cases against Apple Inc (US:APPL), looking at its commission structure on sales and subscriptions made via its App Store, and a separate investigation into the manner in which Apple Pay should be used in merchants' apps and websites. The European Commission has previously taken aim at Apple over its tax arrangements in the Irish Republic, while other US tech counterparts such as Google parent company Alphabet (US:GOOGL) have also previously come under scrutiny from European regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">News on the Apple probes followed an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal that Ms Vestager has also trained her sights on Amazon.com (US:AMZN), specifically the way in which it exploits data generated from third-party retailers on its site. </p><p>Trading blocs are protectionist by nature, so there is a certain irony in an EU competition commissioner going after the world's largest online marketplace. Nevertheless, it is the latest sign that the Danish politician is intent on reining in business practices which my colleague Alex Newman believes are the result of \"a long-sighted, often creative and sometimes brutal drive to dominate every market it [Amazon] touches\".</p><p>A company does not have to achieve pure monopoly status to garner some of the related benefits, such as lower long-run average costs. If adequately capitalised, it can simply crowd out competition by prioritising market share over profitability as its footprint expands. This criticism has been levelled at Amazon in the past, as reduced competition can potentially result in unfavourable price structures for consumers over the long haul.</p><p>This time around, however, the EU Commissioner is apparently more interested in Amazon's ability to utilise the metadata linked to sale patterns for its third-party retailers, with a view to creating Amazon-branded products which then compete with the original goods. In an instant, Amazon can tell which products are flying off the shelves and which third-party vendors are attracting the most attention.</p><p>                     Legal challenges proliferate as online dominance grows                   </p><p>Big tech companies are now faced by legal challenges across multiple jurisdictions, with the step-up in institutional scrutiny a possible reflection of how regulatory frameworks often lag technological change. For investors, these latest developments again raise the question as to whether regulatory risk has been adequately priced in to valuations for the US tech giants. Although this is nigh on impossible to quantify, at the very least it should remind us that these businesses are certainly not inviolate.</p><p>                     From Wuhan to Silicon Valley                   </p><p>The orthodox view is that the global pandemic, or rather our response to it, has enhanced the market position of the FAANGs. With more commercial functions and personal interactions being conducted online than ever before, their reputation as modern-day utilities has been further entrenched. Although this view is eminently reasonable, we cannot blithely assume that the enforced changes in behaviour will fundamentally alter the way that businesses and consumers act over the long run. They may well accelerate existing trends, but we cannot say with certainty if they will resonate fully over the long run. For now, there is no 'new normal'.</p><p>What we can say is that big tech has been propping up the major US indices through the second-quarter rally, on the back of what Alex Newman describes as \"an unwavering allocation to fast-growing US-based market winners\" - for \"unwavering\", should we read \"indiscriminate?\" For even as the EU was zeroing in on Apple's alleged antitrust practices, the Trump White House was leaking details of what is termed the \"Executive Order on Online Censorship\".</p><p>                     All the President's Memes                   </p><p>The Executive Order targets social media companies and the liability protections they enjoy under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which make it virtually impossible to sue an online provider for defamation because of third-party posts on its pages. Section 230 was originally formulated to allow the nascent online media industry to take root in the economy by providing protections not afforded to conventional media outlets and the press.</p><p>The legislation effectively treats the likes of Facebook (US:FB), YouTube, and Twitter (US:TWTR) as if they were public forums, largely devoid of editorial accountability. The Executive Order was triggered by a recent decision by Twitter to flag as \"potentially misleading\" two of the President's tweets, his favoured mode of communication. The argument runs that the online media companies should not enjoy the protections set out in the legislation if they selectively editorialise content. Conversely, others in Washington pour scorn on the online providers because they have failed to adequately monitor their platforms (a case of damned if you do, damned if you don't).</p><p>                     Priced for world domination                   </p><p>Judging by valuations, it seems as if institutional investors are sanguine in the face of regulatory risk. On the day that Facebook was hit with a multi-billion dollar fine over the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, its share priced crept up slightly. The ongoing lockdown measures have also been favourable for Facebook and other social media sites, but they have been doubly so for Amazon, which will capture a significant proportion of the growth in e-commerce with conventional retail activity curtailed.</p><p>It helps to explain why the group's share price is up by a third this year, even though aggregate demand in many advanced economies has slumped alarmingly. A diversification in favour of non-retail revenue streams has reinforced margins, with the web services arm now generating the lion's share of profits. Amazon's shares are priced for world domination on a forward price/earnings multiple just shy of three figures. Even aside from Ms Vestager's attentions, there must be several favourable assumptions built into the current valuation, something of a worry as the regulatory regimes tighten, possibly with a view to putting the brakes on further vertical integration. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-63695151</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6054-1GY1-F021-602H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><timeReceived>9:43 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

She has decided to launch two new antitrust cases against Apple (US:AAPL), looking at its commission structure on sales and subscriptions made via its App Store, and a separate investigation into the manner in which Apple Pay should be used in merchants' apps and websites. The European Commission has previously taken aim at Apple over its tax arrangements in the Irish Republic, while other US tech counterparts such as Google parent company Alphabet (US:GOOGL) have also previously come under scrutiny from European regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">News on the Apple probes followed a report in the Wall Street Journal that Ms Vestager had also trained her sights on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Amazon.com\">www.Amazon.com</url> (US:AMZN), specifically the way in which it exploits data generated from third-party retailers on its site.</p><p>Trading blocs are protectionist by nature, so there is a certain irony in an EU competition commissioner going after the world's largest online marketplace. It is the latest sign that the Danish politician is intent on reining in business practices which my colleague Alex Newman believes are the result of \"a long-sighted, often creative and sometimes brutal drive to dominate every market it [Amazon] touches\".</p><p>A company does not have to achieve pure monopoly status to garner some of the related benefits, such as lower long-run average costs. If adequately capitalised, it can simply crowd out competition by prioritising market share over profitability as its footprint expands. This criticism has been levelled at Amazon in the past, as reduced competition can potentially result in unfavourable price structures for consumers over the long haul.</p><p>This time around, however, the EU Commissioner is apparently more interested in Amazon's ability to utilise the metadata linked to sale patterns for its third-party retailers, with a view to creating Amazon-branded products which then compete with the original goods. In an instant, Amazon can tell which products are flying off the shelves and which third-party vendors are attracting the most attention.</p><p>Legal challenges proliferate Big tech companies are now faced by legal challenges across multiple jurisdictions, with the step-up in institutional scrutiny a possible reflection of how regulatory frameworks often lag technological change. For investors, these latest developments raise the question as to whether regulatory risk has been adequately priced in to valuations for the US tech giants. Although this is nigh on impossible to quantify, it should remind us that these businesses are certainly not inviolate.</p><p>From Wuhan to Silicon Valley The orthodox view is that the global pandemic, or rather our response to it, has enhanced the market position of the FAANGs. With more commercial functions and personal interactions being conducted online than ever before, their reputation as modern-day utilities has been further entrenched. Although this view is eminently reasonable, we cannot blithely assume that the enforced changes in behaviour will fundamentally alter the way that businesses and consumers act over the long run. They may well accelerate existing trends, but we cannot say with certainty if they will resonate fully over the long run. For now, there is no 'new normal'.</p><p>What we can say is that big tech has been propping up the major US indices through the second-quarter rally, on the back of what Alex Newman describes as \"an unwavering allocation to fast-growing US-based market winners\" - for \"unwavering\", should we read \"indiscriminate?\" For even as the EU was zeroing in on Apple's alleged antitrust practices, the Trump White House was leaking details of what is termed the \"Executive Order on Online Censorship\".</p><p>All the president's memes The Executive Order targets social media companies and the liability protections they enjoy under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which make it virtually impossible to sue an online provider for defamation because of third-party posts on its pages. Section 230 was originally formulated to allow the nascent online media industry to take root in the economy by providing protections not afforded to conventional media outlets and the press.</p><p>The legislation effectively treats the likes of Facebook (US:FB), YouTube, and Twitter (US:TWTR) as if they were public forums, largely devoid of editorial accountability. The Executive Order was triggered by a recent decision by Twitter to flag as \"potentially misleading\" two of the President's tweets, his favoured mode of communication. The argument runs that the online media companies should not enjoy the protections set out in the legislation if they selectively editorialise content. Conversely, others in Washington pour scorn on the online providers because they have failed to adequately monitor their platforms (a case of damned if you do, damned if you don't).</p><p>Priced for world domination Judging by valuations, it seems as though institutional investors are sanguine in the face of regulatory risk. On the day that Facebook was hit with a multi-billion dollar fine over the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, its share priced crept up slightly. The ongoing lockdown measures have also been favourable for Facebook and other social media sites, but they have been doubly so for Amazon, which will capture a significant proportion of the growth in e-commerce with conventional retail activity curtailed.</p><p>It helps to explain why the group's share price is up by a third this year, even though aggregate demand in many advanced economies has slumped alarmingly. A diversification in favour of non-retail revenue streams has reinforced margins, with the web services arm now generating the lion's share of profits. Amazon's shares are priced for world domination on a forward price/earnings multiple just shy of three figures. Even aside from Ms Vestager's attentions, there must be several favourable assumptions built into the current valuation, something of a worry as the regulatory regimes tighten, possibly with a view to putting the brakes on further vertical integration.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-160855073</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605G-YJ01-JCBW-N2M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1022\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Sounds exactly like the conversations they\u2019re having in the U.S.! Except in modest statements to the press and not tweetstorms , human trafficking bills , tarmac press conferences , and executive orders.                         Breton told the Financial Times that the EU would like to adopt regulation that sounds like a more legitimate, straightforward path to accomplish what Trump is attempting with the ByteDance/TikTok \u201cdeal\u201d (or shakedown, depending on your take). Only in dire cases, Breton says, the EU might resort to forcing tech monopolies to break up or sell their European assets altogether. It seems to be framed less about blah blah \u201cnational security\u201d \u2014 a legitimate concern, but not the one meaningfully addressed by the proposed TikTok deal \u2014 and more consistent with the EU\u2019s existing incremental antitrust regulation.       It\u2019s unclear how that\u2019ll be implemented, but Breton said that proposed legislation will be ready by the end of the year. Gizmodo has reached out to Breton for more details and will update the post if we hear back.       Breton also says European regulators are thinking about the longterm preservation of free speech. (Wild!) He wants to deal with illegal content and disinformation without dismantling the liability shield for online intermediaries ensured by the 2000 E-Commerce Directive. Shielding platforms from liability is incredibly important, and EU regulators understand this; \u201cThe safe harbour of the liability exemption will stay,\u201d Breton told the Financial Times. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s accepted by everyone.\u201d As a European Parliament report noted earlier this year, they might reform it by further clarifying mechanisms to remove already-forbidden illegal content.   U.S. lawmakers\u2019 war over moderation, on the other hand, involves firebombing liability exemptions. Legislators on both sides of the aisle want to dismantle Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which prevents online platforms from being treated as publishers and therefore free from liability over user-submitted content hosted on their platforms. (Among other reasons, Republicans would like to modify it in order to grant them more power to troll, and Democrats would like to hold Republicans accountable for lying.)   The Financial Times also mentions \u201ctougher sanctions\u201d on companies that make it impossible to migrate data to other platforms (Facebook). Breton also floated the idea of a \u201crating system\u201d that would show companies\u2019 track record on moderating disinformation and paying taxes, for which EU and member countries have pursued Amazon , Google , and Apple .   What do they think when they look at us? Sometimes I wonder.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43130847609</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-D6F1-F07F-808K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Gizmodo Australia</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Safe Harbour Holdings PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>SHH</className><className>LON</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: JE00BF03FZ36</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

On Wednesday, the European commission announced its plans to introduce an EU-wide <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/facebook-google-and-amazon-to-pay-fair-tax-under-eu-plans\">tax on large technology companies' revenues</url>, as a response to their well-known practice of minimising their tax liabilities by shifting profits overseas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The idea of a tax on turnover isn't new, with the British, French, German, Spanish and Italian governments all having at various points considered one. But the EU is the first major political actor to put forward a concrete proposal. The commission has called for a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/facebook-google-and-amazon-to-pay-fair-tax-under-eu-plans\">3% levy</url> on internet-based firms with annual global revenues of at least \u00a3658m and EU revenues of \u00a344m - thereby capturing giants including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. It expects this to raise \u00a34.3bn initially, a small amount but a good start nonetheless.</p><p>A tax on turnover clearly isn't the perfect solution. Most economists would agree that profit is a fairer basis for taxation than revenue, given that profit is essentially a form of \"rent\" that would not exist in a perfectly competitive market. In practical terms, too, it is less than optimal - one need only think of the startups that would be hit before managing to break even, or the promising companies in the process of scaling up that generate large revenues but also large losses.</p><p>The UK's ability to influence the tech titans is far greater as part of the world's second largest economy</p><p>The EU's proposal goes some way towards addressing these issues, however, by taxing only firms large enough to have acquired a dominant position in their markets. The commission has also described the proposal as an interim measure while a rational solution at the global level is worked out, which may take quite some time. The Liberal Democrats fully support this approach. As an internationalist party we strongly believe in global treaties, but we also recognise the need to act now to prevent the further erosion of the tax base. Acting through the EU would enable the UK to strike a balance by taxing the tech giants in tandem with our European neighbours, rather than resorting to unilateral action or waiting for the whole world to reach an agreement.</p><p>I realise that this is made more difficult by Britain's impending departure. It is yet another reason why my party and I are campaigning for an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/facebook-google-and-amazon-to-pay-fair-tax-under-eu-plans\">exit from Brexit</url>, by giving the public a vote on the final deal, with the option to remain. The EU has so far shown itself to be the only organisation bold enough to stand up to the tech titans, as evidenced by the hefty fines slapped on Google and Apple for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/facebook-google-and-amazon-to-pay-fair-tax-under-eu-plans\">anti-competitive behaviour</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/facebook-google-and-amazon-to-pay-fair-tax-under-eu-plans\">tax avoidance</url> respectively.</p><p>Even if Brexit does happen, the UK should remain as close to the EU as possible by remaining in the single market and customs union and by maintaining regulatory alignment, including in our tax and competition policies. It is a simple matter of fact that the UK's ability to influence the tech titans is far greater as part of the world's second largest economy and a market of 500 million people, than as the fifth largest economy with a market of 65 million people. A common approach to tax is necessary if we want to stop global multinationals playing off jurisdictions against each other.</p><p>Ensuring that large tech companies pay their fair share of tax is just one part of challenging their dominance. The very serious allegations made against <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/facebook-google-and-amazon-to-pay-fair-tax-under-eu-plans\">Cambridge Analytica</url> involving data harvesting and microtargeting highlight the need to strengthen the control people have over how their data is gathered and used. Here again the EU is ahead of the curve with its general data protection regulation (GDPR), now finding its way into UK law, and its mission to create a digital single market.</p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/facebook-google-and-amazon-to-pay-fair-tax-under-eu-plans\">Facebook gave data about 57bn friendships to academic</url></p><p>The phenomena of fake news and extremist content linked to the rise of social media also require a robust response. And competition policy will need to be rethought in a digital era where market dominance often can't be measured by high prices.</p><p>We stand at a fork in the road. One path leads to a post-Brexit Britain in which a regulatory race to the bottom has left consumers with little control over their data and the government helpless in the face of multinationals' aggressive tax planning. The other path leads to a Britain either still in the EU or closely aligned with it, working alongside its continental neighbours to build a truly effective system for regulating and taxing the digital economy. I know which option I prefer.</p><p>\u00b7 Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats and former secretary of state for business</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42587064</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYJ-WBS1-JCJY-G396-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><timeReceived>11:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

There's also been some concern that the trade war between the U.S. and China might end up lingering a little bit longer than anticipated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is the final hour of trading on Wall Street as U.S. markets are down for a second day. Earnings season as I mentioned is picking up. This is what investors are watching.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The E.U. delivers a new challenge to Amazon. You will hear what online merchants have to say about the latest antitrust investigation. And debt rising, time running out. Washington looks for agreement on raising the government debt ceiling. And can't get out of my head. Elon Musk and his mind boggling plan to link your smartphone to your brain. Live from the world's financial capital here in New York City. It is Wednesday, July 17th. I'm Zain Asher in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>All right. Welcome everybody. I'm Zain Asher. Tonight a Prime Day hangover for Amazon. The retail giant is promising to cooperate as Brussels launches and investigation into the company if it is abusing its market dominance.</p><p>The E.U. Competition Commissioner says this about preserving choice and low prices for people like you and me. Let me read what Margrethe Vestager has to say. She said, \"I have decided to take a very close look at Amazon's business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer.\" Amazon marked the end of its annual Prime Day sales by celebrating with a star- studded concert.</p><p>Taylor Swift headlined the show. Amazon doesn't disclose exact figures, but it says that more than 175 million items was sold in just two days.</p><p>Then the E.U. swooped in to ruin the party. An issue is the buy box on Amazon's website. The box is a massive boon to any seller that has it, greatly increasing the chance of making a sale. However, Amazon decides which sellers get the box and which don't and how they decide that is very unclear.</p><p>And remember, Amazon not only hosts a marketplace, but is increasingly a seller as well. An E.U. fine could be massive, potentially up to 10 percent of Amazon's annual turnover. In other words, around $23 billion.</p><p>Behind all of this is Margrethe Vestager, who has been quite the thorn in the side of big U.S. tech firms. This is potentially the most investigation she will launch as E.U. Competition Commission before her term ends in October.</p><p>Paul Rafelson is the cofounder of the Online Merchants Guild. He joins us live now via Skype from Stamford, Connecticut. Paul, thank you so much for being with us. So my question to you is, is it a level playing field when it comes to third-party sellers on platforms like Amazon and Amazon, the retailer itself? Is the game rigged, do you think?</p><p>PAUL RAFELSON, COFOUNDER, ONLINE MERCHANTS GUILD (via Skype): It's most certainly not a level playing field. And the game is -- it's not that it's rigged, I think it's just misunderstood. I think the thing that Amazon does really well is its misdirection and sort of calling itself a marketplace.</p><p>But you know, we always challenge people to sort of take a look at what a traditional marketplace looks like. I just got back from a seller conference in Jerusalem and I got to experience what a real marketplace is where there's autonomy among retailers operating in a marketplace.</p><p>Amazon sellers are suppliers. I mean, that's the mistake that I think the first mistake we noticed from the E.U. is that, you know, we hope through their investigation, they start to figure that out that a lot of what Amazon does in the world that you know isn't really you know, fair in the way they conduct business stems from sort of this notion that they're just a marketplace.</p><p>But you know, when you break down the reality or you know, the substance over the form, they are nothing like a traditional mall. You know, if you go to the Mall of America, for example, in Minnesota, every storefront doesn't say Mall of America in big print and put the retailer's name in tiny print preventing the retailer from having access to the customer from marketing to the customer from selling to the customer.</p><p>So I mean, step one, I think we would like to see obviously, you know, some questions as far as are we calling Amazon the right thing when we say it's a marketplace or is it really just a retailer.</p><p>ASHER: You know, that's really interesting what you said you know, that is the term marketplace even valid for a company like Amazon? Are the sort of third-party sellers that are on his platform merely suppliers?</p><p>[15:05:09] ASHER: My question to you is, given that you believe that the playing field is not level, you're saying it's not necessarily rigged, but it's certainly in your opinion, not level. What can be done about that? What sort of resources do third-party sellers have to fight back, do you think?</p><p>RAFELSON: Sure. Well, I mean, our association is a nonprofit. I volunteer my time. I'm a law professor based in New York. I have a law practice where I represent Amazon sellers and I was asked to lead this project, Online Merchants Guild to sort of build the first sort of seller trade association to sort of get sellers to start working together and push for fair legislation.</p><p>So right now in California, for example, we have AB 1790 being pushed by Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, who is really developing the first of its kind seller fairness legislations to sort of, you know, require more transparency on Amazon, limitations on use of data, things like that.</p><p>So I think, I mean sellers need to band together. I tell my sellers, you know, Wisconsin cheese farmers figured out a long time ago that they needed -- that there are certain issues in the world that you need to work together on.</p><p>And you know, there's five million sellers in the world, and there's just no representation. So when decisions are made about e-commerce, when policies are created, you know who is always missing on the table are sellers, right?</p><p>I mean, they're talking to the marketplaces themselves. They will often rely on that distinction to, you know, pursue certain agendas that, you know, they really shouldn't get away with. So I would challenge regulators to start by actually talking to sellers, and we try to provide that voice.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Paul Rafelson, thank you so much. Appreciate that. Thank you for sharing your perspective with us. Amazon isn't the only American tech giant that's been under scrutiny in Europe. Google has faced a series of antitrust fines totaling $9.3 billion. Apple was forced to pay $14.6 billion in back taxes to Ireland, and Facebook was fined $122 million for misleading regulators about WhatsApp.</p><p>We want you to join the conversation want to hear from you at home. Get out your phones or go to cnn.com/join. Tonight, we're asking you a simple question. The question is, is Europe too tough on Big Tech companies? Is Europe too tough on Big Tech companies? Vote now by heading to cnn.com/join. We will see the results very shortly on your screen.</p><p>In the way President Trump sees that the E.U. is stepping on America's toes. In an interview with Fox Business a few weeks ago, he said the Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has a grudge against the United States. I want you to listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: She hates the United States, perhaps worse than any person I've ever met. What she does to our country, she is suing all our companies. You know, look, we should be suing Google and Facebook and all that which perhaps we will. Okay. You see -- Apple, they're suing Apple for billions of dollars. They're suing everybody. They make it very, -- almost impossible to do two-way business.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Hadas Gold is following the story from London. She joins us live now. So, Hadas, you had President there basically intimating that Margrethe Vestager has a grudge against the United States. Obviously, she's on her way out of that role. Do you think that the next Competition Commissioner will be as aggressive when it comes to fighting against Big Tech, as Ms. Vestager has?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Well, Zain, we now have the new President of the European Commission, who said in her introductory platform that the regulation of Big Tech is something that's on the agenda.</p><p>So, I would expect that the next Competitions Chair would be somebody who will continue this pathway that we're seeing and there does seem to be this movement in all of Europe, and now also we're seeing in Washington to get their hands around regulating Big Tech, not only from what we're seeing right now with the antitrust investigation into Amazon, but also to things like your personal data, how it's used, how it passes between countries and across the Atlantic.</p><p>And also in other competition areas is something that they're looking into and they're also concerned about just the certain companies having so much power in so many different aspects of people's lives.</p><p>ASHER: Just walk us through what exactly the E.U. Competition Commissioner is investigating when it comes to Amazon. I'm not sure if you heard our last guest, but he was saying that essentially, between Amazon the retailer, and these third-party sellers, the level field, there's not a sort of a level playing field.</p><p>And in fact, he doesn't believe necessarily that the game is rigged, but it is certainly not a level playing field. He says that a lot of these third party sellers amount to basically suppliers. Just walk us through what specifically Ms. Vestager is investigating here.</p><p>GOLD: So what they're looking into is Amazon's role as both a retailer, somebody who sells their own products and also as a marketplace that hosts other products on their platform and whether Amazon is inappropriately using data that they're gathering from these third-party sellers to somehow give them an unfair competitive advantage.</p><p>[15:10:07] GOLD: You'll hear from some seller, they'll complain that they'll have a successful product. But then Amazon will sort of start creating or start marketing their own version of that product that will then, they allege will get ranked better, and then we'll get sold better than their own products that it's an unfair marketplace.</p><p>And the question, the reason why Amazon is being investigated is because of their perceived dominance in the market. Now, Amazon says that they want to foster a creative business environment. And they've actually said in those hearings in Washington, that they don't use the seller data to somehow inform their decisions.</p><p>But that's something that a lot of sellers find hard to believe. They'll say, \"Listen, I had a successful computer stand. And then in a few years, I saw Amazon was selling a similar computer stand, and I'm not getting the same sales anymore.\" The E.U. is also looking into this buy box button that might appear on some Amazon searches, which allows you to immediately put a product into your cart instead of having to go through the product page. That's seen as something that can give a product a great advantage.</p><p>They're looking at the how and why those certain products are chosen versus others. But it's also important to keep in mind that the fines here that we're starting to see Big Tech start facing are starting to grow.</p><p>Now, the companies are still so big and make so much money that it's not necessarily going to affect them that much. But if Amazon is found in this investigation to be breaking E.U. Competitions Law, they face a fine of up to 10 percent of their global annual revenue. And if you look at Amazon's 2018 revenues, a fine on this 2018 revenues would be about $23 billion.</p><p>ASHER: All right Hadas Gold, live for us. Thank you. And I should also mention that we did get the results from our poll, as you can see in your screen there, 83 percent of you -- 83 percent of you who actually voted on this believe that Europe is actually not too tough on Big Tech companies.</p><p>So by far the vast majority of you as Hadas Gold was mentioning there, Amazon could be looking at a fine of ten percent -- ten percent of its global revenue, depending on what comes out of this investigation.</p><p>After not having much luck winning over senators to the idea of its Libra cryptocurrency on Tuesday, Facebook executives are today in front of the Financial Services Committee in the House of Representatives and even after Tuesday's Q&amp;A, Congressmen are still trying to nail down the basics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>What is a Libra?</p><p>DAVID MARCUS, VICE PRESIDENT OF MESSAGING PRODUCTS, FACEBOOK: Congressman a Libra is a digital currency -- a reserve backed digital currency.</p><p>REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC): Is that a security?</p><p>MARCUS: We don't believe it is, Congressman.</p><p>MCHENRY: Is it a commodity?</p><p>MARCUS: Congressman, based on current U.S. law, I believe it might be a commodity, but we see it as a payment tool.</p><p>MCHENRY: Is it an exchange traded fund?</p><p>MARCUS: It is not, Congressman.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: And it's interesting, these hearings are actually having a bit of an impact on the price of Bitcoin. It's up slightly today after sinking 11 percent on Tuesday. It's still below $10,000.00 mark. Clare Sebastian is here to break all of this down for us. So Clare, this is a bit of a difficult environment for Facebook, because there's so much mistrust, so much concern when it comes to privacy, user data, that sort of thing.</p><p>Did they have any more luck today, in terms of convincing lawmakers of the viability of Libra?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: I would say a little bit, more likely. It was still a pretty hostile reception, particularly from the Democrats. We definitely saw more of a divided down party lines today.</p><p>Facebook was compared to everything from Wells Fargo and Equifax to the Lehman Brothers. One congressman even suggested that it posed more of a threat to the U.S. than Osama bin Laden.</p><p>So certainly, a lot of criticism, but the top Republican on the Committee said that Washington really needed to not be the place where he said innovation goes to die. That just because they didn't understand it didn't mean they should prohibit it.</p><p>And as a result, I think we did see a bit more substance. There were a lot of questions as you saw there about what exactly this is. How it should be used. They really seem to want to get to the bottom of this. And obviously the central question is, how should it be regulated?</p><p>But there are a lot of unanswered questions, Zain. As you saw there, David Marcus from Calibra, he isn't able to say definitively yet what exactly Libra is and how it should be regulated. And that is the question that's preoccupying not any lawmakers and regulators in the U.S., but outside as well.</p><p>The G7 Finance Ministers today were united in their opposition and their concern about this. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNO LE MAIRE, FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER: I think that there is a need for regulation. There is a need for very strong commitments and obligations for that project and for the time being, I think that the necessary requirements are not fulfilled by the project, Libra.</p><p>OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER (through translator): The G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bankers meeting here all have serious concerns. We intend to examine carefully whether all current regulations are being adhered to, and whether regulations will need to be changed in the future to ensure the stability international financial systems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:15:01] SEBASTIAN: So the concern Zain is the same as what we're hearing in Washington. They range from financial stability to data privacy to competition. The sheer size of Facebook is what has made this such a concern for lawmakers and the overarching theme that we hear is that Facebook shouldn't go ahead and launch until these concerns have been addressed. That is something that Facebook has promised not to do.</p><p>ASHER: And what's interesting, and I mentioned this earlier is that this is having -- this is sort of wreaking havoc with Bitcoin as well, because essentially, all of the scrutiny surrounding Libra is forcing other cryptocurrency investors to rethink Bitcoin. I mean, they are up a little bit today, but they were down 11 percent just recently.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, it's been interesting to watch because when Libra, when the white paper came out and it was first announced back in June, you can see from the chart there, Bitcoin went up.</p><p>I mean, a lot of people thought, you know, this would be the rising tide that would lift all boats. That Libra would be the thing that would bring cryptocurrency into the mainstream. It would lead to comprehensive regulation. That is something that a lot of people in the crypto space would welcome. But I think since then, we've seen such a tide of negative publicity.</p><p>We've seen the President tweeting about it. We've seen the Federal Reserve Chairman here in the U.S. expressing serious concerns. The Treasury Secretary has called it a national security issue. I think there is a concern now that all of this could lead to excess regulation and that it's just you know, bad publicity for the space in general.</p><p>ASHER: Clare Sebastian, live for us. Thank you so much. All right, time for a quick break here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Iran's Foreign Minister has been speaking to CNN with concern mounting that high tensions could spill over into war. Javad Zarif addresses the danger directly and debt ceiling drama in Washington. Lawmakers race against time to seal a deal while the U.S. government runs out of money. That's next.</p><p>ASHER: \"We will never start a war.\" That declaration coming from Iran's Foreign Minister to CNN a short time ago. Javad Zarif was asked of tensions in the Persian Gulf could lead to a war with the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: You cannot simply disregard a possibility of a disaster. But we all need to work in order to avoid one. There is a war going on right now. It's an economic war. An economic war against Iran targets civilian population and President Trump is on the record saying that he is not engaging in a military war, but an economic war.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:20:04] ASHER: All eyes on oil. The price of crude is slipping again today. Prices plunged on Tuesday, yesterday after President Trump said progress had been made with Iran. Later, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has claimed that Tehran was willing to negotiate over missiles.</p><p>Let's bring in John Defterios standing by in London for us. So John, you heard Mohammad Javad Zarif there talking about the fact that he believes that the United States is waging an economic war against Iran.</p><p>When you look at just how dramatically oil exports from Iran have fallen, they've gone from three million barrels to 350,000 barrels. I mean, just walk us through what the economic impact has been on Iran so far.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, I think it's fair to call it an economic war, Zain. After all, the U.S. has shut off the faucet of U.S. dollars into that economy. It's pushed the rial down as much as 80 percent. Inflation running about half that or 40 percent, and as you suggested here, they really squeezed Iran when it came to oil exports.</p><p>You are correct to say that their exports are hovering around 350,000 barrels a day. What does that mean for Iran? It's about $50 billion of export earnings. But it seems to me that the Trump administration, both in the case of Iran and in China, with the trade talks have jumped the gun here saying that both these parties are willing to sit down and negotiate.</p><p>There is no incentive on the table for Iran to do so just now. Think about it. This is the worst time for Iran to actually go into the table with the Trump administration ahead of an election cycle. The Iranians like long negotiations, as we found out during the nuclear agreement. I could not see a win-win coming out of it.</p><p>And in fact, the senior Gulf source was suggesting to me that they're putting too much pressure, they, the United States is putting too much pressure on Iran. And we're going to see this lashing out taking place, and you could stumble into conflict and not just an economic war.</p><p>So if you play it out a little bit here, this could go back and forth with the United States throughout 2020 until the election, until there's enough incentive for the Iranians to come back to the bargaining table. There's another word at play here. It's resilience.</p><p>The Iranians now just need 30 percent of the oil representing their budget right now. So they've learned to survive on very little. You can hear the tone from Javad Zarif right there. It's not quite the time to negotiate unless they have some carrots to put onto the table.</p><p>ASHER: And John, just in terms of where oil prices have gone? The fall in price yesterday was directly linked to the Trump administration saying that Iran was willing to negotiate. Obviously, Iran sort of counteracted that. Just walk us through why there was such a difference in opinion in terms of where things were going negotiation-wise?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: I think a simple way to think about it, Zain, we know what the risk of Iran and U.S. conflict has priced in terms of the market, because every time we get a hint that there's going to be a truce or negotiations taking place, we see a swing of four to five percent going downwards.</p><p>And when the tension rises, we see a gain of four to five percent. In the last three trading days, we've seen a correction of five percent. This is a pretty fair price for crude knowing that in the second half of the year the demand is going to drop. And that's why we see additional downward pressure.</p><p>The Energy Information Administration in United States was suggesting there was a drawdown on inventories, but not very strong. Then you add on top of it, the U.S.-China trade tensions and it could get much worse.</p><p>The other thing I would add from Iran here very quickly, Minister Zangeneh the Petroleum Minister was saying that their exports will continue uninterrupted. We don't know what level. They didn't say where it's going. But you would think that Russia and China is supporting them, but they're not giving any clues to the United States because they know that they're going to try to chase those exports into the Strait of Hormuz, and some of those export markets that are still supporting them behind the scenes.</p><p>ASHER: All right, John Defterios live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Thanks, Zain.</p><p>ASHER: I want to check in with the U.S. market, the Dow is off. Let's see 76 points or so, staying in red after basically a flat open. We saw a sliver of green in the morning, but it's been pretty much in the red all day. All three indices are now down for a second day in a row.</p><p>Wall Street is the middle of a very busy earnings week. Bank of America is latest to beat expectations. There we have it. Shares are actually up about one and a half percent after the bank reported a record $7.3 billion in profit last quarter, thanks to strong spending by U.S. households.</p><p>Let's bring in Matt Egan. He is following it all. So, Matt, just walk us through this. Record profits. They beat in terms of expectations and the consumer banking side was really to thank for this.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: That's right, Zain. So I mean, if there's a recession or even a severe economic slowdown in the United States, it is definitely not showing up in Bank of America's earnings or really any of the big banks.</p><p>As you mentioned $7.3 billion is all-time high for Bank of America in terms of profits. The whole first half of the year was actually a record and a lot of it is really being driven by the real economy.</p><p>[15:25:01] EGAN: Bank of America said its banking profits -- its consumer banking profits were up by 13 percent during the quarter. Loans increased by six percent which is very healthy. Deposits were up and the CEO Brian Moynihan was very optimistic. He said that he sees steady increases among consumers. And he thinks all this points to a solid economy, even if it's growing a bit slower than it had been.</p><p>ASHER: So loans were up. However, the dark cloud on the horizon is, of course, what's going to happen with interest rates with the Fed because loans are not going to be as profitable with interest rate cuts.</p><p>EGAN: That's exactly right. So Bank of America echoed what we've heard from the other big banks, and it came out and it lowered its outlook for net interest income, which really is the biggest way that banks make money still.</p><p>And so Bank of America said that if the Fed cuts rates twice this year, its net interest income will only grow by one percent. That's a downshift from earlier when they expected three percent growth.</p><p>Now, I'll point out that the Fed Funds Futures market is pricing in a two thirds chance of three cuts of more suggesting that Bank of America and all the other banks could actually have to downgrade their earnings outlook a little bit further, all because of the volatility of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>ASHER: So one fund fact that I learned today that I did not know is that Bank of America represents one in two U.S. households. So they are very powerful. So what does the fact that they've done so well, especially in terms of record profits, what does that tell you? You touched on this earlier about the strength of the U.S. economy right now?</p><p>EGAN: Right. I mean, it makes so much sense to listen to what Bank of America and the other banks have to say, because they -- you know, they talk to CEOs every day. They talk to small business owners every day. And so they have a real sense of what's actually going on in the economy.</p><p>And so I think big picture, they're saying that really, there is no severe slowdown in the economy yet, despite the trade war, despite the slowdown in China, it hasn't really happened yet.</p><p>And so that's why it is kind of interesting that we're talking about this in an environment where the Fed is in fact, moving forward with most likely lowering interest rates to try to help the economy.</p><p>It just -- you know, the trouble just hasn't seemed to show up in the real economy, at least not yet.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Matt Egan, thank you. European stocks ended Wednesday's session mostly lower. Fears resurfacing over unresolved trade tensions. Ericsson shares fell 11 percent after a profit warning, but the Swiss watchmaker Swatch rallied six percent after it issued a strong guidance on earnings.</p><p>All right, merging man and machine. Elon Musk unveils perhaps his boldest plan yet saying a device implanted in your brain could stave off the threat of AI. That's next.</p><p>[15:30:00] ASHER: Hello, everyone, I'm Zain Asher, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment. When Elon Musk wants to get into your mind, why he's trying to put chips in human brains.</p><p>And the fight to end modern day slavery. The grim numbers and the governments that are not stepping up. Before that though, these are the headlines at this hour. Iran's Foreign Minister says U.S. sanctions on his country are a form of economic terrorism.</p><p>In an interview with CNN, Mohammad Javad Zarif warned that escalating tensions with the U.S. have made the Persian Gulf a more dangerous place for all nations. And British Prime Minister Theresa May says politics in and out of the U.K. has descended into rancor and tribal bitterness.</p><p>Speaking one week before she leaves office, Mrs. May said politicians on the left and the right have lost the ability to compromise. She also voiced regret if she wasn't able to get her Brexit deal through parliament. A U.S. federal court sentenced former Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman to life in prison plus 30 years for drug trafficking, running a cartel and firearms defenses, he also must forfeit $12.6 billion.</p><p>Now, \"El Chapo\" told the court his trial was unfair and that he suffered physical, emotional and mental torture in prison. And 6 million people in south Asia are being threatened by floods. Well over 100 people have been killed in India and Nepal since the weekend. More than 2 dozen have died in Pakistan including a 9-year-old girl who was electrocuted in a flooded street, and a 6-year-old who died when a roof collapsed.</p><p>And Puerto Rico's governor is refusing to step down in the face of growing protest over leaked messages. They reveal him using obscene, sexist and homophobic language to mock politicians, journalists and celebrities. Officials have now summoned everyone involved in the chart to appear before U.S. territories Justice Department.</p><p>The U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tells CNN she wants a deal on raising the debt ceiling by the end of the week as time runs out for Congress to agree. There are just five legislative days left before the house goes on a recess. The legal ceiling on federal government borrowing currently stands at over $20.4 trillion.</p><p>If it isn't raised by next week, the government could run out of money before Congress returns in September. Nancy Pelosi and fellow Democrat Chuck Schumer spoke with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin earlier. He told reporters they're making progress, but there's still no agreement yet on the issue of funding healthcare for military veterans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Our concern is that the additional initiatives that had been added for veterans, whether you approve of the policy or not, they had become the law and we need to cover them. But we are understanding each other and when we have an announcement, well, you'll be the first to know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Right, CNN's Phil Mattingly joins us now live from Capitol Hill. So, Phil, how close are we at this point to a resolution?</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Close, but close isn't a deal. And I think to echo a lot of people here say on Capitol Hill, nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to. And at this point in time, not everything is agreed to.</p><p>Now, you heard from the speaker right there, saying, it's getting a little bit in the weeds in the negotiations. You're talking about a debt ceiling, right? The urgency is related to raising the debt ceiling which Treasury projects could be reached by the beginning of September.</p><p>Obviously, as you noted, lawmakers are going to be out of town for the entire month of August. But in order to get a debt ceiling agreement, you also need an agreement on the budget. The reason lawmakers want to get together and agree on a budget change is they're trying to force all $124 billion in automatic spending cuts that would occur in January of next year.</p><p>So, that's the piece that actually brings the two sides together. Republicans on Capitol Hill don't want those automatic cuts on defense spending. Democrats don't want them on domestic spending and the debt ceiling kind of slides in there as well.</p><p>So, that's the negotiation dynamic at this point in time. The real question is, can they get what they call parody? Where the defense spending increases are equal to the domestic spending increases. Both parties are happy and then you add the debt ceiling on top of it.</p><p>[15:35:00] The problem as you noted is the timeline. The change in Treasury's projections has added the urgency to these negotiations right now. That's what's sparking the continuous phone calls back and forth. Speaker Pelosi has now spoken to the Treasury Secretary by phone who is the point person for the administration on these talks nine times in the last seven days.</p><p>They want to get something done, they want to get it done by the end of the week so they can vote on it by next week, but they're not quite there yet, Zain.</p><p>ASHER: And are we likely to see a shorter term deal passed instead?</p><p>MATTINGLY: So, what's been interesting is the speaker has repeatedly -- I've asked her repeatedly if she's open to that, said, no. She's not open to that, she wants the long-term two-year agreement, the sweeping agreement, budget and debt ceiling. But here's the reality, that's the negotiating position and she's not going to pull off of that so long as that is kind of the cajole to some degree to get the administration to agree to domestic spending increases.</p><p>When it comes down to an actual negotiation, if they get to the end of this week and there's no agreement, I'm told from people that are actually involved in these negotiations, a short-term agreement is likely, a short- term solution here, pushing the debt ceiling off a couple of months, pushing the budget off a couple of months is certainly in play.</p><p>They're not there yet, but if they have to find an off-ramp, that is certainly an option. One thing all lawmakers of all parties agree to right now, they don't want to mess around with the debt ceiling, and given the fact they're going to be gone for the entire month of August, that pretty much means they're going to have to do something before the house leaves next week, Zain.</p><p>ASHER: And Phil, in other Washington drama, one Democratic Congressman Al Green has actually introduced articles of impeachment --</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: Against the president. Walk us through that because the house now has to look at this closely.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes, never a dull moment around here. So, look, Speaker Pelosi has made it very clear the Democrats who control the United States house aren't ready to pursue an impeachment inquiry yet. Al Green; the Congressman from Texas, a Democrat has multiple times over the course of the last several months try to bring up his own impeachment articles and force a vote on them.</p><p>When he does that, the house is required within two legislative days to consider those impeachment articles. That's what will be happening here in a couple of hours. Now, Democratic leadership has made clear, they are opposed to this pathway, and they are going to try to essentially sink one of the members of their own caucuses efforts to impeach the president because as the speaker has laid out, that is not the path that they want to go down just yet.</p><p>Now, what I'm being told right now is they have the votes to table or basically kill what Al Green is trying to do here, but what it will do is, it will force all Democrats on the record, on this issue that is so divisive within their caucus, is divisive within their party, and that will be an interesting tally to watch.</p><p>Again, the president is not going to be impeached tonight, the impeachment resolution isn't going to pass or get anywhere close to passing tonight, but you will have Democrats have to go on the record on this issue, there's a lot of Democrats saying, we just don't want to take that vote right now.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Phil Mattingly live for us there, thank you so much, appreciate it. So, my next guest says the haggling over the debt ceiling is a reminder that U.S. borrowing is on an unsustainable path. The U.S. deficit has hit $1 trillion for the first time since the financial crisis. Maya MacGuineas is the president of the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, she joins us live now.</p><p>So, Maya, $1 trillion. What are the long-term consequences for our great grandchildren of that?</p><p>MAYA MACGUINEAS, PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL BUDGET: Here, it doesn't -- we don't need to look as far as our great grandchildren to worry about what's going on because our deficits and our debt are now so large and on such an unsustainable path, this is going to have direct effects on us, let alone our children and grandchildren.</p><p>We are now in a cycle of borrowing where there is almost no discussion of when it comes to new priorities how we should pay them, what kind of budget we should put in place. Instead, we have a debt that is the highest it's ever been in this country since we fought World War II, relative to the economy, the debt relative to the economy.</p><p>And worse, it is projected to continue to grow by another $12 trillion over the next decade. Borrowing a trillion dollars a year when the economy is so strong as it is now is absolutely the opposite of what we should be doing. So, yes, this debt ceiling, which absolutely must be increased and in fact, we've known about this deadline for months, it should have been increased months ago, but it should go hand-in-hand with a thoughtful responsible plan to gradually bring our debt down.</p><p>Instead, what we're hearing from our political leaders is that they are entertaining ideas that would increase the debt ceiling along with a plan to increase our national debt even further.</p><p>ASHER: So, here's my question. How does the -- when, I should ask, will the average American actually feel the impact of this? Because when you look at the headlines, the business headlines, it will say that, listen, unemployment is at record lows in this country.</p><p>You've got GDP obviously doing well in the United States, even though there has been in the past, some talk of recession, a lot of people are saying the U.S. economy by all measures is doing relatively well right now. So, in terms of the average American actually feeling the impact of $1 trillion in U.S. deficit. When will that be?</p><p>[15:40:00] MACGUINEAS: Yes, it is the greatest question, and it's kind of the biggest struggle that there is, trying to get people to understand the importance of paying our bills, not borrowing in an unsustainable way and making the hard choices that would fix the debt. I think the national debt in many ways is kind of like germs in the air where you can breathe them in, you can either become sick quickly or more gradually.</p><p>But you don't see them, you don't know that they're happening. And that's really the same situation with this ongoing borrowing. It weakens our economy, but you don't know that it's coming from the debt. It weakens our budget, in that right now, interest payments are the single fastest growing part of the budget.</p><p>We will spend more on interest next year than we do on children. We will spend more on interests in five or six years than we do on national defense. Those things erode our budget, but people don't really notice them, certainly, it doesn't become a kitchen table issue.</p><p>ASHER: So then why -- I'm sorry, go ahead, you can finish your thought, I'll ask the question --</p><p>MACGUINEAS: Well, it means that we're weaker when we hit the next recession, and importantly, I think it means we're a weaker nation. There are so many threats on the horizon from different forms of national security threats to changes in technology and the economy that demand a new social contract.</p><p>And we are not addressing any of them because we are so over-indebted. But to your point, the average consumer just doesn't feel that in a daily way, and therefore there's no real political pressure to make the necessary changes.</p><p>ASHER: Yes, and in this climate, especially as we gear up for 2020, on both sides of the political aisle, this is no longer an issue that either side cares about. I mean, it used to be the Republicans, but now the Republicans obviously pushing what we have now, lower taxes, lower corporate taxes. And then the Democrats of course have moved so far to the left in terms of offering free college tuition or promising Medicare for all, free healthcare, universal healthcare, that sort of thing.</p><p>So, given this climate, where do you see the debt in 20, 30 years from now?</p><p>MACGUINEAS: Yes, you hit the nail on the head right there because this is really a competition between two parties to promise more free lunches. Tax cuts will pay for themselves -- no, of course, they will not. But we didn't pay for them when they passed them. But you can have all these things for free when there's really no such thing as a federal -- when the federal government is giving something.</p><p>There's no such thing as free, it means either we pay for it or we ask the next generation to. But this really reflects a brokenness of our system of government right now where toxic partisanship has become far more important than good-policy making, and as a result, I fear, unless we either have some really strong political leadership that emerges which is certainly what I hope or some kind of external push, either hike in interest rates or other countries not wanting to lend to us as much that forces this upon us.</p><p>I fear we will continue borrowing so much that down the road, as you were talking about, our economy will be so much weaker than it would otherwise have been, our standard of living will be lower, jobs will be fewer, and we will really erode the health of this country and leave us more vulnerable internationally in a way we never should have done.</p><p>But it is just the slow boiling away of kind of an economic health that we had and we're squandering.</p><p>ASHER: Maya MacGuineas, thank you, always good to hear from you, appreciate that --</p><p>MACGUINEAS: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: OK, so naming and shaming. The countries that don't do enough to combat modern day slavery. Up next, I'll speak to the mining magnet about to push to end forced labor. That's next.</p><p>[15:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER: Ten thousand people a day according to a new report, that's how fast victims of slavery need to be freed from their bonds if modern day slavery is to be ended in the next decade. The Walk Free Foundation isn't optimistic it's going to happen. It says that many governments are failing to take action.</p><p>It accuses Qatar, Singapore, Kuwait, Brunei, Hong Kong and Russia of doing little to address the problem, especially considering their relative affluence. Andrew Forrest is the co-founder and chairman of the Walk Free Foundation. He's also chairman of the Fortescue Metals Group, and joins us live now from the UN. Andrew, thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>Can I just ask first of all, why is this a personal issue for you?</p><p>ANDREW FORREST, CHAIRMAN, WALK FREE FOUNDATION: It's deeply personal because I've seen slavery with my own eyes and the trafficking of children up into the gulf states out of Nepal. I've experienced very severe slavery, forced slavery of adult males in the Middle East, making goods for my company and companies all around the world who all have slavery in their supply chains.</p><p>When I discovered this in my personal life and my corporate life, there's slavery all over the world.</p><p>ASHER: So what should other companies -- I mean, that's very honest of you to come forward and admit that there was slavery in your supply chain. What should other companies who are dealing with the same thing do about it?</p><p>FORREST: I think don't be scared of it, just go looking for slavery in your supply chains, and when you find it, it's because you looked for it, not because it wasn't there, it's because you looked for it and you found it and celebrated. Do not be afraid. I've spoken to so many American entrepreneurs -- European entrepreneurs that are scared of finding slavery in their supply chains. Look for it, the shareholders will congratulate you.</p><p>ASHER: So, are you optimistic that we as a society can actually bring modern day slavery to an end whether it's in 30 years, 50 years, a 100 years, given just how much money is made from it? It's one of the most profitable industries in the world.</p><p>FORREST: Yes, it's profitable in an extraordinarily negative sense. It made $300 billion a year, but it causes trillions of dollars of misery. So, the equation is completely wrong. What I know for sure is that you and I will be able to tell within six to nine months which countries will be able to end slavery by the time they all declare to each other globally they'll end modern slavery by 2030.</p><p>It's been six to nine months, if they haven't done a national survey to inform themselves of exactly what slavery they have in their countries, they don't have a hope in -- christen(ph) -- to ever end slavery by 2030.</p><p>ASHER: So, which countries are actually doing -- I mean, I want to start with the positive. Which countries are actually doing the best relative to their net income or relative to their GDP in terms of actually fighting to end modern day slavery?</p><p>FORREST: Well, you know, you actually have some really good African countries, you have some smaller European countries, you certainly have some Asian countries, but the ones which are leading from the front that I'd have to say would be Britain, North America is doing a great job, but I would like to, if I -- with your permission, just change that situation a little.</p><p>The ones we know will end slavery by the drop date they've all promised to 2030 will be those who conduct the modern slavery surveys which walked free, with now the full endorsement of the (INAUDIBLE) have demonstrated it can be done. This is intellectual property which has taken us tens of millions of dollars and many years to develop, they made it available free to the world, and this can inform governments right across the board.</p><p>If they do the surveys, they own the surveys themselves, what they have to do in the next 10 years to end slavery. Now, if they don't do that then, you know they're not serious. They're just playing around, lip service to their citizens, they weren't serious. So, let's watch who does it.</p><p>ASHER: And as the most powerful country in the world, where I am, the United and where you are actually, the United States, there's a huge responsibility, but the immigration laws in this country are actually getting tougher which might make it harder for those who come here illegally, just in terms of their vulnerability to human trafficking.</p><p>[15:50:00] I mean, just walk us through what the U.S.' role and responsibility is in fighting this.</p><p>FORREST: OK, so right back to Abraham Lincoln's days, we have a job to finish. In the United States, I know for sure if you do a survey across your nation, you'll identify exactly what areas need to be -- need to be addressed. You've got 10 years, that will pass in a flash.</p><p>In the several centuries in which the U.S. has tried to defeat slavery, you've got ten years in which you can actually crack it and bid it. Now, with the immigration, to answer your question specifically, I understand that all countries want their laws obeyed, want their borders secured and to have proper healthy immigration policies.</p><p>But what I say to everyone on every border including the United States, train your people, it will take you like 25 minutes if people listen. Train your people on how to detect those fellow Mexicans, Americans, go wherever you're from, you know you all immigrated to North America some time in our history unless you're an Indian.</p><p>Look for those people who are vulnerable. You can recognize it in 25 minutes of training, those who are vulnerable to slavery, bring them out of the line and talk to them. You'll be able to tell in five minutes. Are you enslaved? Are you here by force? Are you incredibly vulnerable?</p><p>The rest, you know, you can -- you can take your own action on, but in 25 minutes training, every immigration enforcement officer will be able to detect someone who is vulnerable to or is a modern day slave.</p><p>ASHER: Andrew Forrest, thank you so much for fighting for such an important cause. I appreciate you being on the program. Thank you.</p><p>FORREST: And CNN have been such legends and I thank you.</p><p>ASHER: Thank you so much, thank you, OK, take care. Still to come, Elon Musk wants to get inside our brains with an implant he claims could make us telepathic and actually reverse serious brain injuries. Musk insists it's not science fiction, it could actually be a reality, that's next.</p><p>ASHER: Roads, space and now our brains. Elon Musk has unveiled perhaps his boldest plan yet, inserting implants into a human brain that he claims could actually enable telepathy and stave off the threat of AI. Ahiza Garcia joins us live now from San Francisco.</p><p>So, is this project philanthropic for Elon Musk in terms of wanting to be of service to humanity or is it commercial? Walk us through that.</p><p>AHIZA GARCIA, CNN SENIOR BUSINESS TECH WRITER: I think it's a little bit of both, right? I think that part of the stated goal right now is to help people with medical needs, right. People who are paralyzed who might benefit from having this type of procedure done to their brain.</p><p>[15:55:00] But I think at the end of the day, there is the hope that this will take on a commercial element, and that people looking for a memory boost could benefit from this procedure as well. Elon Musk as we know is you know, definitely a commercial-minded entrepreneur, so I think that that's not quite a reach to think that there are dual implications here.</p><p>ASHER: Something about this just seems so scary and futuristic. I mean, walk us through -- do we know what the risks are for something like this?</p><p>GARCIA: So yesterday, there was a presentation and one of the doctors working with Elon Musk's company was talking about how this is actually a less invasive procedure. He does this similar procedures on patients and because of the fact that the thread is so thin, it's actually potentially less invasive.</p><p>So there's less risk that, you know, there might be ramifications from the procedure. But obviously, any time you're, you know, dealing with the brain, that's a very unknown territory in many ways. And so there is with any surgical or invasive procedure, definitely a risk associated with that, that people would want to, you know, take into consideration.</p><p>But for someone with a medical need, this might offer the chance to, you know, in some way, alleviate some sort of paralysis or -- you know, those are some of the claims they're making, so maybe the risks would be worth it for someone in dire medical need.</p><p>ASHER: Right, so there's a good side to it, but I have to say, I'm probably not going to be in a rush to sign up. Ahiza Garcia, thank you so much, appreciate it --</p><p>GARCIA: No --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ASHER: Final moments left to trade on Wall Street, we'll have the final numbers and the closing bell right after this break, don't go away.</p><p>ASHER: We're just moments left to trade on Wall Street. We are halfway through a major earnings week, it is a lackluster day across the markets though, the Dow is down 100 points or so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are both down slightly as well.</p><p>As I mentioned, we have been pretty much in the red all day. So, let's look at the Dow components more specifically, Boeing and Caterpillar are at the opposite ends of the index. And beyond the Dow, Netflix is actually set to report earnings after the bell.

The European Union (EU) is planning to force OEMs to let users uninstall any pre-installed apps on their devices, the Financial Times[1] reports. The new law is a part of the upcoming Digital Services Act regulation that the EU is currently working on. </p><p>The regulation, the draft of which is still in early stages, could pass by the end of this year. The Digital Services Act is reportedly the first big overhaul of the EU rules that regulate the internet in the region. The EU is hoping to set global standards on how to fight \"Big Tech.\"EU to force OEMs to make pre-installed apps removableSmartphones come with a plethora of pre-installed apps. These apps are loaded either by the phone maker or your carrier. While we use some of those apps pretty frequently, many of them are used by only a fraction of people who buy those phones. Worst yet, you can't even remove them. They sit there eating up the phone's memory without serving any purpose to you. The European Union wants to change that for good. Details are scarce at the moment, but the EU's Digital Services Act regulation will \"rock\" tech giants, the report adds. Big tech companies such as Facebook and Google often strike deals with OEMs to pre-install their apps. The draft also mentions that companies cannot force other companies to exclusively pre-install their software. The EU had fined Google[2] for allegedly forcing phone makers to bundle its apps on their phones. The Act would also block companies from giving preferential treatment of their own services to the detriment of rivals. Phone makers like Xiaomi and Samsung preload their own suite of apps on their Android phones even when they come with pre-installed Google alternatives.The Digital Services Act may see resistance from Google and othersThe Digital Services Act would also require the likes of Amazon and Google[3] to share their \"huge troves of customer data with smaller rivals\". Such tech biggies will not be able to use data they collect from users for their own commercial activities \"unless they make it accessible to business users active in the same commercial activities,\" the draft of the new regulation reads. Additionally, the so-called \"gatekeeper platforms,\" companies that run the sites or marketplaces that others do business on, would not be able to use \"data received from business users for advertising services for any other purpose other than advertising services\". Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store are some of the major \"gatekeeper platforms.\" As expected, the Act is already seeing pushback from the likes of Google. The internet giant suggested that regulators shouldn't be looking to consider \"new and distinct regulatory frameworks\" just yet. Instead, the company calls for modernizing the existing rules. Google also doesn't want the regulators to rush to define platforms as gatekeepers. \"In certain sectors, the platform may have market power; in others, it may be a new entrant or marginal player. The digital ecosystem is extremely diverse and evolving rapidly and it would be misguided for gatekeeper designations to be evaluated by reference to the position of an entire company or corporate group,\" it said.

The European Union (EU) is planning to force OEMs to let users uninstall any pre-installed apps on their devices, the Financial Times reports.   The new law is a part of the upcoming Digital Services Act regulation that the EU is currently working on. The regulation, the draft of which is still in early stages, could pass by the end of this year. The Digital Services Act is reportedly the first big overhaul of the EU rules that regulate the internet in the region. The EU is hoping to set global standards on how to fight \"Big Tech.\"  EU to force OEMs to make pre-installed apps removable  Smartphones come with a plethora of pre-installed apps. These apps are loaded either by the phone maker or your carrier. While we use some of those apps pretty frequently, many of them are used by only a fraction of people who buy those phones. Worst yet, you can't even remove them. They sit there eating up the phone's memory without serving any purpose to you.  The European Union wants to change that for good. Details are scarce at the moment, but the EU's Digital Services Act regulation will \"rock\" tech giants, the report adds. Big tech companies such as Facebook and Google often strike deals with OEMs to pre-install their apps.   The draft also mentions that companies cannot force other companies to exclusively pre-install their software. The EU had fined Google for allegedly forcing phone makers to bundle its apps on their phones.   The Act would also block companies from giving preferential treatment of their own services to the detriment of rivals. Phone makers like Xiaomi and Samsung preload their own suite of apps on their Android phones even when they come with pre-installed Google alternatives. The Digital Services Act may see resistance from Google and others  The Digital Services Act would also require the likes of Amazon and Google to share their \"huge troves of customer data with smaller rivals\". Such tech biggies will not be able to use data they collect from users for their own commercial activities \"unless they make it accessible to business users active in the same commercial activities,\" the draft of the new regulation reads.   Additionally, the so-called \"gatekeeper platforms,\" companies that run the sites or marketplaces that others do business on, would not be able to use \"data received from business users for advertising services for any other purpose other than advertising services\". Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store are some of the major \"gatekeeper platforms.\"   As expected, the Act is already seeing pushback from the likes of Google. The internet giant suggested that regulators shouldn't be looking to consider \"new and distinct regulatory frameworks\" just yet. Instead, the company calls for modernizing the existing rules.  Google also doesn't want the regulators to rush to define platforms as gatekeepers. \"In certain sectors, the platform may have market power; in others, it may be a new entrant or marginal player. The digital ecosystem is extremely diverse and evolving rapidly and it would be misguided for gatekeeper designations to be evaluated by reference to the position of an entire company or corporate group,\" it said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43208885415</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-6581-F07F-81X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>AndroidHeadlines</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>XIAOMI INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

But then again, so is Facebook's decision to exempt political ads from its normal fact-checking processes. What's required is a middle-ground and a commitment to transparency that showcases what ads are allowed and those that are rejected for being 'political.' The fact that neither of them seem to be interested in taking up the job of sifting truth from propaganda despite their central role in today's political discourse speaks volumes about their seriousness in tackling the problem.

Tech companies have been a big target by the EU in the past decade, with Google and Facebook both getting record fines in recent months. Now it looks like Amazon is going to be next in line to get a record fine. </p><p>This investigation is going to put Amazon's data collection under the microscope. For years, it has been said that Amazon is using that data from its merchants in an effort to get a competitive advantage against the very merchant that is selling products on Amazon's platform. It's easy to see why Amazon would want to do this. It wants its merchants to sell on their platform versus on their own website, then Amazon gets a cut of that revenue. Amazon has a \"dual role\" in the retail space right now, as a retailer and as a marketplace. So the investigation is going to be looking into that, and seeing if that is killing competition. The EU did put out a statement and stated that \"based on the Commission's preliminary fact-finding, Amazon appears to use competitively sensitive information - about marketplace sellers, their products and transactions on the marketplace.\" It's the European Commission[2] that is investigating Amazon this time. That's the executive arm of the European Union or the EU. It actually began questioning merchants about how Amazon collects its data, last year. If the Commission does find that Amazon breached its rules, it could face a fine of up to 10-percent of the company's global annual revenues. And given how much Amazon makes in a year, that could be a pretty hefty fine. As Amazon continues to grow, it is facing more and more scrutiny around the world. The European Union is still one of the very few antitrust regulators in the world that is actually investigating big tech companies like Amazon, to see if they are following the rules. This is something that President Trump has been critical of, as he thinks that the FTC and DOJ should be investigating these companies too. 2020 Presidential Candidates have also been very critical of big tech and have been lobbying to break them up. Specifically speaking of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. These companies have gotten so large, that they are their own competitors in a lot of spaces. Amazon is a good example. Not only are they a retailer, but they are also a marketplace platform where people can sell products. Which, in a way, is a competitor to Amazon's main business. Then there's also the fact that there's AWS, Amazon's[3] cloud business, as well as their Music and video business too. The European Union investigation was announced before the market opened this morning, and Amazon has been trading pretty flat, to trading the same as the overall market today. So it looks like these investigations are priced in. Not surprising, seeing as the US is investigating Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google right now.

The comments, made by Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's (EU) chief competition officer, come amid an alleged 'shopping spree' carried out by American behemoths. Although this appears to be meant to protect the European tech ecosystem, what will the actual effect be on startups and investors in the continent? [Read:Pizza, beer, and ping-pong \u2014 why your image of early-stage startups is wrong][1] Europe has indeed seen its fair share of acquisitions by tech giants in recent years. </p><p>In 2011, for example, US tech giant Microsoft paid $8.5 billion for Skype[2]. While such deals make headlines for obvious reasons, it's reasonable for regulators to consider keeping a closer eye on transactions that aren't typically subjected to the same level of scrutiny. 'What we will try to do is to find ways to make sure that we see these acquisitions because sometimes these businesses are quite small, and maybe the sums, the turnover will not meet our thresholds,' Vestager told[3] CNBC. So, what's currently happening to those smaller deals that often go under the radar. EU should focus onwhy Jonathan Simnett, director at specialist technology M...dvisory firm Hampleton Partners[4] told GQ that most disclosed transactions in the European technology markets over the past 30 months involved European companies buying other European players. 'To put this into context, only 25% of the global transactions in the past 30 months have involved the acquisition of European companies versus 68% being North American. So, the term 'shopping spree' could be considered alarmist even if the transaction for the smallest firms may not be disclosed,' he added. Increased regulatory scrutiny may be useful to ensure the market stays competitive for consumers, but Simnett believes the focus needs to be adjusted to ensure the ecosystem offers the same opportunities for companies without them having to relocate elsewhere. 'What should concern the EU more is that one of the major reasons European companies are bought \u2014 whatever the nationality of their buyer \u2014 is that they are unable to achieve scale at the rate of those in North America, and increasingly, in Asia, and particularly China,' he continued.Asignal of a healthy ecosystem Simon Menashy, a partner at venture capital firm MMC Ventures[5], said the EU's proposals were 'well-meaning' but noted that acquisitions \u2014 regardless of size \u2014 were part of the ecosystem's lifeblood. 'Threatening that cycle, whether actually blocking acquisitions or just introducing delay and friction, may undermine investors' confidence that they will one day be able to sell their stake for a profit \u2014 key to taking that early-stage risk in the first place,' he told me. 'We have been here before,' he added. 'Venture funding in France took a dive in 2014 after the government blocked Yahoo's acquisition of Dailymotion because it 'had to remain French.' This time around the ecosystem is much larger and the stakes are higher. And with a tit-for-tat attitude in the US administration, let's not provoke retaliation against our own emerging tech successes as they set out to conquer America.' Andy Moseby, a corporate partner at Kemp Little[6], a law firm specializing in technology and digital media, agreed. He did, however, acknowledge that there needs to be a balance between protecting consumers from monopolistic practices and discouraging US tech investment in the EU. 'Without a buoyant M...arket, there is little incentive for European entrepreneurs to create world-class businesses in their home states when they could just move to the US West Coast,' he added.Finding the balanceEd Macnair, the CEO of cybersecurity company Censornet[7], said the rate of acquisition in Europe was evidence of a thriving ecosystem of innovation and technology. 'The reality is that we want UK and European companies to succeed internationally and most founders and CEOs have global ambitions. One of the paths to global growth is through acquisition and it builds confidence to see that European companies are attracting international buyers, which helps to bring European tech into new markets,' he added. There's no denying that the EU has a hard task at hand: Regulating the industry while also giving tech companies in the continent the best chance to succeed. Unveiled today, the EU's first draft digital strategy[8] is likely to have major consequences for tech behemoths such as Facebook, Apple, and Google \u2014 it's also a signal that Vestager and her team aim to cement the EU's global role in regulation. The EU's challenge will be to do what others have struggled to do before: find the balance between regulation and innovation. If they manage to do this, while preserving a fair and competitive market, it's likely that startups and scaleups will benefit.The ball is in Vestager's court. Like what you've read?

It also requires sites to 'provide rightsholders with adequate information on the functioning and the deployment of measures.' </p><p>Then there is the jargon-laden instruction for Member States to 'facilitate cooperating between the information society service providers and rightsholders through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices.' Those appropriate and proportionate measures mean 'content recognition technologies' along the lines of Content ID, the copyright filter that Google uses to stop YouTube users from uploading copyrighted videos. As open internet campaigner and writer Cory Doctorowhas explained[3], everyone hates the filter: 'Big rightsholders say that it still lets crucial materials slip through the cracks. Indie rightsholders say that it lets big corporations falsely claim copyright over their works and take them down. Google hates Content ID because they spent $60,000,000 developing a system that makes everyone miserable, and YouTubers and their viewers hate it because it overblocks so much legit content.' The E.U. seems to have looked at this way of doing things and decided it should be extended - by law - not just to all online videos but to everything on the internet. The E.U. seems to have looked at this way of doing things and decided it should be extended - by law - not just to all online videos but to everything on the internet.Stifling the Free Flow of Ideas and InformationIt is hard to overstate the extent of the threat this piece of legislation is to online culture as we know it. Inan open letter[4]to European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, a group of internet pioneers that includes Tim Berners-Lee, Vinton Cerf,and Jimmy Wales spell out the danger: 'Article 13 takes an unprecedented step towards the transformation of the Internet from an open platform for sharing and innovation, into a tool for the automated surveillance of its users.' Article 13 essentially amounts to an outsourcing of copyright enforcement to internet companies and imposes a requirement to check everything posted online for copyright infringement. That will have grave consequences for both free expression and competition. That the legislation is bad news for free expression is inevitable for two reasons. The first is the inadequacy of the technology. As Doctorow explains, YouTube's filter just isn't very good at distinguishing copyrighted from non-copyrighted material. The same would be true of whatever firms are forced to implement by Brussels. Plenty of material that in no way falls foul of copyright law will be caught by the filters. Given that the internet platforms now responsible for policing copyright have little reason to be anything other than risk-averse when it comes to preventing infringement, overkill seems unavoidable under Article 13. But the bigger problem is that identifying material shouldn't be enough to automatically block its use. It's not hard to think of harmless pictures that could be caught by a filter because of a logo on a t-shirt or a poster on the wall. There is also the question of what is known as fair dealing in U.K. copyright law and fair use elsewhere. These are the exceptions that allow people to use copyrighted material if they are doing so for research, criticism, review, parody, or a number of other uses. A filter that automatically blocks copyrighted material would make no allowance for these important cases. Memes, which very often involve the sharing, tweaking,and re-sharing of copyrighted material, wouldn't make it past the proposed filters. Nor would countless other ways we use the internet. This is, among many other things, bad news for good fun. Memes, which very often involve the sharing, tweaking,and re-sharing of copyrighted material, wouldn't make it past the proposed filters. Nor would countless other ways we use the internet.Article 13 Consolidates Big Tech's PowerArticle 13 wouldn't just hurt users directly by limiting what they can post online, but would indirectly affect them by further tilting things in favor of the internet giants. The E.U. likes to talk tough - and impose big fines - on big tech. So why does it keep passing laws that impose regulatory burdens large firms can shoulder more easily than their smaller competitors? Healthy political systems sometimes pass bad laws. But unhealthy political systems pass many more of them. The benefits of this copyright clampdown are nothing compared to the benefits of an open, vibrant online culture. But whereas the former are concentrated among a handful of industries, the latter are spread thinly across society. Such fights will always be imbalanced ones, but they are made worse when, as in Brussels, decision-making is dysfunctional, remote, and democratically deficient. That makes it easier for vested interested to exploit the legislative process. Healthy political systems sometimes pass bad laws. But unhealthy political systems pass many more of them. It is probably too late tostop Article 13[5]. After very little public debate, it is set to be waved through a plenary session of the European Parliament. And so, with lamentably little fuss, the E.U. will have taken a big step towards ruining what makes the internet so great.

View original post here[2]. Authored by Oliver Wiseman via CapX.co,[3] What is it about the European Union and bad tech laws with boring names? Brussels managed to transform four harmless letters into a byword for irritating compliance-induced spam and pop ups as well asa consolidation of power for the internet's biggest players[4]. Now that the GDPR dust has settled, along comes Article 13 of the Directive for Copyright in the Digital Single Market, which was approved by the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs yesterday.  Article 13 requires websites to take 'appropriate and proportionate' measures to make sure copyrighted material doesn't appear on their pages. </p><p>It would also require sites to 'provide rightsholders with adequate information on the functioning and the deployment of measures'. Then there is the jargon-laden instruction for Member States to 'facilitate cooperating between the information society service providers and rightsholders through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices'. Those appropriate and proportionate measures mean 'content recognition technologies' along the lines of Content ID, the copyright filter that Google uses to stop YouTube users from uploading copyrighted videos. As open internet campaigner and writer Cory Doctorowhas explained[5], everyone hates the filter: 'Big rightsholders say that it still lets crucial materials slip through the cracks.  Indie rightsholders say that it lets big corporations falsely claim copyright over their works and take them down.  Google hates Content ID because they spent $60,000,000 developing a system that makes everyone miserable,  and YouTubers and their viewers hate it because it overblocks so much legit content.'  The EU seems to have looked at this way of doing things and decided it should be extended - by law - not just to all online videos, but to everything on the internet. It is hard to overstate the extent of the threat this piece of legislation is to online culture as we know it. Inan open letter[6]to European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, a group of internet pioneers that includes Tim Berners-Lee, Vinton Cerf and Jimmy Wales spell out the danger: 'Article 13 takes an unprecedented step towards the transformation of the Internet from an open platform for sharing and innovation, into a tool for the automated surveillance of its users.'  Article 13 essentially amounts to an outsourcing of copyright enforcement to internet companies and imposes a requirement to check everything posted online for copyright infringement. That will have grave consequences for both free expression and competition. That the legislation is bad news for free expression is inevitable for two reasons. The first is the inadequacy of the technology. As Doctorow explains, YouTube's filter just isn't very good at distinguishing copyright from non-copyright material. The same would be true of whatever firms are forced to implement by Brussels. And so, plenty of material that in no way falls foul of copyright law will be caught by the filters. Given that the internet platforms now responsible for policing copyright have little reason to be anything other than risk averse when it comes to preventing infringement, overkill seems unavoidable under Article 13. But the bigger problem is that identifying material shouldn't be enough to automatically block its use. It's not hard to think of harmless pictures that could be caught by a filter because of a logo on a t-shirt or a poster on the wall. There is also the question of what is known as fair dealing in UK copyright law and fair use elsewhere. These are the exceptions that allow people to use copyrighted material if they are doing so for research, criticism, review, parody or a number of other uses. A filter that automatically blocks copyrighted material would make no allowance for these important cases. This is, among many other things, bad news for good fun. Memes - which very often involve the sharing, tweaking and re-sharing of copyrighted material - wouldn't make it passed the proposed filters. Nor would countless other ways we use the internet.

The benefits of this copyright clampdown are nothing compared to the benefits of an open, vibrant online culture. But whereas the former are concentrated among a handful of industries, the latter are spread thinly across society. Such fights will always be imbalanced ones. But they are made worse when, as in Brussels, decision making is dysfunctional, remote and democratically deficient. That makes the legislative process easier to exploit by vested interests.

The investigation will look into whether Amazon's use of data from independent retailers, who sell on its marketplace, is in breach of EU competition rules. Amazon's role as both a seller and a platform for other merchants has become one of the most contentious areas of the business. If Amazon is found to have breached EU competition laws, it could face a fine of up to $23 billion. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] The EU is cracking down on Amazon. </p><p>On Wednesday[3], the European Commission announced[4] that it will launch a formal investigation into Amazon. Reports of this investigation first surfaced on Tuesday[5]. The investigation will look into whether Amazon's use of data from independent retailers, who sell on its marketplace, is in breach of EU competition rules. Amazon could be fined as much as 10% of its annual revenue, or $23 billion, if it is in breach of laws. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is leading the investigation, said in a statement on Wednesday that she will be taking a \"very close look\" at Amazon's \"dual role.\" \"We need to ensure that large online platforms don't eliminate these benefits through anti-competitive behaviour,\" she said. \"I have therefore decided to take a very close look at Amazon's business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer, to assess its compliance with EU competition rules.\"Vestager's team began preliminary work on an Amazon investigation last year. On Thursday, the European Commission said: \"Amazon appears to use competitively sensitive information - about marketplace sellers, their products and transactions on the marketplace.\" \"The Commission will focus on whether and how the use of accumulated marketplace seller data by Amazon as a retailer affects competition,\" it added. Specifically, it will examine: The agreements between Amazon and its marketplace sellers, which allow Amazon to analyze and use third-party seller data and specifically, whether the use of this data affects competition. How Amazon selects retailers for its \"Buy Box\" feature - the \"add to cart\" button that allows customers to directly add an item to their shopping cart. \"Winning\" the Buy Box is key for marketplace sellers, it said, as the majority of transactions are done through this.Potential $23 billion fine on the cardsIf Amazon is found to have breached EU competition laws, the company could be fined up to 10% of its global revenue. Amazon's total sales stood at $233 billion last year, meaning a fine of $23 billion is possible. A spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Vestager is known for being a formidable force when it comes to scrutinizing big tech. Since taking on the role of EU Commissioner for Competition in 2014, she has taken action against Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google among others. InJuly[6]2018, she fined Google$5 billion[7] for anti-competitive practices related to its Android operating system and in 2017, Amazon was forced to pay Europe \u20ac250 million ($280 million) in unpaid back taxes Investigating Amazon would be one of Vestager's final acts before her five-year term ends, although she has indicated that she would like to serve for another five years.[8] It's not just the EU that's interested in Amazon's use of data. Vox reported[9] that the US Federal Trade Commission had also started questioning some of Amazon's rivals about some of its business practices including how it competes with its own third-party sellers. The main concern for both regulators and competitors is that the company is so dominant that it's impossible for others to compete.NOW WATCH: Watch SpaceX's 'most difficult launch ever'[10]See Also:

The European Union implements its General Data Protection Regulation[1] (GDPR), empowering web users to opt out of having their information gathered by websites, with high penalties for non-compliance. Dominant companies have built business models on surveilling and profiling users from every corner of the internet. Nearly all revenue is derived from it, mostly from delivering valuable targeting information to advertisers. </p><p>The platforms know how much money you make, what you spend it on, what you watch and listen to, whom you owe money to, and what you're feeling, on a moment-by-moment basis. GDPR could threaten that strategy. 'It will require such a rethinking of the way Facebook and Google work, I don't know what they will do,' says Jonathan Taplin, author of Move Fast and Break Things, a book that's critical of the platform economy. But last month, The Wall Street Journal[2] and The New York Times[3] suggested, suspiciously on the same day, that Facebook and Google would benefit from GDPR, because startup rivals won't be able to handle the compliance burden. The Times even cited an academic paper buttressing this argument co-written by Catherine Tucker, who has received $155,000[4] in Google grants. The idea that regulations necessarily stunt competition is dubious, especially in this case, where Facebook and Google lobbyists persistently argued against the proposal to European regulators. 'I've been told this is the most lobbied issue in the history of the EU,' said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade association for online publishers. If Google and Facebook come out of GDPR on top, it's because they'll have successfully distorted its meaning and offloaded responsibility on partner publishers and websites. It will take determined regulators to avert this. But if they succeed, GDPR will become a global standard that will diminish the power and reach of the tech monopolies, their propaganda aside. Let's go over what GDPR actually does. All companies that interact with European users will have to identify what personal information they collect, which outside entities can access it, and to what end it will be used. This disclosure must come in simple and unambiguous language, not in a ponderous user agreement written in legalese that is routinely ignored. Since tech companies are increasingly global, you've probably gotten a lot of email notices about changes to privacy policies[5], regardless of whether you live in Europe. With few exceptions, users must affirmatively consent to have their data collected, stored, and processed. They can request that their data be erased completely (known as the 'right to be forgotten'), or prohibited from sale to third parties. They can transfer all of their data to a different provider, making social media or search sites interoperable. Children under 16 would have to have a parent opt into data collection for them. Tech firms must inform users of a data breach within 72 hours, and cannot condition their products' usage on being able to acquire data. This consent must be individualized\u2014companies cannot have one page where users agree to all forms of data collection and use. That's crushing for ad tech companies[6], which must ask users specifically if they want to be targeted with personalized ads as they travel around the web. That's likely to significantly diminish such products as users decline rampant surveillance. The regulation doesn't ban targeted ads[7], but it certainly will reduce their ubiquity. GDPR violations will cost a company either 20 million euros or 4 percent of annual global revenue, whichever is larger. So a fine against Facebook or Google could easily reach into the billions of dollars[8]. There's also a private right of action in the regulation, meaning companies out of compliance invite class-action lawsuits. In short, GDPR puts data back under user control, and ends the pernicious reliance on self-regulation that has governed the tech industry since the internet's founding. Firms have thrived on concealing what the user truly gives up in exchange for searching for news or chatting with friends. GDPR unmasks that, and the result should be positive for users, as well as those websites with nothing to hide and something legitimate to offer. Some fear that users will be inundated with annoying interruptions accompanying each type of data collection. But that gives advantage to sites that figure out how to survive without mass surveillance, creating a more enjoyable experience. GDPR is only the first step in Europe's war on the surveillance economy. The imminent ePrivacy regulation[9] would be even more stringent, disallowing automatic data collection even if there's a 'legitimate interest,' like collecting someone's location so it can show the current weather forecast. According to Citibank[10], ePrivacy could reduce European ad revenue by a whopping 70 percent, and a 33 percent reduction in ad budgets. Other analyses find ePrivacy to be a far greater threat[11] than GDPR. The idea that Google and Facebook would be financially secure in such a scenario is risible. That's why the platforms have interpreted GDPR in a way that evades responsibility. Google has told media websites[12] using its ad network that the burden of getting consent for data collection falls on them, shifting liability for non-compliance to the publisher. Under this standard, Google could, as a 'data controller,' process information gleaned from users for their own purposes. 'If you're an ad tech company, that's your way in, you tell a publisher, you get me consent,' said Jason Kint of Digital Content Next. Publishers have gotten no clarity[13] from Google on their concerns; the company is running out the clock and forcing partners to either accept their terms or lose access to the dominant ad network. It's an audacious attempt to preserve the business model while perverting the intent of the law. Similarly, Facebook's design for obtaining user consent is intended to induce users to rapidly agree[14], maximizing the allowable data collection. They've added large 'accept and continue' buttons and tiny text where you can see the actual changes. Consenting to the new standards is far easier to accomplish than reviewing or altering them. This bobbing and weaving from the big players makes the role of the regulators even more crucial. 'Will the regulators step in and make sure the big platforms aren't able to re-rig the rules?' asked Jason Kint. 'We don't know whether or not they'll have enough juice to mean business.' Given that almost nobody will be compliant[15] on launch day, and the whole of the regulation is fairly obtuse[16], establishing principles to guide enforcement is the key. GDPR intends for users to be placed firmly in control of their data, and being duped into consent, or having a third-party grab consent on someone else's behalf, violates that spirit. The EU competition authorities will have to set an example early. If they can manage it, they can really change the world. No multinational will want to have one set of rules for Europe and another for everywhere else. This can become a global standard that puts individual privacy ahead of surveillance-based profit. The critics who point the inevitable start-up glitches either are hostile to the whole idea, or miss the point. This is the first draft of a new policy regime. There will be revisions, embellishments, and course corrections. We ought to root for its success.

As part of a push to make the Union ready for the digital age, it has published a white paper and begun consulting about how it can best control its own destiny[2]. After all, the EU may be a bigger market than the US, but it has struggled to produce homegrown alternatives to Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the justification for the shift, with policymakers saying that the technology represents a large change in how we live our lives. </p><p>That includes how AI can alter markets like healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, advertising, policing, education and advertising. And, of course, there's the looming specter of how these technologies can be used to avert, or avoid, the perils of climate change.Because the EU has a slow, consultative approach, the documentation is light on detail beyond outlining the key goals of the plan. That includes creating a single market for data, developing \"local\" technologies and ensuring that AI regulation is effective. For instance, the EU is concerned that AI could be used to circumvent some of the laws it implemented under its General Data Protection Regulations.In Europe, we have all what we need to shape our digital future. With the #DigitalEU[3] strategy we adopted today, we want to give each European, each business, and our industry and societies the chance to fully benefit from the digital transformation \ufe0f <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/H45itKEVcE\">https://t.co/H45itKEVcE</url>[4] pic.twitter.com/WAmIuEnJvw[5] \u2014 Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) February 19, 2020[6] There are other concerns, like how AI could be used by law enforcement[7] to curtail people's fundamental rights. Given the continent's history, there's a general unwillingness to allow computers to discriminate on grounds that are currently protected by law. Which is why there are plans to see how AI regulation can be codified to make these systems transparent and its users accountable in law.To boost AI, we want to attract more than \u20ac20bn/year during the next 10 years.

The DSA is a landmark package announced by President von der Leyen in her political guidelines and in the Commission's communication 'Shaping Europe's Digital Future' of February 19, 2020 (see the EC's press release on the Digital Services Act[1]); The second relates to a new competition tool ('NCT') to deal with structural competition problems that cannot be tackled or addressed in a timely and effective manner on the basis of the current competition rules (see the EC's press release on a new competition tool[2]).Alongside the continued vigorous enforcement of the existing competition rules, particularly Article 102 TFEU which condemns market power abuses, these new tools are presented as forming two of the three pillars of the new holistic approach announced by EC Vice-President Vestager to ensure the contestability and fair functioning of digital markets. </p><p>The EC's new holistic approach was prompted by a series of landmark antitrust decisions against Google, as well as ongoing investigations against Amazon, Facebook and Apple. It is also informed by several studies and reports strongly suggesting that in today's digital markets there can be a systemic and recurring risk that Big Tech has pushed these markets to a tipping point where competition is significantly impeded or often seen as permanently eliminated. In such extreme situations, the traditional antitrust enforcement \u0336 which looks at market conduct ex-post \u0336 is perceived as coming too late to restore effective competition and ensure that markets function in a way that foster innovation and choice for consumers.The current public consultations are open to contributions until September 8, 2020. These consultations consist of detailed questionnaires that seek to collect stakeholders' views on the need for new ex-ante regulation and competition tools and on the features that such instruments should have. As the work on the proposed ex-ante rules and on the NCT complement each other, the EC recommends stakeholders answer both documents.Based on those contributions, the EC aims to adopt proposals for the introduction of ex-ante regulatory obligations on gatekeeper platforms and for a NCT under an aggressive timeframe. Specifically, initial drafts formalizing the EC's initiatives are tentatively scheduled by the end of Q3 or beginning of Q4 and proposed legislative acts should be released by year-end for consideration by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.Both initiatives have already been the subject of strong opinions and comments. This is quite unusual at such an early stage, where consultations have just begun, much of their features have yet to be defined, and initial drafts by the EC are not expected until the end of this year. While the frenzy around these initiatives suggest that the EU is progressing fast on its digital agenda, it is worth keeping in mind that any definite position on the new tools' shape, scope and impact on digital markets and beyond is certainly premature and perhaps a little presumptuous. The consultation on an ex-ante regulation of digital gatekeepers The regulatory framework for digital services has remained largely unchanged since the adoption of the e-Commerce Directive in 2000. It helped the growth of European digital services but it neither gives answers to many of today's pressing questions, including users' safety as well as the respect of their fundamental rights such as their freedom of expression, nor does it deal with the specific role and responsibility of the largest online platforms.Against this background, the consultation on an ex-ante regulation against digital platforms - dubbed the 'gatekeeper regulation' - seeks stakeholders' opinions on the enactment of additional general rules, which could apply to all platforms of a certain scale and/or on the establishment of tailored regulatory obligations applicable only to gatekeepers. These measures could include rules aimed at avoiding self-preferencing, imposing non-personal data access obligations, and specific requirements regarding personal data portability or interoperability requirements. The new competition tool consultation For its part, under the EC plan, the proposed NCT is intended to tackle structural market failures that the existing EU competition law framework (i.e., Articles 101 and 102 TFEU) is deemed unable to address in an effective and timely manner. Specifically, the NCT would empower the EC to intervene in two well-identified scenarios. First, the EC would be able to act before the conduct of a would-be dominant company durably and fatally tips the market to its favor and seemingly renders antitrust intervention obsolete. Second, it would give the EC the power to impose curative measures when a market or industry sector is structurally inefficient and leads to sub-optimal outcomes. According to the EC, in both cases early intervention and remedy under the NCT would be more effective than launching a series of individual antitrust cases to fight against what is really a systemic problem or when the harm is done and likely irreversible.Under this new instrument, the Commission would impose remedies to restore the level playing field even if there are no antitrust violations (no market abuse or collusive conduct). As a last resort, the tool would even allow the EC to break up dominant companies, particularly in situations giving rise to significant conflicts of interest and self-preferencing. However, under the new tool, the EC would not have the power to impose fines.The ongoing NCT consultation tests ideas such as whether companies should be subject to the same invasive investigative tools that the EC uses in antitrust cases, including dawn raids and quizzing employees of the company under scrutiny. It also questions stakeholders on whether the EC should be able to impose interim orders to maintain the status quo pending the outcome of its investigation. While the scope of the NCT is also part of the ongoing consultation, EC Vice-President Vestager has herself already spoken out in favour of an instrument covering the whole economy. However, many consider that it is unlikely that the EC will get a \"blank check\" to apply the NCT beyond the digital space or well-identified sectors.The tool is unapologetically inspired by the UK Competition &amp;#38; Markets Authority's ('CMA') so-called 'investigation references' - which give power to the CMA to conduct market investigation and impose remedies to address structural failures - and by similar instruments in certain EU member states and third countries. In that sense, the CMA's closed market investigation cases should provide a useful perspective on what could be the NCT's potential impact at EU level. To date, one of its most noticeable outcomes is the adoption, in 2016, of a so-called 'Open Banking' system, designed to tackle the lack of competition in the retail banking sector, which enables consumers and small businesses to manage their accounts with multiple payment services providers via a single digital app. This app eventually gives them more control of their funds (for example to avoid overdraft charges and manage cashflow) and help them compare competing products based on their own requirements. Other CMA's investigated industries include, among others, cement, energy and airports.Ultimately, the degree of similarity between the proposed NCT and the CMA's investigation references will largely depend on the feedback to the two consultations. Initial feedback and links to the public consultation questionnaires Stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including competition authorities and government bodies, academia, as well as legal and economic practitioners were invited to submit exploratory views on each of the consultations' so-called inception impact assessments with deadlines on June 30, 2020. These documents are roadmaps setting out the main options for how the new proposed rules might look like and work. The EC received 85 feedbacks on the ex-ante regulation of digital platforms inception impact assessment and 73 feedbacks on the new complementary tool to strengthen competition enforcement (these contributions can be downloaded on the EC's Better Regulation website here and here).Respondents overwhelmingly welcomed the introduction of ex-ante regulation of digital platforms. This is an unsurprising result, given that only the Big Tech companies are expected to be affected and formulate opposite views. By contrast, the NCT received a cold shower and had critical responses from an extensive number of stakeholders, ranging from polite advice on its content to direct appeals to make better use of the existing EU competition tools, such as a more extensive use of interim measures and the protection of less efficient undertakings against dominant companies. As anticipated, one of the main sticking points appears to be the EC's potential new power to force companies to stop profitable or otherwise consumer-friendly and efficient behaviors, or to divest strategic assets, in the absence of any tangible and palpable market foreclosure, giving rise to material consumer harm. The prima facie imbalance between the extensive powers of the EC and the companies' rights, which might have to comply with EC remedies regardless of any competition violation, is highly questionable, as it seriously blurs the line between enforcement and regulation.Other concerns relate to the test that has to be met to trigger an intervention under the NCT and the standard of proof to justify the imposition of remedies at the end of the investigative process. The need to safeguard fairness and to protect the rights of defence of the investigated companies have also been highlighted.Stay tuned as Dentons is preparing submissions to the two public consultations and will take part in the subsequent policy and legislative debates.

While Facebook ended the day in the red, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet (Google) all struggled to stay above the green line today. </p><p>Below, we'll talk about the issue for big tech that's coming out of the EU as well as what today's news means for the tech industry moving forward. So, let's get right to it\u2026&lt;nl/&gt;The European Union Ruling That Shook Tech&lt;nl/&gt;Today, a ruling from the highest court in the European Union was everything that tech companies involved in data sharing and their investors didn't want to to hear. The ruling today took on what is called the 'Safe Harbor' pact. The pact is a transatlantic data sharing agreement that was originally put into action in 2000. The ruling from the European Union made it so that European regulators have the ability to overturn this pact. The reason for the ruling is relatively simple. The courts found that the pact did nothing to protect the privacy of European consumer data when it was stored within United States data centers.&lt;nl/&gt; The case all started against Facebook. An Austrian law student and privacy activist by the name of Max Schrems took on the tech giant Facebook because he believes the company hands customer information over to United States Spies. The case was started in the midst of the Edward Snowden leaks that showed mass data collection and surveillance by the NSA. In terms of Facebook, the issue really comes down to digital advertising. While the digital advertising industry was still being born in the year 2000 when the Safe Harbor pact was signed, that industry has grown up quite a bit; losing sight of the importance of computer privacy in the process.&lt;nl/&gt;What This Means For Big Tech Companies&lt;nl/&gt;While the implications of today's EU ruling are still unknown, it's clear that this isn't a good thing for the world of big tech. After all, big tech is filled with companies that have an unending hunger for data and data sharing. One thing we do know is that this ruling is going to cause major changes in the world of tech. When you think about how important EU consumers are to the industry, it's clear to see why. After all, Facebook has 311 million users in Europe, a far larger audience than the 213 million user strong audience it has in the United States.&lt;nl/&gt; Essentially, as a result of the ruling, American companies will possibly be forced to adopt more conservative data sharing strategies at the snap of a finger. If these companies decide to ignore requests to adopt the conservative data sharing strategies, these companies will likely be investigated by European regulators. Of course, if European regulators find that these companies are breaking European law, the companies will face punishment.&lt;nl/&gt;What We Can Expect From Tech Stocks Moving Forward&lt;nl/&gt;There's one thing that's for sure, uncertainty! The bottom line is that the ruling was just passed down today. It will take time to see what kind of effect this will have on tech stocks. However, investors don't like uncertainty. So, I'm expecting more volatile actions in the tech space. While we're likely to see major positive spikes from big tech, we're also likely to see major declines. At the end of the day, I'm expecting companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google and others to show either flat trends or downtrends until more information becomes available with regard to how the ruling will effect the industry.&lt;nl/&gt;What Do You Think?&lt;nl/&gt;What do you think the EU ruling means for big tech?

The most famous victim of their scrutiny, Alphabet[1], is a dominant force not only in the tech industry, but in making the industry harder than others to regulate. </p><p>The accrual of a massive amount of data and the ability to use it, an inevitable, natural consequence of growth in the web sector, often dubbed 'Big Data', is not a criminal act in and of itself. It does, however, present barriers of entry to smaller incumbents. The way that these barriers are erected boils down to human psychology. With search engines, for example, if results aren't up to par, people are statistically more likely to keep scrolling through pages of results than to switch search engines. This simply gives the search engine in question, more often than not Google, more opportunities to advertise and more data on the user.&lt;nl/&gt; Likewise, in other Big Data applications, the hassle of switching services is often seen by the user as less than simply working it out with the current service. The souring public opinion of Facebook in the face of record growth and the stagnation of rival networks is just one example of this phenomena at work. Adding to the issue, most users go where their friends are, causing hard-to-budge local networks clinging to services that are inefficient or even irrelevant.&lt;nl/&gt; As you can see, the nature of Big Data makes the jobs of people like Ariel Ezrachi and David Evans pretty hard. The pair were invited recently to present evidence before the House of Lords' EU Internal Market Sub Committee concerning Big Data in General and Google in particular. Parliament's devotion to the eradication of anti competitive behavior is a boon for the consumer, to be sure, but it can make them seem as though they're targeting bigger businesses. In this case, however, their focus on Google may be justified. With Google pushing Chrome and Android hard, as well as paying a cool billion to be the default search engine for iOS, it's not hard to see how they're taking advantage of the reluctance to switch shown by users who become acquainted with a product.&lt;nl/&gt; In the end, Parliament and the House of Lords will have to prove that Google's behavior is theoretically responsible for a decline in quality of services or barring competition, or both. In Google's home country, antitrust regulators have rarely set sights on them. Some analysts have pointed out that it can't be mere coincidence that former Googlers keep winding up in high places, such as the federal policy making or commercial regulation. Amazon has come under fire for similar reasons. Many Google fans say that they are being targeted unfairly by the EU, but evidence continues to mount that there may be cause for concern[2] after all.&lt;nl/&gt; //ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822...JS=1...ration=GetAdHtml...ketPlace=US...rce=ss...=ss_til...type=product_link...cking_id=androheadl04-20...ketplace=amazon...ion=US...cement=B013CP5HCK...ns=B013CP5HCK...kId=F6WM3ECYQBVBPSJW...w_border=true...k_opens_in_new_window=true[3]//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822...JS=1...ration=GetAdHtml...ketPlace=US...rce=ss...=ss_til...type=product_link...cking_id=androheadl04-20...ketplace=amazon...ion=US...cement=B00IVPU7AO...ns=B00IVPU7AO...kId=4ZUY7OPV44GS3WZU...w_border=true...k_opens_in_new_window=true[4]&lt;nl/&gt;
