I don\u2019t mean this as a criticism, just a statement of fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the great things about America is that politics \u2014 never mind political philosophy \u2014 isn\u2019t a big part of most people\u2019s lives. Associating a body of ideas with the institutions (political parties) that are directly charged with putting ideas into action is a pragmatic way to cut to the chase. Paying attention to what the eggheads and theorists of the left and right want the parties to do is only worthwhile if you\u2019re especially interested in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The challenge for conservatives these days is that the Republican Party really doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s for, beyond defending President Trump and opposing Democrats and socialism. While the fight over impeachment sucks up all of the oxygen in public, there\u2019s a robust battle behind the scenes about what it means to be a conservative.</p><p> Some of it has spilled out into public view, usually centering on nationalism \u2014 what it means, what it requires in terms of policy, how it differs from traditional conservatism or whether it differs at all. Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, for example, have offered thoughtful versions of \u201ceconomic nationalism,\u201d pitting it against libertarianism (both real and imagined).</p><p> There are many different schools of thought here, but a common theme is the idea that government should be more interventionist in the economy: Policymakers should be more willing to overrule the marketplace on everything from big tech to child care to trade.</p><p> Republicans were outraged by the way the Obama administration \u201cpicked winners and losers\u201d in the economy. Some were appalled when Obama bailed out automakers with a massive handout. Trump has now given more aid to farmers than Obama ever gave Detroit, and if an elected Republican has complained about it, I missed it. In fairness, the farmer bailouts were necessitated by the president\u2019s trade wars. But that just demonstrates Republicans\u2019 willingness to substitute their judgment for the market\u2019s.</p><p> There\u2019s a cultural version of the nationalist project as well. Some conservative intellectuals \u2014 mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic \u2014 believe the state has a role in imposing its judgment in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p> I have strong views about all of this, but I thought it might be helpful to offer a few humble suggestions about how to think about such things as these debates heat up.</p><p> First, the root of conservatism is conservation. The great conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who died earlier this month, said, \u201cConservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share: the sentiment that good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created.\u201d This sentiment is at the heart of traditional conservatism, but it\u2019s not constrained by ideology or partisanship. Many liberals (and even some socialists) have displayed this temperament.</p><p> Second, with the great divide in conservative theory, there are those who are anti-left and those who are anti-state. For a crude illustration, some people are opposed to public schools because they don\u2019t think education is a proper task for the state. (Milton Friedman called them \u201cgovernment schools.\u201d) Others on the right think public schools are fine; they just object to how progressives operate them, filling kids\u2019 heads with objectionable ideas.</p><p> Obviously, most libertarian purists are in the anti-state camp, but for most conservatives it\u2019s a balancing act. A consistent conservative can be libertarian on nearly all policy questions and still favor heavily regulating or even banning pornography.</p><p> Another fault line revolves around the question, \u201cWhich state are we talking about?\u201d</p><p> If I may show my cards a bit, outside of foreign policy, I\u2019m very libertarian at the national level, mostly libertarian at the state level and pretty communitarian at the local level. Letting people live the way they want to live where they actually live, so long as basic civil rights are respected, has always struck me as the best way to maximize happiness and democratic accountability.</p><p> This raises a final question: Can the state actually do what you want it to do?</p><p> At the core of the conservative critique of the left has always been a basic skepticism that top-down planning from Washington can work. It used to be that the champions of such planning were mostly on the left. That\u2019s not true any longer. And it remains to be seen whether top-down planning from the right works any better than it does from the left.</p><p> Contact Jonah Goldberg on Twitter, his handle is @JonahDispatch.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Jonah Goldberg</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNM-178C7AC11D6F1CC6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898CFAB3BBD4A NWBKNM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3F-BSC1-JBCN-435W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409154</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Gallup Independent.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In Washington last week Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator and presidential hopeful, called for a break-up of America's large technology companies. In Australia moves are afoot to create a powerful watchdog to rein in Google and Facebook. In Europe, meanwhile, America's tech giants are under continual attack for riding roughshod over competition and privacy laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A consensus has emerged that tighter regulation is needed to curb the excesses of Big Tech. What no one can agree on is how to clip Silicon Valley's wings.</p><p>Yesterday Jason Furman, a former chief economic adviser to President Obama, attempted to provide an answer. With Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft seeking to replicate their dominance over the internet economy in artificial intelligence and other new fields, his review of the tech sector could not be more pressing.</p><p>As Mr Furman makes clear in his official report for the Treasury, the government needs to give the competition watchdog new weapons to police the digital economy. The standards used to assess technology mergers are ripe for a reboot.</p><p>The problem of curbing the big five's dominance stems from the unique dynamics of the digital economy. In areas such as internet search and social networking, the winner often takes it all. Highly efficient and innovative companies can quickly eviscerate their competitors through network effects; the more users they attract, the more data they gather, enabling them to improve their service, attract more eyeballs, and so forth.</p><p>Over time, however, such concentrations of power become a barrier to more innovative start-ups emerging. Consumers suffer, too, albeit in less overt ways than under an old-style monopolist. According to Mr Furman, we may be handing over more personal information to access \"free\" internet services than we would in a more competitive market.</p><p>Because most popular online services are free to consume, internet companies have been elusive prey for competition watchdogs. Proposed mergers are judged on the basis of whether prices are likely to rise because of a merger. It's tricky to prove that a merger will cause harm to consumers when personal information, not cash, is the means of exchange. According to Mr Furman, regulators use a \"static and myopic\" gauge to measure up technology deals.</p><p>This bias has allowed a number of deals to proceed that with the benefit of hindsight should never have been given the green light. Mr Furman is particularly critical of Facebook's $1 billion takeover of Instagram in 2012. Coupled with its 2014 swoop on WhatsApp, the company eliminated two potential threats, cementing its control over social networking. Deals of this kind are known as \"killer acquisitions\". For good reason.</p><p>It was once assumed that there could be no lasting monopoly in cyberspace. But this has proved wrong. Allowing tech incumbents to snuff out nascent rivals unchecked has vastly entrenched their power. Over the past decade Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have bought more than 400 smaller businesses.</p><p>Clearly, takeover rules need to be overhauled so that regulators can view deals through a much wider lens. Mr Furman wants watchdogs to block acquisitions if they consider a deal would harm competition in the future, not just the present. Regulators should also consider whether a deal will cut innovation.</p><p>His proposals are radical. They would force regulators to make subjective judgments on future developments in technology, and could prevent start-up founders from selling at a time of their choosing. However, the government cannot afford to sit on its hands. Time is running out to clip Big Tech's wings.</p><p>                   Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-52564214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMM-T6N1-F021-620B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

In Washington last week Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator and presidential hopeful, called for a break-up of America's large technology companies. In Australia moves are afoot to create a powerful watchdog to rein in Google and Facebook. In Europe, meanwhile, America's tech giants are under continual attack for riding roughshod over competition and privacy laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A consensus has emerged that tighter regulation is needed to curb the excesses of Big Tech. What no one can agree on is how to clip Silicon Valley's wings.</p><p>Yesterday Jason Furman, a former chief economic adviser to President Obama, attempted to provide an answer. With Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft seeking to replicate their dominance over the internet economy in artificial intelligence and other new fields, his review of the tech sector could not be more pressing.</p><p>As Mr Furman makes clear in his official report for the Treasury, the government needs to give the competition watchdog new weapons to police the digital economy. The standards used to assess technology mergers are ripe for a reboot.</p><p>The problem of curbing the big five's dominance stems from the unique dynamics of the digital economy. In areas such as internet search and social networking, the winner often takes it all. Highly efficient and innovative companies can quickly eviscerate their competitors through network effects; the more users they attract, the more data they gather, enabling them to improve their service, attract more eyeballs, and so forth.</p><p>Over time, however, such concentrations of power become a barrier to more innovative start-ups emerging. Consumers suffer, too, albeit in less overt ways than under an old-style monopolist. According to Mr Furman, we may be handing over more personal information to access \"free\" internet services than we would in a more competitive market.</p><p>Because most popular online services are free to consume, internet companies have been elusive prey for competition watchdogs. Proposed mergers are judged on the basis of whether prices are likely to rise because of a merger. It's tricky to prove that a merger will cause harm to consumers when personal information, not cash, is the means of exchange. According to Mr Furman, regulators use a \"static and myopic\" gauge to measure up technology deals.</p><p>This bias has allowed a number of deals to proceed that with the benefit of hindsight should never have been given the green light. Mr Furman is particularly critical of Facebook's $1 billion takeover of Instagram in 2012. Coupled with its 2014 swoop on WhatsApp, the company eliminated two potential threats, cementing its control over social networking. Deals of this kind are known as \"killer acquisitions\". For good reason.</p><p>It was once assumed that there could be no lasting monopoly in cyberspace. But this has proved wrong. Allowing tech incumbents to snuff out nascent rivals unchecked has vastly entrenched their power. Over the past decade Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have bought more than 400 smaller businesses.</p><p>Clearly, takeover rules need to be overhauled so that regulators can view deals through a much wider lens. Mr Furman wants watchdogs to block acquisitions if they consider a deal would harm competition in the future, not just the present.</p><p>Regulators should also consider whether a deal will cut innovation.</p><p>His proposals are radical. They would force regulators to make subjective judgments on future developments in technology, and could prevent start-up founders from selling at a time of their choosing. However, the government cannot afford to sit on its hands. Time is running out to clip Big Tech's wings.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-147328824</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-M0F1-DYTY-C20S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0009DNU</classCode><className>GEOPHARMA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In Washington last week Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator and presidential hopeful, called for a break-up of America's large technology companies. In Australia moves are afoot to create a powerful watchdog to rein in Google and Facebook. In Europe, meanwhile, America's tech giants are under continual attack for riding roughshod over competition and privacy laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A consensus has emerged that tighter regulation is needed to curb the excesses of Big Tech. What no one can agree on is how to clip Silicon Valley's wings.</p><p>Yesterday Jason Furman, a former chief economic adviser to President Obama, attempted to provide an answer. With Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft seeking to replicate their dominance over the internet economy in artificial intelligence and other new fields, his review of the tech sector could not be more pressing.</p><p>As Mr Furman makes clear in his official report for the Treasury, the government needs to give the competition watchdog new weapons to police the digital economy. The standards used to assess technology mergers are ripe for a reboot.</p><p>The problem of curbing the big five's dominance stems from the unique dynamics of the digital economy. In areas such as internet search and social networking, the winner often takes it all. Highly efficient and innovative companies can quickly eviscerate their competitors through network effects; the more users they attract, the more data they gather, enabling them to improve their service, attract more eyeballs, and so forth.</p><p>Over time, however, such concentrations of power become a barrier to more innovative start-ups emerging. Consumers suffer, too, albeit in less overt ways than under an old-style monopolist. According to Mr Furman, we may be handing over more personal information to access \"free\" internet services than we would in a more competitive market.</p><p>Because most popular online services are free to consume, internet companies have been elusive prey for competition watchdogs. Proposed mergers are judged on the basis of whether prices are likely to rise because of a merger. It's tricky to prove that a merger will cause harm to consumers when personal information, not cash, is the means of exchange. According to Mr Furman, regulators use a \"static and myopic\" gauge to measure up technology deals.</p><p>This bias has allowed a number of deals to proceed that with the benefit of hindsight should never have been given the green light. Mr Furman is particularly critical of Facebook's $1 billion takeover of Instagram in 2012. Coupled with its 2014 swoop on WhatsApp, the company eliminated two potential threats, cementing its control over social networking. Deals of this kind are known as \"killer acquisitions\". For good reason.</p><p>It was once assumed that there could be no lasting monopoly in cyberspace. But this has proved wrong. Allowing tech incumbents to snuff out nascent rivals unchecked has vastly entrenched their power. Over the past decade Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have bought more than 400 smaller businesses.</p><p>Clearly, takeover rules need to be overhauled so that regulators can view deals through a much wider lens. Mr Furman wants watchdogs to block acquisitions if they consider a deal would harm competition in the future, not just the present.</p><p>Regulators should also consider whether a deal will cut innovation.</p><p>His proposals are radical. They would force regulators to make subjective judgments on future developments in technology, and could prevent start-up founders from selling at a time of their choosing. However, the government cannot afford to sit on its hands. Time is running out to clip Big Tech's wings.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-147341515</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-M0F1-DYTY-C2G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0009DNU</classCode><className>GEOPHARMA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In Washington last week Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator and presidential hopeful, called for a break-up of America's large technology companies. In Australia moves are afoot to create a powerful watchdog to rein in Google and Facebook. In Europe, meanwhile, America's tech giants are under continual attack for riding roughshod over competition and privacy laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A consensus has emerged that tighter regulation is needed to curb the excesses of Big Tech. What no one can agree on is how to clip Silicon Valley's wings.</p><p>Yesterday Jason Furman, a former chief economic adviser to President Obama, attempted to provide an answer. With Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft seeking to replicate their dominance over the internet economy in artificial intelligence and other new fields, his review of the tech sector could not be more pressing.</p><p>As Mr Furman makes clear in his official report for the Treasury, the government needs to give the competition watchdog new weapons to police the digital economy. The standards used to assess technology mergers are ripe for a reboot.</p><p>The problem of curbing the big five's dominance stems from the unique dynamics of the digital economy. In areas such as internet search and social networking, the winner often takes it all. Highly efficient and innovative companies can quickly eviscerate their competitors through network effects; the more users they attract, the more data they gather, enabling them to improve their service, attract more eyeballs, and so forth.</p><p>Over time, however, such concentrations of power become a barrier to more innovative start-ups emerging. Consumers suffer, too, albeit in less overt ways than under an old-style monopolist. According to Mr Furman, we may be handing over more personal information to access \"free\" internet services than we would in a more competitive market.</p><p>Because most popular online services are free to consume, internet companies have been elusive prey for competition watchdogs. Proposed mergers are judged on the basis of whether prices are likely to rise because of a merger. It's tricky to prove that a merger will cause harm to consumers when personal information, not cash, is the means of exchange. According to Mr Furman, regulators use a \"static and myopic\" gauge to measure up technology deals.</p><p>This bias has allowed a number of deals to proceed that with the benefit of hindsight should never have been given the green light. Mr Furman is particularly critical of Facebook's $1 billion takeover of Instagram in 2012. Coupled with its 2014 swoop on WhatsApp, the company eliminated two potential threats, cementing its control over social networking. Deals of this kind are known as \"killer acquisitions\". For good reason.</p><p>It was once assumed that there could be no lasting monopoly in cyberspace. But this has proved wrong. Allowing tech incumbents to snuff out nascent rivals unchecked has vastly entrenched their power. Over the past decade Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have bought more than 400 smaller businesses.</p><p>Clearly, takeover rules need to be overhauled so that regulators can view deals through a much wider lens. Mr Furman wants watchdogs to block acquisitions if they consider a deal would harm competition in the future, not just the present.</p><p>Regulators should also consider whether a deal will cut innovation.</p><p>His proposals are radical. They would force regulators to make subjective judgments on future developments in technology, and could prevent start-up founders from selling at a time of their choosing. However, the government cannot afford to sit on its hands. Time is running out to clip Big Tech's wings.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-147341208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-M0F1-DYTY-C1RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0009DNU</classCode><className>GEOPHARMA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The biotech entrepreneur should be with his track record, having helped to build reams of successful life sciences businesses. However, even he can't muster enthusiasm about the election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Like many people, I've become disillusioned with politics over the last few years,\" he shrugs. \"It's sort of sad.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across Cambridge, a hub for the UK's brightest technology and life sciences companies, there is a similar frustration - a murmuring sense of disaffection.</p><p>Another election isn't exactly what they want. \"It's almost like a double negative,\" AstraZeneca's Andy Williams explains. \"Basically it just gets in the way of business continuity and [brings] potential uncertainty.\"</p><p>Among research institutes, he says, there is a \"nervousness rather than actual negativity at the moment\".</p><p>Nervousness, of course, because an election brings with it uncertainty. But, this time around, it's more than that. The technology industry is estimated to bring in more than \u00a3180bn to the UK economy, life sciences around \u00a330bn, and both create jobs at a rate which outstrips many other sectors. And yet, it appears \"there isn't a natural ally necessarily anywhere in the political spectrum at the moment\", Edward Benthall, chairman of Cambridge venture firm Cambridge Innovation Capital, says.</p><p>Brexit is a major sticking point. Prior to the referendum almost 90pc of the tech sector was opposed to leaving the EU, and concerns over how the life sciences supply chain will function has weighed heavy on pharmaceutical companies. Almost three quarters of Cambridge voters also wanted to remain in the EU in 2016.</p><p>For some, it is entirely dictating their vote. \"The main problem is what type of Brexit, if any, we get,\" says Hermann Hauser, partner at venture firm Amadeus Capital Partners. \"If the outcome was another referendum, I think that would improve things enormously. From a commercial point of view, that is by far the most desirable outcome.\"</p><p>But, outside of Brexit, there are other, equally uncomfortable choicesROSE to be made.</p><p>\"There isn't really a party that champions wealth creation through innovation, and that does feel a bit awkward,\" says Benthall. \"I can't quite believe that any of the parties really would see the growth of jobs and value that happens around Cambridge as anything other than a good thing, but for some reason, it doesn't seem easy for them to champion that case.\"</p><p>More widely, there have been major pushes from both sides of the political debate to take on big tech - plans for digital services taxes on US giants, or to make the Silicon Valley firms pay for a part-nationalisation of BT.</p><p>But closer to home, British companies are warning that there are policies across the board which could affect their ability to innovate, and prove potential roadblocks for growth.</p><p>One area of concern is around entrepreneurs' relief - a tax break which reduces the amount of capital gains tax that business owners have to pay when they sell a business.</p><p>According to their manifestos, if the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrats come into power, the relief will be scrapped. If the Conservatives do, a \"review and reform\" is planned.</p><p>And, yet, while there appears cross-party backing of some change to the tax break, doing so could be \"pretty damaging\" for innovators, says Benthall. \"It's much harder to start a new company than it is to work for an existing incumbent player, so they deserve the relief that they get and that needs to be maintained.\"</p><p>Stephen Chandler, a former entrepreneur who is now at venture capital firm Notion Capital, agrees. \"Whilst I'm open to tightening requirements to ensure it does what was intended, anything that curtails entrepreneurial risk appetite ... is a negative in my view.\"</p><p>There are other policies on the table which are causing some concern - Labour's plans to establish a \"generic drug company\", for example, has prompted alarm within the life sciences sector. How it would work, the party says, is that if companies did not set \"fair prices\" for patented drugs, the UK would then be able to secure access to generic versions of those drugs through things such as research exemptions.</p><p>This could prove \"very dangerous,\" says Richards. The UK is a \"very small part of the pharmaceuticals market\", and establishing a new generics company \"would rip up global international trade positions in intellectual property\".</p><p>A particular priority \"for life sciences research and industry development, is the commercialisation of intellectual property\", says Alan Hirzel, the boss of London-listed Abcam. It creates an environment where there are clusters of spin-out companies from universities, essential for the next generation of commercial talent.</p><p>\"We'd like to keep that kind of environment here,\" says Hirzel.</p><p>Ultimately keeping the status quo is high on the list of demands of many of the companies in the region.</p><p>In recent years, a succession of major initiatives, such as the Industrial Strategy, has proven hugely beneficial to a host of companies across the technology and life sciences industries, not only in helping to foster innovation, but then in propelling them into the public sphere.</p><p>Specific sector deals for artificial intelligence, life sciences and automotive have led to more taxpayer cash being funnelled into companies developing ground-breaking technology. Alongside that, businesses have flourished in Cambridge.</p><p>Data from Centre for Cities indicates that the city has the highest proportion of patent applications for the residents who live there, and is now home to six billion-dollar companies.</p><p>Last year, almost \u00a3500m was invested by venture capitalists into Cambridge-based businesses, and as well as attracting giants AstraZeneca, Microsoft and Amazon, there are thousands of exciting smaller companies dotted around the city.</p><p>\"It's about preserving what we've got,\" says Clive Morris, the boss of liquid biopsy firm Inivata.</p><p>He says he doesn't really mind who wins the election - \"as long as they're accommodating to life sciences\".</p><p>In fact, taking a hands-off approach could be the best solution for a future government, some say.</p><p>\"Let those of us who want to build businesses in the UK get on with it,\" urges Martin Frost, the boss of CMR Surgical, a robotics business which recently became a \"unicorn\", valued at more than $1bn. \"Technology needs, I would say, little government and few rules.\"</p><p>Where rules could, perhaps, be the most damaging would be on immigration, which is a major part of both the life sciences and technology sector. Around 45pc of the UK tech sector's net employment growth is made up of workers from overseas and there have been warnings that tougher regulation of immigration could worsen skill shortages in life science.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley wealth was created through immigration to California,\" Frost says. \"It would be disappointing if we were to become more monoculture.\"</p><p>Perhaps equally challenging would be any pressure on R&amp;D funding - although, so far, this is a point on which many of the parties are united. \"Labour will create an innovation nation,\" the party said, tabling plans to hike direct support for R&amp;D and better \"crowd in\" private investment.</p><p>The Conservatives, meanwhile, are looking to set up a new funding agency, styled in the fashion of Washington's Darpa. They've pledged to continue to work with the EU on scientific research, including Horizon - the EU's main research programme which has been at the centre of much concern by start-ups.</p><p>Taking into account questions over Brexit, immigration, tax changes and any R&amp;D policies, what becomes clear is that this is an election which could upend the life sciences and technology industries.</p><p>There is an \"awful lot\" that needs to be resolved, CIC's Benthall says. Not only is it \"very unclear what the outcome is going to be, but it's also quite unclear what happens in any of the possible outcomes\".</p><p>Whilst it is apparent this is viewed as a hugely important vote, many in the city don't really know what to think. \"I'm interested, engaged, a bit anxious... but mostly a bit confused probably,\" says Benthall. \"It really matters. And it matters a lot to what's going on here in Cambridge.\"</p><p>Telegraph tour of the UK Thursday West Midlands Friday North East Monday Dec 9 South West Tuesday Dec 10 Scotland Wednesday Dec 11 Northern Ireland In part 4 tomorrow, Alan Tovey visits Britain's engineering heartland, the West Midlands</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CMR Surgical, a robotics firm based in Cambridge, is valued at more than $1bnDAVID ROSE FOR THE TELEGRAPH</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-155348420</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN8-WMK1-DYTY-C06K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 4, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002L6S</classCode><className>ASTRAZENECA PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>AZN (STO)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>AZN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>AZN (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Trade Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097CY</classCode><className>REFERENDUMS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Y2REExMDg3NTBBNDJDNDk0MzcwNDc1RTNEMUIyQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0M3QUYzNjlBN0UzNEVBMDk4OEIyMzdBMDlGQzA2RjI</classCode><className>Initiative &amp;

Sinha in the Rajya Sabha on July 11. In response, IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the government was not planning to bring any legislation to regulate social media companies, and that the \"Government is fully committed to freedom of speech and expression and privacy of its citizens as enshrined in the constitution of India\".</p><p><br/><br/>Prasad added that the \"government does not monitor content appearing on [the] internet\" and it is in fact law enforcement agencies who take action against \"malicious content\" on the internet on a \"case-to-case basis\". He also said that under the IT Act, 2000, social media companies are intermediaries. Under section 79 of the Act, \"intermediaries are required to disable/remove unlawful content on being notified by appropriate government or its agency\", he said, before adding:<br/><br/>\"The Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules 2011 notified under this section require that the intermediaries shall observe due diligence while discharging their duties and shall inform the users not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information that is harmful, objectionable, and unlawful in any way.\" - Ravi Shankar Prasad<br/><br/>Big Tech's repeated run-ins with Indian government on 'safeguarding citizens' rights'<br/><br/>* The Ministry of Home Affairs, in November 2018, had said that Twitter had been slow in removing or blocking objectionable content in some cases. It said that compliance for removal of such content had been 60%, even when the competent authority issued an order to Twitter.<br/><br/>* In February 2019, Twitter was summoned by a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology to examine \"how to safeguard citizens' rights on social/online news media platforms\". This meeting was called a day after there were protests outside Twitter India's office accusing the platform of being \"biased against the right-wing\". However, Twitter didn't appear for the parliamentary hearing.<br/><br/>* In February 2019, a Parliamentary Committee on Information Technology had also called on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram representatives to discuss safeguarding citizens' rights on online platforms in the same month.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0049438734</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1D-STP1-JB5M-W3NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In a joint memorandum, the competition enforcers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden all raised concerns about so-called killer acquisitions, or small deals that big tech companies use to nip the threat of up-and-coming rivals in the bud.  While these deals typically fall below merger reporting requirements, the memo pointed out that the competition laws of Norway, Sweden and Iceland allow them to catch these acquisitions as they happen.  \"In Norway, Sweden and Iceland, the power to order the notification of mergers that fall below the notification thresholds can be employed when there are reasonable grounds to assume that competition will be affected by the transaction,\" the memo read.  The countries pointed out that in Norway, competition officials can also impose disclosure requirements on individual firms. The disclosures and the merger notifications would help officials keep abreast of mergers that fall below traditional merger notification thresholds and fill any enforcement gaps, according to the memo.  \"We suggest that the European Commission considers the introduction of supplementary tools,\" the memo read. \"In this context, the set of tools in the Nordic countries may serve as an inspiration, both at the EU level and at the member state level.\"  The memo also noted the European Commission's efforts to increase regulations on entities acting as \"gatekeepers\" in the digital space. The countries pushed the commission to take a \"harmonized approach,\" like including other member states in the process and ensuring compatibility with competition rules, to \"avoid fragmentation and safeguard the effective functioning of digital markets.\"  \"An EU-wide process will guarantee a higher level of harmonization and transparency, which are crucial for preserving a level playing field on the single market and for legal certainty and predictability,\" the memo read.  The Nordic countries also said the commission should establish a \"clear and objective set of criteria\" on who will be considered \"digital gatekeepers,\" so companies are aware of what kind of regulations they'll be subject to.  As the commission considers other changes to laws that would allow it to intervene in markets where certain companies become too dominant, the memo advocated for companies at the other end of these proposed rule changes to have proper protections.  More specifically, the Nordic countries called for companies to have the \"right to judicial review\" and other \"procedural safeguards\" in the face of a potential increase in the European Commission's regulatory power. They also stressed \"transparent and predictable rules\" within these rule changes to \"ensure legal certainty and predictability, preserve incentives to invest and innovate, and ensure the effective use of\" the changes.  The European Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.  --Additional reporting by Bryan Koenig and Matthew Perlman.

After having enjoyed some German beer at the ongoing Oktoberfest in Munich, Cook has made his way to Berlin. While visiting a Berlin-based startup called Blinkist, which summarises non-fiction books in an easy-to-consume interface, Cook spoke about Apple's pricing strategy, its bet on video streaming services and much more.</p><p><br/>Speaking to German magazine Stern, Cook said that Apple always tries to price its services and devices as low as possible. Yes, many may scoff at that statement considering the stratospheric pricing of its flagship smartphones. With the iPhone 11 series though, Apple has indeed priced the\u00a0base iPhone 11 at a price lower than what the iPhone XR had launched at. The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max prices are similar to the prices of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. Not to mention the affordable pricing of Apple Arcade in India at Rs 99 per month and the plan to offer free Apple TV+ streaming service for a year for anyone who buys a new Apple product this year.<br/>\"We always try to keep our prices as low as possible. Fortunately, we were able to lower the price of the iPhone this year,\" said Cook.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>On the topic of taking a 30 percent cut in the sale of paid apps and the accusations of Apple being a monopoly by trying to push its own apps on the App Store, Cook said that he found this accusation outlandish.<br/>\"No sane person would ever call Apple a monopoly,\" said Cook to Stern. He also mentioned that every market that Apple operated in has stiff competition.\u00a0Sweden-based music streaming company Spotify would not really agree with that. In fact, Spotify even filed a complaint with the\u00a0EU antitrust regulators against Apple, saying the iPhone maker unfairly limited rivals to its own Apple Music streaming service.<br/>While Cook didn't comment on the Spotify fiasco, he views the App Store as the only channel to sell iOS apps as an advantage. He said that the App Store provides a trustworthy environment to purchase apps. \"We ensure that every app that we curate is checked thoroughly,\" said Cook.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Cook also elaborated on how the company is looking at its services segment as the next growth story. \"My assessment is that Apple would achieve even faster growth with new services in the coming year, with projected revenue of $46 to $50 bn this year,\" said Cook. Speaking about Apple TV+, Cook said that he didn't think Netflix would be a competition and the video-streaming\u00a0segment had space for many players of which Apple TV+ was one.<br/>On the topic of US Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's call for breaking up Big Tech, Cook said that he has always been in favour of investigating big companies and has no problem with that.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Blinkist which boasts of about 500,000 paying subscribers from across the world, focusses on giving you the key takeaways from non-fiction tomes in 15 minutes. Cook highlighted how startups such as Blinkist were a prime example of modern firms, which could be set up in one part of the world and have customers all over the world.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-271387</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFT-5FH1-DYDW-71T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"509\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Trump's social media order not liked nor shared: Opposition to (and skepticism of) President Trump's executive order threatening online immunity for social media companies was swift and bipartisan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2.

Schumer wants to change the way the government fosters emerging technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. ACLU files facial surveillance suit: The organization is suing the controversial facial recognition company Clearview AI in Illinois, arguing that its data gathering violates privacy rights.</p><p>4. Cyber crooks on the coronavirus prowl: Google's Threat Analysis Group has observed an uptick in activity by Indian hackers-for-hire carrying out phishing attacks by posing as health officials.</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Trump's executive order to curb social media greeted with bipartisan skepticism</p><p>Even before it was signed Thursday, President Donald Trump's executive order encouraging federal regulators to reconsider legal immunity for social media companies was pilloried by a diverse coalition of opponents who questioned the order's legality and Trump's motivations.</p><p>The order, signed by Trump on the heels of a multiday online tirade aimed at Twitter after the company fact-checked a pair of the president's tweets about mail-in voting, would direct federal agencies to reexamine Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.</p><p>Section 230, which prevents online publishers -- including companies such as Twitter and Facebook -- from being sued over third-party content posted on their websites, is a prized liability shield for Silicon Valley that experts have credited with playing a crucial role in fostering the growth of the internet as a bastion of free speech and expression.</p><p>But Trump and his allies, who have accused Big Tech platforms of censoring conservative viewpoints on their sites, have long considered changes to Section 230 as a way of exerting pressure on the companies.</p><p>\"A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States,\" Trump said before signing the order. \"They've had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens and public audiences.\"</p><p>Trump was joined in the Oval Office by Attorney General William Barr, who said Section 230 \"has been stretched way beyond its original intent.\"</p><p>Specifically, the executive order directs the Commerce Department to ask the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, to propose new regulations clarifying actions by online publishers that might violate Section 230. The order also directs the Federal Trade Commission to review thousands of complaints of online censorship submitted to the White House by the public. </p><p>The order also asks federal agencies to enumerate and report to the White House Office of Management and Budget on how much they are spending on social media. And it tasks Barr to work with state authorities to see if social media platforms are engaging in any unfair and deceptive acts or practices that may violate state laws.</p><p>See my complete report on reaction to Trump's executive order here.</p><p>2. Bipartisan bill seeks to counter China on emerging technology</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties, including Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., on Wednesday announced legislation that would overhaul the government's research and development approach to emerging technology with the aim of countering a push by China for innovation dominance this century.</p><p>The bicameral legislation (S 3832, HR 6978) would rechristen the National Science Foundation as the National Science and Technology Foundation and authorize $100 billion for a new directorate within the agency to fund research and development in 10 areas of emerging technology the lawmakers believe \"will define global competitiveness\" in the coming decades.</p><p>The fields of technology covered under the legislation range from familiar topics -- artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, robotics and automation and advanced telecommunications -- to more obscure ones like biotechnology and genomics, quantum computing and semiconductors, according to a summary of the legislation. </p><p>The newly created directorate would be authorized to use the $100 billion to increase funding for partnerships between research universities and the private sector and educational benefits including undergraduate scholarships, industry training programs and post-doctoral support.</p><p>The agency could also use the funding to \"facilitate and accelerate the transfer of new technologies from the lab to the marketplace, including expanding access to investment capital\" and coordinate with state officials and private companies to build \"regional innovation ecosystems,\" according to the summary.</p><p>The bill would authorize an additional $10 billion for the Commerce Department to designate 10 new regional technology hubs and help state and local officials \"connect disadvantaged populations and places to new job and business opportunities developing key technologies.\"</p><p>Schumer and the other lawmakers backing the legislation -- Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis. -- describe it as a push to reverse eroding American leadership in innovation that could be further exacerbated by the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>\"The coronavirus pandemic has shown the science and technology gap between the United States and the rest of the world is closing fast and that threatens our long-term health, economic competitiveness, and national security,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"America cannot afford to continue our decades-long underinvestment and expect to lead the world.\"</p><p>Young accused the Chinese government of using the moment to get ahead of other countries \"by virtue of being the first to emerge on the other side of this pandemic.''</p><p>\"Instead of allowing Beijing to threaten our values and interests, now is the time for America to invest in ourselves and give the world a clear alternative,\" Young said in a statement.</p><p>Read my full report on the emerging technology legislation here. </p><p>3. ACLU sues facial recognition company Clearview AI, alleging privacy violations </p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI, which has amassed a biometric database of millions of American faces, over concerns that the company violated the privacy of individuals in Illinois who did not consent to their inclusion in the software.</p><p>The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Cook County Circuit Court, alleges that Clearview AI is in violation of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires companies that gather biometric information -- such as facial scans -- to notify people and obtain individual consent.</p><p>The suit could grow into a landmark case over the use of facial recognition technology in the United States, which is being debated at every level of government. </p><p>\"Companies like Clearview will end privacy as we know it, and must be stopped,\" said Nathan Freed Wessler, an ACLU senior staff attorney. \"This menacing technology gives governments, companies, and individuals the unprecedented power to spy on us wherever we go -- tracking our faces at protests, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, political rallies, places of worship, and more.\"</p><p>Clearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>4. \"Hackers-for-hire\" are posing as health officials to steal login info, Google says</p><p>Google is tracking an increase in activity by \"hackers-for-hire\" who are using the COVID-19 pandemic to try and steal Google account credentials, the company's Threat Analysis Group said.</p><p>The latest hacking attempts, which are mostly originating in India, are part of \"a resurgence in COVID-related hacking and phishing attempts from numerous commercial and government-backed attackers,\" the company said in a blog post on Wednesday.</p><p>The attacks out of India involve posing as an official with the World Health Organization and have targeted financial services, consulting and health care corporations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, Google said.</p><p>\"The lures themselves encourage individuals to sign up for direct notifications from the WHO to stay informed of COVID-19 related announcements, and link to attacker-hosted websites that bear a strong resemblance to the official WHO website, Google said.</p><p>\"The sites typically feature fake login pages that prompt potential victims to give up their Google account credentials, and occasionally encourage individuals to give up other personal information, such as their phone numbers.\"</p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ Roll Call's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

Up next we have Jim Squire. This slide says President, but soon we'll be adding CEO to that as of June 1 -- from Norfolk Southern. We're really happy to have him here today, along with Katie Cook from Investor Relations. Again, my name is Brian Ossenbeck. I cover the transports here at J.P.Morgan. And Jim's going to go over a few slides and we'll kick it off with Q&amp;A. So please, Jim, take it away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAMES SQUIRE, PRESIDENT, NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION: Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for coming. First, the obligatory legal disclaimer. Let me remind you that during this presentation, I'll make certain forward-looking statements. And these are all subject to risks and uncertainties, of course, and our actual results may differ materially from those projected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And I would invite you to refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of all the risk factors and uncertainties we view as important.</p><p>So thanks again for coming, everyone. On behalf of all of us at Norfolk Southern, I appreciate this opportunity very much to tell you about our Company. I would like to start with an overview of some guiding principles. And following that, I'll review our recent financial performance and give you some color on the current state of our railroad and our outlook for 2015.</p><p>So let's begin with the franchise. Let's see here; here we go. Our railroad connects businesses to the marketplaces of the world, and we are a safe, efficient and dependable transporter of raw materials, intermediate and finished goods for all manners of shippers and receivers.</p><p>Our network covers most of the eastern US, 20,000 route miles in 22 states as shown here. We connect efficiently with all the other major rail carriers. We serve the major population centers in the United States. We view our mission as facilitating international trade as well via every major seaport on the East Coast of the US, 10 river ports and 9 lake ports.</p><p>We operate the most extensive intermodal network in the eastern US, which generated half of our 2014 volume. And we are a major transporter of industrial products, coal, agricultural commodities and finished automobiles.</p><p>Our vision is straightforward. We strive to be the safest, most customer-focused and successful transportation company in the world. And to accomplish this, we follow five guiding principles. First, we strive to deliver safe, reliable, efficient service that allows us to grow volume and raise prices by creating value for customers.</p><p>We aim to grow volume because ours is a substantially fixed-cost franchise in which additional business naturally comes at declining marginal cost. So therein lies the logic for a volume growth strategy financially.</p><p>We seek to raise prices and revenue per unit to compensate for high embedded labor expenses in our business and otherwise offset inflation. And of course, the key to both volume growth and price increases over time is providing excellent service.</p><p>The second principle -- we use existing resources whenever we can to maximize incremental margin from volume growth. And although we invest for growth, we recognize that freight, that shares, in-place infrastructure is prima facie, preferable to freight demanding new or specialized facilities.</p><p>Third, we spend to replenish essential railroad assets, things like track, roadway structure, signal systems, locomotives, freight cars. We try to resist the temptation to cut spending on these things at low points in the business cycle or to divert spending beyond them at high points, because thriving in our business, we believe, depends on an abiding commitment to core CapEx.</p><p>Fourth, we return ample funds to shareholders. Having seen the resiliency of our cash flow through the great recession, we and our shareholders believe that our balance sheet can support reasonable leverage, do supplement distributions from free cash flow. So that's certainly a key principle for us as well.</p><p>And lastly, while opportunities for M&amp;A in a mature, heavily regulated industry like ours are necessarily somewhat limited, there are times when it makes sense to buy or sell assets around the core franchise. So our recent acquisition of lines from CP, the D&amp;H South, are a great example of that. The lines fit perfectly within our existing operation. In fact, we're the main user of them today.</p><p>So there's little, if any, execution risk from the transaction. And moreover, since we're tying together parts of our network, the synergies, which we predict, should be readily obtainable.</p><p>Now, these five principles have contributed to our Company's success over the year s and drove record results in 2014. For the year, we delivered best-ever financial records across the board, including a 3% increase to $11.6 billion in revenue, which translated to a 10% increase in income from operations and our first-ever operating ratio below 70.</p><p>Net income and EPS were up 8% and 9% respectively, excluding a gain from selling property in 2013.</p><p>Record revenue marked the fourth consecutive $11 billion-plus year for us and the diversity of our franchise propelled overall network volume upwards by 5%, notwithstanding softness in our coal sector.</p><p>With respect to capital allocation, we raised our quarterly dividend by 10% and reached 130 consecutive quarters of paying dividends on our common stock. We invested $318 million in share repurchases, while continuing to fund core infrastructure and capabilities to enhance performance and growth and value creation in the future.</p><p>These accomplishments are a testament to our people, who were able to overcome significant operating and service challenges in 2014, brought on by a harsh winter and a surge of freight volume. And while we were pleased with our financial results, our service did not meet all of our customers' expectations. So we've been taking steps to improve service by investing in people, equipment and infrastructure.</p><p>These additional resources will help foster the level of service our customers expect and deserve. By November of last year, we had resources in place -- again, people, equipment and infrastructure -- to reset our network, yielding sequential improvements in train speed and terminal dwell, in December, which we maintained into January of this year.</p><p>Over the last couple of weeks, winter weather in the eastern US, our territory has those challenges. And as a result, we've seen a downturn in our most recent service metrics. But even so, with the benefit of the additional crews, locomotives and infrastructure that came onboard in late 2014, plus continued hiring that is front-end loaded for 2015, we expect to see service improve in the second quarter and during the remainder of the year.</p><p>All total, the slower network and difficult weather of 2014 did add about $130 million to our cost structure last year. And as we realized the benefits of the investment we have made, are able to increase system velocity later this year, we'll start to see those costs come down.</p><p>The volume this year in 2015 started out strong, although we did see a dip in the recent 2 weeks' car loadings. That's largely reflective of the weather, we believe, and not inherently lower demand.</p><p>Similar to last year, we are seeing continued growth year-over-year in our chemicals and metals and construction lines of business, which were up 10% and 6% year-to-date respectively. This is related largely to energy-driven demand, such as crude by rail and frack sand as well as aggregates and coiled steel.</p><p>Intermodal volume was up 4%, reflecting increases in international demand, a function in part of traffic diverted onto our network from the West Coast. Plus, continued strength in our domestic intermodal market as motor carrier capacity limitations continue to support the intermodal value proposition.</p><p>As we look to the remainder of the year, we anticipate opportunities for volume growth across most of our business units. Crude by rail and Marcellus and Utica shale inputs and outputs will benefit 2015, albeit probably at a moderated growth rate.</p><p>Now, to provide some context, our 2014 crude by rail volumes were 113,000 carloads, were about 1.5% of our total carloads, up 50% though compared with 2013. Similarly, the Marcellus and Utica inputs and outputs comprised about 1.6% of our volumes and also experienced strong growth in 2014.</p><p>We anticipate higher steel volumes to support commercial construction and automotive sectors. Increased road construction will boost aggregate and asphalt volume while growth in housing starts will generate growth in lumber and construction materials.</p><p>Our automotive volumes are expected to increase with vehicle production at several key Norfolk Southern-served plants. And within our agricultural markets, we expect increased soybean and higher ethanol and feed shipments.</p><p>Intermodal will benefit from a consumer-driven economy and capacity constraints in the truck market that continue to support highway conversions in our domestic business. And international demand should benefit from new customers and service offerings.</p><p>Coal is an exception to our growth outlook, as volumes should be lower in both the utility and export markets. Utility demand will reflect lower natural gas prices, while global oversupply, low prices and the strong US dollar will leave US coal producers at a disadvantage in the world market.</p><p>As background, coal was approximately 17% of our volume last year and 2014 volumes declined about 5% versus the prior year. With regarding to pricing, we expect higher market demand relative to tight capacity that will support core price increases with the exception of coal, which we expect to be flat.</p><p>Now, based on the current outlook for lower fuel prices, our 2015 fuel surcharge revenue will decrease substantially to less than half of the $1.3 billion we generated in 2014 in FSC revenue. About half of that 2014 FSC revenue was from contracts linked to WTI and about half was from contracts linked on highway diesel.</p><p>About two-thirds of that WTI-based revenue was from contracts with triggers at or above $64 per barrel. So those contracts will yield no fuel surcharge revenue this year at current prices. And the remaining contracts will generate substantially lower revenue.</p><p>As the fuel surcharge contracts roll over, over time, we intend to move away from WTI, when it is constructive to do so, to more closely align our surcharge program with on-highway diesel prices.</p><p>So in summary, the year holds opportunities for growth across most of our franchise in terms of both volume and core pricing. But we will also see decreased coal volume and fuel surcharge revenue.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at expenses. We expect our fuel costs to decrease significantly, of course, partly offsetting the impact of lower FSC revenue. In addition, some of the service related cost will decline, as network velocity picks up in the second half.</p><p>The impact of the hiring I mentioned should be front-end loaded in 2015, as will the impact of increased wage costs effective January 1 this year versus prior years where the increases took effect as of July 1. So as a result, about two-thirds of the $85 million increase in wage costs in 2015 will occur in the first half of the year.</p><p>And in addition, we have about $11 million of cost in the first quarter of this year related to a new agreement, an on-property agreement, with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. That's a contract signing bonus and a similar lump-sum payment will be recorded in the fourth quarter for employees with active service during the year.</p><p>This is a productivity enhancing agreement, we believe. So over time, we should see offsets to those expenses and more from work rules changes we were able to negotiate with the BLE.</p><p>Now, given our outlook for the year and our firm balance sheet, we're well positioned to strike the right balance, we believe, between reinvesting in the franchise and returning significant funds to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.</p><p>We have $2.4 billion committed in our capital budget. About 70% of that is core franchise investment. About $220 million is for the federally mandated (inaudible) project and the remaining 20% of CapEx will support growth and productivity initiatives.</p><p>In addition to those investments, our board has approved a $0.02 per share, 4% increase in our quarterly dividend, effective for dividends paid this quarter. And in 2015, we anticipate returning about $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks.</p><p>We have 2015 year marked for the acquisition of the Delaware and Hudson assets from Canadian Pacific, which as I mentioned, should be a great bolt-on to our existing network.</p><p>So thanks for the opportunity to discuss Norfolk Southernwith you today. I want to highlight that our franchise is diverse and wide-reaching. We're committed to maintaining safety, reliability and efficiency across all of our lines of business.</p><p>Our 2014 financial performance was record-breaking and we'll build on that momentum moving forward. Our 2015 growth prospects are favorable for most of our markets and we are fully committed to improving customer service. And most important I think are the principles that have guided our accomplishments to this point.</p><p>We have a strong record of success and look forward to building on the Norfolk Southernlegacy. We're confident we are the right steps to continue creating value for our customers in the communities we serve, the employees of this Company and of course, for our shareholders. So thank you for your attention. I'd be happy to answer any questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. Thank you, Jim. Just looking at the first quarter, we're about two-thirds of the way through. Clearly, all the puts and takes there, as you look at international divergence from the intermodal side and you see coal down about 7%, I believe it was.</p><p>So can you just fill in the blanks for the rest of the quarter? Where do you think the quarter could end up on a year-over-year basis in terms of just volume? And what are the puts and takes that could potentially move it one way or another?</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Okay. As you said, volumes for the quarter to date, up about 2%, pretty broad-based strength in the industrial products and automotive volumes, IP up 5%. Tracking the types of growth rates we were seeing last year for most of the year, a little bit of muted growth in the intermodal segment because of weather primarily, and some ripple effects from the West Coast port shutdown.</p><p>Coal is the soft spot, down 7%. Some of that is weather related. I would say this about the volume trends so far this year. I think that the effects, the trend, over the last couple of weeks is probably not indicative. We've seen a sharp downturn in railcar loadings across the industry the last few weeks.</p><p>I attribute that to weather. I think that we'll see a snap-back in volumes as we move through the rest of March and into the second quarter like we saw last year. So I read the volume for the year-to-date as indicative of a pretty strong underlying economy still there.</p><p>I think the intermodal volumes will rebound to growth rates like we saw last year, high-single-digits, that type of thing. And they'll be both domestic and international. Coal is the wild card. We are expecting lower coal shipments in both the utility and the export segment this year.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. On the international intermodal, do you think these are just diversions that were built up after the labor issues out on the West Coast, or are these more share gains that you think you could potentially hang onto for the longer term like we saw back in 2002?</p><p>With the lockout, there was a fair amount of traffic that moved away from those ports and just stayed there. So is the network set up to take those? Are there any areas you feel that's a little more sticky in terms of the volumes that could potentially be coming your way?</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: We did see some temporary diversion. So for sure, that has bumped up international shipments in the short term, and these are vessels that were rerouted en route. And some of that will revert back to the West Coast ports for sure. So I'd say that, yes, we certainly have seen some diversions in the short run.</p><p>Longer term, I believe many of our ocean carrier customers are interested in East Coast ports. We've seen strong growth in East coast ports really dating back a year, a year and a half. As the labor situation started to develop, we were getting more and more interest on the part of our customers in East Coast work callings.</p><p>So the East Coast ports have a real opportunity right now to hold onto some of that volume that has been diverted. They are investing for that. We have the service offerings in place. We've got great coverage from all of the East Coast ports. So we can really make hay with that.</p><p>The question is East Coast port capacity and whether there is sufficient capacity today to really take on large-scale diversions from the West Coast. I'm not sure we have that type of capacity on the East Coast. We have some room to grow. We'll hold onto some of the diverted business and then it's a question of investment and increases in capacity going forward.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. So it sounds like the longer term growth would still take a little bit of investment on the port side to really see differentials there.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: I would say so and I think it'll happen, it'll happen.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Right.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: All the ports are doing that; it's just a question of time.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. Then just more broadly on intermodal, clearly, you have the quarters over -- as you mentioned, over half the volumes last year were from intermodal. Can you just give us an update on where the utilization of the quarters are and how you think of just balancing the network? Is intermodal something you want to take to 55%, 60%?</p><p>As coal continues to shrink, perhaps that'll just grow naturally in terms of the mix. So clearly, there's a lot of factors in intermodal when you think about getting the round trip, getting the density, serving all the customers efficiently. So maybe you can just give us an update on where you are now and how you see that engine which has been so good for the Company, in a couple of years' time?</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Sure. First, the question of capacity in our intermodal network in particular, we have invested pretty heavily in the last 5 to 10 years in creating additional capacity through new terminals, greenfield terminals and line of road capacity improvements as well. So we're in a very good position in terms of capacity utilization today, with room, lots of room to grow.</p><p>So our strategy henceforth in terms of growth capacity and investment in the intermodal business will be to utilize the existing resources, as I emphasized in my opening comments. We're really determined to fill up the capacity that we have created to lean into pricing a little bit more, particularly in that business, to complete the value proposition that we have created in domestic intermodal through the investments that we have made.</p><p>And I think there's tremendous opportunity in the volume growth still to come in that business from additional incremental margin and utilization drawing on the operating leverage that we have created for that business. So very excited about that.</p><p>Our highest incremental margin business is actually our general merchandise portfolio of businesses because you put another car onto a scheduled train and it comes at very low marginal cost. So we'd love to grow those businesses too. And those are, to some extent, reflective of what the economy gives us, but we are certainly all about growing our merchandise franchise too, thus, the investments in the Bellevue classification yard, which we highlighted in our Investor Day this year. That creates capacity for those businesses that utilize the fixed-cost network and a great opportunity for leverage there as the economy grows into it.</p><p>Coal faces a number of challenges this year. And certainly, the utility coal volumes with gas trading below $3 will take a step down. The last time we've seen natural gas in that price range was in 2012 and sure enough, volumes were down. Utility coal volumes were down significantly that year versus the prior year, 2011.</p><p>And we're likely to see that this year as well. The utilities have become adept at substituting gas for coal and switching back and forth as conditions warrant. There is a floor there and gas prices have been volatile over the years. We are confident that we will see a rebound in gas prices eventually. Supply will come out; demand will increase, as always happens. So eventually, we'll see a rebalancing and our coal volumes will in turn rebound.</p><p>A different dynamic on the export side, but the same result. There, it's not about substituting other energy sources. It's about oversupply in the global marketplace and weakening demand globally. US producers, with that said, have been very resilient and continuing to send coal into the global marketplace. And we're continuing to see coal move over our export terminal.</p><p>We're primarily a Met franchise in Hampton Road. So although it's been soft the last couple of weeks, we will continue to ship some, and our customers will ship some volumes into the international market. Prices seem to have stabilized there somewhat, so we're not seeing further pressure on prices on our producers. But that's it; it'll be challenging.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: You mentioned it's soft the last couple -- is that because of the weather, because I believe you had a couple of days we had to shut actually down the facility there.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: For sure. And as I said, really the volume trend in the last few weeks to me is attributable to the weather. It gets very difficult and we've talked about weather ad nauseam and you're tired of hearing about it and I'm tired of talking about it. But unfortunately, it's that time of year.</p><p>This is a more normal weather year, a more seasonal weather pattern this year than we had last year, but it's still been extremely cold across our territory. You've got to run a bunch of short trains. The terminals fill up. You can't get the air propagated through the normal train length. That's why we're running shorter trains and more of them. You see terminals will increase and so on. We'll get through all of that and spring is around the corner. And we expect to see a return to more normal service performance (inaudible).</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: I sure hope it is. So just on coal, when you look at the export markets, and Met coal in particular, you could argue that we're coming down off of a cyclical peak from China's demand. We have, as you mentioned, excess supply in the market. FX clearly is not helping the US producers, but the miners are still going to mine in the US.</p><p>So how do you think about the network's ability to match what's being given to you from the miners? Is there ability to scale down trains and crews and some of the fixed assets? How do you manage the remaining part of when we get to more sustainable level, wherever that is, for exports from the US?</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Managing true volatility in that particular business, export coal, is a challenge. And it has been a very volatile business. Over the years, volumes have been up and down a lot if you go back historically. The toggle we have is, of course, crews. We can modulate crews to shoot the current conditions. In terms of fixed assets, the toggle we have is our railcar fleet. We own many of the coal cars that we use in export and the export business.</p><p>We've been in the process of a multiyear replenishment program, coal car buying program. We have completely hit the brakes on that. We have ample cars. So we are able to react by at least deferring -- perhaps canceling -- future capital expenditures devoted to that fixed-asset network.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. Then on domestic thermal coal, it certainly feels like utilities have switched a fair amount to gas at this point in time. There's certainly structural issues on whether or not they can continue to do that. But do you feel that has really hit bottom at this point, at least the maximum amount of pressure? I know that's again getting back to weather, so that's the end of the first question.</p><p>The second, more longer term, there has been, with the emission controls and the ability to burn higher sulfur coal, there's been a bigger demand from at least the southeastern utilities to go into the interior basins, so the ILB and the PRB. Is that an area that you think Norfolk would look at expanding?</p><p>I know you have those Mid-Continent route with CN. So maybe you can just elaborate on where you see the short-term pressures ending and if there is room to grow, at least change the footprint in domestic coal, domestic thermal.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Okay. Let me tackle short-term demand again first. Absolutely, gas at below $3 per million cubic feet, that's going to pressure our utility [lines]. There is a limit, however, and I would emphasize the point you made about structure. There is certainly a structural limit on how much gas our utility customers can burn.</p><p>And so we are going to ship coal to our utility customers this year. It's a question of how much and how much flexibility they have. At some point, they run out of gas-powered generation and they take coal. So certainly, there is a structural bottom to what they can do with gas.</p><p>From the regulatory side, it's much more of a long-term story. We have seen some takeout of coal volumes, minimal though, due to regulatory impositions the last few years. And we're calling for really low-single-digit tonnage to come out of demand this year, thanks to additional environmental regulations. Longer term, carbon regulation is certainly a question mark.</p><p>The pace of proposals seems to have slackened a little bit there and our utility franchise may be given a bit more time to adapt to whatever comes out in final form. But that's certainly a consideration for the franchise long term as well.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Right.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Oh, you mentioned the basins.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Yes, (inaudible) sulfur.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Certainly, the Illinois Basin is becoming an increasingly important source of coal for us and for our utility customers. And we do expect to see growth in ILB coals and PRB coals relative to [CAP and NAP]. [CAP] is particularly challenged from a cost standpoint. [NAP] is in a bit better shape. ILB and PRB are probably more of the future.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Right. I guess that would also help you on the coal-gas switching if they have a lower switching threshold versus gas.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Sure.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: So I just want to ask you one question on auto because clearly, that's a big part of the business. What we've seen in the last couple of years or so is really a build of more penetration for specifically aluminum for light-weighting as we get back into the theme of more regulatory standards on fuel economy. So I was just curious because you do serve some of the larger plants that are involved in the big F-150 switchover.</p><p>I was just curious how that's -- how you see that affecting the network, if we start to move in that direction more and more. This is a giant step in that direction with the biggest -- the best-selling vehicle going -- a significant amount of aluminum. But has that affected the way you service those supply chains right now? And do you think that would be something that could really change the game a little bit if this were to be a longer term trend? And if so, how would you prepare for that?</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Ford, as you alluded, has made a bold gambit in using more aluminum in the F-150, which we haul for Ford, as you know. And it's going to be a terrific product for Ford and the consumer driven by CAFE standards and the need to increase fuel economy through lighter weight materials. Don't view it as a paradigm shift really for the auto industry or for us; for us because we participate in the aluminum supply chain as well.</p><p>And in addition, other manufacturers, steel manufacturers, are coming out with very lightweight steel materials that will, in some cases, be substituted for aluminum by other manufacturers. So net-net, it could have a modest impact on rail volumes, but I mean very, very modest in our case. We have large metals in the construction franchise, including some aluminum products and a lot of steel, including lightweight product as well.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. We've got a full room here, so let's see if there's any questions from the floor. (Conference Instructions).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good morning. A quick question on oil trains -- have yourself or the industry done anything to improve the safety on these oil trains' speed or any other initiatives?</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Sure, absolutely. The question relates to crude by rail shipments and the industry's efforts to improve safety. We at Norfolk Southernand the industry have long been supporters of a better, safer tank car. So even predating the current proceeding at the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, we have been advocating for a more robust, crash-worthy, safer tank car.</p><p>And so the FIMSA, the regulatory agency, is set to come out with new regulations, we think in May of this year. We're all waiting anxiously for those regulations and we will, of course, abide by them and support them.</p><p>A couple of the key enhancements include a thermal blanket, a ceramic lap inside the tank car, which serves to protect a product if other tank cars are compromised. It extends the time that that product can remain safely in the tank car without collateral explosions. So that's one of the key features and there are some other enhancements.</p><p>In terms of operating practices, we voluntary slowed down, so we're operating at 40 miles per hour in high-threat urban areas. That's in accordance with the government's views on that as well. We have increased inspections of rail throughout our networks, particularly in corridors handling crude by rail and other hazardous commodities.</p><p>We're utilizing distributed power and telemetry devices in the trains that handle those commodities to enhance braking capability. So a whole host of measures to improve safety trends [in] crude by rail.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Looking out over the longer term, you quickly mentioned the clean power plan. Could you just go into a little bit more detail? Do you think that could be another step-change for coal volumes going down?</p><p>And how are you looking at CapEx with regard to coal and just the uncertainty about which plants could be closing? It's really not going to matter whether it's almost Appalachian coal or West Coast coal. It's just coal closing, period, so --</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Not to dodge the question about the effect of carbon regulation, but it's just too soon to tell. It's too conceptual and too far into the future to really be able to map confidently the impact of that on utility coal consumption, I believe. But we're certainly going to keep a close eye on it. And I flagged it earlier as a risk factor in the coal area, utility coal area.</p><p>Let's see, the second part of your question --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: CapEx.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: -- had to do with CapEx, right. So there's not a lot of ongoing CapEx that's dedicated to our coal franchise to begin with. The big ticket item was the coal cars, and as I said, that's variable. And we've in fact stopped buying coal cars and we're in an attrition mode in terms of our own coal car fleet.</p><p>Longer term, there's a question about the franchise and the coal fields. We have an extensive track network in central Appalachia and northern Appalachia. The issue there is you've got a mine here, a mine there, tracks serving each. Coal mines, as you probably know, never really close. They just go quiet for a while and then they can be brought back. So it's a tough call to close a network or close tracks that run to these mines. With that said, if volume drops off, we'll look at rationalizing the track network along with the other assets we have in that franchise.</p><p>The one area where we might actually invest more in the coal business is in serving the Illinois Basin origins. There's a need for gathering facilities and some additional track structure in the ILB because that's not a region we have hauled coal from for very long. But that would not be material CapEx.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just [pay-backing] on the crude by rail question, if the FIMSA regulation goes through, as you're expecting, how large do you expect the financial impact to be? My understanding is that everybody is going to feel it a little bit and you'll be able to pass some through. But you may have to carry some of it.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: It obviously depends on what the regulations prescribe. The gist of the regulations, as proposed, has to do with tank car safety enhancements, as I mentioned. We don't own the tank cars, so we would not be making the investments in those tank car enhancements.</p><p>How that could flow through to rates, I can't say right now, but one way or another, the supply chain picks up the additional cost and some of it is passed on to the customer of course, hopefully all of it, if you're the supply chain.</p><p>Other investments associated with the regulations, there's a question out there right now about electronically controlled pneumatic brakes. That's a technology that has been discussed in the FIMSA proceeding. The industry -- and there is some concern that FIMSA will require ECP brakes in all trains hauling crude by rail and perhaps other hazardous commodities.</p><p>We've actually experimented quite a bit with ECP brakes on our railroad. I think we're probably the furthest along in introducing ECP brakes into [revenue] service on Norfolk Southernof anyone. And what we've learned from that is it's tricky technologically. Like any big tech investment, it takes longer to bear fruit than you think.</p><p>When you start on it, you've got to keep the equipment together because you have to have [all the] cars in ECP service, so equipped as most of the locomotives will be equipped for ECP. So it creates operational complexity. We don't believe that the benefits of an ECP mandate for crude by rail would be worth it, given the benefits. So the industry has opposed that. We'll have to see what the government comes out with.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. Jim, just to bring it back to the higher level network perspective, you mentioned the second half 20145 service improvements. So can you just give us a sense of where that could be if you're looking at 2012, 2013 levels and how fast do you expect the network to get there?</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Of course, the metrics that we all look at, the public metrics, relate to terminal dwell and the system average train speed. Let me just digress on that for just a minute and tell you what we're seeing now and how we interpret the latest data there.</p><p>The good news is velocity is still tracking about a mile per hour better than at the trough last year. So for us, that's roughly 20 miles an hour as average network velocity versus 19 miles per hour in November of last year, which was the service trough. We've been able to hang on. We did a reset; velocity picked back up. It slipped some, but we're still better than we were last year.</p><p>Terminal dwell is the other key metric. Average terminal dwell in the most recent week was around 30 hours. That's about where it was last November. So unlike with velocity, where we've been able to hold onto the improvements, terminal dwell has risen to about the level where it was at the trough.</p><p>So what's going on? The story these metrics tell us really is one of fluidity on the network. The main lines are fluid, are open. Once the trains get out of the terminal, they proceed to destination in a relatively timely way. Now, long term, we're certainly looking to get back to that 2012, 2013 velocity level of more like 23 miles per hour on average. We think that'll happen in the second half.</p><p>The terminals, however, are very full and thus, the elevated terminal dwell right now. And that's because of the weather. When it gets this cold, you have to run a lot of short trains. You cannot propagate the air through the brake system and therefore, you have to run shorter trains, more trains, more trains in the terminals waiting for power.</p><p>And the other issue is the power. When it's cold, locomotives break. They don't like very cold, snowy weather, particularly DC locomotives. And so we see our bad orders, our shop locomotives spike this time of year; it always happens and that just detracts from the overall power equation. With that said, we have plenty of locomotives, but we are not out there --</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Do you feel good about --</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: We have plenty of locomotives and when the velocity picks back up and the weather improves, we'll be putting locomotives in storage.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. So --</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Yes, we expect to see service metrics rebound right back to that 2012, 2013 level, we think, in the second half.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. Then just real quickly, 1 mile per hour better in speed. Do you have a rough estimate of how many locomotives you can take off the network when you hit that target?</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Right, so we think about that in terms of locomotives that we can put into storage --</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Right.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: -- as velocity improves. 100, give or take, per mile per hour is probably a reasonable estimate. So we'd be looking at putting a couple of hundred into storage, we think, as velocity rebounds to that 22, 23 miles per hour average system velocity.</p><p>Let me just say one other thing on crews. We had a lot of crew shortages last year. Crews are in much, much better shape right now. We on-boarded 400 conductors in the fourth quarter and we're feeling pretty robust right now in terms of the crew base. We'll continue to hire, but trains held for crews are way down.</p><p>This is not a time of year when we typically feel pressure from crew shortages because people don't take vacations in March or February usually. But so seasonally, this is a good time for crews anyway, but we're feeling very good about the crew situation. I think all of the pieces are in place for much better service performance come spring.</p><p>BRIAN OSSENBECK: Okay. It's a good place to end. Thank you very much, Jim, for your time.</p><p>JAMES SQUIRE: Okay.

Although the US economy has entered a deep recession, the stockmarket index has recovered all of its losses from the early days of the pandemic and has set new record highs in recent days. Within the index, there is a disconnect between a small number of major tech companies whose valuations have grown significantly, and the rest, who have lost ground this year. This means that the robust performance of the market is vulnerable to any negative effects to the valuation of any of these firms. This may work against the political willingness to impose tighter regulation on the tech sector in the coming year, given the sector's role in propping up the rest of the stockmarket.</p><p>The US death toll from the coronavirus stood at just over 176,000 on August 23rd, around one-fifth of the global total of 802,693. The US daily death toll has fallen below 1,000 for the first time in a month on a seven-day moving average basis, compared with a low of 475 in early July and a previous peak of about 2,300 in mid-April. The national number of cases has also begun to fall again in the past week, to about 43,000, from a peak of 65,000 in late July. The proportion of tests that are positive is dropping too, from about 8.5% in mid-July to 6.5% in mid-August. The World Health Organisation recommends a positive rate of 5% or below as an indicator of whether governments are testing enough to have an accurate measure of the scale of local outbreaks. The number of deaths in Canada stood at 9,073 on August 23rd. On a seven-day moving average basis, the number of daily deaths is in the high single figures, from a peak of 175 in early May.</p><h>August 24th: tech sector drives stockmarkets higher</h><p>The US economy is in a deep recession, but the stockmarket has been remarkably resilient. The S&amp;P 500 index set two record highs last week, meaning that it has made up all of the losses incurred previously during the pandemic. This is unusual; for example it took more than five years for the index to post a new high after the global financial crisis. There is no good news on the economy: unemployment is high, tens of millions of other jobs are in peril and thousands of firms are only managing to cope owing to unprecedented state support.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are clearly some supporting factors for the stockmarket, even if they do not seem robust. These might include: extremely accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve (the US central bank), which has sent a wall of investment cash towards the stockmarket; that the pandemic has so far suited the country's five big tech companies, which comprise 20% of the value of the S&amp;P 500; the assumption that the pandemic will be overcome by a vaccine in the near future; and the hope that the federal government will continue to push fiscal stimulus measures until the economy can cope independently. Accordingly, investors may want to pay more attention to the policies of the two presidential hopefuls towards greater regulation of the sector than to anything that happens in the real economy.</p><h>August 24th-27th: the Trump takeover</h><p>Following the Democratic Party's virtual convention last week, it is the turn of the Republicans, beginning on August 24th. The Republican Party's event is expected to be similar in style to that of the Democrats, with a series of pre-recorded to-camera speeches by party bigwigs. Few details have been released so far, partly because the party wants to hold some surprises back and partly because work is ongoing. Two trends immediately leap out, however. One is the dominance of the president and his family: both Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, will give speeches, as will four of his adult children and his daughter-in-law. Mr Trump is a remarkably polarising figure nationally, but he is still hugely popular within the party. According to the latest poll by Gallup, 90% of those identifying as Republicans approve of his performance. Slightly surprisingly, or perhaps reflecting the extreme partisanship of American politics, this number has been rising steadily during his presidential term. Stacking the convention with members of the Trump family will go down well with existing Republican voters, although not necessarily undecided voters.</p><p>The other major trend is the prominence given to three figures who would be among the leading contenders to succeed Mr Trump if he is re-elected in November. That the vice-president, Mike Pence, will address the party is not a surprise, but the speeches given by a former ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, and a senator from Arkansas, Tom Cotton, will be closely watched. But above all, this will be a convention about Mr Trump, who will speak on all four nights, in search of a spark to overturn an intimidating deficit in the polls.</p><h>August 24th: a capable pair of hands</h><p>Last week the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, lost his longest-serving minister when Bill Morneau resigned the finance portfolio. Mr Morneau had come under heavy pressure for not disclosing his personal ties to a charity that was awarded a government contract. He also repaid more than C$40,000 (US$30,400) to the state after it was discovered that he had outstanding travel expenses for overseas trips related to the charity (Mr Morneau claims that he forgot to repay the expenses, but has now done so). Alongside the scandal, there appears to have been a difference of opinion with Mr Trudeau over the continuation of support for the economy during the pandemic. Mr Morneau is believed to have been more reticent than the prime minister is to extend government programmes, which have led to a dramatic widening of the budget deficit. The design of some of the stimulus has also been criticised by parliamentary committees.</p><p>Mr Morneau's replacement is the deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, who is Mr Trudeau's most highly regarded minister and closest ally. The prime minister had previously moved Ms Freeland to lead the trade negotiations with the US, and then promoted her again to foreign minister, and then to his deputy. She has been a steadfast supporter of Mr Trudeau and is thought to be more amenable to maintaining current fiscal policy for longer. The ministerial switch is likely to benefit policy continuity in the short term, as well as to strengthen the prime minister, whose approval ratings have weakened during the charity scandal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIURTS-crcrcaupdater20200824t1438010001xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIURTS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NN-XPS1-JCDS-300W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1069\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2020 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

Although the US economy has entered a deep recession, the stockmarket index has recovered all of its losses from the early days of the pandemic and has set new record highs in recent days. Within the index, there is a disconnect between a small number of major tech companies whose valuations have grown significantly, and the rest, who have lost ground this year. This means that the robust performance of the market is vulnerable to any negative effects to the valuation of any of these firms. This may work against the political willingness to impose tighter regulation on the tech sector in the coming year, given the sector's role in propping up the rest of the stockmarket.</p><p>The US death toll from the coronavirus stood at just over 176,000 on August 23rd, around one-fifth of the global total of 802,693. The US daily death toll has fallen below 1,000 for the first time in a month on a seven-day moving average basis, compared with a low of 475 in early July and a previous peak of about 2,300 in mid-April. The national number of cases has also begun to fall again in the past week, to about 43,000, from a peak of 65,000 in late July. The proportion of tests that are positive is dropping too, from about 8.5% in mid-July to 6.5% in mid-August. The World Health Organisation recommends a positive rate of 5% or below as an indicator of whether governments are testing enough to have an accurate measure of the scale of local outbreaks. The number of deaths in Canada stood at 9,073 on August 23rd. On a seven-day moving average basis, the number of daily deaths is in the high single figures, from a peak of 175 in early May.</p><h>August 24th: tech sector drives stockmarkets higher</h><p>The US economy is in a deep recession, but the stockmarket has been remarkably resilient. The S&amp;P 500 index set two record highs last week, meaning that it has made up all of the losses incurred previously during the pandemic. This is unusual; for example it took more than five years for the index to post a new high after the global financial crisis. There is no good news on the economy: unemployment is high, tens of millions of other jobs are in peril and thousands of firms are only managing to cope owing to unprecedented state support.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are clearly some supporting factors for the stockmarket, even if they do not seem robust. These might include: extremely accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve (the US central bank), which has sent a wall of investment cash towards the stockmarket; that the pandemic has so far suited the country's five big tech companies, which comprise 20% of the value of the S&amp;P 500; the assumption that the pandemic will be overcome by a vaccine in the near future; and the hope that the federal government will continue to push fiscal stimulus measures until the economy can cope independently. Accordingly, investors may want to pay more attention to the policies of the two presidential hopefuls towards greater regulation of the sector than to anything that happens in the real economy.</p><h>August 24th-27th: the Trump takeover</h><p>Following the Democratic Party's virtual convention last week, it is the turn of the Republicans, beginning on August 24th. The Republican Party's event is expected to be similar in style to that of the Democrats, with a series of pre-recorded to-camera speeches by party bigwigs. Few details have been released so far, partly because the party wants to hold some surprises back and partly because work is ongoing. Two trends immediately leap out, however. One is the dominance of the president and his family: both Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, will give speeches, as will four of his adult children and his daughter-in-law. Mr Trump is a remarkably polarising figure nationally, but he is still hugely popular within the party. According to the latest poll by Gallup, 90% of those identifying as Republicans approve of his performance. Slightly surprisingly, or perhaps reflecting the extreme partisanship of American politics, this number has been rising steadily during his presidential term. Stacking the convention with members of the Trump family will go down well with existing Republican voters, although not necessarily undecided voters.</p><p>The other major trend is the prominence given to three figures who would be among the leading contenders to succeed Mr Trump if he is re-elected in November. That the vice-president, Mike Pence, will address the party is not a surprise, but the speeches given by a former ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, and a senator from Arkansas, Tom Cotton, will be closely watched. But above all, this will be a convention about Mr Trump, who will speak on all four nights, in search of a spark to overturn an intimidating deficit in the polls.</p><h>August 24th: a capable pair of hands</h><p>Last week the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, lost his longest-serving minister when Bill Morneau resigned the finance portfolio. Mr Morneau had come under heavy pressure for not disclosing his personal ties to a charity that was awarded a government contract. He also repaid more than C$40,000 (US$30,400) to the state after it was discovered that he had outstanding travel expenses for overseas trips related to the charity (Mr Morneau claims that he forgot to repay the expenses, but has now done so). Alongside the scandal, there appears to have been a difference of opinion with Mr Trudeau over the continuation of support for the economy during the pandemic. Mr Morneau is believed to have been more reticent than the prime minister is to extend government programmes, which have led to a dramatic widening of the budget deficit. The design of some of the stimulus has also been criticised by parliamentary committees.</p><p>Mr Morneau's replacement is the deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, who is Mr Trudeau's most highly regarded minister and closest ally. The prime minister had previously moved Ms Freeland to lead the trade negotiations with the US, and then promoted her again to foreign minister, and then to his deputy. She has been a steadfast supporter of Mr Trudeau and is thought to be more amenable to maintaining current fiscal policy for longer. The ministerial switch is likely to benefit policy continuity in the short term, as well as to strengthen the prime minister, whose approval ratings have weakened during the charity scandal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIURTS-crcrusupdater20200824t1438010001xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIURTS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NN-XPS1-JCDS-302R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1069\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2020 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

It is Wednesday, September the 19th.  Here's what's driving  the day's stock markets.  Shrugging off the trade war.  They could close at  record highs this hour.  Tech shares are lagging though as the EU looks  into Amazon's data use; and yet, there's nothing but green in the cannabis  sector as weed stocks just can't stop growing.  I'm Stephanie Sy.  This is  \"Quest Means Business.\"  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, the EU opens up a new front in its war with the US tech giants  after dealing major blows to both Apple and Google.  EU Competition  Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager is adding Amazon to her antitrust hit  list.  Shares in Amazon are falling at this hour, down 26 points.  Brussels  says its investigating whether the company uses data from smaller third  party sellers to gain an edge over its competitors.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a press conference earlier, Vestager explained the case against Amazon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EU COMPETITION COMMISSIONER:  The question here is  about the data, because if you as Amazon gets the data from smaller  merchants that you host, which can be, of course, completely legitimate  because you can improve your service to these smaller merchants, well, do  you then also use these data to do your own calculations as what is the new  big thing, what is it that people want, what kind of offers do they like to  receive, what makes them buy things?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  This is just the latest example of the European Union's crusade to  rein in Amazon and its Silicon Valley rivals.  Last year Amazon was ordered  to pay almost $300 million in unpaid taxes after the EU Commission found it  benefited from an illegal arrangement with Luxembourg.  </p><p>In July, Google was hit with a record $5 billion fine for breaking  antitrust laws with its Android operating system.  Facebook was fined $122  million for misleading European officials about its takeover of messaging  service WhatsApp and just this week, Apple ponied up $14 billion in unpaid  taxes to Ireland after the EU complained.  </p><p>Scott Galloway is a professor of marketing at NYU Stern, and an author of  \"The Four\" which is about these big tech companies.  Scott, it's a pleasure  to have you with us.  Let's start with this new probe.  It's Amazon - how  significant is the investigation and what does it portend?  </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN:  So, it's another point  in a line that is essentially showing that the war against big tech will  breakout where all the major conflicts of the 20th Century broke out, and  it's going to break out in continental Europe.  </p><p>There was more action in any given quarter in the last two years against  big tech in Europe than there is in the US.  So this is just again another  data point showing that, quite frankly, the EU is fed up with American big  tech.  </p><p>SY:  The World War II analogy is ...  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  It's too much.  </p><p>SY:  Yes, maybe a little hyperbolic, but today Amazon did become the third  largest digital advertiser.  I mean, still way behind Facebook and Google  and yet that targeted advertising is largely dependent on data, so how much  of a threat to its advertising business is a potential probe into where it  gets its data?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, you see, you bring up a great point.  So Amazon - Morgan  Stanley predicted that Amazon would be $4.5 billion in advertising this  year.  Our analysis shows they are going to do over $11 billion, or put it  another way, Amazon might do as much in advertising this year as Twitter,  SnapChat and Instagram combined.  This is Amazon.  </p><p>Amazon in two years may be one of the five largest media companies in the  world and this is what happens when you have an invasive species unlike any  other company in history can grow to become the most valuable company in  the world, which it will be in the next 60 days without ever having to  achieve meaningful profitability, meaning, they can reinvest 100 cents on  the dollar back in any business.  </p><p>It is almost impossible to compete with Amazon.  I personally don't believe  these fines.  I think they're a gnat on the windshield of a tractor-trailer   truck.  When Google got fined $5 billion, that day was announced, the stock  went up.  </p><p>SY:  That is the question.  How to deal with the outsized power of these  tech companies?  Now, you bring up the fact that they're becoming a media  company and of course, we had AT&amp;T/Time Warner merger which included CNN  and part of what the judge said in his ruling was looking at the outsized  power of these companies in the digital advertising space, so you see that  response.  </p><p>[15:05:09]  </p><p>SY:  But is regulation the right strategy?  Are fines the right strategy?   Is any of that going to make a difference when you consider how large the  market capitalization of these four or five companies are?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  So when you have a company like Google at $100 billion in cash  and you're fined 5billion, what you're effectively telling Google to do is  to continue to break the law.  If you had a parking meter in front of your  house that costs  $100.00 an hour, but the ticket was $0.25, you would  continue to break the law and that's what we've been telling these  companies to do.  With fines, it might sound large in dollar terms, but in  terms of impact, aren't that large.  </p><p>You ask what we should do?  I believe regulation has unintended  consequences.  I think GDPR has actually emboldened and strengthened these  companies' position.  I believe that the future to oxygenate the  marketplace is to break these guys up.  I think Antitrust action is the way  to go.   </p><p>SY:  Do you think there is a real risk of that now?  I know that the US  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is having a meeting with states Attorneys  General next week to discuss this very topic.  We're starting to hear that  word antitrust.  We're even starting to hear the word \"monopoly\" associated  with some of these companies.  Is that a growing regulatory risk for these  mega tech companies?  Could you actually see them getting broken up?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  I used to think there was no way because Amazon has 88 full-time  lobbyists in DC.  We in the US, I would suffer a little bit from what I  call this gross idolatry of innovators and billionaires.  We see them as  our heroes.  But I do think there is a movement afoot.  </p><p>Now, whether it happens out of DC, I would say most likely no.  I think the  pushback is going to come out of Brussels and possibly a red state where an  Attorney General in that state sees that the brightest blue line path to  the governor's mansion is to make an argument against these tech companies.   And quite frankly, probably haven't been good.  </p><p>Have they been good for California?  Yes.  New York?  Yes.  Has it been  good for Kansas?  What's happened to the ad agencies, the retailers, the  businesses in those states?  I think a lot of these red states have  decided, \"You know what?  Big tech, we've been net losers here.\"  So I  don't think it is going to come out of DC.  It might.  The DOJ should  absolutely do its job.  They're called to restraint the acquisition of this  company was ridiculous in comparison to the power of these other companies.  </p><p>So I actually believe, there is a nonzero probability now that the DOJ or  the FTC or state AG might go after these companies and accuse them of   anticompetitive behavior and propose antitrust and breaking up a business  solution.  </p><p>SY:  It's an interesting paradox because you have Amazon yet to announce  the second location for its headquarters and you have, you know, local  mayors and governors courting Amazon at the same time you see it coming  under increasing potential  antitrust scrutiny and other bad headlines  following it as well.  </p><p>Do you see public opinion changing at all toward the power of these big  tech companies while at the same time we're also dependent on them?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Oh, the worm is absolutely turned.  Two years ago, the only  argument was most who was more Christ-like are going to be the next  president among those CEOs.  But really the weaponization of the Facebook  platform by the GRU of the Russian government changed everything.  And now  comes ...  </p><p>SY:  The analytical ...  </p><p>GALLOWAY:   ... citizens are starting to feel a lot more wary about these  storms, but you brought up an interesting point.  The competition to be the  host of the next HQ and regulation are linked, Stephanie, because the next  headquarters for Amazon will be Washington, DC, the metro area and the  reason why - and it was always going to be DC is one, the Bezos have a home  there and a CEO always gets to pick where the company's second headquarters  are going to be and so the only thing standing in between Amazon's  valuation of $1 trillion and $2 trillion is regulation and no one is going  to regulate the individual that throws out the first pitch at the 2019  opening game of the Washington nationals which will be Jeff Bezos.  </p><p>This competition was a ruse to transfer wealth from fire departments and  school departments to the shareholders of Amazon.  It was always going to  be DC.  This has been a terrible abuse of the Commonwealth.  </p><p>SY:  And how many lobbyists does Amazon have in DC right now?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Last check, 88 full-time lobbyists in DC.  </p><p>SY:  Scott Galloway.  We're going to see if you're right on that.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  We'll see, right?  It's going to be embarrassing if they  announce to pick Indianapolis this afternoon.  </p><p>SY:  Well, DC could certainly use the jobs.  Scott, thank you so much.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Thank you.  </p><p>SY:  Let's turn to Europe and the massive money laundering case that's  shaking the financial world.  The CEO of Danske Bank is out.  A new report  from the firm details its employees' failure to conduct basic due diligence  on customers and managers' failure to heed warning signs.  </p><p>The tentacles of the investigation and the alleged wrongdoing spreading.   Regulators in the United States, Denmark and Estonia are all probing Danske  Bank's operations and the probes center on the bank's tiny subsidiary in  Estonia.  Lax controls there allowed for more than $230 billion, they came  from thousands of suspicious customers outside Estonia and that dollar  amount is nearly twice what was previously reported.  The bank is alleged  to have become a conduit for money coming from Russia and former Soviet  states.  </p><p>[15:10:12]  </p><p>SYL  The allegations are linked with fraud cases exposed by Bill Browder  and his former lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky who was murdered in a Russian  prison.  Bill Browder himself was kicked out of Russia.  He has since filed  several criminal complaints over Danske Bank's behavior.  Bill is the CEO  Hermitage Capital Management, and author of \"Red Notice,\" which is all  about his experience in Russia and he joins me now from London.  </p><p>Bill, it's great to have you with us with all these developments happening.   First of all, describe for our viewers, if you will, what your interest is  in this investigation and why you have filed or planning to file a criminal  complaint against Danske bank in Denmark?  What are you accusing the bank  of?  </p><p>BILL BROWDER, CEO, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Well, so it all comes  back to the murder of my lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky.  Sergei Magnitsky was a  Russian lawyer who worked for me in Russia.  He uncovered $230 million  government corruption scheme.  He exposed it and in retaliation, he was  arrested, tortured and killed eight and a half years ago at the age of 37  leaving a wife and two children.  </p><p>I've been on a mission to get justice for Sergei Magnitsky which has led me  to look for who got the benefit of the $230 million crime that he exposed  and was killed over.  We've been investigating it, my team and I, for the  last eight and a half years, and we've discovered that a lot of that money  flowed to Danske Bank's Estonian branch.  And my interest in this whole  story is that I don't want anybody who is involved in the laundering of the  funds that killed Sergei Magnitsky to get away with it and so, I and my  team have filed criminal complaints in Denmark, in Estonia which has led to  the opening of a criminal case, and the criminal complaints that we filed  has metastasized into this big discovery, and now, we are effectively  facing the largest money laundering scandal in the history of Europe  through Danske Bank.  </p><p>SY:  So it is still a question exactly how much of those funds that went  through Estonia were considered suspicious transactions.  I know that you  have said it is $8.3 billion.  Bill, what proof do you have of that and do  you have evidence trying that back to specific individuals and entities in  Russia that you've been looking at related to the death of Mr. Magnitsky?  </p><p>BROWDER:  Yes, so in addition to the criminal complaints we filed in  Estonia and in Denmark, we filed criminal complaints in about 26 countries  and there are now 15 live money laundering investigations connected to the  murder of Sergei Magnitsky in the money laundering of that case, and from  those criminal investigations, and particularly one in France, we've been  able to get documents from a subset, not the whole account, but a subset of  the Danske Bank transactions and from that subset, we've determined that  $8.8 billion of suspicious transactions went  through Danske Bank and it  went through Danske Bank on its way to other countries including the United  Kingdom where I am right now, France, Germany, Spain and other places.  </p><p>And as a result of those transfers, there are cases open to those countries  looking into the purchases of houses, of chartering of yachts, private  planes, et cetera.  </p><p>SY:  What else do you want to know with regard to Danske's Estonia branch's  role in all of this and do you believe that this was just a lack of due  diligence and understanding who their clients were and where the money was  coming from or are you alleging further malfeasance?  </p><p>BROWDER:  Well, in the report that came out today from Danske Bank itself,  from its own internal lawyers showed that in 2007, Danske Bank was warned  by the Russian Central Bank that money going through this Estonian  subsidiary was from the proceeds of crime.  And so with this whole - the  whole problem started in 2007 or at least became - the bank became aware in  2007, but they carried on for eight years and according to these numbers,  $234 billion flowed through the bank after they were made aware that this  was bad money coming from Russia.  </p><p>So this was not just a failure to do due diligence.  There were a lot of  people profiting from this and those people didn't want the flows to stop.  </p><p>SY:  So the CEO, Thomas Borgen has resigned, Bill.  What else do you think  should happen from here?  </p><p>BROWDER:  We've asked the Estonian and the Danish prosecutors to  investigate the CEO, the people around him and the employees that were  responsible for these transfer for - to see what their criminal liability  is.  I don't know what he knew or what he didn't know, but that's for the  law enforcement agencies to determine.  </p><p>SY:  Bill Browder, thank you so much for joining us with your insights on  this case.  We'll continue to follow the developments, of course.  </p><p>[15:15:16]  </p><p>SY:  Later in the program, we're going to be talking about another  corruption scandal, the 1MDB saga in Malaysia.  I'll speak to the authors  of a new book about the investor they're calling \"A Modern Gatsby.\"  Stocks  are surging and investors have reefer madness.  We'll explain why one  marijuana company's shares are up 50%.  </p><p>It's the final hour of trading on Wall Street and the Dow is up 160 points.   It is now at its highest level since January.  The S&amp;P 500 is two-tenths of  one percent away from its record high and that's thanks to a mix of relief  about the trade war and rising treasury yields which are lifting financial  shares.  </p><p>The chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs says stock market returns will  be slowing down soon.  Peter Oppenheimer spoke to Richard at the end of  last week and says things can't stay like this forever.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PETER OPPENHEIMER, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, GOLDMAN SACHS:  Within equities  a really important driver of that bull market has been technology and why  we're still optimistic about technology, we don't really see the margins in  that sector rising in the way that they have, so with the absence of that  being a stronger driver than we've seen in the past and without lower  interest rates pushing valuations yet higher still, we're likely to see  relatively low profit growth and lower returns overall.  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  In that case, where do you  go?   What does one do?  Anybody watching tonight, he's got this top chap here  who's had global strategist of equities, this man must know what the  strategy should be for the next year or so, what does an ordinary investor  do faced with the information that we are putting before them tonight?  </p><p>OPPENHEIMER:  I think one thing to say is that having some kind of balance  and diversified approach always makes sense.  Cash rates, interest rates  have picked up particularly in the US and it makes some sense to have some  money in cash to counter balance perhaps money in stock markets as an  example, but the main thing that this is really saying is one should be  prepared for a time when the returns available in financial assets,  including stock markets are just lower than we've enjoyed in recent years.  </p><p>[15:20:08]  </p><p>OPPENHEIMER:  Within stock markets, there will be tactical opportunities,  rebound we think is plausible, for example, in emerging markets where we've  seen a big selloff recently.  We think good quality companies that are  reinvesting for future growth or companies that are restructuring and  generating good cash flows and decent dividend yields all make sense as  well.  And I think it is prudent to expect that just buying and holding  indices, equity markets overall is likely to generate lower returns than  people have been used to in the period of the last few years where  valuations have gone up a lot on the back of falling interest rates and the  liquidity boost of quantitative easing which is beginning to come to an  end.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  Growing marijuana plants takes light, water and nutrients.  Growing  marijuana stocks takes an approval from the Federal government and a lot of  optimism apparently from investors.  Tilray shares are up 45%.  They he  seesawed wildly in the last ten minutes.  Actually, shares were briefly  halted moments ago in fact due to the extreme volatility.  </p><p>Today's surge though puts Tilray's  market cap above $20 billion and that  makes Tilray the most valuable marijuana company with a market cap on par  with American Airlines and Twitter.  On Tuesday, Tilray revealed that the  US Federal government will allow it to import cannabis for a clinical trial  in California.  It's a small step toward the mass legalization that Tilray  CEO told us is the key to growth.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BRENDAN KENNEDY, CEO, TILRAY:  We're seeing tremendous growth country after  country is legalizing.  We also see Canada will be the first G7 nation to  allow adult use sales.  The first sale will take place in October this  year, October 17th, and so we're very optimistic about our growth  opportunities this year as well as next year with Canada being the first  adult use opportunity.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  Alan Valdes knows all about marijuana stocks.  He's the chairman of a  Cannabis company, Diego Pellicer and a senior partner at Silver Bear  Capital.  Alan, great to see you.  Somebody just did the math for me and  told me that if you had  bought at the IPO price back in July for  $1,000.00, you put a $1,000.00 and you'd be a millionaire today.  </p><p>ALAN VALDEZ, CHAIRMAN, DIEGO PELLICER:  Yes, that's true.  That's correct.   Cannabis I think is going to have a great year this year and one of  the  main reasons is, the President has this massive tax cuts here in America.   He's got to make up for it somewhere.  And in cannabis, it is a unique  industry.  We know we have clients even though we haven't been legally able  to market in many  states.  Nothing's open.  It's not legal.  But we know  there are tons of customers out there.  </p><p>So the minute this goes legal, and we think this administration will  legalize it because they need the tax revenue.   It's all about the money.   We'll see what happens.  That's going to lift all these cannabis stocks in  the wings right through the roof.  </p><p>SY:  Okay, you clearly, Alan, share the fervor for Tilray and the cannabis  companies whose stocks we're seeing explode today, but is there a concern  that some of this is just speculative fever?  Tilray's market cap is in the  billions now.  Its grown by hundreds of percentage points from its IPO, but  it only has $28 million in sales.  So do the fundamentals really back up  this valuation in your view?  </p><p>VALDES:  No, not yet, but again, I think if you're getting into marijuana,  into cannabis companies like Tilray are good to get involved in Diego, too,  but of course, I'm speaking of my own book here.  But I think those are  great companies to take a look at.  I think, in the long run, look what  Coke is doing.  Coke is thinking about infusing a drink with cannabis oil.  </p><p>So, I think in the long run, you're going to see this industry grow and if  you get in on the bottom floor, like some of these stocks are, it is a good  place to begin.  Yes, the valuations are a little out of whack, of course,  but again in the long run, I think, it's a good place to be.  </p><p>SY:  I think it's interesting that you believe the Trump administration is  going to be for Federal legalization when we've heard the Attorney General  Jeff Sessions being really in the reverse of that and wanting to - earlier  in the  administration at least crack down on some of the states that had  gone for legalization.  Do you think that because Jeff Sessions seems to be  not on President Trump's good side right now that actually bodes well for  the marijuana industry?  </p><p>VALDES:  No question about it.  I mean, he's been a thorn in our side, to  be honest with you.  But again, I think at the end of the day, Trump being  a businessman is going to have to get tax revenue somewhere and this is a  great - California alone, over $1 billion in tax revenue once that goes  legal later on this year.  So, I think overall, it's going to be a great  year for cannabis and now's the time to get in.  </p><p>SY:  All right.  Thank you, Alan Valdes.  Good to see you.  </p><p>VALDES:  Thanks.  Have a great day.  </p><p>SY:  You too.  </p><p>[15:25:16]  </p><p>SY:  European investors seem unfazed by the potential fallout from the US- China trade war.  It was a solid day of gains across the continent.  In  fact, in London, mining stocks helped lift the FTSE.  Investors may be on  move, but the ahead of Daimler Trucks admits he's very worried about the  current tariff battle.  </p><p>Martin Daum says there are no winners in a trade war and he told our Anna  Stewart that consumers will pay the price.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>MARTIN DAUM, HEAD OF DAIMLER TRUCKS:  I mean, I'm really worried because we  are truly a global company with a big footprint in nearly every major  economy employing everywhere thousands of people in each and  every  country, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in each and every  country and we depend on long-term stability in the globe and the free  exchange of ideas, people, goods.  We don't invest in each and every  country for each and every part.  We ship parts back and forth around the  globe for the benefits of all economies.  And therefore, we are concerned.  </p><p>The first fallout, at least, a significant increase in aluminum and we  produce aluminum crafts in the United States.  So, US trucks got more  expensive because of that tariff.  I don't see any much sense on any trade  war because at the end of the trade war, nobody wins.  There will be no  winner.  There will be potentially losers and big losers and we want win- win situations for everyone.  </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  I think that the tariffs on aluminum and  steel have increased you costs, are you passing that cost on to the  consumer or are you having to absorb that?  </p><p>DAUM:  I mean, for 2018, we have to absorb it because we are basically sold  out for the years so you can't increase pricing in mid-year, but in the  next year, we will pass it on and I think, at least that our competitors  are seeing the same increase in raw material cost, so the general, the  pricing of trucks will go up.  The prices of trucks go up, the prices of -  the cost of transportation goes up and that will have then the prices on  the shelves for the consumers ultimately and it is a very good  example of  how trade wars ultimately harm the consumer in each and every country the  most.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SY:  Corruption allegations are flying, a luxury yacht is seized and  investigators are keen to find billions of dollars that seemed to have  disappeared.

And I was reading a  description of an extravagant birthday party that this guy Jho Low threw  for himself in Vegas in the midst of the financial crisis. </p><p>A long list of rappers and Hollywood actors, it was like reading a chapter  from \"Crazy Rich Asians\". </p><p>TOM WRIGHT, AUTHOR:  Yes, exactly -- </p><p>SY:  Except this is real and he allegedly stole all this money?</p><p>WRIGHT:  He did, I mean, we -- that's the prologue of our book you're  referring to, his 2012 birthday party which Robin Lee described as possibly  the biggest private party that anyone has ever thrown.  But the money, he  had taken it from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund that he run from behind  the scenes.</p><p>SY:  So Bradley, $6 billion is what was allegedly funding his lifestyle.   How did he get there? Was this an elaborate scheme or a simple theft? </p><p>BRADLEY HOPE, AUTHOR:  Well, he had the -- working with the Malaysian Prime  Minister, he helped create his own sovereign wealth fund which he run from  behind the scenes, and with the help of Goldman Sachs, they buried all this  money, and he arranged all these deals where the money was kind of siphoned  into the side.</p><p>And that's where billions of dollars he basically took control of, and used  to fund this crazy lifestyle to do big deals, he was almost about to buy  Arriba from Adidas in 2015, that got scuppered because the FBI started  investigating him.  So it's -- that's how he pulled it off.</p><p>[15:35:00]  SY:  What is just remarkable is the amount of famous people  that you name in this book.  Everyone from rap stars to Leonardo DiCaprio,  he allegedly helped fund the film \"Wolf of Wall Street\", so this was a  midst of a financial crisis, how did he get away with this for so long with  nobody noticing or asking who this guy was?</p><p>WRIGHT:  I think, well, billion dollar well shows is that if you've got  enough money, you can buy you way into any place in the world.  I mean, he  got to Leonardo DiCaprio by offering $400 million in some financing, she  dated Miranda Kerr, you know, she had made $7 million a year before she met  Jho Low. </p><p>But you know, that's not enough alone for super yachts or to throw, you  know, champagne-drenched parties.  So Jho Low was really the guy who knew  how to use money to enjoy kinds of crazy high society.</p><p>SY:  Yes, you talk a little bit about the Golden Sachs nexus.  And there's  one person that you name in particular who had a relationship with Jho Low.   What's his situation right now?</p><p>HOPE:  Yes, one of the key bankers from Goldman Sachs is called Tim  Leissner, he was married to Kimora Lee Simmons.  He was the banker that  kind of helped set up all of the deals for this 1MDB fund and earned  Goldman Sachs a huge profit, 600 million or so on deals that normally would  have earned Goldman Sachs maybe a million dollars or so or less.</p><p>So he is now in -- the last we've heard from them, he was in clean talks  with the U.S. government or the Department of Justice to talk about what he  knows about this case and what Goldman Sachs knew and exactly that's there  all the way up to the top. </p><p>SY:  So there continues to be a potential for illegal exposure for Goldman  -- </p><p>WRIGHT:  For Goldman, yes, well, I mean, there's two things here.  One is  the preliminary investigation with his buddy he was referring to and Tim  Leissner, some previous talks that he'll probably admit to some kind of  wrongdoing.  And there's also of course -- there could be something to a  hefty fine under the bank's Secrecy Act.</p><p>Because there were huge red flags in this that they were raising money for  this sovereign wealth fund that Jho Low ran, including a request to put $3  billion into his Swiss bank account which was -- which highly unusual.   Goldman's own lawyers on the deal, the plaintiffs(ph) said that perhaps  they shouldn't do it and they went ahead and did it anyway.</p><p>So those are the kind of things regulators are going to be looking at. </p><p>SY:  All right, where is Jho Low now, we know that the former Prime  Minister of Malaysia has been arrested, there's a new regime, and I believe  there's an arrest warrant now for him.  What do we know about his  whereabouts? </p><p>HOPE:  The best we know is that he's in China, and he has some measure of  protection from the Chinese government.  He -- we reported in the Wall  Street Journal that he's told people that he has worked with Chinese  intelligence.  And so far, sort of the subjects are some tensed discussions  between the two countries, Malaysia and China say you know, where exactly  is Jho Low?</p><p>Are they going to turn him over?</p><p>SY:  Does he still have the money?</p><p>HOPE:  It appears from all we can see, he still has a lot of money.</p><p>SY:  Tom, what do you want people to take away from this book.  I mean, I  feel like there's a very interesting message that I got from it as far as  how wealth works in this world, as far as access is, you know, what do you  want people to walk away from?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Well, first of all, it's not didactic, I think it's a great true  crime thriller, and I want people to enjoy reading it.  But also, we have a  chapter called \"White-Collar Crime\", very late on, and I think what's  important here is that you cannot, you know, conduct white-collar crime and  get away with it.</p><p>There should be some repercussions for the banks and for the enablers of  Jho Low.  It wasn't just a corrupter in Malaysia that did this, he was  enabled by, you know, the global financial system.</p><p>SY:  Tom Wright and Bradley Hope, good luck with the book, thanks so much  for being with us.  </p><p>HOPE:  Thank you. </p><p>SY:  Making artificial intelligence more fair.  IBM says it's got a tool  for that.  I'll be talking to one of their top AI people just ahead.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  The scale of the agricultural impact from Hurricane Florence is just  becoming clear in the Carolinas.  U.S. officials saying nearly 3.5 million  poultry birds were lost in the storm, but barreled through parts of the  southeastern U.S. a few days ago.</p><p>President Donald Trump is praising the recovery effort, he met with  emergency workers earlier today during a visit to the flood zone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The job you've done has been  -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes -- </p><p>TRUMP:  Incredible.  They're talking about it all over the world and we  want to keep it going that way because some of the hard work is now.  We've  gone through a very dangerous work and still dangerous, but some of the  hard work is taking place right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  The death toll from Florence is now 36.  The storm broken into --  remnants has moved that of the area leaving behind massive destruction and  new threats from flooding.  Moody's estimates the damage could top $22  billion.  Belfor which specializes in restoration and repair says it had  hundreds of people on the ground during the hurricane. </p><p>CEO Sheldon Yellen echoed Mr. Trump's praise for the rescuers when he spoke  to my colleague Bianna Golodryga.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHELDON YELLEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BELFOR:  I think the authorities  have done an amazing job.  The communication has been very good on the  ground level.  The utility crews that are out there are in huge numbers.  I  think the preparation for this storm has been terrific.  I really do.  </p><p>And I think that for the most part, people are listening to the  instructions that are being given.  Every once in a while, you hear of a  story that there has to be in the media rescue attempt to -- and what we're  hearing back and what our own people on the ground are seeing is that these  rescues are being handled -- they're being handled in a terrific way.</p><p>And I really do think the authorities have done a terrific job in this  scenario.  I really do.</p><p>BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN:  And lastly, you know, people focus on costs and not  human costs, but financial costs at the end, right? That's not the primary  issue of concern, but it is a big issue nonetheless.  How given that we're  going to be seeing more and more of these types of storms and their  ramifications. </p><p>How can you better prepare? How can we better prepare ourselves to not end  up with such a huge financial costs when it comes to the clean up and  rebuilding efforts.</p><p>YELLEN:  Well, I think again, you know, when you talk about costs, there's  so many different shading factors, but one of the issues that all property  owners are facing is coverage issues.  So if you have coverage for wind- driven rain on a normal (INAUDIBLE) policy, that's one type of coverage.</p><p>But a lot of people in flood zones don't have flood coverage.  People need  to be aware of this in advance for these storms, and flood coverage is  available through the private sector and or through national flood  programs.</p><p>So the coverage is available and these insurance companies are very well  capable of insuring the properties and the reinsurance that's laid off is  all in place.  But people have to take these measures in advance under  consideration.</p><p>For those people that are under insured, there are federal programs for  loans, that's what FEMA administers.  But the real efforts that go into  restoring a community is a private insurance, federal assistance, FEMA's  assistance and the overall good of the communities pulling together because  I've seen over 34 years of doing this. </p><p>[15:45:00]  The enormous positive effect of communities pulling together,  neighbor helping neighbor, person helping person, one at a time all  contribute to pulling these communities back to where they need to be. </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  IBM has launched a new tool, it wants to help AI users spot hidden  biases in algorithms.  Dario Gil is IBM's vice president of AI, he joins me  now in the C-suite.  Dario, this is such an interesting topic to me,  especially because AI seems to be pervasive in our workplace, in our lives  right now.</p><p>Can you start by just explaining what do you mean when you say AI bias?</p><p>DARIO GIL, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, IBM RESEARCH &amp; VICE PRESIDENT OF AI:   AI bias, yes, so one of the reasons why we're hearing about AI so much is  because the recent advances that we have made with, you know, metal works,  make prediction accuracy, you know, very good.</p><p>The problem is it's a black box.  So when we go and we have a data set that  we give examples to these known network to train it, let's say we're going  to do our credit scoring to assign whether somebody should get a mortgage  or not.</p><p>So we give past examples, and I give us a prediction.  But you know, in the  training of the example, did somebody use bias data? And therefore, for  example, if we use historical data from past approvals.  And maybe in the  past, we weren't given credit or approvals to women as an example. </p><p>SY:  Or to minorities.</p><p>GIL:  Or to minorities.  Well, if we use naively sort of pass data to just  alternative example, we're going to create a system that is bias.  So what  we have released in our trust and transparency toolbox is the ability to be  able to check for your data that you use to train, the mission learning  models and see if it's bias and also for the models themselves.</p><p>And also to provide expendability(ph).  Why did he make that prediction?  Give me some explanation for how it works?</p><p>SY:  Is it easy to understand, you know, you talk about the black box and I  want to get there.  You know, there's a belief that, I think that there are  not a lot of AI experts that understand how algorithms, how machine- learning, how all of that stuff works.</p><p>But there's an understanding that programmers behind it use data that might  be bias and the programmers themselves might be bias.  So how  understandable I guess is this toolkit for these companies to be able to  really understand what's going into the decisions that they're allowing AI  to potentially make?</p><p>GIL:  That's right, and that's the major advance of the new service we've  released on the IBM cloud because what you can do is two components of it.   One is this bias checking of the data itself and the models.  The second  component, what you alluded to is explain it to me in a way I can  understand it.</p><p>Not by telling me, oh, he has a billion weight, here are some numbers, and  you're like what does this mean?</p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>GIL:  Give me -- </p><p>SY:  And that keeps it a black box.</p><p>GIL:  That keeps it as a black box, exactly right.  So this is about be  able to give me an explanation with language that I can just read of  saying, oh, you know, this prediction is using these variables more, you  know, these class of variables and so on.</p><p>And it gives you an understanding for which variables are more important,  the consequences of using those variables and the prediction that's in the  credit scoring or on hiring in HR or on medical recommendation.  So that  human and the whole person we all are to understand why is it behaving the  way it does, and that's a major advance.</p><p>SY:  And obviously, your company hopes that what this leads to is less of a  fear of the technology, more mass deployment of AI and I know IBM is active  in that.  On that point, I want to ask you a broader question about  competition in the AI sphere.</p><p>I know that China is also very advanced when it comes to artificial  intelligence technology.  How far ahead is it when it comes to a China-U.S.  comparison?</p><p>GIL:  Well, AI, I mean, is arguably the most important technology in the  world today.  So it's not surprising that at every level, whether you're  talking about the educational level and students wanting to learn about AI  at the business level, using AI and creating AI for competitive advantage  and at the national level, right? </p><p>There's national strategies to advance AI, and we're seeing that.  So China  is an exemplar of making those investments -- </p><p>SY:  A national strategy -- </p><p>GIL:  A national strategy, but we're seeing that, you know, broadly, not  just in China, of course in the United States.  If you look at United  States or Canada are major power houses in terms of AI innovation and  advances and so on.  But it's undoubtedly the case that China has made it,  that's one of their top strategic priorities. </p><p>SY:  And because it's made it a priority, has it advanced technologically  further than the U.S. for example? </p><p>GIL:  Well, what I would say is that we're seeing the application of it,  it's a very broad use, but we're also seeing that in the United States.   And I would say at the forefronts of advances in AI, the United States also  remains extraordinarily competitive, right, in making many of the seminal  advances.    </p><p>[15:50:00]  You know, things are happening in China as well.  But I would  not say that we're in a situation where we're not at the forefront of  leading in AI.</p><p>SY:  Dario Gil; Vice President of AI at IBM, such an interesting topic,  thank you so much for coming in. </p><p>GIL:  Thank you for having me here.</p><p>SY:  Coming up, Supreme Court ruling sparks a sports-betting gold rush in  the U.S., I'll ask the CEO of DraftKings, how he's cashing in.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  More parts of the United States are looking to get on board the sports  betting bandwagon.  Lawmakers in Washington D.C. have introduced a bill  that will let people bet on games.  While it's legal in many countries  around the world, it's only allowed in a handful of U.S. states. </p><p>Jason Robins is the CEO of DraftKings; a site for betting and fantasy  sports.  Jason, thank you so much for being with us.  Since the Supreme  Court ruling that lifted the ban on sports betting, you've opened up an  actual sports betting establishment in New Jersey. </p><p>So talk about its popularity and its profits.</p><p>JASON ROBINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DRAFTKINGS:  Well, we were the first  to get a mobile app in market, and that launched on August 1st, so it's  still very early.  But I can tell you that every number we thought when we  projected were shattering.  It's just unbelievable how much demand and how  much excitement there is over sports betting.</p><p>And you know, a lot of people I think are enjoying -- it's a good time of  year, so a lot of people enjoying college sports, you know, the NFL being  the -- you know, those are the two most popular betting sports in America  and both just started, I think the timing couldn't have been better.</p><p>SY:  Yes, and I read that it took 38 days to reach 1 million sports bets  since you launched the online sports book in New Jersey on August 1st.  As  you mentioned, the NFL season has gotten underway, you usually see a spike  in bets of course during American football season.  Are you happy so far  with the metrics you're seeing?</p><p>ROBINS:  The growth since NFL started has been unbelievable.  So you just  mentioned, it took us 38 days to get to our millionth bet.  About 15 days  later, this Sunday, we are going to hit our 2 millionth bet.  So in less  than half the time it took to get to the first one.</p><p>And overall, the products is growing, but it's really the NFL season  starting that's making a take-off, and you know, we've had some days where  we were processing hundred thousand-plus bets in a day.</p><p>SY:  What about any new products and innovation? Did you introduce anything  new going into the NFL season this year?</p><p>ROBINS:  Well, our focus this year is to make sure that we have a product  that everybody thought was the best in market. </p><p>[15:55:00]  We've been working for about a year on it, we actually -- you  know, no pun intended, we made a bet that the Supreme Court was going to  rule away, they did and started investing back in June of 2017, so we are  well-prepared and I inc. the product we brought to the market, it has a lot  of features that, maybe over in Europe and more mature markets are more  common place but are pretty new and pretty exciting for bettors in the U.S.</p><p>Who having being exposed to legal markets really ever, and you know, in  Nevada, even I think the online and mobile market isn't nearly as advanced  as is in Europe.  So it's an exciting time.</p><p>SY:  Do you see any hurdles? Are you making a bet that this is going to be  legalized throughout the land in the U.S. and what does the future for the  company look like?</p><p>ROBINS:  Well, the good thing for us is we still have a very exciting and  growing fantasy sports business.  And I mean, this is sort of like, you  know, a bonus on top and obviously we're hopeful and will be, you know,  doing our best to try to get as many laws passed and sensible regulations  in place as possible that allows for more states to do sports betting.</p><p>But from our perspective, there's really no rush, we continue to have a lot  of growth in our daily fantasy sports business and we think a lot of rooms  left to innovate there, and obviously we'd like to see sports betting go,  but you know, I think overtime it's inevitable.  So it's really more  question of when, not if, and we'll be patient and hopefully it will happen  sooner rather than later.</p><p>SY:  All right, Jason Robins; CEO of DraftKings, pleasure to have you on,  thank you. </p><p>ROBINS:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>SY:  We'll have a final check on the markets as we approach the closing  bell in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Time for our final check of the markets.  The Dow is holding on to its  gains in the final moments of trading as you can see here.  But shares of  that cannabis company Tilray, see sign wildly, they have swung between  gains of 93 percent and 9 percent in the last hour. </p><p>They're up about 40 percent as you can see and at the moment.  Tech stocks  were among the biggest losers on the Dow, Microsoft and Cisco both  finishing near the bottom of the pile.  Financial shares were the big  winners with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan each up around 3 percent.</p><p>And that's it for QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'm Stephanie Sy, the closing bell  is ringing on Wall Street, it happened to be ringing and the CEO of Hertz  celebrating its 100th anniversary. </p><p>(BELL RINGING) </p><p>And she is one of the few women, Kathryn Marinello is, who heads a Fortune  500 company.  That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, \"THE LEAD\" is next. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED.

It is Wednesday, September the 19th. Here's what's driving the day's stock markets. Shrugging off the trade war. They could close at record highs this hour. Tech shares are lagging though as the EU looks into Amazon's data use; and yet, there's nothing but green in the cannabis sector as weed stocks just can't stop growing. I'm Stephanie Sy. This is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, the EU opens up a new front in its war with the US tech giants after dealing major blows to both Apple and Google. EU Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager is adding Amazon to her antitrust hit list. Shares in Amazon are falling at this hour, down 26 points. Brussels says its investigating whether the company uses data from smaller third party sellers to gain an edge over its competitors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a press conference earlier, Vestager explained the case against Amazon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EU COMPETITION COMMISSIONER: The question here is about the data, because if you as Amazon gets the data from smaller merchants that you host, which can be, of course, completely legitimate because you can improve your service to these smaller merchants, well, do you then also use these data to do your own calculations as what is the new big thing, what is it that people want, what kind of offers do they like to receive, what makes them buy things?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: This is just the latest example of the European Union's crusade to rein in Amazon and its Silicon Valley rivals. Last year Amazon was ordered to pay almost $300 million in unpaid taxes after the EU Commission found it benefited from an illegal arrangement with Luxembourg.</p><p>In July, Google was hit with a record $5 billion fine for breaking antitrust laws with its Android operating system. Facebook was fined $122 million for misleading European officials about its takeover of messaging service WhatsApp and just this week, Apple ponied up $14 billion in unpaid taxes to Ireland after the EU complained.</p><p>Scott Galloway is a professor of marketing at NYU Stern, and an author of \"The Four\" which is about these big tech companies. Scott, it's a pleasure to have you with us. Let's start with this new probe. It's Amazon - how significant is the investigation and what does it portend?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN: So, it's another point in a line that is essentially showing that the war against big tech will breakout where all the major conflicts of the 20th Century broke out, and it's going to break out in continental Europe.</p><p>There was more action in any given quarter in the last two years against big tech in Europe than there is in the US. So this is just again another data point showing that, quite frankly, the EU is fed up with American big tech.</p><p>SY: The World War II analogy is ...</p><p>GALLOWAY: It's too much.</p><p>SY: Yes, maybe a little hyperbolic, but today Amazon did become the third largest digital advertiser. I mean, still way behind Facebook and Google and yet that targeted advertising is largely dependent on data, so how much of a threat to its advertising business is a potential probe into where it gets its data?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, you see, you bring up a great point. So Amazon - Morgan Stanley predicted that Amazon would be $4.5 billion in advertising this year. Our analysis shows they are going to do over $11 billion, or put it another way, Amazon might do as much in advertising this year as Twitter, SnapChat and Instagram combined. This is Amazon.</p><p>Amazon in two years may be one of the five largest media companies in the world and this is what happens when you have an invasive species unlike any other company in history can grow to become the most valuable company in the world, which it will be in the next 60 days without ever having to achieve meaningful profitability, meaning, they can reinvest 100 cents on the dollar back in any business.</p><p>It is almost impossible to compete with Amazon. I personally don't believe these fines. I think they're a gnat on the windshield of a tractor-trailer truck. When Google got fined $5 billion, that day was announced, the stock went up.</p><p>SY: That is the question. How to deal with the outsized power of these tech companies? Now, you bring up the fact that they're becoming a media company and of course, we had AT&amp;T/Time Warner merger which included CNN and part of what the judge said in his ruling was looking at the outsized power of these companies in the digital advertising space, so you see that response.</p><p>[15:05:09]</p><p>SY: But is regulation the right strategy? Are fines the right strategy? Is any of that going to make a difference when you consider how large the market capitalization of these four or five companies are?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So when you have a company like Google at $100 billion in cash and you're fined 5billion, what you're effectively telling Google to do is to continue to break the law. If you had a parking meter in front of your house that costs $100.00 an hour, but the ticket was $0.25, you would continue to break the law and that's what we've been telling these companies to do. With fines, it might sound large in dollar terms, but in terms of impact, aren't that large.</p><p>You ask what we should do? I believe regulation has unintended consequences. I think GDPR has actually emboldened and strengthened these companies' position. I believe that the future to oxygenate the marketplace is to break these guys up. I think Antitrust action is the way to go.</p><p>SY: Do you think there is a real risk of that now? I know that the US Attorney General Jeff Sessions is having a meeting with states Attorneys General next week to discuss this very topic. We're starting to hear that word antitrust. We're even starting to hear the word \"monopoly\" associated with some of these companies. Is that a growing regulatory risk for these mega tech companies? Could you actually see them getting broken up?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I used to think there was no way because Amazon has 88 full-time lobbyists in DC. We in the US, I would suffer a little bit from what I call this gross idolatry of innovators and billionaires. We see them as our heroes. But I do think there is a movement afoot.</p><p>Now, whether it happens out of DC, I would say most likely no. I think the pushback is going to come out of Brussels and possibly a red state where an Attorney General in that state sees that the brightest blue line path to the governor's mansion is to make an argument against these tech companies. And quite frankly, probably haven't been good.</p><p>Have they been good for California? Yes. New York? Yes. Has it been good for Kansas? What's happened to the ad agencies, the retailers, the businesses in those states? I think a lot of these red states have decided, \"You know what? Big tech, we've been net losers here.\" So I don't think it is going to come out of DC. It might. The DOJ should absolutely do its job. They're called to restraint the acquisition of this company was ridiculous in comparison to the power of these other companies.</p><p>So I actually believe, there is a nonzero probability now that the DOJ or the FTC or state AG might go after these companies and accuse them of anticompetitive behavior and propose antitrust and breaking up a business solution.</p><p>SY: It's an interesting paradox because you have Amazon yet to announce the second location for its headquarters and you have, you know, local mayors and governors courting Amazon at the same time you see it coming under increasing potential antitrust scrutiny and other bad headlines following it as well.</p><p>Do you see public opinion changing at all toward the power of these big tech companies while at the same time we're also dependent on them?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Oh, the worm is absolutely turned. Two years ago, the only argument was most who was more Christ-like are going to be the next president among those CEOs. But really the weaponization of the Facebook platform by the GRU of the Russian government changed everything. And now comes ...</p><p>SY: The analytical ...</p><p>GALLOWAY: ... citizens are starting to feel a lot more wary about these storms, but you brought up an interesting point. The competition to be the host of the next HQ and regulation are linked, Stephanie, because the next headquarters for Amazon will be Washington, DC, the metro area and the reason why - and it was always going to be DC is one, the Bezos have a home there and a CEO always gets to pick where the company's second headquarters are going to be and so the only thing standing in between Amazon's valuation of $1 trillion and $2 trillion is regulation and no one is going to regulate the individual that throws out the first pitch at the 2019 opening game of the Washington nationals which will be Jeff Bezos.</p><p>This competition was a ruse to transfer wealth from fire departments and school departments to the shareholders of Amazon. It was always going to be DC. This has been a terrible abuse of the Commonwealth.</p><p>SY: And how many lobbyists does Amazon have in DC right now?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Last check, 88 full-time lobbyists in DC.</p><p>SY: Scott Galloway. We're going to see if you're right on that.</p><p>GALLOWAY: We'll see, right? It's going to be embarrassing if they announce to pick Indianapolis this afternoon.</p><p>SY: Well, DC could certainly use the jobs. Scott, thank you so much.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thank you.</p><p>SY: Let's turn to Europe and the massive money laundering case that's shaking the financial world. The CEO of Danske Bank is out. A new report from the firm details its employees' failure to conduct basic due diligence on customers and managers' failure to heed warning signs.</p><p>The tentacles of the investigation and the alleged wrongdoing spreading. Regulators in the United States, Denmark and Estonia are all probing Danske Bank's operations and the probes center on the bank's tiny subsidiary in Estonia. Lax controls there allowed for more than $230 billion, they came from thousands of suspicious customers outside Estonia and that dollar amount is nearly twice what was previously reported. The bank is alleged to have become a conduit for money coming from Russia and former Soviet states.</p><p>[15:10:12]</p><p>SYL The allegations are linked with fraud cases exposed by Bill Browder and his former lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky who was murdered in a Russian prison. Bill Browder himself was kicked out of Russia. He has since filed several criminal complaints over Danske Bank's behavior. Bill is the CEO Hermitage Capital Management, and author of \"Red Notice,\" which is all about his experience in Russia and he joins me now from London.</p><p>Bill, it's great to have you with us with all these developments happening. First of all, describe for our viewers, if you will, what your interest is in this investigation and why you have filed or planning to file a criminal complaint against Danske bank in Denmark? What are you accusing the bank of?</p><p>BILL BROWDER, CEO, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Well, so it all comes back to the murder of my lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. Sergei Magnitsky was a Russian lawyer who worked for me in Russia. He uncovered $230 million government corruption scheme. He exposed it and in retaliation, he was arrested, tortured and killed eight and a half years ago at the age of 37 leaving a wife and two children.</p><p>I've been on a mission to get justice for Sergei Magnitsky which has led me to look for who got the benefit of the $230 million crime that he exposed and was killed over. We've been investigating it, my team and I, for the last eight and a half years, and we've discovered that a lot of that money flowed to Danske Bank's Estonian branch. And my interest in this whole story is that I don't want anybody who is involved in the laundering of the funds that killed Sergei Magnitsky to get away with it and so, I and my team have filed criminal complaints in Denmark, in Estonia which has led to the opening of a criminal case, and the criminal complaints that we filed has metastasized into this big discovery, and now, we are effectively facing the largest money laundering scandal in the history of Europe through Danske Bank.</p><p>SY: So it is still a question exactly how much of those funds that went through Estonia were considered suspicious transactions. I know that you have said it is $8.3 billion. Bill, what proof do you have of that and do you have evidence trying that back to specific individuals and entities in Russia that you've been looking at related to the death of Mr. Magnitsky?</p><p>BROWDER: Yes, so in addition to the criminal complaints we filed in Estonia and in Denmark, we filed criminal complaints in about 26 countries and there are now 15 live money laundering investigations connected to the murder of Sergei Magnitsky in the money laundering of that case, and from those criminal investigations, and particularly one in France, we've been able to get documents from a subset, not the whole account, but a subset of the Danske Bank transactions and from that subset, we've determined that $8.8 billion of suspicious transactions went through Danske Bank and it went through Danske Bank on its way to other countries including the United Kingdom where I am right now, France, Germany, Spain and other places.</p><p>And as a result of those transfers, there are cases open to those countries looking into the purchases of houses, of chartering of yachts, private planes, et cetera.</p><p>SY: What else do you want to know with regard to Danske's Estonia branch's role in all of this and do you believe that this was just a lack of due diligence and understanding who their clients were and where the money was coming from or are you alleging further malfeasance?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, in the report that came out today from Danske Bank itself, from its own internal lawyers showed that in 2007, Danske Bank was warned by the Russian Central Bank that money going through this Estonian subsidiary was from the proceeds of crime. And so with this whole - the whole problem started in 2007 or at least became - the bank became aware in 2007, but they carried on for eight years and according to these numbers, $234 billion flowed through the bank after they were made aware that this was bad money coming from Russia.</p><p>So this was not just a failure to do due diligence. There were a lot of people profiting from this and those people didn't want the flows to stop.</p><p>SY: So the CEO, Thomas Borgen has resigned, Bill. What else do you think should happen from here?</p><p>BROWDER: We've asked the Estonian and the Danish prosecutors to investigate the CEO, the people around him and the employees that were responsible for these transfer for - to see what their criminal liability is. I don't know what he knew or what he didn't know, but that's for the law enforcement agencies to determine.</p><p>SY: Bill Browder, thank you so much for joining us with your insights on this case. We'll continue to follow the developments, of course.</p><p>[15:15:16]</p><p>SY: Later in the program, we're going to be talking about another corruption scandal, the 1MDB saga in Malaysia. I'll speak to the authors of a new book about the investor they're calling \"A Modern Gatsby.\" Stocks are surging and investors have reefer madness. We'll explain why one marijuana company's shares are up 50%.</p><p>It's the final hour of trading on Wall Street and the Dow is up 160 points. It is now at its highest level since January. The S&amp;P 500 is two-tenths of one percent away from its record high and that's thanks to a mix of relief about the trade war and rising treasury yields which are lifting financial shares.</p><p>The chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs says stock market returns will be slowing down soon. Peter Oppenheimer spoke to Richard at the end of last week and says things can't stay like this forever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER OPPENHEIMER, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Within equities a really important driver of that bull market has been technology and why we're still optimistic about technology, we don't really see the margins in that sector rising in the way that they have, so with the absence of that being a stronger driver than we've seen in the past and without lower interest rates pushing valuations yet higher still, we're likely to see relatively low profit growth and lower returns overall.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: In that case, where do you go? What does one do? Anybody watching tonight, he's got this top chap here who's had global strategist of equities, this man must know what the strategy should be for the next year or so, what does an ordinary investor do faced with the information that we are putting before them tonight?</p><p>OPPENHEIMER: I think one thing to say is that having some kind of balance and diversified approach always makes sense. Cash rates, interest rates have picked up particularly in the US and it makes some sense to have some money in cash to counter balance perhaps money in stock markets as an example, but the main thing that this is really saying is one should be prepared for a time when the returns available in financial assets, including stock markets are just lower than we've enjoyed in recent years.</p><p>[15:20:08]</p><p>OPPENHEIMER: Within stock markets, there will be tactical opportunities, rebound we think is plausible, for example, in emerging markets where we've seen a big selloff recently. We think good quality companies that are reinvesting for future growth or companies that are restructuring and generating good cash flows and decent dividend yields all make sense as well. And I think it is prudent to expect that just buying and holding indices, equity markets overall is likely to generate lower returns than people have been used to in the period of the last few years where valuations have gone up a lot on the back of falling interest rates and the liquidity boost of quantitative easing which is beginning to come to an end.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: Growing marijuana plants takes light, water and nutrients. Growing marijuana stocks takes an approval from the Federal government and a lot of optimism apparently from investors. Tilray shares are up 45%. They he seesawed wildly in the last ten minutes. Actually, shares were briefly halted moments ago in fact due to the extreme volatility.</p><p>Today's surge though puts Tilray's market cap above $20 billion and that makes Tilray the most valuable marijuana company with a market cap on par with American Airlines and Twitter. On Tuesday, Tilray revealed that the US Federal government will allow it to import cannabis for a clinical trial in California. It's a small step toward the mass legalization that Tilray CEO told us is the key to growth.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRENDAN KENNEDY, CEO, TILRAY: We're seeing tremendous growth country after country is legalizing. We also see Canada will be the first G7 nation to allow adult use sales. The first sale will take place in October this year, October 17th, and so we're very optimistic about our growth opportunities this year as well as next year with Canada being the first adult use opportunity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: Alan Valdes knows all about marijuana stocks. He's the chairman of a Cannabis company, Diego Pellicer and a senior partner at Silver Bear Capital. Alan, great to see you. Somebody just did the math for me and told me that if you had bought at the IPO price back in July for $1,000.00, you put a $1,000.00 and you'd be a millionaire today.</p><p>ALAN VALDEZ, CHAIRMAN, DIEGO PELLICER: Yes, that's true. That's correct. Cannabis I think is going to have a great year this year and one of the main reasons is, the President has this massive tax cuts here in America. He's got to make up for it somewhere. And in cannabis, it is a unique industry. We know we have clients even though we haven't been legally able to market in many states. Nothing's open. It's not legal. But we know there are tons of customers out there.</p><p>So the minute this goes legal, and we think this administration will legalize it because they need the tax revenue. It's all about the money. We'll see what happens. That's going to lift all these cannabis stocks in the wings right through the roof.</p><p>SY: Okay, you clearly, Alan, share the fervor for Tilray and the cannabis companies whose stocks we're seeing explode today, but is there a concern that some of this is just speculative fever? Tilray's market cap is in the billions now. Its grown by hundreds of percentage points from its IPO, but it only has $28 million in sales. So do the fundamentals really back up this valuation in your view?</p><p>VALDES: No, not yet, but again, I think if you're getting into marijuana, into cannabis companies like Tilray are good to get involved in Diego, too, but of course, I'm speaking of my own book here. But I think those are great companies to take a look at. I think, in the long run, look what Coke is doing. Coke is thinking about infusing a drink with cannabis oil.</p><p>So, I think in the long run, you're going to see this industry grow and if you get in on the bottom floor, like some of these stocks are, it is a good place to begin. Yes, the valuations are a little out of whack, of course, but again in the long run, I think, it's a good place to be.</p><p>SY: I think it's interesting that you believe the Trump administration is going to be for Federal legalization when we've heard the Attorney General Jeff Sessions being really in the reverse of that and wanting to - earlier in the administration at least crack down on some of the states that had gone for legalization. Do you think that because Jeff Sessions seems to be not on President Trump's good side right now that actually bodes well for the marijuana industry?</p><p>VALDES: No question about it. I mean, he's been a thorn in our side, to be honest with you. But again, I think at the end of the day, Trump being a businessman is going to have to get tax revenue somewhere and this is a great - California alone, over $1 billion in tax revenue once that goes legal later on this year. So, I think overall, it's going to be a great year for cannabis and now's the time to get in.</p><p>SY: All right. Thank you, Alan Valdes. Good to see you.</p><p>VALDES: Thanks. Have a great day.</p><p>SY: You too.</p><p>[15:25:16]</p><p>SY: European investors seem unfazed by the potential fallout from the US- China trade war. It was a solid day of gains across the continent. In fact, in London, mining stocks helped lift the FTSE. Investors may be on move, but the ahead of Daimler Trucks admits he's very worried about the current tariff battle.</p><p>Martin Daum says there are no winners in a trade war and he told our Anna Stewart that consumers will pay the price.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>MARTIN DAUM, HEAD OF DAIMLER TRUCKS: I mean, I'm really worried because we are truly a global company with a big footprint in nearly every major economy employing everywhere thousands of people in each and every country, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in each and every country and we depend on long-term stability in the globe and the free exchange of ideas, people, goods. We don't invest in each and every country for each and every part. We ship parts back and forth around the globe for the benefits of all economies. And therefore, we are concerned.</p><p>The first fallout, at least, a significant increase in aluminum and we produce aluminum crafts in the United States. So, US trucks got more expensive because of that tariff. I don't see any much sense on any trade war because at the end of the trade war, nobody wins. There will be no winner. There will be potentially losers and big losers and we want win- win situations for everyone.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: I think that the tariffs on aluminum and steel have increased you costs, are you passing that cost on to the consumer or are you having to absorb that?</p><p>DAUM: I mean, for 2018, we have to absorb it because we are basically sold out for the years so you can't increase pricing in mid-year, but in the next year, we will pass it on and I think, at least that our competitors are seeing the same increase in raw material cost, so the general, the pricing of trucks will go up. The prices of trucks go up, the prices of - the cost of transportation goes up and that will have then the prices on the shelves for the consumers ultimately and it is a very good example of how trade wars ultimately harm the consumer in each and every country the most.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SY: Corruption allegations are flying, a luxury yacht is seized and investigators are keen to find billions of dollars that seemed to have disappeared.

Brussels claims the company may be unfairly gleaning information from smaller retailers to boost its own sales and predict new trends. Shares on Amazon are falling on the news.</p><p>A spectacular fall from grace for the man who once run Malaysia's government. Former Prime Minister Najib Razak was arrested earlier today in a corruption scandal. Billions of dollars and state money have gone missing from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad or 1MDB fund which Razak created.</p><p>Investigators say more than $600 million from that fund found its way into his personal bank account. Najib had previously been charged with multiple counts of corruption and money laundering over the scandal. He denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>And the 1MDB scandal continues to shock and captivate Malaysia. A new book tells the story of one man at the center of the scandal Jho Low has been described as a modern-day gatsby. Here he is on the right there with Alicia Keys, here he is again with the super model Gigi Hadid and here's his yacht in the Cayman Islands where the quarter of a billion dollars are now in the hands of authorities.</p><p>The book is called \"Billion Dollar Whale\", the author is Tom Wright and Bradley Hope join me now. Guys, this book is juicy. And I was reading a description of an extravagant birthday party that this guy Jho Low threw for himself in Vegas in the midst of the financial crisis.</p><p>A long list of rappers and Hollywood actors, it was like reading a chapter from \"Crazy Rich Asians\".</p><p>TOM WRIGHT, AUTHOR: Yes, exactly --</p><p>SY: Except this is real and he allegedly stole all this money?</p><p>WRIGHT: He did, I mean, we -- that's the prologue of our book you're referring to, his 2012 birthday party which Robin Lee described as possibly the biggest private party that anyone has ever thrown. But the money, he had taken it from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund that he run from behind the scenes.</p><p>SY: So Bradley, $6 billion is what was allegedly funding his lifestyle. How did he get there? Was this an elaborate scheme or a simple theft?</p><p>BRADLEY HOPE, AUTHOR: Well, he had the -- working with the Malaysian Prime Minister, he helped create his own sovereign wealth fund which he run from behind the scenes, and with the help of Goldman Sachs, they buried all this money, and he arranged all these deals where the money was kind of siphoned into the side.</p><p>And that's where billions of dollars he basically took control of, and used to fund this crazy lifestyle to do big deals, he was almost about to buy Arriba from Adidas in 2015, that got scuppered because the FBI started investigating him. So it's -- that's how he pulled it off.</p><p>[15:35:00] SY: What is just remarkable is the amount of famous people that you name in this book. Everyone from rap stars to Leonardo DiCaprio, he allegedly helped fund the film \"Wolf of Wall Street\", so this was a midst of a financial crisis, how did he get away with this for so long with nobody noticing or asking who this guy was?</p><p>WRIGHT: I think, well, billion dollar well shows is that if you've got enough money, you can buy you way into any place in the world. I mean, he got to Leonardo DiCaprio by offering $400 million in some financing, she dated Miranda Kerr, you know, she had made $7 million a year before she met Jho Low.</p><p>But you know, that's not enough alone for super yachts or to throw, you know, champagne-drenched parties. So Jho Low was really the guy who knew how to use money to enjoy kinds of crazy high society.</p><p>SY: Yes, you talk a little bit about the Golden Sachs nexus. And there's one person that you name in particular who had a relationship with Jho Low. What's his situation right now?</p><p>HOPE: Yes, one of the key bankers from Goldman Sachs is called Tim Leissner, he was married to Kimora Lee Simmons. He was the banker that kind of helped set up all of the deals for this 1MDB fund and earned Goldman Sachs a huge profit, 600 million or so on deals that normally would have earned Goldman Sachs maybe a million dollars or so or less.</p><p>So he is now in -- the last we've heard from them, he was in clean talks with the U.S. government or the Department of Justice to talk about what he knows about this case and what Goldman Sachs knew and exactly that's there all the way up to the top.</p><p>SY: So there continues to be a potential for illegal exposure for Goldman --</p><p>WRIGHT: For Goldman, yes, well, I mean, there's two things here. One is the preliminary investigation with his buddy he was referring to and Tim Leissner, some previous talks that he'll probably admit to some kind of wrongdoing. And there's also of course -- there could be something to a hefty fine under the bank's Secrecy Act.</p><p>Because there were huge red flags in this that they were raising money for this sovereign wealth fund that Jho Low ran, including a request to put $3 billion into his Swiss bank account which was -- which highly unusual. Goldman's own lawyers on the deal, the plaintiffs(ph) said that perhaps they shouldn't do it and they went ahead and did it anyway.</p><p>So those are the kind of things regulators are going to be looking at.</p><p>SY: All right, where is Jho Low now, we know that the former Prime Minister of Malaysia has been arrested, there's a new regime, and I believe there's an arrest warrant now for him. What do we know about his whereabouts?</p><p>HOPE: The best we know is that he's in China, and he has some measure of protection from the Chinese government. He -- we reported in the Wall Street Journal that he's told people that he has worked with Chinese intelligence. And so far, sort of the subjects are some tensed discussions between the two countries, Malaysia and China say you know, where exactly is Jho Low?</p><p>Are they going to turn him over?</p><p>SY: Does he still have the money?</p><p>HOPE: It appears from all we can see, he still has a lot of money.</p><p>SY: Tom, what do you want people to take away from this book. I mean, I feel like there's a very interesting message that I got from it as far as how wealth works in this world, as far as access is, you know, what do you want people to walk away from?</p><p>WRIGHT: Well, first of all, it's not didactic, I think it's a great true crime thriller, and I want people to enjoy reading it. But also, we have a chapter called \"White-Collar Crime\", very late on, and I think what's important here is that you cannot, you know, conduct white-collar crime and get away with it.</p><p>There should be some repercussions for the banks and for the enablers of Jho Low. It wasn't just a corrupter in Malaysia that did this, he was enabled by, you know, the global financial system.</p><p>SY: Tom Wright and Bradley Hope, good luck with the book, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>HOPE: Thank you.</p><p>SY: Making artificial intelligence more fair.

U.S. officials saying nearly 3.5 million poultry birds were lost in the storm, but barreled through parts of the southeastern U.S. a few days ago.</p><p>President Donald Trump is praising the recovery effort, he met with emergency workers earlier today during a visit to the flood zone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The job you've done has been --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes --</p><p>TRUMP: Incredible. They're talking about it all over the world and we want to keep it going that way because some of the hard work is now. We've gone through a very dangerous work and still dangerous, but some of the hard work is taking place right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: The death toll from Florence is now 36. The storm broken into -- remnants has moved that of the area leaving behind massive destruction and new threats from flooding. Moody's estimates the damage could top $22 billion. Belfor which specializes in restoration and repair says it had hundreds of people on the ground during the hurricane.</p><p>CEO Sheldon Yellen echoed Mr. Trump's praise for the rescuers when he spoke to my colleague Bianna Golodryga.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHELDON YELLEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BELFOR: I think the authorities have done an amazing job. The communication has been very good on the ground level. The utility crews that are out there are in huge numbers. I think the preparation for this storm has been terrific. I really do.</p><p>And I think that for the most part, people are listening to the instructions that are being given. Every once in a while, you hear of a story that there has to be in the media rescue attempt to -- and what we're hearing back and what our own people on the ground are seeing is that these rescues are being handled -- they're being handled in a terrific way.</p><p>And I really do think the authorities have done a terrific job in this scenario. I really do.</p><p>BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN: And lastly, you know, people focus on costs and not human costs, but financial costs at the end, right? That's not the primary issue of concern, but it is a big issue nonetheless. How given that we're going to be seeing more and more of these types of storms and their ramifications.</p><p>How can you better prepare? How can we better prepare ourselves to not end up with such a huge financial costs when it comes to the clean up and rebuilding efforts.</p><p>YELLEN: Well, I think again, you know, when you talk about costs, there's so many different shading factors, but one of the issues that all property owners are facing is coverage issues. So if you have coverage for wind- driven rain on a normal (INAUDIBLE) policy, that's one type of coverage.</p><p>But a lot of people in flood zones don't have flood coverage. People need to be aware of this in advance for these storms, and flood coverage is available through the private sector and or through national flood programs.</p><p>So the coverage is available and these insurance companies are very well capable of insuring the properties and the reinsurance that's laid off is all in place. But people have to take these measures in advance under consideration.</p><p>For those people that are under insured, there are federal programs for loans, that's what FEMA administers. But the real efforts that go into restoring a community is a private insurance, federal assistance, FEMA's assistance and the overall good of the communities pulling together because I've seen over 34 years of doing this.</p><p>[15:45:00] The enormous positive effect of communities pulling together, neighbor helping neighbor, person helping person, one at a time all contribute to pulling these communities back to where they need to be.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: IBM has launched a new tool, it wants to help AI users spot hidden biases in algorithms. Dario Gil is IBM's vice president of AI, he joins me now in the C-suite. Dario, this is such an interesting topic to me, especially because AI seems to be pervasive in our workplace, in our lives right now.</p><p>Can you start by just explaining what do you mean when you say AI bias?</p><p>DARIO GIL, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, IBM RESEARCH &amp; VICE PRESIDENT OF AI: AI bias, yes, so one of the reasons why we're hearing about AI so much is because the recent advances that we have made with, you know, metal works, make prediction accuracy, you know, very good.</p><p>The problem is it's a black box. So when we go and we have a data set that we give examples to these known network to train it, let's say we're going to do our credit scoring to assign whether somebody should get a mortgage or not.</p><p>So we give past examples, and I give us a prediction. But you know, in the training of the example, did somebody use bias data? And therefore, for example, if we use historical data from past approvals. And maybe in the past, we weren't given credit or approvals to women as an example.</p><p>SY: Or to minorities.</p><p>GIL: Or to minorities. Well, if we use naively sort of pass data to just alternative example, we're going to create a system that is bias. So what we have released in our trust and transparency toolbox is the ability to be able to check for your data that you use to train, the mission learning models and see if it's bias and also for the models themselves.</p><p>And also to provide expendability(ph). Why did he make that prediction? Give me some explanation for how it works?</p><p>SY: Is it easy to understand, you know, you talk about the black box and I want to get there. You know, there's a belief that, I think that there are not a lot of AI experts that understand how algorithms, how machine- learning, how all of that stuff works.</p><p>But there's an understanding that programmers behind it use data that might be bias and the programmers themselves might be bias. So how understandable I guess is this toolkit for these companies to be able to really understand what's going into the decisions that they're allowing AI to potentially make?</p><p>GIL: That's right, and that's the major advance of the new service we've released on the IBM cloud because what you can do is two components of it. One is this bias checking of the data itself and the models. The second component, what you alluded to is explain it to me in a way I can understand it.</p><p>Not by telling me, oh, he has a billion weight, here are some numbers, and you're like what does this mean?</p><p>SY: Yes --</p><p>GIL: Give me --</p><p>SY: And that keeps it a black box.</p><p>GIL: That keeps it as a black box, exactly right. So this is about be able to give me an explanation with language that I can just read of saying, oh, you know, this prediction is using these variables more, you know, these class of variables and so on.</p><p>And it gives you an understanding for which variables are more important, the consequences of using those variables and the prediction that's in the credit scoring or on hiring in HR or on medical recommendation. So that human and the whole person we all are to understand why is it behaving the way it does, and that's a major advance.</p><p>SY: And obviously, your company hopes that what this leads to is less of a fear of the technology, more mass deployment of AI and I know IBM is active in that. On that point, I want to ask you a broader question about competition in the AI sphere.</p><p>I know that China is also very advanced when it comes to artificial intelligence technology. How far ahead is it when it comes to a China-U.S. comparison?</p><p>GIL: Well, AI, I mean, is arguably the most important technology in the world today. So it's not surprising that at every level, whether you're talking about the educational level and students wanting to learn about AI at the business level, using AI and creating AI for competitive advantage and at the national level, right?</p><p>There's national strategies to advance AI, and we're seeing that. So China is an exemplar of making those investments --</p><p>SY: A national strategy --</p><p>GIL: A national strategy, but we're seeing that, you know, broadly, not just in China, of course in the United States. If you look at United States or Canada are major power houses in terms of AI innovation and advances and so on. But it's undoubtedly the case that China has made it, that's one of their top strategic priorities.</p><p>SY: And because it's made it a priority, has it advanced technologically further than the U.S. for example?</p><p>GIL: Well, what I would say is that we're seeing the application of it, it's a very broad use, but we're also seeing that in the United States. And I would say at the forefronts of advances in AI, the United States also remains extraordinarily competitive, right, in making many of the seminal advances.</p><p>[15:50:00] You know, things are happening in China as well. But I would not say that we're in a situation where we're not at the forefront of leading in AI.</p><p>SY: Dario Gil; Vice President of AI at IBM, such an interesting topic, thank you so much for coming in.</p><p>GIL: Thank you for having me here.</p><p>SY: Coming up, Supreme Court ruling sparks a sports-betting gold rush in the U.S., I'll ask the CEO of DraftKings, how he's cashing in.</p><p>SY: More parts of the United States are looking to get on board the sports betting bandwagon. Lawmakers in Washington D.C. have introduced a bill that will let people bet on games. While it's legal in many countries around the world, it's only allowed in a handful of U.S. states.</p><p>Jason Robins is the CEO of DraftKings; a site for betting and fantasy sports. Jason, thank you so much for being with us. Since the Supreme Court ruling that lifted the ban on sports betting, you've opened up an actual sports betting establishment in New Jersey.</p><p>So talk about its popularity and its profits.</p><p>JASON ROBINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DRAFTKINGS: Well, we were the first to get a mobile app in market, and that launched on August 1st, so it's still very early. But I can tell you that every number we thought when we projected were shattering. It's just unbelievable how much demand and how much excitement there is over sports betting.</p><p>And you know, a lot of people I think are enjoying -- it's a good time of year, so a lot of people enjoying college sports, you know, the NFL being the -- you know, those are the two most popular betting sports in America and both just started, I think the timing couldn't have been better.</p><p>SY: Yes, and I read that it took 38 days to reach 1 million sports bets since you launched the online sports book in New Jersey on August 1st. As you mentioned, the NFL season has gotten underway, you usually see a spike in bets of course during American football season. Are you happy so far with the metrics you're seeing?</p><p>ROBINS: The growth since NFL started has been unbelievable. So you just mentioned, it took us 38 days to get to our millionth bet. About 15 days later, this Sunday, we are going to hit our 2 millionth bet. So in less than half the time it took to get to the first one.</p><p>And overall, the products is growing, but it's really the NFL season starting that's making a take-off, and you know, we've had some days where we were processing hundred thousand-plus bets in a day.</p><p>SY: What about any new products and innovation? Did you introduce anything new going into the NFL season this year?</p><p>ROBINS: Well, our focus this year is to make sure that we have a product that everybody thought was the best in market.</p><p>[15:55:00] We've been working for about a year on it, we actually -- you know, no pun intended, we made a bet that the Supreme Court was going to rule away, they did and started investing back in June of 2017, so we are well-prepared and I inc. the product we brought to the market, it has a lot of features that, maybe over in Europe and more mature markets are more common place but are pretty new and pretty exciting for bettors in the U.S.</p><p>Who having being exposed to legal markets really ever, and you know, in Nevada, even I think the online and mobile market isn't nearly as advanced as is in Europe. So it's an exciting time.</p><p>SY: Do you see any hurdles? Are you making a bet that this is going to be legalized throughout the land in the U.S. and what does the future for the company look like?</p><p>ROBINS: Well, the good thing for us is we still have a very exciting and growing fantasy sports business. And I mean, this is sort of like, you know, a bonus on top and obviously we're hopeful and will be, you know, doing our best to try to get as many laws passed and sensible regulations in place as possible that allows for more states to do sports betting.</p><p>But from our perspective, there's really no rush, we continue to have a lot of growth in our daily fantasy sports business and we think a lot of rooms left to innovate there, and obviously we'd like to see sports betting go, but you know, I think overtime it's inevitable. So it's really more question of when, not if, and we'll be patient and hopefully it will happen sooner rather than later.</p><p>SY: All right, Jason Robins; CEO of DraftKings, pleasure to have you on, thank you.</p><p>ROBINS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>SY: We'll have a final check on the markets as we approach the closing bell in just a moment.</p><p>SY: Time for our final check of the markets. The Dow is holding on to its gains in the final moments of trading as you can see here. But shares of that cannabis company Tilray, see sign wildly, they have swung between gains of 93 percent and 9 percent in the last hour.</p><p>They're up about 40 percent as you can see and at the moment.

The Cupertino, California-based company told officials in Northern Virginia that it wantsspace[2] big enough to accommodate about 20,000 employees, according to The Washington Post[3]. Reportedly, Apple told economic development officials in Northern Virginia that it needs about four million square feet of space to accommodate 20,000 employees. </p><p>Amazon is also eyeing similar locations for its new campus[4]. The officials have supposedly proposed several new sites in Crystal City, privately owned Loudoun County land near the Center for Innovation technology and the Scotts Run development in Tysons for the new Apple campus. Both Crystal City and the Loudoun land have been proposed to Amazon as well. Both the companies are expected to finalize a site sometime this year. Northern Virginia would benefit immensely if both the companies choose it for their centers. However, a separate report from Triangle Business Journal claims that the iPhone maker is considering Research Triangle Park in North Carolina for the new Apple campus. Spread across 22 million square feet, the research park has become an attractive site for tech companies and has emerged as North Carolina's technology hub due to its proximity with NC State, the University of North Carolina and Duke University. According to WRAL News, Apple's estimated investment in the new campus at NC would be somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion upon completion. As well, the average salary for Apple employees in the area which would house the research and development positions, would be approximately $130,000. Also, there are reports that the transfer of the employees to the Research Triangle Park campus would be in stages. Initially, the company would lease the office space for approximately 1,000 employees in Cary, and at the same time would also start construction on the 300 acres of land. Apple CEO Tim Cook is quite familiar with the area as he earned his MBA degree from Duke University in 1988. Reportedly Cook met with NC Governor Roy Cooper recently, and now officials are drafting an incentive package that would include thirty years of county property tax abatements and adjustments to employee withholding taxes. Earlier this year, Apple already came out clear that it would spend $30 billion on new facilities and hire 20,000 employees in the U.S. over the next five years. Unlike Amazon, Apple has kept much of its plans for the new campus under wraps. The D.C. region is an attractive destination for West Coast technology companies, which are seeking a young, highly educated and tech savvy workforce. Further, the region is near to universities and colleges, and more importantly is very near Congress and the Trump administration. 'It is akin to what the defense industry did in the 1990s and early 2000s when it moved headquarters and facilities to be closer in touch with the people who use its product,' said Tom Stringer, a corporate location specialist and managing director at BDO International, according to USAToday. 'Big tech companies, as big and diversified as they have gotten and as many regulatory areas they now fall under, are starting to take the same approach.' In separate news, in the ongoing patent lawsuit[5] between Apple and Samsung, the former now says that the iPhone was the biggest risk that the company took. Apple's Vice President of Marketing, Greg Joswiak, recently testified in the ongoing legal war with Samsung, saying the launch of the iPhone was the game changing moment for Apple. 'We were really risking everything that was making Apple successful at the time,' Joswiak said. 'We were really betting the company.' In the lawsuit, which first started in 2011, Apple accused Samsung of stealing features used in the iPhone and the iPad, while the Korean firm is alleging that Apple infringed upon patented features used in its tablets and phones. In 2012, Samsung was ordered to pay over a billion dollars, but the amount was later reduced to approximately $340 million. Now, the company is appealing the damages in a new case that started on Monday, where Joswiak explained how the iPhone and overall product design has been embedded in the company's DNA. 'That's something that [Apple co-founder] Steve Jobs had created in the DNA of the company,' he added. On Wednesday, Apple shares closed up 0.93% at $188.18.

The president defying his own vice president to set up the summit.</p><p>ROMANS: The nation's leading e-cigarette maker warns against deceptive marketing. Now, a new warning against vaping from the American Medical Association.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Number 34, David Ortiz.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: A huge ovation for Big Papi. David Ortiz back in public for the first time since he was shot back in June.</p><p>He looks and sounds great. Good to see him back.</p><p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Dave Briggs. ROMANS: I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: Good morning.</p><p>ROMANS: It's Tuesday, September 10th, it is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p>And we begin, though, in North Carolina. Critical special elections in North Carolina today that could be a bellwether for 2020.</p><p>The key race is in the state's ninth district held by the GOP for more than 50 years. It has been vacant since a razor-thin vote in 2018. No winner was declared amid allegations of absentee ballot fraud that prompted state officials to call for a new vote.</p><p>President Trump won that district by 12 points, but early voting suggests strong Democratic turnout.</p><p>For context, Democrats represent only four congressional districts won by a larger margin than 12 points.</p><p>BRIGGS: The president tried to rally support for Dan Bishop in North Carolina last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The radical Democrats want to dismantle, demolish and destroy everything that you've gained. And they will do it and it won't take that long.</p><p>Your way of life is under assault by these people. With your support, tomorrow, we take the first steps to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: One possible advantage for Democrat Dan McCready is that Democrats hold an eight-point voter registration in the district, although Republicans continue winning that seat. There's another seat open in the third district, due to the death of long-time congressman Walter Jones. Polls open in 90 minutes, 6:30 a.m.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. The president is defending a decision to set up a secret meeting with the Taliban at Camp David. The talks would have come just days before the anniversary of 9/11. It is the Taliban, of course, who harbored the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The president claims he called off the meeting when he learned last week the group claimed responsibility for killing an American soldier.</p><p>BRIGGS: But the Taliban have already claimed the deaths of at least nine service members in 2019 and are likely responsible for seven others. The president now insisting there is no path forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They're dead. They're dead. As far as I'm concerned, they're dead. They thought they had to kill people in order to put themselves in a little better negotiating position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Sources tell CNN the president overruled national security adviser John Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence, when he decided to set up the meeting with the Taliban. Bolton and his staff did not trust the U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, and thought he gave the Taliban too much leverage in the talks.</p><p>ROMANS: President Trump sealed a partnership with the Scottish airport in 2014, that routinely sent refueling flight crews to his resort in Turnberry. That's according to a report in \"The New York Times.\" But in this tweet on Monday, the president claimed to know nothing about Air Force crews staying at his resort there.</p><p>\"The New York Times\" obtained documents from the Scottish government detailing the Trump administration's deal with Glasgow Prestwick Airport. The report says Mr. Trump played a direct role. But the president claims he doesn't need this kind of arrangement to help his bottom line.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I'm going to give out my financial condition. And you'll be extremely shocked that the numbers are many, many times what you think. I don't need to have somebody take a room overnight at a hotel.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Special financial report. Tax returns could do that trick, too.</p><p>BRIGGS: It wouldn't hurt.</p><p>ROMANS: The arrangement again raises questions about whether Mr. Trump is benefitting financially from his presidency. On Sunday, the Air Force ordered a review of all international layover stays.</p><p>BRIGGS: An effort to clean up after President Trump's false claim that Alabama would be hit by Dorian led to the Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, threatening to fire top staffers at NOAA.</p><p>[05:05:01]</p><p>That's the agency that runs the National Weather Service.</p><p>\"The New York Times\" reports Ross ordered NOAA to disavow a tweet from a regional weather that contradicted the president's claim. When the acting head of NOAA pushed back, Ross told him the agency's political staff would be fired. The commerce spokesman denies the story.</p><p>Now, NOAA's acting chief scientist told colleagues in an e-mail that he is investigating. Craig McLean calls the agency's response and a danger to public health and safety. ROMANS: North Korea said, yesterday, it's ready to restart nuclear talks with the U.S. then, just hours later, test-fired two weapons. After more than a year of refraining from missile tests, Pyongyang has launched 10 since May.</p><p>The Kim Jong-un regime is barred from conducting missile tests under U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p><p>President Trump has played down North Korea's short range ballistic missile tests, calling them, quote, very standard.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday Kim has not broken any commitments to the president but he said the U.S. is disappointed.</p><p>BRIGGS: Concerned that President Trump repeatedly mishandled classified intel led the U.S. to extract one of its highest level covert sources inside the Russian government. CNN was first to report on the successful previously secret mission citing multiple U.S. officials with direct knowledge. The mission was ordered after a May -- this May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office, where the president discussed highly classified intelligence with top Russian officials.</p><p>ROMANS: Sources say the informant was the highest level source the U.S. had inside the Kremlin. The spy had access to Vladimir Putin and could even provide pictures of documents on his desk. One source says there was, quote, no equal alternative inside the Kremlin.</p><p>President Trump said yesterday he knows nothing about reports suggesting he mishandled classified information.</p><p>BRIGGS: Top Democratic candidates for president are teaming up ahead of Thursday's debate to deliver a powerful message on guns.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Gun violence is literally life and death.</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That has become so numbingly common.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have kids going to school wondering if they're going to be physically safe.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Learning how to duck, cover, hide.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For fear there's a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That's wrong. That shouldn't happen in a country like ours.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Candidates are speaking out in support of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords' organization. The candidates have differences on how to combat gun violence but they deliver a unified message in an increasingly hostile primary.</p><p>After mass shootings in Texas and Ohio last month, President Trump instructed the Justice Department to prepare a list for lawmakers. It did not include universal background checks. Sources say some officials including Attorney General William Barr quietly urged the president to consider backing such a measure.</p><p>A new poll shows very broad support for background checks, including 83 percent of Republicans.</p><p>ROMANS: That is good context there.</p><p>All right. Nearly every state now investigating Google over antitrust, marking the latest escalation in regulatory scrutiny of the tech giant. A bipartisan group of attorneys general representing 48 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico launched this investigation. Only California and Alabama have not signed on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN PAXTON (R), TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL: While many consumers believe that the Internet is free, certainly, we know from Google's profits of $117 billion that the Internet is not free. This investigation is not a lawsuit. It's an investigation to determine the facts. And right now, we're looking at advertising. But the facts will lead to where the facts lead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Silicon Valley has faced growing criticism into whether it's just become too big, harming competition and consumers.</p><p>Big tech, a constant target for politicians. Conservatives claim they face discrimination. Liberals claim algorithms elevate fringe voices and conspiracies. The probe will initially focused on Google's advertising, it may expand from there. Regulators around the world have also been critical of Google. You know, the E.U. has fined Google $9 billion in antitrust violations in the past three years. Google declined to comment for us.</p><p>BRIGGS: Time is running out to find survivors in the Bahamas from Hurricane Dorian. Why did one ferry operator ask some people seeking refuge in the U.S. to get off?</p><p>[05:13:54]</p><p>ROMANS: The FDA is warning e-cigarette maker Juul about illegally marketing its product as a safer alternative to cigarettes. The company has been ordered to respond with corrective actions within 15 working days. Juul says it is reviewing the order and will fully cooperate. There has been an alarming rise in cases of severe lung illness linked to vaping. The American Medical Association is now urging everyone to avoid e-cigarettes. A direct warning from the American Medical Association.</p><p>In November, the FDA revealed vaping increased nearly 80 percent among high school students and 50 percent among middle schoolers compared to a year earlier.</p><p>First Lady Melania Trump tweeting she is deeply concerned about the growing epidemic and we need to do all we can to prevent e-cigarettes from leading to nicotine addiction.</p><p>BRIGGS: Desperation growing in the Bahamas as the death toll continues to rise. At least 50 people now confirmed dead. The power company on the devastated island of Abaco calls the situation dire. It says there are no standing electricity poles for 16 miles from Marsh Harbour to Treasure Cay.</p><p>Families of the missing are still holding out hope.</p><p>[05:15:06]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I hope they find him. I hope so. We just have a son. You know, we don't know (INAUDIBLE) yet. I hope they find him. I hope so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Meantime, the ferryboat operator that ordered dozens of Hurricane Dorian evacuees from the Bahamas off of its boat is now apologizing.</p><p>CNN affiliate WSVN posted the video.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All passengers that don't have U.S. visa, please proceed to disembark.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The ferry operator says at the time he was told evacuees needed more travel authorization.</p><p>ROMANS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the ferry operator did not properly coordinate the evacuation ahead of time.</p><p>President Trump even raised concerns gang members were using Dorian's aftermath to gain entry to the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Everybody needs totally proper documentation. Look, the Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas that weren't supposed to be there. I don't want to allow people that weren't supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: There is no proof of that claim. Nearly 5,000 residents have fled the Bahamas in the wake of the violent storm. The prime minister says evacuees will be returned home as homes are rebuilt.</p><p>And you think about proper documentation when you look at smashed homes from miles and miles. Just a real humanitarian crisis.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, not exactly convenient to you at the time.</p><p>Coming up, we'll talk a little sports. Big drama for the Saints back on the field for the first time since that heartbreaking no-call in the NFC title game.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fifty-eight-yard attempt for the win.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Did it have enough?</p><p>Carolyn Manno has the rest of that video in \"The Bleacher Report.\"</p><p>Good to see you, my friend.</p><p>CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.</p><p>[05:22:02]</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. Week one of the NFL came to an end Monday night. Not one but two primetime games, well past our bedtime.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: Some would say they saved the best for last. I would not say that.</p><p>ROMANS: Carolyn Manno is here with \"The Bleacher Report\".</p><p>Hey, Carolyn.</p><p>MANNO: That sounds like an upset Broncos fan, if you ask me.</p><p>BRIGGS: I'm thankful it was a 10:20 Eastern Time kickoff because I would have been angry and not sleep a minute.</p><p>MANNO: Can I just say, it's been a long, long off-season for the Saints.</p><p>BRIGGS: Oh, man.</p><p>MANNO: After getting oh, so close to the Super Bowl last season.</p><p>BRIGGS: They are still feeling that.</p><p>MANNO: That controversial no call. They are still feeling that in that NFC championship game.</p><p>Their fans have not forgotten. Many of them showed up against the Houston Texans in referee jerseys. They were treated to a thriller that went down to the wire. With just 37 seconds left in the game. Houston's Deshaun Watson hitting his new wide receiver Kenny Stills for a 37-yard score to give the Texans a one-point lead.</p><p>But that is plenty of time for Drew Brees and the Saints. The 40- year-old quarterback doing what he does. He gets the Saints in position for the longest kick in Will Lutz's career. And Lutz delivers, drilling the game winning 58-yard field goal as time expires. The Saints begin their quest for a third-straight NFC south title.</p><p>The Raiders opened their last season in Oakland in the second game of the Monday night doubleheader against their division rivals, the Denver Broncos. The silver and black looked ready to put the Antonio Brown drama behind them, with quarterback Derek Carr leading to a statement win, even though A.B. has signed with the Patriots, Carr couldn't escape questions about his one-time teammate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDOE CLIP)</p><p>DERER CARR, OAKLAND RAIDERS' QUARTERBACK: Just get the elephant out of the room. Antonio is no longer with us. We love Antonio. The guys in this locker room, the guys that competed in training camp, all offseason, we grinded, we came together. We're a family. This family is pretty special. I'm glad to be a quarterback part of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MANNO: So, what is Antonio Brown doing, while the Raiders are moving on? He is spending quality time with his quarterback, Tom Brady. The duo spotted with a caption claiming that they are new best friends.</p><p>Brown is Brady's house guest until he is settled in Boston. He makes his debut for the Patriots on Sunday against the Dolphins in Miami.</p><p>The love that Bostonians have for Tom Brady is rivaled by few. But this next man is right up there with him.</p><p>David Ortiz making a surprise appearance at Fenway park last night, throwing out the first pitch against the Yankees. It was Big Papi's first public appearance since being shot in June during a botched assassination attempt. Ortiz seemed to be moving well after spending nearly two months in the hospital.</p><p>Good for fans to see there. BRIGGS: It's funny you said that. Rivaled by few. Having lived there, and you did, too, I would say Big Papi is more popular in Boston than even Tom Brady, because they know him.</p><p>[05:25:05]</p><p>They love him. They hug him.</p><p>MANNO: It's 1 and 1A. He is more approachable and more fan-friendly. That's why the fans went nuts for him at Fenway.</p><p>And Yankees, by the way, too, congratulating him after a tough couple months.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, CC Sabathia seeing him in the hospital.</p><p>MANNO: You bet.</p><p>ROMANS: Nice to see you, Carolyn.</p><p>BRIGGS: Good to see you.</p><p>ROMANS: Thank you, Carolyn Manno.</p><p>The final House race of 2018, in many ways, the first house race of 2020. Are voters in reliably red districts turning on the president? Special elections today will give some big clues.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019091003CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1C-03G1-DXH2-62XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>BOSTON RED SOX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>North Carolina</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Taliban</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Defense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Meetings</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>American Medical Association</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Juul</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Advertising</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Safety</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>David Ortiz</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Boston Red Sox</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sports</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

U.S. and North Korean officials are talking in North Korea to try to get ready for a meeting between <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GEORGE HOWELL, HOST, CNN: Plus, the United States says it can't account for nearly 1500 missing migrant children, and U.S. is saying they're not responsible for the situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHURCH: And fighting Facebook, the lawsuit that could cost the company billions and might affect your privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and of course from all around the world. We are live in Atlanta. I'm Rosemary Church.</p><p>And I'm George Howell. From CNN's world headquarters, Newsroom starts right now.</p><p>And at this hour, a team of U.S. diplomats and officials are in North Korea. Their mission there is to lay the groundwork for the upcoming summit between those two nations.</p><p>CHURCH: And that summit still may or may not happen. Earlier in the week U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>pulled the plug on the meeting over some hostile comments made by North Korean officials.</p><p>HOWELL: But here is the thing. On Saturday, he hinted to reporters that after the surprise meeting between North and South Korea, the leaders there, the summit may be back on. And another clue. A U.S. advanced team has also left for Singapore where the June 12th summit is set to take place if it happens.</p><p>CHURCH: And let's take a look at all of this. We want to bring in Paula Hancocks who joins us from Seoul, South Korea. So Paula, despite <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>cancelling the summit meeting Thursday, it now appears to be back on track for June 12, as originally scheduled. And this U.S. delegation is now in North Korea to plan for that summit. What are you learning about all of this? PAULA HANCOCKS, CORRESPONDENT,CNN:: Well, Rosemary we know about the U.S. delegation that it's headed up by a man called Sung Kim. He is U.S. ambassador to the Philippines at the moment. But he was an ambassador here in South Korea. He was also one of the point people that Washington had when they were negotiating with North Korea in previous years.</p><p>So he has experience of talking to the North Koreans. He knows how difficult and challenging it can be to try and strike a deal with Pyongyang. He was very much involved in six-party talks as well.</p><p>So from that point of view, they do have people who have experience of this before, who are currently in North Korea negotiating with the North Korean side. Now as we understand it, this is going to be more about the substance of the summit itself, more about what will be on the agenda. Clearly denuclearization is going to be the big issue on the agenda.</p><p>But how do they discuss that? What sort of issues does each side have? And is there any chance, I suppose, of these pre-negotiations trying to narrow the gap between the American understanding and the North Korean understanding of what denuclearization means.</p><p>Because usually when you have these kinds of summits between large -- big leaders, you will have months and months of preparation. Months of these kinds of pre-negotiations and once you get to the summit, most of it is already agreed upon. But, of course, this is a very different situation and two very different leaders.</p><p>CHURCH: Yes, most certainly. And of course, there are two issues that threaten to derail this summit going forward. Trust is one of them. And you mentioned the other one, denuclearization, the problem being of course that the two sides do not share the same definition, as you also mentioned. But this is problematic, isn't it? If the two leaders arrive together there in Singapore on June 12th, and that has not been decided?</p><p>HANCOCKS: Well, that's right. And I think this is where these kinds of delegations are coming very useful. That the fact that there is this pre-discussion on what exactly both sides are expecting, because neither side wants to come away from a summit with it having failed of course if the summit even goes ahead.</p><p>But another interesting point as well which we learned over the weekend from the North Korean leader and the South Korean leader meeting for the second time in just a month which is unprecedented was the fact that we understood a little bit more about what <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>is going to be looking for from this summit.</p><p>According to <person><nameText>President Moon Jae-in, </nameText></person>he spoke to the nation on Sunday, he was talking about the guarantees that <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>is looking for. He wants a guarantee for the survival of the regime. So certainly it gives us a bit more of an insight into what he is looking for.</p><p>President Moon also mentioned there would be economic benefits for Mr. Kim. But he said to the North Korean leader, you should sit down with the U.S. president so he can tell you this himself face-to-face.</p><p>We've already heard from Mr. Trump that he has guaranteed <person><nameText>Kim Jong- un's </nameText></person>safety, which raised some eyebrows here, guaranteeing the safety of a dictator. But saying that he will be safe, he will be happy. His country will be rich. So getting more and more insights into what exactly both sides want.</p><p>[03:05:08] CHURCH: Yes. And of course guarantees like that are difficult to give when we think about 10 years into the future and a whole lot of other variables. But talking there with our Paula Hancocks, joins us from Seoul in South Korea where it's just after 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Many thanks, as always.</p><p>HOWELL: And now let's get some perspective on all of this and the possible outcome that is if it happens. We're joined by Tai Wei Lim. He is a research fellow at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore. It's a pleasure to have you on the show at this hour.</p><p>The devil always in the details with these types of things. We know that North Korea wants security guarantees. We know that the United States wants denuclearization. The question, will these two sides be able to work out those details with this type of a meeting, keeping in mind time is of the essence right now?</p><p>TAI WEI LIM, RESEARCH FELLOW, NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE: I think there is a lot of statement in this meeting, as you have mentioned. And as you've mentioned the two sides have very different definition of what denuclearization is.</p><p>So it remains to be seen whether they can bring together or close the gap between two definitions of denuclearization.</p><p>Now, there is a lot of speculation of what denuclearization mean. Some people say face withdrawals. Others say kind of a security umbrella before they will give up their weapons. And others would say that an end to the exercises. This is all pure speculation. So I suspect that the talks will be very important in kind of shaping the agenda of what exactly defines a denuclearization.</p><p>I think today we received news that President Moon from South Korea might be joining the talks in Singapore, and that might clarify or at least he could become mediator in bridging this gap.</p><p>HOWELL: Also, when it comes to economic aid for North Korea, now there is some pushback we're hearing to the idea of outside investment from private companies, keeping in mind that's something that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has suggested all along. What would North Korea be looking for when it comes to aid?</p><p>LIM: I think so far we have heard three individuals talk about aid. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>himself, Mr. Mike Pompeo and also Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. And President Xi from China has also at times mentioned about economic help or aid or grants for North Korea if the talks turn out to be successful. So, international leaders stand by ready to give economic assistance to North Korea. But the big question is whether the talks will be successful. And it all hinges on the two parties concerned, U.S. and North Korea to hammer out the details of what -- of how they define denuclearization.</p><p>HOWELL: I'd like to get your thoughts on how these allies of the United States, South Korea, Japan, how they have all worked together in this. Because again, just a few days ago, several days ago we saw the U.S. president cancel this summit, to the surprise of South Korea.</p><p>Then we saw South Korea, <person><nameText>President Moon Jae-in </nameText></person>held a surprise meeting with North Korea, seemingly, to the surprise of the United States. Is there a sense that these allies are working together? Is there a sense that it is almost every man for themselves to make this summit happen?</p><p>LIM: Indeed. The two allies of the Washington, Tokyo and Seoul are working very closely together and coordinating the efforts, as well as actions with the Washington, D.C. One good example is when President Moon met North Korean leader Kim in the very first summit in the demilitarized zone.</p><p>President Moon conveys Japanese concerns about the abductees that North Korea has kidnapped from Japan. Two, North Korean leader Kim, and also reported shared information back or privacy (Inaudible) through South Korea's intelligence achieves.</p><p>So I think this whole episode, as well as the nuclear testing in the past has achieved a much closer relationship in Washington, Tokyo and Seoul.</p><p>HOWELL: We certainly appreciate your type and perspective. There are a lot of question at play. We'll stay in touch with you as this either happens or does not happen. Thank you for your time.</p><p>LIM: Thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: Well, the U.S. president renewed his attack on the Russia investigation in a series of tweets Sunday. And <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>attorney is defending him.</p><p>HOWELL: <person><nameText>Rudy Giuliani </nameText></person>said the president's tweets are part of a strategy to avoid the threat of impeachment.</p><p>Our Boris Sanchez has details now from the White House.</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CORRESPONDENT,CNN: The Russia investigation clearly top of mind for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>this weekend, as we saw in a number of tweets in which he called the Russia investigation a witch-hunt and referred to Russia's role in the 2016 election as so-called meddling.</p><p>[03:09:55] The president in one curious tweet referring to young and beautiful lives that were destroyed by the Russia investigation. I got a chance to ask some White House officials specifically who he was talking about. They did not send me a response. Though the president's attorney <person><nameText>Rudy Giuliani </nameText></person>was on State of the Uunion Sunday morning with Dana Bash, and he called the Russia investigation during that interview illegitimate, again, repeating claims that were previously made by the president, suggesting that there is a wide conspiracy theory, a spy that was implanted by the deep state within the Trump campaign to try to benefit Hillary Clinton's campaign.</p><p>Something that neither the president nor Giuliani nor lawmakers on Capitol Hill provided any conclusive evidence for, Giuliani argued that the reason that they continue propagating these claims is not necessarily a legal strategy to try to defend the president from the special counsel's investigation, but rather, a public opinion strategy, one meant to sway the public to believe that the investigation is not valid.</p><p>And further, one that is designed to protect the president from the threat of impeachment. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>RUDY GIULIANI, </nameText></person>FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: They're giving us the material. I couldn't do it if I didn't have the material. They're giving us the material to do it. Of course we have to do it in defending the president.</p><p>We're defending to a large extent, remember, Dana, we're defending here, it is for public opinion because eventually the decision here is going to be impeach, not impeach.</p><p>Members of Congress, Democrat and Republican are going to be informed a lot by their constituents. So our jury is the American -- as it should be, is the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Dana also pressed Giuliani on the question of whether the president would sit down with Robert Mueller for a one-on-one interview, something that we've long speculated about.</p><p>Recently, sources have indicated that both sides, the Trump legal team and the special counsel have been discussing logistics and the subject matter of that potential interview. Giuliani made the case that the investigation would be wrapped up were it not for the president's adamant assistance that he wants to sit down and be interviewed by Robert Mueller.</p><p>Boris Sanchez, CNN, at the White House.</p><p>And for more on this we go to Scott Lucas in England. He is professional of international politics at the University of Birmingham. Scott, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCOTT LUCAS, POLITICS PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM: Good morning. CHURCH: So let's start with one of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>tweets from over the weekend that had a few of us scratching our heads, it has to be said. This is what he said regarding the Russia probe. \"Who is going to give back the young and beautiful lives that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia collusion witch-hunt? They journey down to Washington, D.C. with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation. They went back home in tatters.\"</p><p>So, Scott, which young and beautiful lives do you think he is referring to in this tweet?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, Rosemary, first I need to be direct with you, and I need to say this, even at the risk of cutting the interview short. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>lies. Over the weekend he lied about the North Korean summit, denying the existence of a White House official. He lied about the separation of immigrant children from their parents at the border, and he put out a series of lies about the Trump Russia investigation.</p><p>He lies when he says that the FBI had a spy inside his campaign in 2016. He lied again when he said all members of Robert Mueller's investigating team are Democrats. And then he topped it off with a tweet to which you referred, and that is that the people who have been indicted or convicted in this investigation are, for example, his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, his former senior adviser and national security adviser Michael Flynn, his foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, and others.</p><p>And I won't comment on whether or not they're beautiful, but they're not young, they were not innocent. They were involved in this investigation of whether or not he is linked to Russians in the 2016 campaign.</p><p>And let us be clear about why he is lying. Aided and abetted by <person><nameText>Rudy Giuliani </nameText></person>who gave the reason away. They need to discredit the Mueller investigation. They need to tear it down. They need to tear it down before the facts are presented to the point of whether or not there is impeachment, the possibility of political or criminal charges against the president and his advisers. And so this campaign is now all-out.</p><p>CHURCH: And still on the topic of the Russia probe, let's just listen for a moment to what Republican Senator Jeff Flake revealed about his concern regarding the investigators.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF FLAKE, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR: I can tell you behind the scenes there is a lot of alarm there is concern that the president is laying the groundwork to move on Bob Mueller or Rosenstein. And if that were to happen, obviously that would cause a constitutional crisis.</p><p>There is concern behind the scenes. I've been concerned that we haven't spoken up loudly enough and told the president you simply can't go there. And he is obviously probing the edges as much as he can.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>[03:15:00] FLAKE: To see how far Congress will go. And we've got to push back harder than we have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: So, Scott, he has threatened this before, hasn't he? But how likely is it that Mr. Trump would get rid of Mueller or Rosenstein, given the great risk involved in triggering a constitutional crisis and perhaps impeachment proceedings?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>ever since Robert Mueller was appointed in May 2017, has really wanted to get rid of him. But of course to do that, he has to get rid of the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who is the only person who can dismiss Mueller. The problem is that each time Trump tries to do this, his advisers pull him back and say there will be this crisis.</p><p>So what we have now is a plan b. If you can discredit Mueller, if you can discredit Rosenstein, if you can say that nothing that they do in the words of <person><nameText>Rudy Giuliani </nameText></person>yesterday is legitimate, you don't have to fire them.</p><p>So I think while this campaign is going on, this campaign of deceptions and decide you have a deep state coup against Trump, he won't have to resort to firing him. But if the campaign doesn't work, if they feel that it's feel failing, then Trump is again back at the precipice.</p><p>CHURCH: And Scott, you mentioned that <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>lawyer <person><nameText>Rudy Giuliani </nameText></person>revealed over the weekend that he believed the Russia probe was illegitimate, and that the administration was using this public opinion strategy to discredit the Russia investigation. He admitted that. It appears that they are having some success in discrediting the probe when you look at some of the recent polls.</p><p>LUCAS: I agree that what you do is that you throw smoke in everybody's eyes, and we get so confused as to whether up is down, whether black is white, even as the president is saying, trust me, black is white here.</p><p>I've seen this tactic before. I saw Russia use it even as they interfered in the 2016 election. They've got a very organized state strategy of propaganda and disinformation. Whether or not Trump officials worked with the Russians during that campaign, they've learned a bit from that strategy.</p><p>And <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>himself as a gut instinct politician is going to go all-out and hope and hope that Robert Mueller, who is exactly the opposite, who is not saying a word, who is not on Twitter, that when Robert Mueller comes forward in his lawyer fashion, somehow Trump can say nothing to see here, folks. No collusion, witch-hunt.</p><p>CHURCH: Scott Lucas, thanks for joining us from Birmingham in England, where it is just after 8.15 in the morning. We appreciate it. And we'll take a very short break here. But many voters in Ireland are celebrating their referendum victory. But now that they've agreed to change the country's strict abortion law, it is time for lawmakers to roll up their sleeves. We'll have more on that next.</p><p>HOWELL: And there is a serious question to be asked here in the United States. How do you lose track of 1500 children in the care of the federal government, and if authorities say they're not responsible, which they're saying, well, who is? That story ahead.</p><p>[03:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, now that Ireland has overwhelmingly voted to reform its strict abortion laws, they have a lot of work to do to actually build new legislation.</p><p>For more on that, let's get to CNN's Atika Shubert. She is live in Dublin, Ireland. So Atika, what is the next step for the Irish government as they try to get this legislation put in place by the end of the year?</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Yes, I mean, there already is a bill they've drawn up, but you know, they have to tweak it. They have to submit it to parliament, and then it's got to be debated. And there is a summer recess in all of this coming up. So it's not likely to be debated probably until the autumn.</p><p>But there is enormous pressure now to get this done. And of course the momentum is there. This is something that was initiated, the referendum was pushed by the current government with the Irish prime minister and his health minister, Simon Harris in particular saying this has to -- this has to get done.</p><p>So I think they really do want to try and get the legislation as quickly as possible. But the reality is it's probably not going to be done until the end of this year, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: And, of course, Atika, abortion is legal in the United Kingdom, but not in Northern Ireland. And this abortion vote has brought pressure to bear now on Prime Minister Theresa May to do something about that. How is she dealing with this very tricky political situation?</p><p>SHUBERT: Yes, I mean, you know, campaigners here really want to capitalize on the momentum that they've got from this vote. And it's interesting. When I was at Dublin Castle for that big rally, you know, there was a big sign that said the north is next.</p><p>And we've already seen Amnesty International, for example, put out a petition and appeal. And they've got tens of thousands of signatures already, you know, putting more pressure on Northern Ireland to legalize abortion.</p><p>But as you point out, it's a bit different there Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, of course, finds herself in a very delicate political position because she is in coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party. And this is a party that is pro-life, anti-abortion, staunchly so, and so -- and also, the laws are different there. There is no constitutional ban in the U.K. So it really is a local legislation issue.</p><p>So it's going to be a bit different for the issue of abortion rights in Northern Ireland. But absolutely there will be more pressure to bear, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: And we will watch that, and I know you will there from Dublin, Ireland where it is nearly 8.30 in the morn. Atika Shubert, as always, great to have you with us. Thank you.</p><p>HOWELL: And we have some amazing video to show you of a rescue that took place in Paris. An immigrant from Mali is being called a real life hero, a spider-man, because look at this video. Let's just look at this. Going from floor to floor.</p><p>You can see Mamoudou Gassama scaling these four different levels. He goes from balcony to balcony. Watch him get right up here to this 4- year-old child, and then pulling him to safety right there in midair. Amazing.</p><p>CHURCH: It is incredible. And French President Emmanuel Macron invited him to the Elysee Palace and will thank him personally any moment now. In fact, listen to how Gassama explains what he did there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:25:02] MAMOUDOU GASSAM (through translator): We came here to watch the football match at a restaurant. I saw a lot of people yelling. Cars were honking. I got out, and I saw the child, who was about to fall from the balcony. I like children.</p><p>So I will hate to see him get hurt in front of me. I ran, and I thought of ways to save him. And thank God I scaled the front of the building to that balcony.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): How did you climb? It seemed easy.</p><p>GASSAM (through translator): I got on top of a door and managed to pull myself up from balcony to balcony, and thank God I saved him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: What an incredible young man. And Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote on Twitter that she spoke with the 22-year-old, and she said this. \"He explained to me that he had arrived from Mali a few months ago, dreaming of building his life here. I told him that his heroic act is an example to all citizens and that the city of Paris will obviously be very keen to support him in his efforts to settle in France.\" And let's hope that happens.</p><p>HOWELL: Migrant who moves to a new country, and save the child and is looking to start a new life. CHURCH: It is incredible.</p><p>HOWELL: It is incredible, isn't it?</p><p>Still ahead here on Newsroom, hundreds of children unaccounted for and blanket denials that the government should know where they are. What U.S. officials have to say about a bureaucratic crisis that is actually quite human.</p><p>Plus this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Facebook is already facing accusations it's not complying with brand-new European data laws. We'll take a look at that. Back in just a moment.</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOWELL: Welcome back to viewers here in the United States and around the world, you're watching CNN Newsroom.</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOWELL: Welcome back to viewers here in the United States and around the world. You're watching \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm George Howell.</p><p>CHURCH: And I'm Rosemary Church. Let's check the headlines for you this hour. A U.S. delegation is in North Korea to do the advance work ahead of a possible summit between the leaders of the two nations. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>canceled it a few days ago, but all indications are it's back on. An advance team has also left for Singapore, where the summit is scheduled to be held.</p><p>HOWELL: The former president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, is in the hospital. This after suffering a loss of blood pressure and fatigue. Mr. Bush's chief of staff says the 93-year-old is awake, that he is alert and not in any discomfort. He was last hospitalized in April after the death of his wife, Barbara.</p><p>CHURCH: Britain's prime minister is facing hate from lawmakers for refusing to push for abortion reform in Northern Ireland. Theresa May's spokeswoman said abortion law should only be changed by a government in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, more than 100 U.K. parliament members will reportedly back a bill allowing abortion in the province.</p><p>HOWELL: Disturbing story to share with you here in the United States. The government says it is not responsible for nearly 1,500 undocumented minors who have essentially gone missing. These are children, children who crossed the border into the United States and landed into the custody of the office of refugee resettlement. Last year, the office admitted it had lost track, lost track of nearly 20 percent of the children in its care.</p><p>CHURCH: But the federal government in 50 agencies' hands are clean because it released the children over to sponsors who then take responsibility. CNN's Tal Kopan explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAL KOPAN, CNN POLITICS REPORTER: If someone comes to the border without an adult, a child comes to the border by themselves or if for some reason they are separated from their parents through or the adults they were with through the course of action, they're turned over to a different government agency who then works to place them with a sponsor.</p><p>Sometimes that's a family member. Sometimes that's an individual who seems responsible and can care for this child. Now, this government agency has testified that it is their position that once they make that handoff, they are not legally responsible for what happens to those children. They are expected to show up for court dates and that type of thing.</p><p>But they typically have not been followed up and figured out what happens to these children. So in the last three months of 2017, they followed up on about 7,500 of these children. And as you mentioned, about 20 percent of them, about 1,500, they could not account for what had happened to them after their placement. Now, it is unknown what happened to them.</p><p>It is possible that those children made an independent decision to go into the shadows and live undocumented in the U.S. They could very well have ended up in the hands of traffickers. But this is now, you know, a potentially even bigger problem as the U.S. is pursuing policy options that could result in even more children being separated from their families.</p><p>And the U.S. government is grappling with these questions, what happened to these children and what can they do in the future to prevent it from happening again?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: All this as the Department of Homeland Security is defending a controversial policy of separating families that cross the U.S. border illegally.</p><p>And investigators are looking into a shooting at the southern U.S. border that left a young woman dead.</p><p>HOWELL: She and two other migrants have been traveling for more than two weeks when they encountered a border patrol agent in Texas. As our Martin Savidge reports, the story of what happened next, well, that keeps shifting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We have learned new information first and foremost, the identity of the young victim who was killed on Wednesday, a 20-year-old female from Guatemala. We have also learned a bit more about the border patrol agent that fired the fatal shot. He is a 15-year veteran of the force. Otherwise, though, the questions continue to grow.</p><p>Searching for answers, even as investigators, including the FBI, showed up to process the scene of Wednesday's fatal shooting. Customs and border protection officials began walking back critical details of the reported attack on one of their border agents.</p><p>The revised statement released Friday now says the border patrol agent was allegedly assaulted. In the original press release, the word \"allegedly\" never appears. Instead, it states \"initial reports described an agent under attack by multiple subjects using blunt objects.\"</p><p>The revised statement simply states now the group of suspected undocumented immigrants rushed him. Wednesday, CBP (ph) said the agent fired his weapon, fatally wounding one of the assailants.</p><p>[03:34:59] The revised statement now says the agent discharged one round, striking one member of the group, no longer characterizing the shooting victim as an assailant. Marta Martinez was a witness to what happened. What she says she heard and saw was nothing like either account officials have given.</p><p>So when was the first indication there was a problem here?</p><p>MARTA MARTINEZ, EYEWITNESS: When I heard the gunshot.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Martinez says when she rushed out of her home, she didn't see a border patrol agent being attacked by a group.</p><p>MARTINEZ: So I came out and got my phone and started recording. I didn't thought there was somebody dead.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Marta live streamed the aftermath which has since been viewed thousands of times.</p><p>Marta Martinez had a front row seat to this tragedy because it happened literally right next door. She found the body of the young woman lying on the ground right there. There is still traces of blood. And if you come down here and look across her fence into this lot, there are other indications that something happened, a struggle or an altercation. Just look at the way the grass is all matted down.</p><p>Juan Gonzalez, the Rio Bravo fire chief was among the first responders to treat the woman who was shot. He says when he got there, she looked very young, very fatigued, and barely alive. When she stopped breathing, he says, rescuers carried on with CPR.</p><p>Did she say anything? Did she move in any way? Did she seem conscious?</p><p>JUAN GONZALEZ, FIRST RESPONDER: No. She was not conscious, but she was breathing.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Customs and border protection were to hold a news conference on Friday, but it was suddenly canceled, and then they reissued that revised statement. Experts say it's not uncommon in the course of an investigation to change when you begin to learn new insights.</p><p>One part that does trouble those same experts though is that when they removed the allegation that blunt force objects were used, in other words, kind of weapons that people picked up by this group that allegedly attacked the border patrol agent, when that was removed from the scenario, that is very troubling about the depiction.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Martin Savidge there reporting.</p><p>CHURCH Well, in the U.S. state of Maryland, flash floods turned this city street into a river Sunday.</p><p>HOWELL: Murky water rushed through Ellicott City near the city of Baltimore. This situation is especially hard on residents there who just finished rebuilding from last year's floods about two years ago.</p><p>CHURCH: And our meteorologist, Allison Chinchar, joins us now with the very latest on the devastating rain. Just incredible images there, Allison.</p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: That's right. And the unfortunate part for that town of Ellicott City is the topography that comes into play there because it sits at a low point, so all of the rain from the surrounding area ends up kind of flowing into that same spot.</p><p>So, not only do they get the rain that actually fell on Ellicott City, which is right here where my hand is, but a lot of the other areas where it begins to flow back down. They also pick up lot of that rain as it's making its way down towards some of the other rivers.</p><p>So in turn, they end up getting a lot more rain on their roadways and such than they would just based off of the rain coming down above them. But let's take a look at the overall amounts where my hand is located. This is where Baltimore is.</p><p>So notice the heaviest rain was just out to the west of that. Widespread amounts, about 150 to 250 millimeters of rain or about 6 to 10 inches total, which is incredibly high if that was, say, your entire day's worth of rain.</p><p>But for those locations, a lot of them picked it up in less than three hours. We talked about some of the rivers, creeks, and streams. This is a map of the Patapsco River, OK, showing kind of the gauge here. The blue line remaining steady and then within two hours making a huge jump of about 17 feet. Again, in just two hours.</p><p>They ended up breaking their all-time record crest at this river because of that heavy rain. Now, the good news is this particular region is getting a brief reprieve from the rain that will allow some of that water to recede. However, notice a lot of that moisture being pushed up from the south. That moisture is coming from subtropical storm Alberto.</p><p>Now, the heaviest rain associated with this is still really mainly impacting southeastern states like Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and such. But this system is going to continue to make its way off to the north.</p><p>We expect landfall to be within the next 12 hours. The winds will quickly start to die back down as it makes its way further inland but it's going impact other cities, Birmingham, Nashville, even into Chicago as we get later on into the week.</p><p>And with it, it's going to take some of that heavy rain. Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Key West dealing with incredible heavy rain. And a lot of those areas, by the way, are already dealing with an above average month of May for precipitation. And now, George and Rosemary, we're going to add an additional four to six inches on top of what they've already had.</p><p>HOWELL: Looks like it's going to be a soaker.</p><p>[03:39:59] CHURCH: Yeah, it is. It most certainly is. A lot to cover there. Allison, thank you so much for bringing us up to date.</p><p>HOWELL: Thank you, Allison. Still ahead here on \"Newsroom,\" Facebook's CEO insisted the company would follow the rules. But experts say the social media giant is already violating strict new European regulations. Plus this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: This woman claims her Amazon Alexa snooped on her conversation. How a series of unlikely events may have caused the error. You might want to rethink of all of this. We're back in a moment to explain.</p><p>CHURCH Welcome back, everyone. Well, Europe's sweeping data protection regulation came into effect on Friday, and CNN has learned separate lawsuits have already been filed against Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, and Instagram, alleging that the companies are failing to comply.</p><p>HOWELL: That's right. Testifying in front of E.U. leaders on Tuesday, Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, insisted that his company would follow the rules. But as our Samuel Burke reports, legal experts believe that Facebook is already violating the new law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Austrian lawyer Max Schrems has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time. His NGO suing Facebook for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER: We're looking for big companies that really willfully violate the law, that kind of try to ignore it and try to get away with it.</p><p>BURKE: Schrems who helped write the regulation says he is taking legal action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS: They're saying we don't want this. We think it's stupid so we don't want to comply with it. And then there is obvious business interests. There is certain things you simply can't do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p>[03:44:58] BURKE: The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UCI: On your Facebook profile, you can put in things like sexuality, religion or political beliefs. And if you put that on, you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents to deliver advertising and so on.</p><p>BURKE: There is only an \"I accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE: Exactly.</p><p>BURKE: There is not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE: Exactly. You got it.</p><p>BURKE: Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other websites too.</p><p>VEALE: Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data it has about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE: As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>VEALE: Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE: Failure to comply could be costly. For a big company like Facebook, European data regulators can impose a fine of up to four percent of its global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said the company has, quote, introduced better tools for people to access, download, and delete their information. The company also says it's building a new tool that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We do expect to be fully compliant on May 25th.</p><p>BURKE: Lawyer Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have engaged in.</p><p>SCHREMS: If we enforced them properly, we can actually get a balance in this digitalize stage. In the end, you as a customer have the possibility to use let's say Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.</p><p>BURKE: However, the courts come down on the tech giants. Europe's new data regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.</p><p>Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: OK. So Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa, can do many things.</p><p>HOWELL: And apparently it can even snoop on your private conversations. Our Anna Stewart explains this one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a cautionary tale of technology telling too much. A woman in Oregon says Amazon's Alexa recorded and then e-mailed a random person with a private conversation that took place in her house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion. Like immediately I'm like I'm never plugging that device in again. I can't trust it.</p><p>STEWART: Amazon's Echo owner, Danielle, said she was chatting with her husband about hardwood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who works for her husband. She only found out about the recording when she received an alarming phone call.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The person on the other line said unplug your Alexa devices right now. We go around and unplug them all. He proceed to tell us that he had received audio files, recordings from what was going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART: Amazon told CNN affiliate Kiro-7, the device misinterpreted commands like send message and the contact's name as part of the background conversation, and called it an extremely rare occurrence.</p><p>It's unknown if the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light up when it was activated, or if the device responded at all. Either way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH Very unnerving. I have one of those at home. You don't.</p><p>HOWELL: Kind of old school. I don't know if I want it, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: Yes. I'm not sure I still want mine now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOWELL: What all it's listening to?</p><p>CHURCH Well, I mean, it listens to everything. But I mean it -- it wakes up when you say \"Alexa.\" But, you know, obviously they didn't realize they had said \"Alexa.\" Luckily, they were only talking about wooden floors, right?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHURCH: All right. We'll take a very short break. We'll be back in a moment.</p><p>[03:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOWELL: It is Memorial Day here in the United States, a day set aside to honor the men and women of the armed forces who made the ultimate sacrifice defending this country.</p><p>CHURCH: This weekend, the oldest living Pearl Harbor veteran made his mark in Washington. He paid tribute to fallen comrades and was honored himself as well. CNN's Dianne Gallagher has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.</p><p>DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A day that still plays out in the mind of Ray Chavez.</p><p>RAY CHAVEZ, OLDEST SURVIVING PEARL HARBOR VETERAN: Every day.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Seventy-six years later --</p><p>CHAVEZ: I saw all the ships on fire and a terrible smoke screen all through the harbor and covering the ships.</p><p>GALLAGHER: At 106 years old, Chavez is the oldest surviving Pearl Harbor veteran.</p><p>CHAVEZ: It never goes away, what you see. That's the way I am. I remember and then I forget and remember again.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Remembering, it's what brings Chavez to Washington, D.C. this weekend. Although he did meet President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>at the White House --</p><p>CHAVEZ: I looked forward to it because I didn't vote for him, and I enjoy meeting him. Pleasant enough to have me right next to him when we were seated.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Chavez traveled across-country from San Diego to D.C., stopping in Kansas to refuel and meet with fellow veterans to attend the 150th Memorial Day Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.</p><p>[03:55:04] He and his family are the guests of Defense Secretary James Mattis. But the navy veteran says more than all of the pomp and circumstance surrounding his visit, his focus is on those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. It's the act of remembering that is most important this holiday weekend.</p><p>CHAVEZ: National remembrance day, because it's very important that the younger generation know and learn at the beginning of war.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Vice President Mike Pence spent part of his Friday at the TAPS Good Grief Camp with a younger generation that knows the consequences of war all too well. All of these children have lost a loved one who served in the armed forces.</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A room full of heroes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>GALLAGHER: And many will spend part of their Memorial Day here, in Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, remembering their fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers, veterans of wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and post-9/11 conflicts.</p><p>CHAVEZ: I would do it again if I was called to active duty, but chances are never.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GALLAGHER: But the secretary and deputy secretary of defense surprised Chavez Friday night with a reenlistment and promotion. Still, the 106-year-old says the purpose of this weekend is to honor the memory of those he served with.</p><p>CHAVEZ: I never will forget that, because I met some real fine young men.</p><p>GALLAGHER: And the sacrifice of the men and women who came after as well.</p><p>Dianne Gallagher, CNN, Atlanta.l (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: A day to reflect and to remember.

U.S. and North Korean officials are talking in North Korea to try to get ready for a meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GEORGE HOWELL, HOST, CNN:  Plus, the United States says it can't account for nearly 1500 missing migrant children, and U.S. is saying they're not responsible for the situation. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHURCH:  And fighting Facebook, the lawsuit that could cost the company billions and might affect your privacy. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and of course from all around the world. We are live in Atlanta. I'm Rosemary Church. </p><p>And I'm George Howell. From CNN's world headquarters, Newsroom starts right now. </p><p>And at this hour, a team of U.S. diplomats and officials are in North Korea. Their mission there is to lay the groundwork for the upcoming summit between those two nations. </p><p>CHURCH:  And that summit still may or may not happen. Earlier in the week U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the plug on the meeting over some hostile comments made by North Korean officials. </p><p>HOWELL:  But here is the thing. On Saturday, he hinted to reporters that after the surprise meeting between North and South Korea, the leaders there, the summit may be back on. And another clue. A U.S. advanced team has also left for Singapore where the June 12th summit is set to take place if it happens. </p><p>CHURCH:  And let's take a look at all of this. We want to bring in Paula Hancocks who joins us from Seoul, South Korea. So Paula, despite President Trump cancelling the summit meeting Thursday, it now appears to be back on track for June 12, as originally scheduled. And this U.S. delegation is now in North Korea to plan for that summit. What are you learning about all of this?  PAULA HANCOCKS, CORRESPONDENT,CNN::  Well, Rosemary we know about the U.S. delegation that it's headed up by a man called Sung Kim. He is U.S. ambassador to the Philippines at the moment. But he was an ambassador here in South Korea. He was also one of the point people that Washington had when they were negotiating with North Korea in previous years. </p><p>So he has experience of talking to the North Koreans. He knows how difficult and challenging it can be to try and strike a deal with Pyongyang. He was very much involved in six-party talks as well. </p><p>So from that point of view, they do have people who have experience of this before, who are currently in North Korea negotiating with the North Korean side. Now as we understand it, this is going to be more about the substance of the summit itself, more about what will be on the agenda. Clearly denuclearization is going to be the big issue on the agenda. </p><p>But how do they discuss that? What sort of issues does each side have? And is there any chance, I suppose, of these pre-negotiations trying to narrow the gap between the American understanding and the North Korean understanding of what denuclearization means. </p><p>Because usually when you have these kinds of summits between large -- big leaders, you will have months and months of preparation. Months of these kinds of pre-negotiations and once you get to the summit, most of it is already agreed upon. But, of course, this is a very different situation and two very different leaders. </p><p>CHURCH:  Yes, most certainly. And of course, there are two issues that threaten to derail this summit going forward. Trust is one of them. And you mentioned the other one, denuclearization, the problem being of course that the two sides do not share the same definition, as you also mentioned. But this is problematic, isn't it? If the two leaders arrive together there in Singapore on June 12th, and that has not been decided? </p><p>HANCOCKS:  Well, that's right. And I think this is where these kinds of delegations are coming very useful. That the fact that there is this pre-discussion on what exactly both sides are expecting, because neither side wants to come away from a summit with it having failed of course if the summit even goes ahead. </p><p>But another interesting point as well which we learned over the weekend from the North Korean leader and the South Korean leader meeting for the second time in just a month which is unprecedented was the fact that we understood a little bit more about what Kim Jong-un is going to be looking for from this summit. </p><p>According to President Moon Jae-in, he spoke to the nation on Sunday, he was talking about the guarantees that Kim Jong-un is looking for. He wants a guarantee for the survival of the regime. So certainly it gives us a bit more of an insight into what he is looking for. </p><p>President Moon also mentioned there would be economic benefits for Mr. Kim. But he said to the North Korean leader, you should sit down with the U.S. president so he can tell you this himself face-to-face. </p><p>We've already heard from Mr. Trump that he has guaranteed Kim Jong- un's safety, which raised some eyebrows here, guaranteeing the safety of a dictator. But saying that he will be safe, he will be happy. His country will be rich. So getting more and more insights into what exactly both sides want. </p><p>[03:05:08] CHURCH:  Yes. And of course guarantees like that are difficult to give when we think about 10 years into the future and a whole lot of other variables. But talking there with our Paula Hancocks, joins us from Seoul in South Korea where it's just after 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Many thanks, as always. </p><p>HOWELL:  And now let's get some perspective on all of this and the possible outcome that is if it happens. We're joined by Tai Wei Lim. He is a research fellow at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore. It's a pleasure to have you on the show at this hour. </p><p>The devil always in the details with these types of things. We know that North Korea wants security guarantees. We know that the United States wants denuclearization. The question, will these two sides be able to work out those details with this type of a meeting, keeping in mind time is of the essence right now? </p><p>TAI WEI LIM, RESEARCH FELLOW, NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE:  I think there is a lot of statement in this meeting, as you have mentioned. And as you've mentioned the two sides have very different definition of what denuclearization is. </p><p>So it remains to be seen whether they can bring together or close the gap between two definitions of denuclearization. </p><p>Now, there is a lot of speculation of what denuclearization mean. Some people say face withdrawals. Others say kind of a security umbrella before they will give up their weapons. And others would say that an end to the exercises. This is all pure speculation. So I suspect that the talks will be very important in kind of shaping the agenda of what exactly defines a denuclearization. </p><p>I think today we received news that President Moon from South Korea might be joining the talks in Singapore, and that might clarify or at least he could become mediator in bridging this gap. </p><p>HOWELL:  Also, when it comes to economic aid for North Korea, now there is some pushback we're hearing to the idea of outside investment from private companies, keeping in mind that's something that President Trump has suggested all along. What would North Korea be looking for when it comes to aid? </p><p>LIM:  I think so far we have heard three individuals talk about aid. President Trump himself, Mr. Mike Pompeo and also Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. And President Xi from China has also at times mentioned about economic help or aid or grants for North Korea if the talks turn out to be successful.  So, international leaders stand by ready to give economic assistance to North Korea. But the big question is whether the talks will be successful. And it all hinges on the two parties concerned, U.S. and North Korea to hammer out the details of what -- of how they define denuclearization. </p><p>HOWELL:  I'd like to get your thoughts on how these allies of the United States, South Korea, Japan, how they have all worked together in this. Because again, just a few days ago, several days ago we saw the U.S. president cancel this summit, to the surprise of South Korea. </p><p>Then we saw South Korea, President Moon Jae-in held a surprise meeting with North Korea, seemingly, to the surprise of the United States. Is there a sense that these allies are working together? Is there a sense that it is almost every man for themselves to make this summit happen? </p><p>LIM:  Indeed. The two allies of the Washington, Tokyo and Seoul are working very closely together and coordinating the efforts, as well as actions with the Washington, D.C. One good example is when President Moon met North Korean leader Kim in the very first summit in the demilitarized zone. </p><p>President Moon conveys Japanese concerns about the abductees that North Korea has kidnapped from Japan. Two, North Korean leader Kim, and also reported shared information back or privacy (Inaudible) through South Korea's intelligence achieves. </p><p>So I think this whole episode, as well as the nuclear testing in the past has achieved a much closer relationship in Washington, Tokyo and Seoul. </p><p>HOWELL:  We certainly appreciate your type and perspective. There are a lot of question at play. We'll stay in touch with you as this either happens or does not happen. Thank you for your time. </p><p>LIM:  Thank you. </p><p>CHURCH:  Well, the U.S. president renewed his attack on the Russia investigation in a series of tweets Sunday. And Donald Trump's attorney is defending him. </p><p>HOWELL:  Rudy Giuliani said the president's tweets are part of a strategy to avoid the threat of impeachment. </p><p>Our Boris Sanchez has details now from the White House. </p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CORRESPONDENT,CNN:  The Russia investigation clearly top of mind for President Trump this weekend, as we saw in a number of tweets in which he called the Russia investigation a witch-hunt and referred to Russia's role in the 2016 election as so-called meddling. </p><p>[03:09:55] The president in one curious tweet referring to young and beautiful lives that were destroyed by the Russia investigation. I got a chance to ask some White House officials specifically who he was talking about. They did not send me a response. Though the president's attorney Rudy Giuliani was on State of the Uunion Sunday morning with Dana Bash, and he called the Russia investigation during that interview illegitimate, again, repeating claims that were previously made by the president, suggesting that there is a wide conspiracy theory, a spy that was implanted by the deep state within the Trump campaign to try to benefit Hillary Clinton's campaign. </p><p>Something that neither the president nor Giuliani nor lawmakers on Capitol Hill provided any conclusive evidence for, Giuliani argued that the reason that they continue propagating these claims is not necessarily a legal strategy to try to defend the president from the special counsel's investigation, but rather, a public opinion strategy, one meant to sway the public to believe that the investigation is not valid. </p><p>And further, one that is designed to protect the president from the threat of impeachment. Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR:  They're giving us the material. I couldn't do it if I didn't have the material. They're giving us the material to do it. Of course we have to do it in defending the president. </p><p>We're defending to a large extent, remember, Dana, we're defending here, it is for public opinion because eventually the decision here is going to be impeach, not impeach. </p><p>Members of Congress, Democrat and Republican are going to be informed a lot by their constituents. So our jury is the American -- as it should be, is the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Dana also pressed Giuliani on the question of whether the president would sit down with Robert Mueller for a one-on-one interview, something that we've long speculated about. </p><p>Recently, sources have indicated that both sides, the Trump legal team and the special counsel have been discussing logistics and the subject matter of that potential interview. Giuliani made the case that the investigation would be wrapped up were it not for the president's adamant assistance that he wants to sit down and be interviewed by Robert Mueller. </p><p>Boris Sanchez, CNN, at the White House. </p><p>And for more on this we go to Scott Lucas in England. He is professional of international politics at the University of Birmingham. Scott, good to have you with us. </p><p>SCOTT LUCAS, POLITICS PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM:  Good morning.  CHURCH:  So let's start with one of President Trump's tweets from over the weekend that had a few of us scratching our heads, it has to be said. This is what he said regarding the Russia probe. \"Who is going to give back the young and beautiful lives that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia collusion witch-hunt? They journey down to Washington, D.C. with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation. They went back home in tatters.\" </p><p>So, Scott, which young and beautiful lives do you think he is referring to in this tweet? </p><p>LUCAS:  Well, Rosemary, first I need to be direct with you, and I need to say this, even at the risk of cutting the interview short. Donald Trump lies. Over the weekend he lied about the North Korean summit, denying the existence of a White House official. He lied about the separation of immigrant children from their parents at the border, and he put out a series of lies about the Trump Russia investigation. </p><p>He lies when he says that the FBI had a spy inside his campaign in 2016. He lied again when he said all members of Robert Mueller's investigating team are Democrats. And then he topped it off with a tweet to which you referred, and that is that the people who have been indicted or convicted in this investigation are, for example, his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, his former senior adviser and national security adviser Michael Flynn, his foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, and others. </p><p>And I won't comment on whether or not they're beautiful, but they're not young, they were not innocent. They were involved in this investigation of whether or not he is linked to Russians in the 2016 campaign. </p><p>And let us be clear about why he is lying. Aided and abetted by Rudy Giuliani who gave the reason away. They need to discredit the Mueller investigation. They need to tear it down. They need to tear it down before the facts are presented to the point of whether or not there is impeachment, the possibility of political or criminal charges against the president and his advisers. And so this campaign is now all-out. </p><p>CHURCH:  And still on the topic of the Russia probe, let's just listen for a moment to what Republican Senator Jeff Flake revealed about his concern regarding the investigators.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JEFF FLAKE, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  I can tell you behind the scenes there is a lot of alarm there is concern that the president is laying the groundwork to move on Bob Mueller or Rosenstein. And if that were to happen, obviously that would cause a constitutional crisis. </p><p>There is concern behind the scenes. I've been concerned that we haven't spoken up loudly enough and told the president you simply can't go there. And he is obviously probing the edges as much as he can. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right. </p><p>[03:15:00] FLAKE:  To see how far Congress will go. And we've got to push back harder than we have. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH:  So, Scott, he has threatened this before, hasn't he? But how likely is it that Mr. Trump would get rid of Mueller or Rosenstein, given the great risk involved in triggering a constitutional crisis and perhaps impeachment proceedings? </p><p>LUCAS:  Well, Donald Trump, ever since Robert Mueller was appointed in May 2017, has really wanted to get rid of him. But of course to do that, he has to get rid of the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who is the only person who can dismiss Mueller. The problem is that each time Trump tries to do this, his advisers pull him back and say there will be this crisis. </p><p>So what we have now is a plan b. If you can discredit Mueller, if you can discredit Rosenstein, if you can say that nothing that they do in the words of Rudy Giuliani yesterday is legitimate, you don't have to fire them. </p><p>So I think while this campaign is going on, this campaign of deceptions and decide you have a deep state coup against Trump, he won't have to resort to firing him. But if the campaign doesn't work, if they feel that it's feel failing, then Trump is again back at the precipice. </p><p>CHURCH:  And Scott, you mentioned that President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani revealed over the weekend that he believed the Russia probe was illegitimate, and that the administration was using this public opinion strategy to discredit the Russia investigation. He admitted that. It appears that they are having some success in discrediting the probe when you look at some of the recent polls. </p><p>LUCAS:  I agree that what you do is that you throw smoke in everybody's eyes, and we get so confused as to whether up is down, whether black is white, even as the president is saying, trust me, black is white here. </p><p>I've seen this tactic before. I saw Russia use it even as they interfered in the 2016 election. They've got a very organized state strategy of propaganda and disinformation. Whether or not Trump officials worked with the Russians during that campaign, they've learned a bit from that strategy. </p><p>And Donald Trump himself as a gut instinct politician is going to go all-out and hope and hope that Robert Mueller, who is exactly the opposite, who is not saying a word, who is not on Twitter, that when Robert Mueller comes forward in his lawyer fashion, somehow Trump can say nothing to see here, folks. No collusion, witch-hunt. </p><p>CHURCH:  Scott Lucas, thanks for joining us from Birmingham in England, where it is just after 8.15 in the morning. We appreciate it.  And we'll take a very short break here. But many voters in Ireland are celebrating their referendum victory. But now that they've agreed to change the country's strict abortion law, it is time for lawmakers to roll up their sleeves. We'll have more on that next. </p><p>HOWELL:  And there is a serious question to be asked here in the United States. How do you lose track of 1500 children in the care of the federal government, and if authorities say they're not responsible, which they're saying, well, who is? That story ahead.</p><p>[03:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone. Well, now that Ireland has overwhelmingly voted to reform its strict abortion laws, they have a lot of work to do to actually build new legislation. </p><p>For more on that, let's get to CNN's Atika Shubert. She is live in Dublin, Ireland. So Atika, what is the next step for the Irish government as they try to get this legislation put in place by the end of the year? </p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, I mean, there already is a bill they've drawn up, but you know, they have to tweak it. They have to submit it to parliament, and then it's got to be debated. And there is a summer recess in all of this coming up. So it's not likely to be debated probably until the autumn. </p><p>But there is enormous pressure now to get this done. And of course the momentum is there. This is something that was initiated, the referendum was pushed by the current government with the Irish prime minister and his health minister, Simon Harris in particular saying this has to -- this has to get done. </p><p>So I think they really do want to try and get the legislation as quickly as possible. But the reality is it's probably not going to be done until the end of this year, Rosemary. </p><p>CHURCH:  And, of course, Atika, abortion is legal in the United Kingdom, but not in Northern Ireland. And this abortion vote has brought pressure to bear now on Prime Minister Theresa May to do something about that. How is she dealing with this very tricky political situation? </p><p>SHUBERT:  Yes, I mean, you know, campaigners here really want to capitalize on the momentum that they've got from this vote. And it's interesting. When I was at Dublin Castle for that big rally, you know, there was a big sign that said the north is next. </p><p>And we've already seen Amnesty International, for example, put out a petition and appeal. And they've got tens of thousands of signatures already, you know, putting more pressure on Northern Ireland to legalize abortion. </p><p>But as you point out, it's a bit different there Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, of course, finds herself in a very delicate political position because she is in coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party. And this is a party that is pro-life, anti-abortion, staunchly so, and so -- and also, the laws are different there. There is no constitutional ban in the U.K. So it really is a local legislation issue. </p><p>So it's going to be a bit different for the issue of abortion rights in Northern Ireland. But absolutely there will be more pressure to bear, Rosemary. </p><p>CHURCH:  And we will watch that, and I know you will there from Dublin, Ireland where it is nearly 8.30 in the morn. Atika Shubert, as always, great to have you with us. Thank you.</p><p>HOWELL:  And we have some amazing video to show you of a rescue that took place in Paris. An immigrant from Mali is being called a real life hero, a spider-man, because look at this video. Let's just look at this. Going from floor to floor. </p><p>You can see Mamoudou Gassama scaling these four different levels. He goes from balcony to balcony. Watch him get right up here to this 4- year-old child, and then pulling him to safety right there in midair. Amazing. </p><p>CHURCH:  It is incredible. And French President Emmanuel Macron invited him to the Elysee Palace and will thank him personally any moment now. In fact, listen to how Gassama explains what he did there. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:25:02] MAMOUDOU GASSAM (through translator):  We came here to watch the football match at a restaurant. I saw a lot of people yelling. Cars were honking. I got out, and I saw the child, who was about to fall from the balcony. I like children. </p><p>So I will hate to see him get hurt in front of me. I ran, and I thought of ways to save him. And thank God I scaled the front of the building to that balcony. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  How did you climb? It seemed easy. </p><p>GASSAM (through translator):  I got on top of a door and managed to pull myself up from balcony to balcony, and thank God I saved him. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH:  What an incredible young man. And Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote on Twitter that she spoke with the 22-year-old, and she said this. \"He explained to me that he had arrived from Mali a few months ago, dreaming of building his life here. I told him that his heroic act is an example to all citizens and that the city of Paris will obviously be very keen to support him in his efforts to settle in France.\" And let's hope that happens. </p><p>HOWELL:  Migrant who moves to a new country, and save the child and is looking to start a new life.  CHURCH:  It is incredible. </p><p>HOWELL:  It is incredible, isn't it? </p><p>Still ahead here on Newsroom, hundreds of children unaccounted for and blanket denials that the government should know where they are. What U.S. officials have to say about a bureaucratic crisis that is actually quite human. </p><p>Plus this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHURCH:  Facebook is already facing accusations it's not complying with brand-new European data laws. We'll take a look at that. Back in just a moment. </p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOWELL:  Welcome back to viewers here in the United States and around the world, you're watching CNN Newsroom.</p><p>[03:30:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOWELL:  Welcome back to viewers here in the United States and around the world. You're watching \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm George Howell.</p><p>CHURCH:  And I'm Rosemary Church. Let's check the headlines for you this hour. A U.S. delegation is in North Korea to do the advance work ahead of a possible summit between the leaders of the two nations. President Trump canceled it a few days ago, but all indications are it's back on. An advance team has also left for Singapore, where the summit is scheduled to be held.</p><p>HOWELL:  The former president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, is in the hospital. This after suffering a loss of blood pressure and fatigue. Mr. Bush's chief of staff says the 93-year-old is awake, that he is alert and not in any discomfort. He was last hospitalized in April after the death of his wife, Barbara.</p><p>CHURCH:  Britain's prime minister is facing hate from lawmakers for refusing to push for abortion reform in Northern Ireland. Theresa May's spokeswoman said abortion law should only be changed by a government in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, more than 100 U.K. parliament members will reportedly back a bill allowing abortion in the province.</p><p>HOWELL:  Disturbing story to share with you here in the United States. The government says it is not responsible for nearly 1,500 undocumented minors who have essentially gone missing. These are children, children who crossed the border into the United States and landed into the custody of the office of refugee resettlement. Last year, the office admitted it had lost track, lost track of nearly 20 percent of the children in its care.</p><p>CHURCH:  But the federal government in 50 agencies' hands are clean because it released the children over to sponsors who then take responsibility. CNN's Tal Kopan explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAL KOPAN, CNN POLITICS REPORTER:  If someone comes to the border without an adult, a child comes to the border by themselves or if for some reason they are separated from their parents through or the adults they were with through the course of action, they're turned over to a different government agency who then works to place them with a sponsor.</p><p>Sometimes that's a family member. Sometimes that's an individual who seems responsible and can care for this child. Now, this government agency has testified that it is their position that once they make that handoff, they are not legally responsible for what happens to those children. They are expected to show up for court dates and that type of thing.</p><p>But they typically have not been followed up and figured out what happens to these children. So in the last three months of 2017, they followed up on about 7,500 of these children. And as you mentioned, about 20 percent of them, about 1,500, they could not account for what had happened to them after their placement. Now, it is unknown what happened to them.</p><p>It is possible that those children made an independent decision to go into the shadows and live undocumented in the U.S. They could very well have ended up in the hands of traffickers. But this is now, you know, a potentially even bigger problem as the U.S. is pursuing policy options that could result in even more children being separated from their families.</p><p>And the U.S. government is grappling with these questions, what happened to these children and what can they do in the future to prevent it from happening again?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH:  All this as the Department of Homeland Security is defending a controversial policy of separating families that cross the U.S. border illegally.</p><p>And investigators are looking into a shooting at the southern U.S. border that left a young woman dead.</p><p>HOWELL:  She and two other migrants have been traveling for more than two weeks when they encountered a border patrol agent in Texas. As our Martin Savidge reports, the story of what happened next, well, that keeps shifting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We have learned new information first and foremost, the identity of the young victim who was killed on Wednesday, a 20-year-old female from Guatemala. We have also learned a bit more about the border patrol agent that fired the fatal shot. He is a 15-year veteran of the force. Otherwise, though, the questions continue to grow.</p><p>Searching for answers, even as investigators, including the FBI, showed up to process the scene of Wednesday's fatal shooting. Customs and border protection officials began walking back critical details of the reported attack on one of their border agents.</p><p>The revised statement released Friday now says the border patrol agent was allegedly assaulted. In the original press release, the word \"allegedly\" never appears. Instead, it states \"initial reports described an agent under attack by multiple subjects using blunt objects.\"</p><p>The revised statement simply states now the group of suspected undocumented immigrants rushed him. Wednesday, CBP (ph) said the agent fired his weapon, fatally wounding one of the assailants.</p><p>[03:34:59]  The revised statement now says the agent discharged one round, striking one member of the group, no longer characterizing the shooting victim as an assailant. Marta Martinez was a witness to what happened. What she says she heard and saw was nothing like either account officials have given.</p><p>So when was the first indication there was a problem here? </p><p>MARTA MARTINEZ, EYEWITNESS:  When I heard the gunshot.</p><p>SAVIDGE:  Martinez says when she rushed out of her home, she didn't see a border patrol agent being attacked by a group.</p><p>MARTINEZ:  So I came out and got my phone and started recording. I didn't thought there was somebody dead. </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Marta live streamed the aftermath which has since been viewed thousands of times.</p><p>Marta Martinez had a front row seat to this tragedy because it happened literally right next door. She found the body of the young woman lying on the ground right there. There is still traces of blood. And if you come down here and look across her fence into this lot, there are other indications that something happened, a struggle or an altercation. Just look at the way the grass is all matted down.</p><p>Juan Gonzalez, the Rio Bravo fire chief was among the first responders to treat the woman who was shot. He says when he got there, she looked very young, very fatigued, and barely alive. When she stopped breathing, he says, rescuers carried on with CPR.</p><p>Did she say anything? Did she move in any way? Did she seem conscious?</p><p>JUAN GONZALEZ, FIRST RESPONDER:  No. She was not conscious, but she was breathing.</p><p>SAVIDGE:  Customs and border protection were to hold a news conference on Friday, but it was suddenly canceled, and then they reissued that revised statement. Experts say it's not uncommon in the course of an investigation to change when you begin to learn new insights.</p><p>One part that does trouble those same experts though is that when they removed the allegation that blunt force objects were used, in other words, kind of weapons that people picked up by this group that allegedly attacked the border patrol agent, when that was removed from the scenario, that is very troubling about the depiction.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL:  Martin Savidge there reporting.</p><p>CHURCH  Well, in the U.S. state of Maryland, flash floods turned this city street into a river Sunday.</p><p>HOWELL:  Murky water rushed through Ellicott City near the city of Baltimore. This situation is especially hard on residents there who just finished rebuilding from last year's floods about two years ago.</p><p>CHURCH:  And our meteorologist, Allison Chinchar, joins us now with the very latest on the devastating rain. Just incredible images there, Allison.</p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  That's right. And the unfortunate part for that town of Ellicott City is the topography that comes into play there because it sits at a low point, so all of the rain from the surrounding area ends up kind of flowing into that same spot.</p><p>So, not only do they get the rain that actually fell on Ellicott City, which is right here where my hand is, but a lot of the other areas where it begins to flow back down. They also pick up lot of that rain as it's making its way down towards some of the other rivers.</p><p>So in turn, they end up getting a lot more rain on their roadways and such than they would just based off of the rain coming down above them. But let's take a look at the overall amounts where my hand is located. This is where Baltimore is.</p><p>So notice the heaviest rain was just out to the west of that. Widespread amounts, about 150 to 250 millimeters of rain or about 6 to 10 inches total, which is incredibly high if that was, say, your entire day's worth of rain.</p><p>But for those locations, a lot of them picked it up in less than three hours. We talked about some of the rivers, creeks, and streams. This is a map of the Patapsco River, OK, showing kind of the gauge here. The blue line remaining steady and then within two hours making a huge jump of about 17 feet. Again, in just two hours.</p><p>They ended up breaking their all-time record crest at this river because of that heavy rain. Now, the good news is this particular region is getting a brief reprieve from the rain that will allow some of that water to recede. However, notice a lot of that moisture being pushed up from the south. That moisture is coming from subtropical storm Alberto.</p><p>Now, the heaviest rain associated with this is still really mainly impacting southeastern states like Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and such. But this system is going to continue to make its way off to the north.</p><p>We expect landfall to be within the next 12 hours. The winds will quickly start to die back down as it makes its way further inland but it's going impact other cities, Birmingham, Nashville, even into Chicago as we get later on into the week.</p><p>And with it, it's going to take some of that heavy rain. Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Key West dealing with incredible heavy rain. And a lot of those areas, by the way, are already dealing with an above average month of May for precipitation. And now, George and Rosemary, we're going to add an additional four to six inches on top of what they've already had.</p><p>HOWELL:  Looks like it's going to be a soaker.</p><p>[03:39:59]  CHURCH:  Yeah, it is. It most certainly is. A lot to cover there. Allison, thank you so much for bringing us up to date.</p><p>HOWELL:  Thank you, Allison. Still ahead here on \"Newsroom,\" Facebook's CEO insisted the company would follow the rules. But experts say the social media giant is already violating strict new European regulations. Plus this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH:  This woman claims her Amazon Alexa snooped on her conversation. How a series of unlikely events may have caused the error. You might want to rethink of all of this. We're back in a moment to explain.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHURCH  Welcome back, everyone. Well, Europe's sweeping data protection regulation came into effect on Friday, and CNN has learned separate lawsuits have already been filed against Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, and Instagram, alleging that the companies are failing to comply.</p><p>HOWELL:  That's right. Testifying in front of E.U. leaders on Tuesday, Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, insisted that his company would follow the rules. But as our Samuel Burke reports, legal experts believe that Facebook is already violating the new law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Austrian lawyer Max Schrems has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time. His NGO suing Facebook for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER:  We're looking for big companies that really willfully violate the law, that kind of try to ignore it and try to get away with it.</p><p>BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulation says he is taking legal action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS:  They're saying we don't want this. We think it's stupid so we don't want to comply with it. And then there is obvious business interests. There is certain things you simply can't do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p>[03:44:58]  BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UCI:  On your Facebook profile, you can put in things like sexuality, religion or political beliefs. And if you put that on, you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents to deliver advertising and so on.</p><p>BURKE:  There is only an \"I accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE:  Exactly.</p><p>BURKE:  There is not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE:  Exactly. You got it.</p><p>BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other websites too.</p><p>VEALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data it has about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>VEALE:  Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly. For a big company like Facebook, European data regulators can impose a fine of up to four percent of its global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said the company has, quote, introduced better tools for people to access, download, and delete their information. The company also says it's building a new tool that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May 25th.</p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have engaged in.</p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforced them properly, we can actually get a balance in this digitalize stage. In the end, you as a customer have the possibility to use let's say Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.</p><p>BURKE:  However, the courts come down on the tech giants. Europe's new data regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.</p><p>Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH:  OK. So Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa, can do many things.</p><p>HOWELL:  And apparently it can even snoop on your private conversations. Our Anna Stewart explains this one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's a cautionary tale of technology telling too much. A woman in Oregon says Amazon's Alexa recorded and then e-mailed a random person with a private conversation that took place in her house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion. Like immediately I'm like I'm never plugging that device in again. I can't trust it.</p><p>STEWART:  Amazon's Echo owner, Danielle, said she was chatting with her husband about hardwood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who works for her husband. She only found out about the recording when she received an alarming phone call.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The person on the other line said unplug your Alexa devices right now. We go around and unplug them all. He proceed to tell us that he had received audio files, recordings from what was going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART:  Amazon told CNN affiliate Kiro-7, the device misinterpreted commands like send message and the contact's name as part of the background conversation, and called it an extremely rare occurrence.</p><p>It's unknown if the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light up when it was activated, or if the device responded at all. Either way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH  Very unnerving. I have one of those at home. You don't.</p><p>HOWELL:  Kind of old school. I don't know if I want it, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH:  Yes. I'm not sure I still want mine now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOWELL:  What all it's listening to?</p><p>CHURCH  Well, I mean, it listens to everything. But I mean it -- it wakes up when you say \"Alexa.\" But, you know, obviously they didn't realize they had said \"Alexa.\" Luckily, they were only talking about wooden floors, right?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHURCH:  All right. We'll take a very short break. We'll be back in a moment.</p><p>[03:50:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOWELL:  It is Memorial Day here in the United States, a day set aside to honor the men and women of the armed forces who made the ultimate sacrifice defending this country.</p><p>CHURCH:  This weekend, the oldest living Pearl Harbor veteran made his mark in Washington. He paid tribute to fallen comrades and was honored himself as well. CNN's Dianne Gallagher has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy. </p><p>DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  A day that still plays out in the mind of Ray Chavez.</p><p>RAY CHAVEZ, OLDEST SURVIVING PEARL HARBOR VETERAN:  Every day.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Seventy-six years later --</p><p>CHAVEZ:  I saw all the ships on fire and a terrible smoke screen all through the harbor and covering the ships.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  At 106 years old, Chavez is the oldest surviving Pearl Harbor veteran.</p><p>CHAVEZ:  It never goes away, what you see. That's the way I am. I remember and then I forget and remember again.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Remembering, it's what brings Chavez to Washington, D.C. this weekend. Although he did meet President Donald Trump at the White House --</p><p>CHAVEZ:  I looked forward to it because I didn't vote for him, and I enjoy meeting him. Pleasant enough to have me right next to him when we were seated.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Chavez traveled across-country from San Diego to D.C., stopping in Kansas to refuel and meet with fellow veterans to attend the 150th Memorial Day Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.</p><p>[03:55:04]  He and his family are the guests of Defense Secretary James Mattis. But the navy veteran says more than all of the pomp and circumstance surrounding his visit, his focus is on those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. It's the act of remembering that is most important this holiday weekend.</p><p>CHAVEZ:  National remembrance day, because it's very important that the younger generation know and learn at the beginning of war.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Vice President Mike Pence spent part of his Friday at the TAPS Good Grief Camp with a younger generation that knows the consequences of war all too well.

Still, the 106-year-old says the purpose of this weekend is to honor the memory of those he served with.</p><p>CHAVEZ:  I never will forget that, because I met some real fine young men.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  And the sacrifice of the men and women who came after as well.</p><p>Dianne Gallagher, CNN, Atlanta.l (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL:  A day to reflect and to remember.

The bad news is that it's not those who are doing the actual work of producing journalism; instead, it's Google and Facebook, which have figured out how to \"monetize\" the publication of news. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A report (June10) in a study for the News Media Alliance holds that Google made $4.7 billion from the work of news publishers in 2018 through advertising linked to its search engine results and its Google News page. </p><p>Journalists ought to see some of that revenue, argues David Chavern, the president and chief executive of the alliance, which represents 2,000 U.S. newspapers.</p><p>The tech companies \"make money off the arrangement,\" Chavern said in The New York Times, \"and there needs to be a better outcome for news publishers.\" </p><p>If independent journalism is going to survive -- and continue to help communities, states and the nation sustain their democratic institutions -- the work of journalists must be supported.</p><p>\"News publishers need to continue to invest in quality journalism, and they can't do that if the platforms take what they want without paying for it. Information wants to be free, but reporters need to get paid,\" Chavern said in a release. </p><p>The problem facing media outlets -- newspapers, especially -- is a decline in revenue from subscriptions and advertising, a decline that has accelerated as media consumption has moved from print to online platforms. It's not that people have lost their appetite for trustworthy and valuable journalism; fewer are reading newspapers and magazines, but much of that former audience has shifted online, particularly to mobile devices. </p><p>Between 2006 and 2016, U.S. newspaper revenues fell 63 percent; from $49 billion to $18 billion, according to a 2017 report by the Pew Research Center. Even as overall circulation has fallen, Pew found, circulation revenue has shown moderate increases. The biggest losses have been in advertising revenue. </p><p>Where did much of that money go? </p><p>This is where Google, Facebook and even Amazon have been successful; the tech companies have the advantage of their millions of users and the personal data that users have obligingly provided. By using the data the tech companies have been able to target advertising, piggybacking it on the journalism that their users are increasingly looking for. </p><p>Google has denied the News Media Alliance's $4.7 billion figure, but the study notes Pew's findings that 93 percent in the United States get at least some of their news from online sources; that Google has in recent years updated its search algorithms to emphasizes news in its search results; and that YouTube, which Google owns, has also increased its news content.</p><p>The proof is in the clicks, News Media Alliance's study finds: 39 percent of results and 40 percent of clicks on trending searches are news results; 16 percent of results and clicks on \"most searched\" queries are for news. </p><p>A few ideas already have been offered to correct the advertising duopoly, including breaking up the big tech companies, ending or limiting their ability to sell targeted ads and even -- as proposed in the United Kingdom -- requiring Google and Facebook to pay a \"journalism tax.\" </p><p>But what may be in the best interests of newspapers and other journalism producers is for those creating content to share in the advertising juggernaut that Google and Facebook have developed. </p><p>That's the solution proposed in legislation introduced in Congress, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act. Introduced by bipartisan sponsors in the Senate and House, the bill would allow the newspaper industry to collectively bargain with the big tech companies for a share of the advertising revenue, giving them a four-year window -- free from antitrust regulation -- to negotiate a deal. </p><p>The legislation is narrowly tailored to address antitrust concerns; particularly a requirement that the entire industry benefit and not just a few of the nation's top publishers. </p><p>\"At the heart of this bill is helping newspapers survive amid shrinking circulations and massive layoffs,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, who with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, introduced that chamber's bill. \"Google and Facebook now control the news kingdom. They've pitted themselves against newspapers in a David-and-Goliath battle in which newspapers don't have a stone to throw much less a slingshot to put it in. The readers are the true losers as newsrooms empty out across this country.\" </p><p>The legislation has support from 48 press associations in 49 states, including the Washington Newspaper Publishers Association, Allied Daily Newspapers of Washington and the Pacific Northwest Newspaper Association. </p><p>Why would Google or Facebook even entertain the idea of negotiating a deal to share advertising revenue? </p><p>Because, without a robust culture of newspapers and other sources of journalism to produce the content that users are demanding, eventually neither will have much with which to attract advertisers.</p><p>Or does either think they can make $4.7 billion a year in selling advertising next to cat videos?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRICTY-B9731422414Z1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRICTY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCM-RHV1-JC3J-X0JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">308624</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Tri-City Herald (Washington) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tri-City Herald (Washington)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The rapid advancement of digitalization is behind many of the trends, profoundly challenging our personal and societal assumptions. The relationship between humans and technology is switching, with humans increasingly augmenting the decisions of artificial intelligence, rather than the other way around. For example, in the next decade there will be a greater proliferation of autonomous vehicles, whilst energy production and transmission will increasingly become the domain of algorithms rather than people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The next ten years will also be defined as an era of precision, particularly in healthcare, food, and materials science.  Agriculture and aquaculture will look toward robotics in combination with IoT-based and machine learning technologies to optimize crops and seafood at reduced cost.  Additionally, increasingly precise sensor data will help the food industry meet expectations from consumers for insight into the entire value chain for individual products.</p><p>Traditional business models will be disrupted. Space, which was once reserved for state players, will continue to be transformed by private enterprises, who are driving down costs, for example through reusable launchers, enabled by advances in computing and manufacturing.  The scope of Big Tech will widen as data becomes an increasingly important commodity, putting it toe-to-toe (and sometimes in partnership) with Big Pharma, for example.</p><p>Remi Eriksen, Group President and CEO of DNV GL, said, In an era where unicorns and mega-tech companies already seemingly appear overnight, what does the next decade hold for us? That technology development is accelerating is a given, but its digitalized, non-linear trajectory and global scale is hard for individuals to comprehend. DNV GLs Technology Outlook 2030 is focusing on five technology trends that are transformative in key industries: transport and logistics, energy, health care, and food. The industry that is possibly seeing the biggest change in the coming decade is health care. The human body is being analysed and described at levels of detail never previously possible and the rate of growth in data over the next five years is faster than in any other industry. Precision medicine and personalized treatments could vastly reduce nations cost of health care and improve the health of patients, who should also have control over their data.</p><p>As digital technologies transform multiple industries, the risk picture is changing. Current assurance methods focus on physical and business process risks, but there is an urgent need for industries to properly identify, understand and manage emerging digital risks.</p><p>Underperforming sensors, communication and algorithms, unintentionally (cyber safety) or deliberately manipulated (cyber security), are the principal sources of the new risks.  In addition, there is the increasing complexity of software systems, multiplied in uncertainty by machine learning and AI-based systems.</p><p>The digital transformation also opens new trust gaps in industries like food, health and manufacturing, in which a previously entirely physical-based business is augmented and eventually replaced by a digital business. Data on food nutrients and allergens, data on patients health conditions, and data on products to be additively manufactured need to be verified and secured.</p><p>Despite holding the potential to deliver a technological bliss, the Technology Outlook 2030 says that the next decade is in danger of being characterized by missed opportunities, particularly our inability to address climate change and inequality.  However, the keys are in ours hands to prevent negative outcomes, and with the correct regulatory framework, technology can greatly help to address humanitys fundamental challenges.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-161621001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP1-CT11-JDJN-61F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"661\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

We observed that while the U.S. enforcement agencies did not appear to support a regulatory approach to platforms and the digital economy, others like the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the UK Parliament's Digital Culture, Media and Sport Committee may have a stronger appetite for proactive regulation. Since that post, competition authorities, both U.S. and other, have intensified their focus, with activities ranging from sector-wide studies to investigations into individual tech companies.For example, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (DOJ) recently announced[2] a broad review of whether online tech companies have harmed consumers or otherwise reduced competition. The probe will cover leading online platforms in 'search, social media, and some retail services' and will focus on 'practices that create or maintain structural impediments to greater competition and user benefits.'That DOJ announcement is part of a broader effort by the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies to address competition in the tech sector. </p><p>Days later, the Attorney General met with eight State AGs[3] who reportedly are considering opening their own investigations. The FTC launched a tech task force[4] back in February (in addition to its recently concluded hearings on competition and consumer protection) and last month opened a formal antitrust investigation into Facebook (according to a recent press release[5] accompanying Facebook's Q2 earnings report). Reports[6] also have emerged of FTC information requests to third-party resellers on Amazon. Even the Antitrust subcommittee of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary has held a hearing[7] on online platforms and market power as part of its separate investigation.The U.S. agencies' overseas counterparts have remained just as active. In Australia, the ACCC just published the Final Report[8] from its Digital Platforms inquiry[9]. The inquiry focused on online search engines, social media platforms and other digital content aggregation platforms with an emphasis on Facebook and Google, and looked into the impact of digital platforms on competition in the advertising and media markets, and on advertisers, media content creators and consumers.The final report found that Google has 'substantial market power' in the supply of general search services and search advertising services in Australia, and that Facebook has 'substantial market power' in the supply of social media services and display advertising services in Australia. Both companies were found to have 'substantial bargaining power' in their dealings with news media businesses in Australia. The report cautioned that this market power could be used to damage the competitive process, though it did not look at whether these digital players have in fact misused their market power.The report offered 23 recommendations 'aimed at addressing some of the actual and potential negative impacts of digital platforms in the media and advertising markets, and also more broadly on consumers.' The recommendations most directly implicating competition include changing merger law to incorporate additional factors - such as the likelihood that the acquisition would result in the removal of a potential competitor from the market, and the nature and significance of assets, including data and technology, being acquired - and to require advance notice of acquisitions; and creating a new, specialist digital platforms branch within the ACCC to monitor and investigate proactively instances of potentially anticompetitive conduct by digital platforms and take action to enforce competition and consumer laws.The report also recommended changes to Australia's Privacy Act, including expanding the definition of 'personal information' to include technical data, strengthening notification and consent requirements and pro-consumer defaults, enabling the erasure of personal information, and introducing direct rights of action and higher penalties for breach, as well as establishing an ombudsman scheme to resolve complaints and disputes with digital platform providers. Additional recommendations focused specifically on news media (e.g. creating a code of conduct to promote fair and transparent treatment of news media by digital platforms, improving digital media literacy in schools and the communities, and offering greater funding for public broadcasters and local journalism).Similar undertakings are in the works around the globe. The ACCC report comes just as the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced the start of a formal market study[10] into online platforms and the UK market for digital advertising. The study will examine three potential sources of harm in digital advertising: (1) The market power of online platforms in consumer-facing markets - to what extent online platforms have market power and what impact this has on consumers; (2) Consumer control over data collection practices - whether consumers are able and willing to control how data about them is used and collected by online platforms; and (3) Competition in the supply of digital advertising in the UK - whether competition in digital advertising may be distorted by any market power held by platforms. Platforms not funded by digital advertising are expressly outside the scope of the study.In keeping with what appears to be a greater openness toward proactive regulation than the U.S. agencies (at least historically), the discussion of potential remedies in the CMA's Statement of Scope[11] explains that the 'current expectation is that any remedies are likely to focus on recommendations to Government for the development of an ex ante regulatory regime and are likely to require legislative change.' The CMA does not believe that a 'one-off' market investigation and intervention is 'sufficient to provide a sustainable long-term framework for the sector.' The five main areas in which remedies may be required include: (1) increasing competition through data mobility, open standards, and open data; (2) giving consumers greater protection over data; (3) limiting platforms' ability to exercise market power; (4) improving transparency and oversight for digital advertisers and content providers; and (5) institutional reform. The CMA plans to publish an interim report with initial findings in January 2020, with a final report to follow no later than July of next year.Not to be outdone, the EU - which recently has been fairly active in the tech sector, including last year's highly publicized Google Android decision - recently announced[12] a formal investigation into Amazon. The investigation focuses on Amazon's role as both a platform provider (through Amazon marketplace) and a participant on that platform (through its first-party retail offerings), asking whether Amazon's use of sensitive data from independent retailers is in breach of EU competition rules. Specifically, the Commission will look into (1) the standard agreements between Amazon and marketplace sellers, which allow Amazon's retail business to analyze and use third-party seller data; and (2) the role of data (including competitively sensitive marketplace seller data) in selecting the winners of the 'Buy Box,' which allows customers to add items directly to their shopping carts and accounts for the majority of Amazon transactions.As we cautioned previously, with so many competition authorities weighing in on how to assess tech competition, this confluence of inquiries and investigations can pose a challenge for global enterprises operating under an international patchwork of approaches. Technology-focused, data-intensive businesses should consider seeking antitrust counsel to monitor developing competition trends and implications across jurisdictions.

The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice came to an agreement last month over which big tech companies would fall under which agencies jurisdiction. According to Martin, the broader scope of the FTC's mandate could be more harmful to Facebook than the DOJ's oversight of Google.

Federal agencies staked their claim on big tech investigations last month when the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice struck a deal. Facebook and Amazon now fall under the FTC's jurisdiction, while Apple[4] and Google parent Alphabet[5] are under the watchful eye of the DOJ. According to Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, Facebook should be concerned because the FTC has a much broader scope than the DOJ. That, in turn, could open the social media giant up to a bigger and more impactful investigation, if there is one. \"All 5 FTC commissioners are appointed by the White House plus approved by the Senate, it's objectives (our view) are more politically aware,\" Martin said in a research note on Monday. The FTC's investigation process is also different than the DOJ's. It includes public hearings and receives considerable press coverage, whereas the DOJ has a more private and closed process. The agency's mandate also allows it to investigate different companies across any industry on the basis of protecting competition and preventing consumer harm. The DOJ has far less flexibility, according to its mission statement. According to Martin, that's good news for Google and Apple. \"It mentions law at every turn,\" Martin said. \"By implication, it is comparing laws on the books from the past and trying to apply them to new companies.\" Facebook and Google have come under increased scrutiny in recent months over the companies dominant position in the online advertising market. Martin estimates that Google would be worth 50% more if its broken up, but Facebook wouldn't be so lucky. There's also broader concern about big tech's upcoming battle against regulators globally and the impact it will have on growth. \"We believe FAANG growth rates are decelerating and they will increasingly enter each other's business to drive growth,\" she said. \"We believe that not all FAANG 's will survive this battle.\" Martin also warned that Facebook's margins are falling as costs are growing at 50% per year. Despite growing regulatory concerns and a year filled with privacy missteps, Facebook is up more than 40% so far this year.       \u00a0    <url

His venture-backed company had sold out to a big tech buyer, and because the deal was underpriced, his employer's stock-option plan was wiped out. \"Is the incentive stock option a thing of the past?\" he asked. \"What a waste of time!\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In light of the difficulties facing the high-tech industry, as well as the ongoing fight over options expensing, is he right? I've talked to attorneys, accountants, dealmakers and entrepreneurs. The response has been uniform: The death of employee stock options has been greatly exaggerated.</p><p>If anything, the uptick in M&amp;A and initial public offerings is already generating excitement in the tech community. For example, more than 1,000 employees at Google Inc.emerged from the search giant's August IPO as millionaires.</p><p>The fact is that stock options remain an effective tool to recruit and retain qualified employees. True, startups can offer an exciting environment, allowing workers to make their mark on the fledgling enterprise. But to attract top employees, a company needs to give employees a piece of the upside.</p><p>Cash is king with startups. So the usual question to prospective employees is, \"How much cash can you live on?\" The balance of pay is primarily in the form of options.</p><p>For tech startups, the initial stock-option pool is often significant, ranging from 15% to 30% or more of the outstanding shares. But building a solid team is critical, and that means sharing the wealth.</p><p>However, as the company nears its IPO, and as venture capitalists infuse funds, option grants get much stingier. Also, Wall Street is always hesitant about dilution, especially with the new requirements to expense options.</p><p>Watch your step</p><p>Still, tech startups issuing options must tiptoe through numerous minefields. One problem is the \"cheap stock\" charge, which the Securities and Exchange Commission, eager to keep a lid on corporate accounting and executive compensation scandals, is scrutinizing for companies filing to go public.</p><p>To avoid this problem, a company must determine the fair market value of its employee options when they are granted. In the past, when the regulatory environment was looser, startups could afford to be less precise in calculating the value of these transactions.</p><p>No more. Securities regulators are watching. The good news for corporate leaders is that cheap-stock problems are avoidable.</p><p>Take RightNow Technologies Inc., an on-demand software provider that went public last year. Susan Carstensen, the company's chief financial officer, says RightNow carefully documented a valuation for its stock. \"We looked at multiples of competitors to come up with a valuation,\" she says. \"We also adjusted for any rounds of financing. When Nasdaq crashed, we adjusted for this, too.\"</p><p>RightNow escaped any cheap-stock charges. In other words, it's a good idea for startups to implement internal tracking systems for their options plan. \"The temptation is to use Excel spreadsheets,\" says Phil Koehler, a human resources specialist with law firm Stradling Yocca Carlson &amp; Rauth.</p><p>That usually doesn't cut it. For startups, especially those preparing to go public, specialized recordkeeping and tracking software, such as technology from SGVestia Systems Inc., is an important auditing tool. By automating stock plan administration, for instance, this software helps track different option types, including incentive and nonqualified stock options, vesting schedules and exercises, among other things.</p><p>Of course, technology, as usual, isn't a panacea. Establishing an effective options plan requires hiring a good lawyer. Developing a basic plan typically costs from $5,000 to $10,000 and involves drafting a plan document, grant letters and other forms. The law firm also will deal with the federal registration exemptions, and then, as it grows, the company will incur ongoing administration costs.</p><p>Many startups also don't realize that they may need a more elaborate options plan to meet their particular needs. For example, a startup may have employees in India or other non-U.S. locales that can make designing a plan tricky. An experienced attorney can save startups aggravation and costs from civil liability. Issuing options triggers securities laws, so it's essential that companies make no misrepresentations.</p><p>Another potential problem is when companies grant options verbally or by e-mail, says Tom Cervantez, a lawyer for Davis Wright Tremaine LLP. Such an informal approach is not only messy, but also can lead to costly accounting and other headaches.</p><p>Despite such issues, use of options in techland is going strong. Philippe Kahn, who founded Borland Software Corp. and LightSurf Technologies Inc., an image-messenging company acquired earlier this year by VeriSign Inc. for $270 million, remains high on options. A tech startup flourishes as a result of \"teamwork, positive attitude and performance,\" Kahn says, \"and stock options help in these three key components of success.</p><p>Tom Taulli is co-founder of CurrentOfferings.com, an independent advisory and research firm, and author of \"The Complete M&amp;A Handbook.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-1115235454244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4G4F-S2K0-TWK1-92MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Deal, L.L.C.</copyright><publicationName>Daily Deal/The Deal</publicationName><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Tech-Confidential.com\">http://www.Tech-Confidential.com</url><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>May 9, 2005 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ORCL (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.industry\"><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>All US</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI0M0I0QjVFQjkwNDdCMzgwQUIyNTU4RUE4NTkyQUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjRFNjIwMDZBQ0FBNDdBRkFGRTMxMkE0RUNGMEVEMkQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Stock Options</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg2NENENTFGNTQwNEI4NUJDMjBBNzc3NzgyNTlCQTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUU2OTQ1RTEwODA1NERCNEE0MDQxNEQwODAzOTNGMzg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEHO</classCode><className>TECHNICIANS &amp;

Below are the comments that we were able to note down: these may somewhat paraphrased, often exact, but shouldn't be treated as a verbatim transcript. We missed some bits, and skipped some comments, which we either didn't get, or were repetitive, or when I was commenting. We've identified speakers wherever possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, I reached some 15 minutes late, so only caught a part of some great opening remarks from Dr Anupam Saraph, which haven't been included below. Two fun parts: firstly, a person from Hindustan Unilever saying that he's speaking in his personal capacity, and then going on to make a company specific comment. Secondly, an ICICI Bank representative trying to justify buying personal data from clubs etc and using that for marketing (i.e. spamming). Go figure. Anyway, here are the notes from yesterday:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaker: The adjudication mechanism is not working. It often leads to compensation and damages.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: What kind of mechanism are you suggesting?</p><p>Speaker: Why don't we have an online dispute mechanism, where the judicidary inteferes at the end. The organisation or the regulator works this online dispute resolution. The redressal handling mechanism of digital india has failed.</p><p>Everything seems to be linked to consent. It's based on one single button which has I agree. There is no statutory mechanism which legalises I agree. It's dicey: how do we take it as evidence when I agree button is pressed. Is one sided contracts legal? Lets legalise via the I Agree button where there is some statutory support. Consent is going to be based on one button.</p><p>Deliberations have been going on related to a [Privacy law ]since 2006. Aadhaar has been fining people when they keep data at a local level. You put an FIR on them, but what happens to that data? Huge amount of data is with them. Can't we have a right to purge? Courts will have better decision making power.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: We are so focused on digital transactions, we forget what is going on in digital life. That is required to be statutorily there for a specified period. Can we say that it should be immediately deleted or permanently deleted.</p><p>Speaker: What statutes are mandated, what is the amount of time that the data is withheld? Should be between 3-5 years, and other reasonable restriction in courts, till the matter is not settled.</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: Data risk is one instance that we're are interested in. The key question is, what is actually be personal data. Our proposition is that it should be personally identifiable information. We dont think there should be a distinction between sensitive personal data and personal data. We will end up landing up where we are now, with a meaningless list approach. The fact with big data is that proxies are used as links to information. The first proposition is that we should have one standard of personally identifiable information, and there is no excessive compliance issues there.</p><p>On NTPs: there needs to be a difference between controller and processor. If you can slice up the controllers into systemically important entities, medium risk entities and low risk entitied, and ex entities involve with them to prevent data breach. Pre-breach, what non threatening measures can we take. Can we give information guidance, and talk about private warnings, public statements ebfore you have the mass scale breaches before there is panic. On the point of consent, whether it should be a primary ground of processing: it should not be a primary ground. It should exist, but the role of consent has changed: it is a notice to the individual, and no longer is it a permission. All the obligations there should be a legitimate purpose test. There is a six clause formulation: whether the collection islegal, necessary and proportionate. So you balance the interest. Consent is no longer what you look to understand the right and the obligation, whether it is necessary or proportionate. If at any stage it fails the test, of collection, processing etc.</p><p>We've spoken with multiple providers who are seeing data as risk, and see it [data] as a toxic asset. Co-regulation is an important tool but it should be a part of the responsive framework. There can be a pyramid of sanctions, and a pyramid of support, for better data practices. One is the point of protecting individuals. Secondly it's important to enable data flow.</p><p>Rama Vedashree, DSCI: What is the framework that you have in mind to classify controllers as low risk, medium risk and systematically important?</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: The finance sector has some points: if you look at the Basil committee, one part of it is interconnectedness. A central database which a lot of databases use. Another is the volumes that they are exposed to. There are issues related to capitalisation. What is relevant is the amount of peoples information they are holding. When you categorise, organisations should have enhanced supervision tools. There are other tools that they could have. A lot of larger organisations are open to regulatory conversations. This can help reduce and minimise the risk.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: Instead of being systemically important, it could be important from the point of view of the harm it could cause.</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: If you have at a market level the electoral rolls being called into question, that is different from inaccurate info for a few people.</p><p>Vikram Gopikar, TCS: My question is specific to article 2.3, which calls for retrospectice application, whether that would be feasible. There is an illustration in the South African regulation, within one year of collection, they need to be applicable to the act.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: Data is already collected. All the data collected is capable of being misused. Should it or not be subject to the same stringency as what is collected today? Deal with it the same manner as it is today.</p><p>Nancy Jane: There are laws missing: for example IT guidelines for cybercafe rules. Quite often we give this information, and the data is both digital and non digital as well. Both the non digital data should be protected. DSCI had come with a manual. When the police collects data, in case the data is leaked it affects the image of the victim. There are times where rape victim videos have been leaked. Related to corporate espionage, should juristic persons be protected? they should be. Considering that there are lot of infringement, we should protect their interest as well. There is a responsibility to protect that as well. Data protection should be retrospectively applicable. There should be a time-frame given for compliance.</p><p>Aditya Birla group representative: A lot of data is going to be with the government and it should be the role model, and Aadhaar data is with the government. There are chances of leakage. It's important that we apply the principles as well. Another important point which the industry is facing is the extraterritorial jurisdiction. If we could have a treaty at a country level for a safe harbour, it would help us.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: What are you suggesting when you're talking about extraterritorial jurisdiction? Is it data pertaining to India, or to Indian citizens?</p><p>Aditya Birla Group: If it's an Indian citizen, there should make the person accountable if they're extracting the data. Thereby the citizen of India is feeling secure. From a GDPR perspective, the way the law is, that they have extraterritorial jurisdiction. Somewhere a treaty as a global level.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: That is a matter of international treaties, and not of the law.</p><p>Aditya Birla Group representative: I don't agree with the principle of localisation of data, but certain sensitive data can be localised.</p><p>Ashwin, VC: Related to anonymised data: it's practically impossible to use anonymized data, and ensure that it cannot be used beyond the scope. Anonymised data should be defined which should be out of the purview of private data. That is needed because many laws and frameworks cannot be implemented on certain data, in terms of scope. It's practically impossible to define the use and inform the user.</p><p>Krishna: We should stress on privacy and data protection of India, instead of data protection act. We need to stress on it, and keep on repeating privacy, privacy privacy. We need to consider social cultural aspects of India, we have specific sensitive elements. When we define the personal information and sensitive personal information we need to look at social aspects. Consent is coming ahead of notice in the draft, ahead of consent. Notice needs to be ahead of consent.</p><p>Anveshan Roy: We work in understanding movement of people in and out of locations using wifi analytics. Our recommendation of MAC ID should be non personal. Every device has a MAC ID, and that is not personal information. Seeing the potential in India. One cannot identify the person by the MAC ID.</p><p>J Srikrishna: How is it not personal?</p><p>Anveshan Roy: If you have a wifi router and a sensor, your phone has MAC ID should not be personal if it is anonymised completely.</p><p>Gulshan Rai: Technically it is possible to identify the MAC address of the person.</p><p>Anveshan Roy: If I'm the only personal in this room, I can do the reverse engineering. MAC ID has to be tagged with other form of data capture. For us, the initial bit is anonymised and aggregated. We're not capturing IP address.</p><p>Anveshan Roy's Colleague: MAC ID is not identified. If it is merged with another data sourced, consent should be required.</p><p>Another speaker: IP Address should be under the personally identified information. Each category in sensitive personal information should be very very well defined. Regarding the children, in cybercrime, most cases are children related. The pictures should be asked only if necessary. People take pictures, upload it. If it's a 16-17 year old, the pictures are going into the dark web. We need to take care. Take it only when necessary. They should give them an option, even when the school is storing this information in its database, we need protection of data and enforce certain rules. The concern is of privacy of children. The last point is: even parents, are posting pictures of children. Some warning systems for information like that.</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: On the horizontal application point, it would be meaningless to have different laws. The interesting one is around jurisdiction: one is the territorial jurisdiction, it should be everyone in the country. no provider can check your citizenship. There are companies who are conducting business in India, anyone buying goods and services should be protected irrespective of where it is being delivered from. Where there is an entity outside of india, and there's a process, even there, where that processor is processing data in India, there should be a cause of action against them.</p><p>Identifiability and anonymisation: it must be a technology neutral law. The questions will be specific: the first is related to the identifiability of the individual. The law applies to an identifiable natural person, and this can be defined. You can provide a list which is indiciative list at a principles level. Anonymation and pseudonimisation technologies are evolving, if its not identifiable then its not applicable. We can come at clear articulation.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: if it's not applicable today and is possible later, the law should apply later.</p><p>Gulshan Rai: How do you classify rights on entities outside of India?</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: The first is the jurisdiction clause: Foreign companies doing business in India, second is whether they are data controller or processor for our purposes. The offering of goods and services, you would have a claim under the consumer protection law. Purely on the fact that they're offering goods and services. There is a legitimate purpose test.</p><p>Gulshan Rai: He's a data collector when you open the account. The other is when they are storing the data.</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: the third aspect is legitimate purpose. We will need sector specific regulations.</p><p>Anupam Saraph: A concern: increasingly there is a trend that harvesting of information is normal and natural. It assumes that there is nothing wrong about it. If we have to protect somebody, and protecting people who are transacting parties The minute we forget that, where I can photograph and bug you throughout the data, or access to your bank account that I have the right to harvest for whatever purpose, is completely irrelevant. There is no wilful consent and participation. There is no legitimate reason for collecting this. I think this as a big concern. Who are we protecting and whom are we protecting them from. If we don't define these two parties, then we would have lost an opportunity to say that data isn't the new oil. it's not another commodity, It's about ensuring that by protecting data we can build transactions of parties within the country.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: That's where malavika's formulation about consent. There is accident and evidence. The purposiveness of the test becomes important. The purpose for which security camera will get a tick mark.</p><p>A speaker: The lessons from the IT Act have to be implemented. The implementation lacks the teeth. The second is the awareness to the data subjects. Are we making some efforts to tell them what is privacy.</p><p>ICICI Bank representative: On purpose specification and a citizens choiceOne citizen might not want to get offers given to them which is not directly related to what they have given consent to. There would be others who would want this information. A choice to the citizens should still be kept, and citizens should be given an option to opt. There's massive criticism on clickwraps, unless people agree to the terms and conditions. If we want to give someone an option, should the law prescribe what should be informed consent? The person may not choose to get the information, but the service should still be available.</p><p>Notices which are to be given, the paper talks about consent fatigue. From an industry perspective there could be a common notice, which could be framed with the sectoral regulator. Every bank is going to send a similar notice.</p><p>Often there is a requirement to source customers. Once a customer comes and engages with an organisation, it is only then they enter into a contract. When you are trying to source customers, like in club diaries and industry manuals. How should that organisation be liable for using that data which is in the public domain?</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: If I become a member of the club. I give them my data. I give for the purpose for my association with the club can be carried forward. If you as ICICI go and take it, isn't it a failure of the purpose test? I didn't allow the club to give it to ICICI or HDFC? How you source your data, you find out what can be done. But today I get emails from ICICI.</p><p>ICICI Bank: There's a distinction between sensitive personal information and personal information. How we were perceiving that was in terms of the harm which is caused. In the prospective list, under the SPDI rules, it includes financial information. While all other constituents, which is intrinsic to a human body, the harm which can be caused with that data is different from financial data.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: Financial data is personal data. Tomorrow someone finds out you have Rs 100 crores in the bank and you'll get a call from Dubai. Sensitiveness to data is apart from the inherent nature of the data. It is sensitive.</p><p>Gulshan Rai: Malavika was saying that you raise the standard of personal data [to sensitive personal data, and not that you reduce the standard of sensitive personal data to personal data].</p><p>Professor Nagarjuna from TIFR: The law should have a directional principle, where you would say what kind of measures would enhance data security. There is a linkage of information to a large number of agencies. One clear law that one can make is to say that the greater the linkage, the greater will be the leakage. If you have 1 billion people, each person has at least 10 social service leakages, there will be 10 billion leakages. Therefore, is it int he scope of this document to specify what kind of measures would enhance data security? Could it say that linkages to various services should be reduced. There may be business interests, and other interests, but not in the interest of citizens. Greater the harvesting rights given to people, the security will come down. What are the models that will decrease or increase the data security. We are talking about data processing techniques. We need a public audit of data processing. Similar is the case of encryption, rather than some expert committee, because there is a possibility of selection of experts. It's also important for us to say that when I give consent, the agency should also give an undertaking. There are devices that we use which have device identities. They are potentially capable of becoming sources of harvesting.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: You're saying that there should be an undertaking. Why is it needed if the law says you're liable. Undertaking is what he tells you as private contract.</p><p>Prof Nagarjuna, TIFR: Doctors give an oath. Those are some kinds of roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: (something on the lines of an oath is a moral commitment, and not enforceable).</p><p>Sandeep Arora, Market Research industry: One of the things that I've noticed, is that we seem to be too worried. We're seeing the dark side. In this world today that there is so much data that it can help people. We're able to understand the causes of diseases. We have the technology today, it would be foolish and myopic that we don't do it for the better benefit of the humankind. I would want to enhance the motivation of the law, that it has the necessary balance in place for us to ensure that the benefits that it brings to people and consumers is kept in mind. I have a couple of points: In market research industry, we need to keep understanding people. It can lead to a state called mass customisation. You can give a larger solution at an aggregator level, we can understand mass customised solution raise. We need to keep understanding a person more and more. If you have understood them once, you can go and ask questions all over again, or you can go to a proxy and start from thereafter. For us it is very important that we are able to maintain and get incremental insights.</p><p>On the quality checks: we have to go back and perform the necessary checks, and for that we have to maintain recontactability.</p><p>On informed consent: There are two-three elements. One is a blanket consent. Do I really, as a consumer, a right to negotiate different parts of what I'm consenting to. I have to go and agree. There are some dark elements sitting there</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: When I go for a LIC they ask me hundred questions, and say I give you only my name and age? Therefore, the larger test would be purposive.</p><p>Sandeep Arora: Sometimes we are not able to understand the purpose.</p><p>Ranjeet Rane from Reserve Bank IT, speaking in personal capacity: I think that the law should take into consideration that in a very small span of time, we have sene concepts like password become irrelevant with technology. For example, fingerprints. On the financial information side, the law should list down what should list down what should be sensitive. Considering that we are aggressively pushing financial information, I would request the committee to have a view to look at financial information as sensitive personal information.</p><p>Beni Chugh, Dvara Research: Two issues keep recurring: for how long should the information be retained. If we think of legitimate processing test as a step of the framework. It's more of a framework that we're proposing. The CICs are required to retain data for seven years. For other records like vaccination, these are taken care of by the legitimate processing test. There is a need for sectoral regulators to come. On consent, there is behavioral eocnomics to show that it cannot be the exclusionary ground. On one hand, you have legitimate processing, and the obligation to not cause harm. We come at a solution that emerges organically. If I take a photo at a photo booth, it cant be sold on the dark web.</p><p>Shagupta USIS: In terms of the right to be forgotten, it does not allude to the context. To our mind the use should be very limited, in case of theft and financial fraud. It would be better to have broad principles. We saw TRAI and CCI getting into a conflict. The third part is data localiation: that there shouldn't be blanket localisation.</p><p>In terms of data processors and controllers, there are intermediaries. They might not be processing or controlling the data.</p><p>(made some more points but spoke too fast)</p><p>Data minimisation should be replaced with a no harm principle, with artificial intelligence coming in.</p><p>The penalties should be in proportion to the harm. Just because the companies have high turnover.</p><p>Wrt children, we feel that there could be 3 categories, where it is less than 13 years, where parental guidance is mandatory. Next is 13-18 with individual consent along with parental guidance, and then above 18.</p><p>Vickram Krishna: Much of what is concerned with communications impinges on the pesonal sphere. We are close to a cusp where we are in a position to be a serious global player again, provided we have the right laws. One thing that is criticial data management. If there is some place in the world where it is very very important for how personal data is handled, that is a model that we have to respect. If you look at Germany, one of their largest auto makers, Volkswagon cut a sorry figure where they were trying to defeat global standards. What's worse is that Germany has taken a hit for the understanding of technology. We should be setting an example to the world for how we can respect the personal data of our citizens at a level that is at least as high. This is really an opportunity for us and we must take it.</p><p>Suvendra Tulsian: It looks like everyone is overcautious about data. Law should be practical, but we cannot ignore the technology. Law which is good for Europe is not necessarily good for India. Most of the discussion is about protecting data at storage or in transition. Look at the way data is generated: Whatever data we have with UIDAI is protected. Can the UIDAI guarantee that the fingerprint they're getting is not getting leaked? If the whole purpose of UIDAI is properly authenticating the user, they cannot guarantee authentication, how can they allow financial transaction using Aadhaar. One is the consuming party and other is verifying party. The law should make both parties liable for ensuring that the right fingerprint is submitted. The third suggestion is about MAC ID, that one should be able to capture it. In IOS and Android MAC ID is not allowed, because they understand that this is a problem. Because directly and indirectly one can reach the person. We need to recognise the machine but it should be using a virtual ID, not MAC ID. The only use is on the organisational side. What the device is the company shouldn't come to know.</p><p>Harsha Vohra, Data Locus: In the previous law there were definitions of data and access which were broad. We had to take legal opinions from multiple law firms, and not even two of the opinions were same. At the same time, companies in western countries they could formalise a code of conduct. My request is to a data protection authority which could be used by entrepreneurs to take a decision before they start up. We've seen that a lot of innovation is not happening because the laws are not clear. Companies in the US which work on images captured by satellites. Laws can be formed to help in these kind of innovations.</p><p>Shreyas Bhargave, Capgemini (personal capacity): The need for physical documents as proof when we're doing eKYC. If we talk about data security on the digital and physical side. Can the law specify remove the need for physical documents if we're doing in a digital manner.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: People collect for purpose. Data minimisation is the principle.</p><p>Speaker: gives example of new android guidelines, and says that there should be function driven purpose limitation.</p><p>Justrice Srikrishna: That is what Malavika (Raghavan) was talking about with purpose driven regulation</p><p>(Someone sitting in front of me turns around and says to Malavika: This will be called Malavika's Data Protection Act :))</p><p>NS Napinay: I was under the impression that the consultation was going through follow through in the question format. I have a lot more questions than answers. We are faced with a situation where dolls and toys are collecting data, TV shows are facial data, not just usage behaviour. Whether it is offline or online, we don have ring fences protecting information. India has the advantage of doing cherrypicking. The white paper has a west to east flow, in terms of laws. We are on one hand are looking at taking from robust regimes who have learnt from their mistakes, and we are looking at jumping on the bandwagon and going to the gdpr. How ready are we? How much confidence can we have of data controller with just conformance rather than compliance. We've had some skeleton laws in the part of the IT Act. They prescribe certain provisions. Every single provision has been treated more as a tick mark. We may even have a due diligence. Each just leads to a report being filed and it doesn't reflect reality. 90% of what is laid down will result in compliance, but even in the compliance, if we can ensure that merely the tick marks protects the individual rights, we would gain.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: Vishakha guidelines have been in operation for so many years. Every company has to have to have a special committee to deal with sexual harassment. What implementation do you see on the shop floor? The law is good. The mindset has to change? Is there any solution?</p><p>NS Napinay: only two things drive the world: Fear or greed.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: that is right, so we have fines on global turnover, or prison.</p><p>NS Napinay: the command and control and coregulation: Self regulation and coregulation have always worked better than command and control. Command and control only works only if we have a fear of retribution which results in its adherence. That's the way we might have to go with data protection: not just the kinds of data, but also balance thekinds of protections we are putting for each kinds of data. What is the purpose: to protect the individual, empower, enable them or just to enable governance? Is to enable businesses, whether big data analytics. One flip side of this is that businesses need as much leeway with data as they need a law. If we don't have as much of a robust law as the EU GDPR, so business comes here. It needs to enable rights and puts the individual at the centre. The governments rights have to be balanced based on the social contract theory that it is the individual that prevails. \"And the law hangs limb, and barks but never bites\". TDSAT cannot be an authority to decide on data protection, or cyber issues. The secretary ministry IT cannot be the adjudicating officer. When I look at the Schrems case, my utopian dream would be like the EU Court of Justice in India. If that isn't enabled, what will the act be about.</p><p>Rahul from HUL: Part of the data governance team, but speaking in personal capacity. For most of the ecommerce companies now coming, the natural method of the business means that they collect a lot of data. One big purpose is enhanced consumer experience. The other essential entity is the manufacturer, whose product is traveling back to the household. Manufacturer also wants to enhance the consumer experience. If there could be a check-button which allows the consumer to say that I want to give the data to the manufacturer.</p><p>There are many companies in the space of technology who are servicing consumers and businesses, and there's always a chance of interlinking data from one to the other, which gives them a magnitude of strength. There are entities like Google, which has its android platform which can be shared for their services too.</p><p>Debashish Bhattarya from Broadband India Forum: There has been a lot of talk about why we need to protect data. Just to play the devils advocate, where data has not been use to harm anyone, to write the law in a manner that kills sources of innovation is not a good idea.</p><p>Today India is being looked at a global knowledge hub. We are undergoing innovation which is data driven. Data innovation and privacy can be compatible. The data driven innovation cannot be scaled without adequate privacy safeguards, without the trust of the users. Hence it is critical to empower users without overregulating. The law needs to be outcome driven rather than prescriptive.</p><p>Secondly, collection and processing of data should be allowed with minimal restrictions, where there should be control for the data subject, with the right to recall and opt out, and the accountability for the data controller. The next point is that preventing harm principle is a better approach. In terms of the comparison between the roles for the data controller and data processor. The law should not unreasonably intervene int he relationships between data controller and data processor.</p><p>In terms of a data protection authority, there should be corporate accountability and an ombudsman, the principle should be a self regulatory model. Only in case of a deviation, the ombudsman should have a right to intervene.</p><p>In terms of right to be forgotten, it should be for information not publicly available information.</p><p>IIT Mumbai professor: Oil produces production and should be taxed, and therefore when you're using someones data, they need to give proof and why they're using it for. The onus on collecting the data is on the controller. There are now tools available, and philosophies like distributed computing, privacy by design. Things are possible. Why not have laws that are not enforceable? You could make references to these things to give direction. Data has two roles, like a knife: for murder or cutting vegetables. We are formulating new laws. Google and Facebook are very powerful. These are very powerful entities. If it fine to have a legal framework in which they manipulate and control us.</p><p>Ajit: On data localisation, I have a view that asking for data to be localised put a lot of problems from an economic perspective, but is there way to force service providers to give direct access on an MLATs process? If that can change then that is reasonable. Something which says that anyone who provides servies in the countries, that woul dbe good. We shouldn't be asking for data localisation. I don't see anything in the paper about information on dependent entities. What are the expectations from a privacy perspective?</p><p>Cognizant representative: We have captured things from a transactions perspective, and most clients say that India isn't adequate. They offload a lot of things on us in the clauses and tehre is no negotiation. The business team has to think about an Indian version of GDPR, with the same rigour. If the committee could take that into view, while drafting a bill. In terms of access to data by data subjects, when requested by data subjects, we need to give access and modify.</p><p>In terms of the DPO, it is a cost. If the law imposes such a requirement, it is a cost. Our submission is that please keep that flexible to not keep an in-house DPO and outsource to an agency like a company secretary.</p><p>Puneet Awasthi, Market Research Industry: We collect personald ata and opinions. If a person after a year of volunteering that information, and if a large number of people do that, then that has a huge impact. RTBF should be for personal identifiable data, and the analysis should remain. There's also under element, around defining elements that constitute private and personal data. There are data which are not identifiable with a biological entity.</p><p>Shivani Nadkarni: The law that comes out will create an ecosystem of auditors, DPOs etc, and one the biggest challenges is that the awareness is very very low. Very few people understand the difference between data privacy, data security and data protection. The awareness levels need to be increased. Some suggestions I had: There is a mention of bringing out a pictoral notice. What are the other ways in which consumers are in a position to understand and take a decision. Organisations could be helped with specific standards and guidelines in ther form of seals and certification, which helps them understand the level of risk and compliance and thus take a decision. The law could build in structures to build these kind of implementation.</p><p>Ayushi Mishra: Is this law on the horizontal level or the vertical level?</p><p>Justice Srikrishna (with a twinkle in his eye): The law will be spherical in nature. It will cover all 360 degrees.</p><p>Naman from Access Now: [gives too long an intro about Access Now] There needs to be the withdrawal of consent, allowing the data to be deleted. The second would be regarding self regulatory mechanisms: in euripe and otherwise, only mandatory frameworks work and are required. Industry inputs in terms of what they should be and how they should evolve, and are required.</p><p>Brinda Mazumdar: The scope we're talkig about in terms of natural persons, looking at both the living and the dead. Even dead persons personal information could be misused.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: In Puttaswamy, no one argued for a dead persons aadhaar number.</p><p>Ayush, from Bloomberg Qiunt, speaking in his personal capacity: There has been a mention about informed consent. The point I want to make it is that people have concerns around the data that the big tech companies have. The first is that the monster in terms of what access they have, is a lot more nuanced. The kind of permissions that we're giving these apps. In the UK everyone talks about iOS giving more secure than android, while Google is facing a class action suit, where data was accessed by Google. Google's response is that they used a Safari workaround. The case has only come up now. The second one is that Uber has been in the news for all the wrong reasons, where Uber was accessing location even after completing the trip. I don't think it's black and white.</p><p>My concern is that when you speak to them, they dismiss it on a technological ground, else they say please fight this out in California. These big tech companies shoudl we have a robust enough framework to bring them to court.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: whoever operates in India is subject to Indian law.</p><p>NSDL representative: With regards to consent, there should be a lifecycle of the consent, and they ought to take a periodic consent. Many times consent is drafted, the individual is not allowed to say no. For example, if I'm giving KYC data to a bank account, I could be asked to give the data to the credit card. In terms of revokation of content, I shoul dbe allowed to revoke consent. In terms of data collection, does the consent also apply to other information that I have not submitted, which they have to acquire from the third party.</p><p>In case someone dies there should be an heir to the data. The heir should have a legal authority to take authority to take action. So many times, the data of the dead can be misused again the living. Protection of the livign because of the data of the dead is also important here.</p><p>What happens if I collect data from the Internet, why can't I use the data? how can you say its misuse of data?</p><p>Medical data and financial data is contradicting: if I'm in a coma and someone needs my medical records, will my consent be required?</p><p>USIBC representative: supports a light touch regulation with freedom of movement of data. It recommends that the govt prepares privacy principles similar to OECD.</p><p>Nikhil (that's me): made a point about mass surveillance and why governments need to be governed by this law, and there were judicial oversight mechanisms which were not allowed as amendments to the Aadhaar act; the need for data minimisation, poor implementation of Aadhaar which is putting citizens at mass risk; also the problems with mass customization and predatory behaviour; the need for consent because consent is a switch (countering Malavika Raghavan's previous statement about consent primarily serving the purpose of notice.</p><p>Another Speaker: Sector regulators have sometimes been bought in. It would be a problem if we allow sectoral regulators to determine granular parts of the law. We ould end up areas where the same individual and same data is seen under two microscopes. The last point is of due sunset clauses. Will we do it for one year, five years. Having such a clause would help such a law be futuristic, where we can go back to this law every three years.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: You're talking about a suset clause for the law?</p><p>Speaker: There could be clauses that would need to be checked for relevance periodically.</p><p>Suchana, Hindustan Unilever: On the point on consent around medical issues, as a corporation we often are at crossroads where we have to decide how much to share when one of our people needs medical information. Thus, taking informed consent when I am the custodian. The law can provide exceptions for reasonableness considering exigencies, and security measures that I need to take before sharing.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: the whole idea is for everybody to understand what everyone is saying</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: I wanted to provide a couple of ways in which we could look at the liability section. There's a section on accountability and enforcement tools. If we look at the objectives to promote the agency of people,</p><p>Justice Srikirishna: benefit and empower, give them control and prevent harms</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: The formulation that we're thinking through are a list of rights, which will be the fount of the obligations. You must take consent, you must allow access to data, there should be a statutory you could allow strict liability standards for specific rights. The good thing about strict liability, if you're thinking about insurance, it always need a strict standard. For the ex ante measures, you should have strict liability. The second level is this idea of harms, and there are regulators who have started defining harms: They've worded it widely in terms of actual injury or loss. You can have a reasonable efforts standard for this. We should have a reasonable clear standard for the right to informational privacy. The interesting thing is that we are not actively misusing data. The IT Act does so. None of this is that we are new to. In India, nothing will work because we don't have regulatory capacity.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: We are concerned with normative standards.</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: Firstly when we think about the powers of the regulators, we want to make the case for ex ante supervision before the breach. Every time we've had intersectoral coordination in case of ULIP. The FLRC recommendations did look at private and public warnings. You could have a range of investigative powers. It is useful for the regulators to escalate some of these things. IF you have a regulator that speaks softly but carries a big stick is in the insterest of the ecosystem. Two other things: a complaints database. The consumer regulators in the US. Aadhaar already has a complaints databse. You could look technology to mine this data and have a heatmap for which types of agencies. The other is the notion of reg-tech.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: There could also be a complaint about the privacy of the organisation where it could be used to victimise.</p><p>Malavika Raghavan: It could use differential privacy and a frequency graph. The other issue s the accountaiblity of the regulator. It could be the enforcement directorate. That transparency is important to signal the market. Ex Ante these things need to be looked at.</p><p>All types of national identifiers, there need to be some restrictions around their disclosure and use. These should be use limited. There was a final point around data controllers. Because we talked abou tentities interating with consumers who are not the controller. Any entity interfacting witht he consumer collecting the data. the reason why this is important: they only perform an aggregation.</p><p>Justice Srikrishna: There is one entity which collects data, does not process, hands to A, B, C, and if there's a breach at the end point who should be held liable?<br/><br/>Malavika Raghavan: Data controller is the person who is collecting data from the user. And the person for whom the data is collected. Everyone is a processor or a controller, and there should be joint liability.</p><p>Rajat Moona: In IPC the notion of accomplices is already there.</p><p>Vickram Krishna: We've seen in India, that the amount of concentration of corporate power is following the same pattern as conglomeration in Europe. The second is that we all take it for granted that Antarctica is meling. We have arguments about why it is melting. But people are convinced taht it is because of human action. So we don't take it for granted. What I found missing in the white paper is the possibilty that w ehave some other way of managing our production, our productivity. We dont think of civil society as being productive. That's not the way it used to be. There's no recognition of it in the white paper.</p><p>This is the new production.</p><p>Speaker: There is one way in which it leads to data protection. Any centralisation leads to data vulnerability. What are the ways in which citizens can be empowered is a distributed model. Empowerment of citizens. What is the time when data protection would enhance.</p><p>Justice Srikirishna: lets forget the law totally. Today someone will ask you your name etc etc. Person might do it because they want to give you better service.</p><p>Speaker: Instead of a single large silo.</p><p>Srikrishna: Data collection is a fact of life. There should be a right for people to say dont do it, dont do it for this purpose, use it for this purpose.</p><p>Speaker: We can set the direction in which it is moving. I want to keep my wallet in my hand.</p><p>Other speaker: About the exemptions proposed in the white paper. There should be certain minimum obligations. For example if you have for personal use in household purposes, for example matrimonial lists whic can be published online. You could have an app like truecaller. Soe obligations nad restrictions need to be kept.</p><p>On national security, you have the DNA data bank, for investigative purposes, but ithas huge potential for violation of privacy.</p><p>Srikrishna: it's to do this more scientifically. The DNA data bank. It should be done or not be done?</p><p>Speaker: The first draft suggested collected the data of everyone.</p><p>Srikrishna: The criminals are limited scenes of crimes, for the purpose of modus operandi.</p><p>Speaker: The second draft removed that and restricted it to criminals. The data protection authority should have the power to prevent it. Then there are searches of devices at the borders.</p><p>Another speaker: DNA and fingerprints are collected by police authorities. At times govt has an exemption. But the liability for them is much lesser than for the normal people at large. The standard of liaiblty should be the same.</p><p>Manoj: Like investor protection fund, we can have a consent protection fund. It will reimburse users in case of breaches as a compensatory measure. So that unnecessary prohibition of data. Secondly, self regulation.</p><p>Rahul Sharma: On the aspect of building in privacy by design. Singapore has it in its national cyber security strategy. Should it be law or a part of standards. There are roles for sectoral regulation, etc etc, and then try and figure out what everyone will do. Usually laws do not have a sunshine period. We should have this.</p><p>GDPR is increasing the cost of compliance, without enhancing security and privacy. There has to be a proportionate increase of security. The cost gets transferred to users. Data localisation was a protectionist strategy. We have an opportunity to counter this. The government can ensure it for its data, but not for the private sector.</p><p>Nikhil from UTV: While we support notice and consent, the restriction that consumer facing industries that are not able to take consent, but consumers are willing to get it. Two year timeline for implementation of the law. It'll take</p><p>Suresh Menon: At Maharashtra government, we're setting up blockchain. Currently I can only way I can improve it improve my SLAs. We should come out with guidelines of distributed computing, for deleting.</p><p>Anupam Saraph: I want to thank you for actually saying that you'll be technology agnostic. I'd like tyou to be agnostic to words that we import fro m technology. One is the idea of ekyc. ekyc and kyc are two different things. ekyc can be used in N number ofplaces, and there is no way this can be prevented. This boils down to import of concept from technolog. The second is the idea of identification. There is no idea of identification in authentication. To use authentication where identification is required. I'm going to stop here because this is important when we are going to talk about data protection pertaining to the digital space. In digital, all of these concepts, you don't think about how you have changed the responsibiltiy of the partners who have been transacting manually, and sometimes you end up throwing out the responsibility from anyone. It's important that we understand the business process. It has nothing to do with technology. By digitialisation they should not be able to throw out responsible parties from the process.

You only need to look at the last couple of years of Instagram's development path[1] to see just how much Facebook has tried to copy every unique facet of Snapchat. But Amazon may have taken things to an uncomfortable new extreme. </p><p>In a new instance of copycat behavior first spotted by Tinder's Jeff Morris Jr[2], the company has released a pair of Allbirds knockoffs. Allbirds makes shoes from Merino Wool, and they've been extremely popular over the last couple of years. Amazon is now straight copying Allbirds. We have reached \"peak cloning\" in Silicon Valley. There are no rules anymore - if you build a product that works, Amazon or Facebook will copy it. People used to care. Not anymore. pic.twitter.com/73bDMgruMX[3]\u2014 Jeff Morris Jr. (@jmj) September 19, 2019[4] Copying a hugely successful product is nothing new for Amazon. For example, the company has offered an Instant Pot clone[5] for more than a year now. However, what makes this latest instance of creative theft so brazen is the way in which Amazon has tried to hide the copying. With the company's Instant Pot clone, there's no mistaking the slow cooker's origins; it says right on the front that it's an AmazonBasics product. With its newest clone, however, Amazon markets the shoes under its private 206 Collective label.As The Verge points out[6], blatant copying is nothing new to the fashion world[7]. However, Amazon's copying underlines an uncomfortable aspect of the company's power. With its vast amounts of data, Amazon can easily identify popular products. With its unprecedented scale[8], it can then offer those products at a fraction of the cost that other companies sell their wares. It's an aspect of the company that regulators have struggled with for a while[9]. One potential solution to the problem is to not allow big e-commerce platforms to sell their own products on their platforms. This is something India does[10]. With Amazon's new shoes, you can see why that might be a good idea. A pair of Allbirds typically cost around $95. Amazon's new shoes, by contrast, cost as little as $35[11]. And while copying a pair of shoes is a relatively minor offense, the episode is likely to feed into the perception that Amazon and other companies should be regulated as part of the government's recent antitrust investigations into big tech[12].

Having the cash to continue to out-innovate your suddenly impoverished competitors.</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here s a stark example of how the global coronavirus pandemic affects America s tech giants, versus how it affects pretty much everyone else.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On May 12, Alphabet Inc. GOOG 0.54% subsidiary Waymo announced it had scored an additional $750 million to make self-driving cars a commercial reality, bringing its total external fundraising to $3 billion inside two months. Then, on the 18th, The Wall Street Journal reported that Uber Technologies Inc.UBER 1.66% is cutting $1 billion in fixed costs. This included laying off roughly a quarter of its workforce and rethinking big, expensive bets such as its own work on self-driving vehicles.</p><p>It isn t just Uber that is suffering. Many brand-name retailers are now bankrupt or on the precipice, all weakened by shopping habits transformed by e-commerce. Then there are the internet-era businesses in every category, from Airbnb to WeWork, that might not have the cash to survive in their current forms.</p><p>Meanwhile, Big Tech s biggest advantage business models which convert cash into innovation, market share and an ever-larger lead over their competitors is accelerating, thanks to the pandemic. The biggest of the big not just Google-parent Alphabet, but also Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp.  all have businesses that throw off huge profits and bigfoot anyone and anything that gets in their way.</p><p>The Big Get BiggerThe biggest tech companies have the resources to further solidify their dominance as smaller rivals struggle.Cash and short-term securities, quarterly.</p><p>Investment in developing proprietary systems is key to keeping firms dominant in their markets. And spending on acquisitions helps them do that and quash competition. With the eye-popping warchests these companies have accumulated, it is clear they have the power, and the habit, of continuing to spend even if the current situation damages their revenue and profits.</p><p>And it might. Economists at the International Monetary Fund predict this will be the largest global recession since the Great Depression. Anindya Ghose, professor of business at New York University s Stern School of Business, says even the big tech companies will  see a much bleaker scenario  in coming months, and perhaps beyond, with revenue potentially depressed for a long time if reopening leads to new waves of infections and additional shutdowns.</p><p>These firms are still likely to come out ahead, says Rita McGrath, a professor at Columbia Business School. What they are selling e-commerce, cloud services, social media, devices required to work from home and the like are all in high demand and will be for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The tech giants that are thriving aren t merely doing it by acquiring competitors and dominating markets. Like some monopolists of ages past, these companies spend heavily on research and development.</p><p>At the end of the roaring  20s, General Electric invented the first television. Throughout the Great Depression, GE and its subsidiary RCA continued to invest in its development. The result was RCA s dominance of the medium in the decades that followed.</p><p>Big Tech is adopting the same strategy today. Overall R&amp;D spending at the five biggest U.S. tech companies the five biggest companies in the U.S., period continued to rise, even in the first months of the pandemic. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft, or the  Faaam,  as I like to call them, spent almost $29 billion on R&amp;D last quarter, up 17% from the same quarter last year. That is bigger than the entire annual budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and NASA is supposed to get us to Mars.</p><p>Some initiatives are related to the coronavirus pandemic: Microsoft is rolling out services to help health-care professionals, Facebook is going all-in on remote work. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos told investors to  take a seat  as he conveyed the company s plans to spend its entire second-quarter profit about $4 billion on dealing with Covid-19. That program includes the creation of an internal testing program for the virus. The company is also considering developing yet more automation for its fulfillment centers so they won t be as packed with humans. Traditionally, these expenses could be classified as R&amp;D, since the money isn t being spent on activities with a proven commercial benefit, and there is no telling when and how they might pay off.</p><p>Any shortfalls in future R&amp;D spending by the Faaam could be made up by acquisitions a form of outsourced R&amp;D. The giants let others build businesses around new ideas, then buy them up.</p><p>Since the U.S. declared a state of emergency and lockdowns commenced, Apple bought a VR company, Facebook bought Giphy, Amazon Web Services bought DataRow, Google bought Pointy and AppSheet, and Microsoft bought or agreed to buy Metaswitch Networks, Softmotive and Affirmed Networks. The chip giant Intel  not technically part of the Faaam, but one of their key enablers did two deals in May, adding to its capabilities in self-driving cars and Wi-Fi.</p><p>While acquisition volume isn t necessarily up, this could be a good time for these companies to buy up firms they have been eyeing. After WeWork s collapse, valuations for many highflying startups cooled, and the coronavirus pandemic could drive valuations down even further. Facebook buying Giphy last week could be a harbinger of what s to come.</p><p>As public companies, none of the Faaam are willing to comment on their plans for future quarters beyond the guidance they gave in earnings calls. Amazon predicted continued strong revenue growth compared with a year ago, and noted the outsize expenses and investments related to Covid-19. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company plans to hire 10,000 more people in product and engineering roles across 2020 so the company can  continue building.  Facebook CFO Dave Wehner said,  We plan to continue to invest in product development and to recruit technical talent. </p><p>Microsoft predicted it will have modest revenue growth next quarter, and CFO Amy Hood said that in the year ahead the company would leverage its  strong financial position  to make  significant investments.  Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company has entered the crisis in a position of financial strength, and that he will continue to manage the company for the long term.  We ve always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in the next generation of innovation and that s our strategy today,  he added.</p><p>Just as no one predicted the coronavirus (well, almost no one), it is impossible to know what s coming for these companies in terms of revenue and whether they ll dip into their reserves. In an unusual move, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook all declined to offer revenue guidance in their last quarterly reports, given the uncertainty in the global economy.</p><p>It is possible that advertising will crater for Facebook and Google in the way it has cratered for traditional media companies, forcing them to pull back on spending in unprecedented ways, notes Dr. Ghose. People stuck at home, driving up user-engagement numbers for big tech, don t matter much if advertisers aren t spending to reach them. And Alphabet s CFO said in the company s last earnings call that the second quarter would be a difficult one for the company s advertising business.</p><p>Maybe demand for iPhones and other consumer electronics crashes because of high unemployment and low consumer spending. Perhaps Amazon s competitors make inroads against its e-commerce business in unexpected ways, even as spending drops across all categories.</p><p>Even if all of this happened, all of these companies have enough cash to sustain their innovative core and avoid laying off the kinds of design, engineering and product talent that are so expensive to hire in good times.</p><p>All market signals indicate investors are confident these companies can continue to grow in the long run. The value of these five companies are at or near their highs. In the middle of a pandemic, their collective market capitalization is $5.6 trillion.</p><p>One thing that could trip up the Faaam is antitrust action. The Journal revealed on May 15 that both the Justice Department and state attorneys general are well into planning antitrust lawsuits against Google. Facebook s intended acquisition of Giphy is raising antitrust alarms on both sides of the aisle in Congress. Last June, the House Judiciary Committee announced a sweeping investigation of the market power of  big tech  companies, the FTC is investigating every member of the Faaam, and the European Commission s scrutiny of them is unrelenting.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) is pushing the Justice Department to launch an antitrust investigation of Amazon after a Journal investigation found the company had used data about independent sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Apple is facing a potential antitrust investigation by the EU, for allegedly abusing the power of its App Store.</p><p>As long as managing the pandemic continues to take precedence in the halls of governments everywhere, it seems unlikely regulators will act on any of the still-unofficial proposals before them. Those include splitting up Amazon s web and retail businesses, decomposing Facebook into its constituent acquisitions, limiting Apple s power over its own App Store, or curtailing Google s dominance of online advertising. This buys Big Tech even more time to lobby politicians and mollify regulators, build goodwill with consumers, and plow resources into opening up an ever bigger lead over competitors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bezonomics-review-spinning-the-flywheel-11589139434?mod=article_inline\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/bezonomics-review-spinning-the-flywheel-11589139434?mod=article_inline</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Christopher Mims at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:christopher.mims@wsj.com\">christopher.mims@wsj.com</email><br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2569932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600D-S9S1-F08D-52H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1730\"/><timeReceived>11:02 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 26, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

After being leaked last month, it set off a firestorm of protests, including demonstrations and sleep-ins outside the FCC offices in Washington, D.C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But at least one local entrepreneur isn't panicking. Shay David, co-founder and chief revenue officer of video platform Kaltura, said his company won't be affected, although his customers might be. Many are big media companies like HBO and NBCUniversal, but others are colleges, universities and all kinds of websites. The important thing, he said, is to protect against the downside for those who don't pay for premium service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The way to balance it is to guarantee a minimum quality of delivery, but allow a free marketplace for enhanced service and quality,\" he said. \"The opportunity to offer prime services offers a lot of motivation to develop innovations.\"</p><p>Economists and analysts also say that if market forces are allowed to dictate the development of the web, it will result in a bigger, faster pipe for everyone, as lucrative contracts give ISPs the cash and incentive to build more capacity. If bandwidth hogs like Netflix want a fast lane, they should pay for it, much the same as paying FedEx a premium for overnight delivery versus two-day, they argue.</p><p>\"Scrapping Net neutrality would allow [companies like] AT&amp;T and Verizon to charge the big Internet companies the true cost of doing business with them,\" said Cyrus Mewawalla, who runs CM Research, an independent investment-research firm in London that focuses on technology, media and telecom.</p><p>At last week's hearing, FCC Chairman Thomas Wheeler said he was open to recommendations to regulate ISPs as utilities, a route many Net-neutrality fans favor. In any case, he pledged a fast and robust Internet and insisted that, as a former entrepreneur and venture capitalist, he knows its importance firsthand.</p><p>Rebuttals stream in</p><p>\"I will not allow the national asset of an open Internet to be compromised,\" he said. \"I understand this issue in my bones. I have scars from when my companies were denied access in pre-Internet days.\"</p><p>Even so, he's unlikely to convince the tech community that the proposal isn't a looming disaster. In New York, it has generated a Crowdtilt campaign, a 31-page brief to the FCC and a call to lobby Congress, as tech workers and observers warn it could short-circuit the startup pipeline in the city.</p><p>\"[It will put] up hurdles to innovation from newcomers,\" said David Rogers, executive director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership at Columbia Business School. \"Don't protect Netflix. Protect the next challenger to Netflix.\"</p><p>Those most worried are publishers, video-content providers, bloggers, nonprofits and peer-to-peer sites like Wikipedia-especially if they are startups on a tight budget, for whom fast connections are key but may be prohibitively expensive if a two-tiered system develops.</p><p>Net neutrality, the idea that ISPs should extend the same level of service to everyone, was enshrined by the FCC in its Open Internet Order in 2010, but it has been a source of controversy as ISPs have tried to manage explosive and growing traffic, especially streaming video. The current flap grows out of an appeals court decision in January that struck down a part of the FCC rule that prohibited ISPs from discriminating among different types of traffic.</p><p>In response, Mr. Wheeler proposed the new rules, which he modified after the initial storm of protests. In general, they would let ISPs sell faster service to some customers as long as there is a reasonable business basis, and would prohibit them from blocking or slowing any traffic. The FCC might also appoint an ombudsman to monitor ISP behavior.</p><p>Netflix's stock took a hit after the appeals court ruling and dipped again after last Thursday's FCC meeting. The website Mashable reported that Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter estimated fast-lane fees could cost the video streamer between $144 million and nearly $1 billion a year.</p><p>ISPs, on the other hand, would get a payday. Depending on what the final rules are, companies like AT&amp;T, Verizon and Comcast could see revenues climb as much as 10% to 20%, Mr. Mewawalla predicted, making them more attractive to investors. Verizon, for one, has seen its stock inch up to $48 from $46 in the past three weeks. \"They will invest more in mobile and in fiber in the ground, but their return will go up,\" Mr. Mewawalla said.</p><p>Most techies aren't buying it. They said ISPs already violate Net-neutrality rules to silence competition, such as when AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile blocked Google Wallet. If network operators can charge a premium for faster service, the thinking goes, they will have less incentive to provide good service to those who can't pay. It flies in the face, they said, of the Net-neutrality ethos that has governed the Internet since its beginnings-as a dumb pipe that treats all traffic the same-and has made it a source of unprecedented innovation and economic growth.</p><p>Josh Weinstein, founder of You Are TV, a video-chat startup in Union Square, said that if some companies can pay for faster service, it will create an additional chasm for startups to cross.</p><p>\"We've built a real-time multistream video platform, and if you want to have conversation, it needs to be really fast,\" Mr. Weinstein said. \"If we have to pay in order for users to have a basic experience, it's going to increase the capital hurdles for us.\"</p><p>Higher NY business costs</p><p>For venture capitalists, it would be one more thing to factor into an investment decision. New York, with its already high real estate and labor costs, would become an even more expensive place to do business.</p><p>\"You can envision a world where you have to think about the quality of bandwidth as you think through the type of companies you invest in,\" said Rick Heitzmann, a managing director at FirstMark Capital.</p><p>The FCC comment period ends in mid-September. In the meantime, techies are mounting the barricades. More than 150 big tech firms, including Amazon, Google, Netflix and Microsoft, wrote to the FCC opposing Mr. Wheeler's proposal. In New York, Reddit founder Alex Ohanian started a Crowdtilt campaign to raise money for a billboard in Washington, D.C., and to place Net-neutrality ads in The New York Times and The Washington Post. As of May 15, he had raised $21,093.39.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYBUS-3438822</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYBUS2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C86-1CW1-JC0G-4090-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8102</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1114\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Crain Communications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crain's New York Business <br/>Print Version</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23761\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 30</volume><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 19, 2014</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

And quite a few of the names that had skyrocketed in 2015 saw 25%-plus declines. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A slightly downbeat earnings season  that time around. While many big tech names delivered respectable numbers, weak results and/or guidance from Tableau Software  , LinkedIn, which had not yet been acquired by Microsoft  , and a handful of other 2015 high-flyers apparently convinced many investors that the good times were ending.</p><p>But it wasn't long before investors calmed down and realized that conditions still remained very good for much of tech. And that many of the weak reports were due to company-specific problems rather than any broader issue -- Tableau, for example, was dealing with sales execution challenges and stiffer competition -- and that trends in industries such as semiconductors, enterprise software, online ads and online retail remained quite healthy.</p><p>Interestingly enough, it's hard to even blame the current correction, which has led the Nasdaq to drop 8% from recent highs and many high-flyers to post 15%-plus declines, on a few bad earnings reports. Outside of companies with strong smartphone and/or telecom equipment exposure -- and even their numbers have often just been disappointing rather than truly awful --- large-cap tech companies have continued to post very strong results this year. And quite a few chip, consumer Internet and enterprise tech companies continue firing on all cylinders, or close to it.</p><p>Instead, the current selloff has been driven by a mixture of macro and regulatory fears that look pretty vague upon close review. The Trump Administration's decision to slap tariffs on a slew of Chinese products (including some tech products) has sparked trade-war fears. But China's response thus far suggests it's eager to find a compromise -- Beijing's initial plan for retaliatory tariffs only covers $3 billion worth of U.S. imports, and it has also offered to buy more chips from the U.S. relative to South Korea and Taiwan (potentially a positive for Micron<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> and Qualcomm<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, given the nature of their competition).</p><p>The other worry, of course, is the prospect of tougher privacy and data-sharing regulations for consumer tech firms in the wake of the Facebook  /Cambridge Analytica scandal. But while there are plenty of calls for new regulations, specifics are often hard to come by. </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jim Cramer and the AAP team hold positions in Microsoft and Facebook for their </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/k/aap/_tscnav/index.html\">Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

Or, for that matter, on the top lines of other firms depending heavily on online advertising. </p><p>As was the case in early 2016, it feels as if a lot of investors who amassed giant paper profits last year are eager to find reasons to sell. In an environment like that, vague concerns about trade and regulatory issues are enough to send one-time bulls to the sidelines.</p><p>So can an earnings report that was generally good, but came with one or two negatives attached. Consider the case of Micron: The memory giant  and issued above-consensus guidance, but tumbled post-earnings due to worries about a flash memory business that accounts for less than a quarter of its gross profits.</p><p>One could counter that the elevated valuations many tech names now carry make some investors more risk-averse upon the sight of bad news. But it's worth keeping in mind that many of the names that have been hammered -- Facebook and Micron included --  forward earnings and/or free cash flow multiples.</p><p>That type of bloodletting presents opportunities for those have been queasy about the steep multiples many fast-growing tech firms have been assigned as the Nasdaq has surged past 7,000, and are willing to tolerate some more short-term volatility caused by investors looking to take profits on the first sight of bad news.</p><p>Until there's much stronger evidence that tech companies are going to face big macro, regulatory and/or trade pressures, odds are good that the recent correction will simply wind up being a case of fear-induced profit-taking. It arguably makes sense to pay more attention to valuations in this kind of environment (not that one should ignore them in others, of course). But that doesn't mean one should act as if the sky is falling.</p><p>Because for now, there's little reason to think that it is.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-14538455</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S04-FKW1-JCHV-V215-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc.

We are on the precipice of a massive data-driven change,   she continued, leading off the session which addressed collaboration among industry stakeholders   and importantly, with patients.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joanne Waldstreicher, MD, chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the industry has\u00a0  shifted from doing things and making decisions on behalf of patients, to really working with patients together as partners, co-creating clinical trials, co-creating endpoints, making benefit/risk decisions with patients, with the people who count the most.  </p><p> We can do much more working together toward a common goal,   added Guido Rasi, MD, Executive Director, European Medicines Agency (EMA), who noted that as a regulator, the agency needs to work with a growing number of stakeholders, including researchers, companies, investors, patients, and others.</p><p>Providing his viewpoint from the US, Gary Gibbons, MD, Director, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, said the source of the institute s excellence is diversity and inclusion:  The best ideas come from the community .  \u00a0</p><p> On the future of research:  Nothing about me, without me   </p><p>Harlan Krumholz, MD, Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine and Director CORE, Yale University, expects the future of research will be site-less, digital, and in real-time.  I think we re on the cusp of a very different paradigm,   he said during the opening session.  We simply cannot continue to do research at the price and timestamp we are.  </p><p>As part of this paradigm shift, Donna Cryer, JD, interim executive director, People-Centered Research Foundation, said there is  an incredible opportunity   to make sure that research is\u00a0 people-centered.   </p><p> What that means, in reality, is that data is not just a concept of a fuel going through a pipeline, but really it is the information about people s lives that should be used to improve people s lives, and the best way to do that is through partnership with the patient,   she explained.</p><p>Cryer added,  The potential of tapping into the questions that people have, the experiences that patients live through, and combine them and really embedded them much more firmly than ever before can create a whole new landscape for research.  </p><p>Fueled by recent big tech scandals and some in the research sector around how companies are monetizing data, Deven McGraw, JD, LLM, MPH, chief regulatory officer, Ciitizen, said  more and more patients are tired of being on the sidelines.  </p><p> It is data about them and whether they own it or someone else owns it isn t really the issue, it s that it s about me, it s sensitive to me,   she said, stressing that patients want to be included in the process of making decisions about their data.\u00a0 Nothing about me, without me   is becoming a very salient theme, McGraw added, further noting that there has never been zero risk of reidentifying patient data.</p><p> We treat it as if it has zero risk in the law and in that way that we handle it .. and I think that s a mistake,  \u00a0she said. And this risk is compounded by the amount of data available about any given patient. In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2019/02/19/AI-threatens-health-data-privacy-Report\">a recent study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley</url> , found it possible to re-identify individuals using their physical activity data   with current laws and regulations failing to safeguard confidential health information.</p><p>The concerns follow several advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) since the passing of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) more than 20 years ago .</p><p> It is wrong for us to wave the magic wand and say we ve deidentified it,   added McGraw, who said her challenge is one of building trust.  You want to give [patients] agency, but it s too much to say they consented and therefore it was okay ... It s not more acceptable to just do that than say it it s deidentified so, therefore, it s okay . </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGM-N971-JC6M-X4TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>2:04 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

We are on the precipice of a massive data-driven change,   she continued, leading off the session which addressed collaboration among industry stakeholders   and importantly, with patients.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joanne Waldstreicher, MD, chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the industry has\u00a0  shifted from doing things and making decisions on behalf of patients, to really working with patients together as partners, co-creating clinical trials, co-creating endpoints, making benefit/risk decisions with patients, with the people who count the most.  </p><p> We can do much more working together toward a common goal,   added Guido Rasi, MD, Executive Director, European Medicines Agency (EMA), who noted that as a regulator, the agency needs to work with a growing number of stakeholders, including researchers, companies, investors, patients, and others.</p><p>Providing his viewpoint from the US, Gary Gibbons, MD, Director, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, said the source of the institute s excellence is diversity and inclusion:  The best ideas come from the community .  \u00a0</p><p> On the future of research:  Nothing about me, without me   </p><p>Harlan Krumholz, MD, Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine and Director CORE, Yale University, expects the future of research will be site-less, digital, and in real-time.  I think we re on the cusp of a very different paradigm,   he said during the opening session.  We simply cannot continue to do research at the price and timestamp we are.  </p><p>As part of this paradigm shift, Donna Cryer, JD, interim executive director, People-Centered Research Foundation, said there is  an incredible opportunity   to make sure that research is\u00a0 people-centered.   </p><p> What that means, in reality, is that data is not just a concept of a fuel going through a pipeline, but really it is the information about people s lives that should be used to improve people s lives, and the best way to do that is through partnership with the patient,   she explained.</p><p>Cryer added,  The potential of tapping into the questions that people have, the experiences that patients live through, and combine them and really embedded them much more firmly than ever before can create a whole new landscape for research.  </p><p>Fueled by recent big tech scandals and some in the research sector around how companies are monetizing data, Deven McGraw, JD, LLM, MPH, chief regulatory officer, Ciitizen, said  more and more patients are tired of being on the sidelines.  </p><p> It is data about them and whether they own it or someone else owns it isn t really the issue, it s that it s about me, it s sensitive to me,   she said, stressing that patients want to be included in the process of making decisions about their data.\u00a0 Nothing about me, without me   is becoming a very salient theme, McGraw added, further noting that there has never been zero risk of reidentifying patient data.</p><p> We treat it as if it has zero risk in the law and in that way that we handle it .. and I think that s a mistake,  \u00a0she said. And this risk is compounded by the amount of data available about any given patient. In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2019/02/19/AI-threatens-health-data-privacy-Report\">a recent study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley</url> , found it possible to re-identify individuals using their physical activity data   with current laws and regulations failing to safeguard confidential health information.</p><p>The concerns follow several advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) since the passing of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) more than 20 years ago .</p><p> It is wrong for us to wave the magic wand and say we ve deidentified it,   added McGraw, who said her challenge is one of building trust.  You want to give [patients] agency, but it s too much to say they consented and therefore it was okay ... It s not more acceptable to just do that than say it it s deidentified so, therefore, it s okay . </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGG-5DK1-DYNP-M2SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>2:04 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine and Director CORE, Yale University, expects the future of research will be site-less, digital, and in real-time. \u201cI think we\u2019re on the cusp of a very different paradigm,\u201d\u200b he said during the opening session. \u201cWe simply cannot continue to do research at the price and timestamp we are.\u201d\u200b</p><p>As part of this paradigm shift, Donna Cryer, JD, interim executive director, People-Centered Research Foundation, said there is \u201can incredible opportunity\u201d\u200b to make sure that research is\u00a0\u201cpeople-centered.\u201d \u200b</p><p>\u201cWhat that means, in reality, is that data is not just a concept of a fuel going through a pipeline, but really it is the information about people\u2019s lives that should be used to improve people\u2019s lives, and the best way to do that is through partnership with the patient,\u201d\u200b she explained.</p><p>Cryer added, \u201cThe potential of tapping into the questions that people have, the experiences that patients live through, and combine them and really embedded them much more firmly than ever before can create a whole new landscape for research.\u201d\u200b</p><p>Fueled by recent big tech scandals and some in the research sector around how companies are monetizing data, Deven McGraw, JD, LLM, MPH, chief regulatory officer, Ciitizen, said \u201cmore and more patients are tired of being on the sidelines.\u201d\u200b</p><p>\u201cIt is data about them and whether they own it or someone else owns it isn\u2019t really the issue, it\u2019s that it\u2019s about me, it\u2019s sensitive to me,\u201d\u200b she said, stressing that patients want to be included in the process of making decisions about their data.\u00a0\u201cNothing about me, without me\u201d\u200b is becoming a very salient theme, McGraw added, further noting that there has never been zero risk of reidentifying patient data.</p><p>\u201cWe treat it as if it has zero risk in the law and in that way that we handle it .. and I think that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d\u200b\u00a0she said. And this risk is compounded by the amount of data available about any given patient. In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2019/02/19/AI-threatens-health-data-privacy-Report\">a recent study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley</url>\u200b, found it possible to re-identify individuals using their physical activity data \u2013 with current laws and regulations failing to safeguard confidential health information.</p><p>The concerns follow several advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) since the passing of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) more than 20 years ago\u200b.</p><p>\u201cIt is wrong for us to wave the magic wand and say we\u2019ve deidentified it,\u201d\u200b added McGraw, who said her challenge is one of building trust. \u201cYou want to give [patients] agency, but it\u2019s too much to say they consented and therefore it was okay ... It\u2019s not more acceptable to just do that than say it it\u2019s deidentified so, therefore, it\u2019s okay\u200b.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGH-T971-DYNP-M42J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>2:04 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

We are on the precipice of a massive data-driven change,   she continued, leading off the session which addressed collaboration among industry stakeholders   and importantly, with patients.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joanne Waldstreicher, MD, chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the industry has\u00a0  shifted from doing things and making decisions on behalf of patients, to really working with patients together as partners, co-creating clinical trials, co-creating endpoints, making benefit/risk decisions with patients, with the people who count the most.  </p><p> We can do much more working together toward a common goal,   added Guido Rasi, MD, Executive Director, European Medicines Agency (EMA), who noted that as a regulator, the agency needs to work with a growing number of stakeholders, including researchers, companies, investors, patients, and others.</p><p>Providing his viewpoint from the US, Gary Gibbons, MD, Director, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, said the source of the institute s excellence is diversity and inclusion:  The best ideas come from the community .  \u00a0</p><p> On the future of research:  Nothing about me, without me   </p><p>Harlan Krumholz, MD, Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine and Director CORE, Yale University, expects the future of research will be site-less, digital, and in real-time.  I think we re on the cusp of a very different paradigm,   he said during the opening session.  We simply cannot continue to do research at the price and timestamp we are.  </p><p>As part of this paradigm shift, Donna Cryer, JD, interim executive director, People-Centered Research Foundation, said there is  an incredible opportunity   to make sure that research is\u00a0 people-centered.   </p><p> What that means, in reality, is that data is not just a concept of a fuel going through a pipeline, but really it is the information about people s lives that should be used to improve people s lives, and the best way to do that is through partnership with the patient,   she explained.</p><p>Cryer added,  The potential of tapping into the questions that people have, the experiences that patients live through, and combine them and really embedded them much more firmly than ever before can create a whole new landscape for research.  </p><p>Fueled by recent big tech scandals and some in the research sector around how companies are monetizing data, Deven McGraw, JD, LLM, MPH, chief regulatory officer, Ciitizen, said  more and more patients are tired of being on the sidelines.  </p><p> It is data about them and whether they own it or someone else owns it isn t really the issue, it s that it s about me, it s sensitive to me,   she said, stressing that patients want to be included in the process of making decisions about their data.\u00a0 Nothing about me, without me   is becoming a very salient theme, McGraw added, further noting that there has never been zero risk of reidentifying patient data.</p><p> We treat it as if it has zero risk in the law and in that way that we handle it .. and I think that s a mistake,  \u00a0she said. And this risk is compounded by the amount of data available about any given patient. In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2019/02/19/AI-threatens-health-data-privacy-Report\">a recent study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley</url> , found it possible to re-identify individuals using their physical activity data   with current laws and regulations failing to safeguard confidential health information.</p><p>The concerns follow several advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) since the passing of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) more than 20 years ago .</p><p> It is wrong for us to wave the magic wand and say we ve deidentified it,   added McGraw, who said her challenge is one of building trust.  You want to give [patients] agency, but it s too much to say they consented and therefore it was okay ... It s not more acceptable to just do that than say it it s deidentified so, therefore, it s okay . </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG9-GX71-DYNP-M1H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>2:04 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

We are on the precipice of a massive data-driven change,   she continued, leading off the session which addressed collaboration among industry stakeholders   and importantly, with patients.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joanne Waldstreicher, MD, chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the industry has\u00a0  shifted from doing things and making decisions on behalf of patients, to really working with patients together as partners, co-creating clinical trials, co-creating endpoints, making benefit/risk decisions with patients, with the people who count the most.  </p><p> We can do much more working together toward a common goal,   added Guido Rasi, MD, Executive Director, European Medicines Agency (EMA), who noted that as a regulator, the agency needs to work with a growing number of stakeholders, including researchers, companies, investors, patients, and others.</p><p>Providing his viewpoint from the US, Gary Gibbons, MD, Director, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, said the source of the institute s excellence is diversity and inclusion:  The best ideas come from the community .  \u00a0</p><p> On the future of research:  Nothing about me, without me   </p><p>Harlan Krumholz, MD, Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine and Director CORE, Yale University, expects the future of research will be site-less, digital, and in real-time.  I think we re on the cusp of a very different paradigm,   he said during the opening session.  We simply cannot continue to do research at the price and timestamp we are.  </p><p>As part of this paradigm shift, Donna Cryer, JD, interim executive director, People-Centered Research Foundation, said there is  an incredible opportunity   to make sure that research is\u00a0 people-centered.   </p><p> What that means, in reality, is that data is not just a concept of a fuel going through a pipeline, but really it is the information about people s lives that should be used to improve people s lives, and the best way to do that is through partnership with the patient,   she explained.</p><p>Cryer added,  The potential of tapping into the questions that people have, the experiences that patients live through, and combine them and really embedded them much more firmly than ever before can create a whole new landscape for research.  </p><p>Fueled by recent big tech scandals and some in the research sector around how companies are monetizing data, Deven McGraw, JD, LLM, MPH, chief regulatory officer, Ciitizen, said  more and more patients are tired of being on the sidelines.  </p><p> It is data about them and whether they own it or someone else owns it isn t really the issue, it s that it s about me, it s sensitive to me,   she said, stressing that patients want to be included in the process of making decisions about their data.\u00a0 Nothing about me, without me   is becoming a very salient theme, McGraw added, further noting that there has never been zero risk of reidentifying patient data.</p><p> We treat it as if it has zero risk in the law and in that way that we handle it .. and I think that s a mistake,  \u00a0she said. And this risk is compounded by the amount of data available about any given patient. In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2019/02/19/AI-threatens-health-data-privacy-Report\">a recent study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley</url> , found it possible to re-identify individuals using their physical activity data   with current laws and regulations failing to safeguard confidential health information.</p><p>The concerns follow several advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) since the passing of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) more than 20 years ago .</p><p> It is wrong for us to wave the magic wand and say we ve deidentified it,   added McGraw, who said her challenge is one of building trust.  You want to give [patients] agency, but it s too much to say they consented and therefore it was okay ... It s not more acceptable to just do that than say it it s deidentified so, therefore, it s okay . </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGH-G7P1-DYNP-M3D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>2:04 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

He is unconcerned about Google's announcement that it may offer a consumer checking account. But he is a little nervous about how comfortable clients have become with an array of digital financial tools, and what that might mean for his livelihood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I would not be shocked if Google offers more planning,\" says Balcom, the founder of 1650 Wealth Management, an RIA in Lauderdale-by-the Sea, Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many advisors, though, it's not if, but when.</p><p>Even now, technology allows firms to seamlessly partner with broker-dealers or independent advisors to offer managed investment accounts, lending products, checking accounts and retirement vehicles. At the same time, other barriers between traditional financial services and wealth management are breaking down.</p><p>Apple, for instance, launched its credit card in March. In November, Google said it would look to partner with Citigroup to offer checking accounts sometime this year. While the firms may use the accounts to collect client data and peek more deeply into customers' behavior, they are also seen as taking big steps toward the traditional purview of wealth management.</p><p>\"It's obvious from where I sit that big tech will want to make the jump,\" says Jud Mackrill, chief marketing officer at Carson Group. \"A managed account solution is going to come along with one of these product launches.\"</p><p>These latest offerings are an unwelcome reminder of an ever-present question on the minds of wealth managers: Will the FAANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google - as well as other big tech companies make a land grab of services historically provided by financial services? If so, at what cost to traditional RIAs?</p><p>\"Potentially, if Google got cleared to conduct a brokerage business, they could move in any direction they want,\" says Greg O'Gara, a senior research analyst at Aite Group.</p><p>\"Essentially, nothing is going to stop the democratization of investing through technology, and once one of these [tech companies] makes an imprint on the broker-dealer landscape, the growth prospects are very, very good,\" he adds.</p><p>Google's entry into finance can be traced, in part, to recent efforts by fintechs to evolve beyond investing and advice. And, just as those partnerships have rapidly grown, there is little to prevent the search engine giant from teaming up with a broker to launch a wealth management pilot.</p><p>\"We're exploring how we can partner with banks and credit unions in the U.S. to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay,\" says Google spokesman Craig Ewer. In the United States, more than 2,000 banks already offer card transactions via Google Pay, Ewer says.</p><p>Last year, a host of digital wealth managers served up a buffet of new financial services options including banking and lending.</p><p>Betterment and many of its competitors added cash products with annual percentage yields sometimes as much as 2% more than traditional accounts at incumbent banks. (The yields depend heavily on prevailing interest rates.</p><p>Wealthfront advertised its account as the highest-yielding in the market when it announced in early 2019, and says that it attracted $1 billion in assets as a result.</p><p>The most successful may be from micro-savings app Acorns, which was one of the first to tack on additional services and now boasts checking, debit cards and retirement savings vehicles with 6.2 million accounts and $1.7 billion in AUM, according to the firm. Its retirement product, Acorns Later, built up 170,000 accounts in its first two months, according to Acorns CEO Noah Kerner.</p><p>The business strategy of partnering with financial institutions has essentially been mapped by smaller fintechs and has proved successful. Google is now emulating that model to launch its checking account slated to pilot this year. The question may now become not whether tech giants will enter wealth management - but what can possibly stop them?</p><p>Carson Wealth Management became one of the first big advisory firms to offer checking accounts to its clients last May.</p><p>Through its partnership with the digital banking provider Galileo, Carson's RIA clients have access to a Mastercard-branded debit card, online bill paying, direct deposit options and the ability to use tens of thousands of ATMs, according to the firm.</p><p>\"We view Amazon as the competition,\" Ron Carson, CEO of Carson Group, told Financial Planning after Apple announced its credit card launch in March. \"Whenever they decide to get directly into our business, we have to be prepared. They haven't yet because there is just so much low-hanging fruit. But they are coming.\"</p><p>TOO BIG TO SUCCEED?Ominously for independents, a majority of investors who are considering switching financial services providers said they would think about banking with tech companies such as Facebook, Google or Amazon if they could, according to a recent survey by MX, a digital banking technology provider.</p><p>Almost 60% of the survey respondents said they would consider depositing a paycheck with a major technology company.</p><p>\"Cash is a very easy commodity to generate income on, and once you attract clients, you can cross-sell anything,\" O'Gara says.</p><p>\"There really is not much that would stop them from building out a broader investment platform. With the right regulatory oversight, nothing is stopping them,\" he adds.</p><p>It's not a foregone conclusion, however. Google had a similar product, Google Compare, that compared different financial products for consumers, which potentially could have shifted into robo advice. It was shuttered in 2016. \"Google has a bit of attention deficit\" disorder, Mackrill says. \"They'll try something new and have no problem killing it.\"</p><p>The fintech partnerships have one important advantage: the ability to leapfrog regulatory hurdles. Many RIAs cite regulation as a top barrier preventing FAANGs from entering wealth management.</p><p>\"The team at Google Pay has been working for years to help make money simple and accessible for our users, in close partnership with banks, credit unions, and the existing regulatory and financial systems,\" the Google spokesman says. \"We believe our partners' regulatory and financial know-how is a great complement to our experience in building helpful tools and technology for our users.\"</p><p>WHAT ABOUT ROBOS?What's stopping Google from offering an off-the-shelf retirement product? The answer is, not much.</p><p>\"If I were a robo advisor, I would certainly be worried,\" says 1650 Wealth Management's Balcom. \"Amazon is probably not far behind.\"</p><p>However, the robo advice industry is also a crowded soup of new entrants, and the initial results haven't been as promising as some had hoped.</p><p>Major competitors like Schwab and Vanguard have their own megalithic robo platforms, and many of the FAANG companies may hesitate to enter a highly regulated market with entrenched competitors, says Eric Walters, founder of SilverCrest Wealth Planning, an RIA located in Greenwood Village, Colorado.</p><p>Another potential roadblock is the current economics of financial advice. Pricing pressure caused by the race to zero commission trades coupled with high customer acquisition costs has shrunk margins for many digital wealth management firms.</p><p>\"They would rather leverage their ubiquity, control of consumer data and iconic cultural status to facilitate the flow of money - including via partners like Citigroup - to the extent they become irreplaceable components of the financial services ecosystem,\" says Will Trout, a senior analyst at Celent.</p><p>Even if advisors don't expect to face direct competition for clients from big technology firms, one could well offer a new platform, like a wealth management integration, that RIAs might then adopt, says Linda Erickson, founder of Erickson Advisors, an RIA in Greensboro, North Carolina.</p><p>\"I can't see [big tech firms] replacing my money management skills,\" Erickson says. \"Where money management is a commodity - not personalized - maybe they will develop a better approach than robo advisors. I doubt client relationships will be entirely replaced by artificial intelligence.\"</p><p>Still, automated advice continues to defy the industry's initial growth expectations. Assets under robos are expected to grow to over $1.26 trillion by 2023, according to a study by Aite Group.</p><p>In fact, robo advice was listed as one of the top technologies that would change wealth management in the course of the next three years, according to Financial Planning's latest annual Tech Survey. Robos beat out other high-profile technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced risk profiling.</p><p>RESISTANCE IS UNWISEWhether or not Google ends up getting into the wealth management game, there are tangible steps RIAs can take to mitigate the potential risks. The first is to find additional value beyond what a FAANG robo advisor would provide clients.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, advisors shouldn't be focused on the tech companies coming in,\" Mackrill says. \"They should be focused on what they can actually control.\"</p><p>Advisors will need to provide value to their clients through comprehensive financial planning or a unique investment strategy that is not available through automated platforms, Mackrill says. Some good places to start include adding tax services, financial planning or estate planning.</p><p>Ultimately, the human element will be the advisor's secret weapon.</p><p>\"The future of advice looks a lot more like therapy than anything else,\" Mackrill says.</p><p>RIAs will have to open their eyes to the potential risks from tech disruptors, because ultimately technological transformation will happen, he says. It might not be the FAANGs that come into the advice marketplace, but they represent a larger ideology. Change is coming - and RIAs have traditionally been resistant to change.</p><p>\"It's certainly a growing problem,\" Mackrill says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANKIC-0000016e-666c-d66e-a96f-7f7e4b770001-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANKIC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH3-33F1-F06X-W4YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1641\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

He is unconcerned about Google's announcement that it may offer a consumer checking account. But he is a little nervous about how comfortable clients have become with an array of digital financial tools, and what that might mean for his livelihood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I would not be shocked if Google offers more planning,\" says Balcom, the founder of 1650 Wealth Management, an RIA in Lauderdale-by-the Sea, Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many advisors, though, it's not if, but when.</p><p>Even now, technology allows firms to seamlessly partner with broker-dealers or independent advisors to offer managed investment accounts, lending products, checking accounts and retirement vehicles. At the same time, other barriers between traditional financial services and wealth management are breaking down.</p><p>Apple, for instance, launched its credit card in March. In November, Google said it would look to partner with Citigroup to offer checking accounts sometime this year. While the firms may use the accounts to collect client data and peek more deeply into customers' behavior, they are also seen as taking big steps toward the traditional purview of wealth management.</p><p>\"It's obvious from where I sit that big tech will want to make the jump,\" says Jud Mackrill, chief marketing officer at Carson Group. \"A managed account solution is going to come along with one of these product launches.\"</p><p>These latest offerings are an unwelcome reminder of an ever-present question on the minds of wealth managers: Will the FAANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google - as well as other big tech companies make a land grab of services historically provided by financial services? If so, at what cost to traditional RIAs?</p><p>\"Potentially, if Google got cleared to conduct a brokerage business, they could move in any direction they want,\" says Greg O'Gara, a senior research analyst at Aite Group.</p><p>\"Essentially, nothing is going to stop the democratization of investing through technology, and once one of these [tech companies] makes an imprint on the broker-dealer landscape, the growth prospects are very, very good,\" he adds.</p><p>Google's entry into finance can be traced, in part, to recent efforts by fintechs to evolve beyond investing and advice. And, just as those partnerships have rapidly grown, there is little to prevent the search engine giant from teaming up with a broker to launch a wealth management pilot.</p><p>\"We're exploring how we can partner with banks and credit unions in the U.S. to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay,\" says Google spokesman Craig Ewer. In the United States, more than 2,000 banks already offer card transactions via Google Pay, Ewer says.</p><p>Last year, a host of digital wealth managers served up a buffet of new financial services options including banking and lending.</p><p>Betterment and many of its competitors added cash products with annual percentage yields sometimes as much as 2% more than traditional accounts at incumbent banks. (The yields depend heavily on prevailing interest rates.</p><p>Wealthfront advertised its account as the highest-yielding in the market when it announced in early 2019, and says that it attracted $1 billion in assets as a result.</p><p>The most successful may be from micro-savings app Acorns, which was one of the first to tack on additional services and now boasts checking, debit cards and retirement savings vehicles with 6.2 million accounts and $1.7 billion in AUM, according to the firm. Its retirement product, Acorns Later, built up 170,000 accounts in its first two months, according to Acorns CEO Noah Kerner.</p><p>The business strategy of partnering with financial institutions has essentially been mapped by smaller fintechs and has proved successful. Google is now emulating that model to launch its checking account slated to pilot this year. The question may now become not whether tech giants will enter wealth management - but what can possibly stop them?</p><p>Carson Wealth Management became one of the first big advisory firms to offer checking accounts to its clients last May.</p><p>Through its partnership with the digital banking provider Galileo, Carson's RIA clients have access to a Mastercard-branded debit card, online bill paying, direct deposit options and the ability to use tens of thousands of ATMs, according to the firm.</p><p>\"We view Amazon as the competition,\" Ron Carson, CEO of Carson Group, told Financial Planning after Apple announced its credit card launch in March. \"Whenever they decide to get directly into our business, we have to be prepared. They haven't yet because there is just so much low-hanging fruit. But they are coming.\"</p><p>TOO BIG TO SUCCEED?Ominously for independents, a majority of investors who are considering switching financial services providers said they would think about banking with tech companies such as Facebook, Google or Amazon if they could, according to a recent survey by MX, a digital banking technology provider.</p><p>Almost 60% of the survey respondents said they would consider depositing a paycheck with a major technology company.</p><p>\"Cash is a very easy commodity to generate income on, and once you attract clients, you can cross-sell anything,\" O'Gara says.</p><p>\"There really is not much that would stop them from building out a broader investment platform. With the right regulatory oversight, nothing is stopping them,\" he adds.</p><p>It's not a foregone conclusion, however. Google had a similar product, Google Compare, that compared different financial products for consumers, which potentially could have shifted into robo advice. It was shuttered in 2016. \"Google has a bit of attention deficit\" disorder, Mackrill says. \"They'll try something new and have no problem killing it.\"</p><p>The fintech partnerships have one important advantage: the ability to leapfrog regulatory hurdles. Many RIAs cite regulation as a top barrier preventing FAANGs from entering wealth management.</p><p>\"The team at Google Pay has been working for years to help make money simple and accessible for our users, in close partnership with banks, credit unions, and the existing regulatory and financial systems,\" the Google spokesman says. \"We believe our partners' regulatory and financial know-how is a great complement to our experience in building helpful tools and technology for our users.\"</p><p>WHAT ABOUT ROBOS?What's stopping Google from offering an off-the-shelf retirement product? The answer is, not much.</p><p>\"If I were a robo advisor, I would certainly be worried,\" says 1650 Wealth Management's Balcom. \"Amazon is probably not far behind.\"</p><p>However, the robo advice industry is also a crowded soup of new entrants, and the initial results haven't been as promising as some had hoped.</p><p>Major competitors like Schwab and Vanguard have their own megalithic robo platforms, and many of the FAANG companies may hesitate to enter a highly regulated market with entrenched competitors, says Eric Walters, founder of SilverCrest Wealth Planning, an RIA located in Greenwood Village, Colorado.</p><p>Another potential roadblock is the current economics of financial advice. Pricing pressure caused by the race to zero commission trades coupled with high customer acquisition costs has shrunk margins for many digital wealth management firms.</p><p>\"They would rather leverage their ubiquity, control of consumer data and iconic cultural status to facilitate the flow of money - including via partners like Citigroup - to the extent they become irreplaceable components of the financial services ecosystem,\" says Will Trout, a senior analyst at Celent.</p><p>Even if advisors don't expect to face direct competition for clients from big technology firms, one could well offer a new platform, like a wealth management integration, that RIAs might then adopt, says Linda Erickson, founder of Erickson Advisors, an RIA in Greensboro, North Carolina.</p><p>\"I can't see [big tech firms] replacing my money management skills,\" Erickson says. \"Where money management is a commodity - not personalized - maybe they will develop a better approach than robo advisors. I doubt client relationships will be entirely replaced by artificial intelligence.\"</p><p>Still, automated advice continues to defy the industry's initial growth expectations. Assets under robos are expected to grow to over $1.26 trillion by 2023, according to a study by Aite Group.</p><p>In fact, robo advice was listed as one of the top technologies that would change wealth management in the course of the next three years, according to Financial Planning's latest annual Tech Survey. Robos beat out other high-profile technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced risk profiling.</p><p>RESISTANCE IS UNWISEWhether or not Google ends up getting into the wealth management game, there are tangible steps RIAs can take to mitigate the potential risks. The first is to find additional value beyond what a FAANG robo advisor would provide clients.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, advisors shouldn't be focused on the tech companies coming in,\" Mackrill says. \"They should be focused on what they can actually control.\"</p><p>Advisors will need to provide value to their clients through comprehensive financial planning or a unique investment strategy that is not available through automated platforms, Mackrill says. Some good places to start include adding tax services, financial planning or estate planning.</p><p>Ultimately, the human element will be the advisor's secret weapon.</p><p>\"The future of advice looks a lot more like therapy than anything else,\" Mackrill says.</p><p>RIAs will have to open their eyes to the potential risks from tech disruptors, because ultimately technological transformation will happen, he says. It might not be the FAANGs that come into the advice marketplace, but they represent a larger ideology. Change is coming - and RIAs have traditionally been resistant to change.</p><p>\"It's certainly a growing problem,\" Mackrill says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINPLN-0000016e-666c-d66e-a96f-7f7e4b770001-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINPLN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH2-C971-JCRW-53RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">170491</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1641\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

He is unconcerned about Google's announcement that it may offer a consumer checking account. But he is a little nervous about how comfortable clients have become with an array of digital financial tools, and what that might mean for his livelihood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I would not be shocked if Google offers more planning,\" says Balcom, the founder of 1650 Wealth Management, an RIA in Lauderdale-by-the Sea, Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many advisors, though, it's not if, but when.</p><p>Even now, technology allows firms to seamlessly partner with broker-dealers or independent advisors to offer managed investment accounts, lending products, checking accounts and retirement vehicles. At the same time, other barriers between traditional financial services and wealth management are breaking down.</p><p>Apple, for instance, launched its credit card in March. In November, Google said it would look to partner with Citigroup to offer checking accounts sometime this year. While the firms may use the accounts to collect client data and peek more deeply into customers' behavior, they are also seen as taking big steps toward the traditional purview of wealth management.</p><p>\"It's obvious from where I sit that big tech will want to make the jump,\" says Jud Mackrill, chief marketing officer at Carson Group. \"A managed account solution is going to come along with one of these product launches.\"</p><p>These latest offerings are an unwelcome reminder of an ever-present question on the minds of wealth managers: Will the FAANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google - as well as other big tech companies make a land grab of services historically provided by financial services? If so, at what cost to traditional RIAs?</p><p>\"Potentially, if Google got cleared to conduct a brokerage business, they could move in any direction they want,\" says Greg O'Gara, a senior research analyst at Aite Group.</p><p>\"Essentially, nothing is going to stop the democratization of investing through technology, and once one of these [tech companies] makes an imprint on the broker-dealer landscape, the growth prospects are very, very good,\" he adds.</p><p>Google's entry into finance can be traced, in part, to recent efforts by fintechs to evolve beyond investing and advice. And, just as those partnerships have rapidly grown, there is little to prevent the search engine giant from teaming up with a broker to launch a wealth management pilot.</p><p>\"We're exploring how we can partner with banks and credit unions in the U.S. to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay,\" says Google spokesman Craig Ewer. In the United States, more than 2,000 banks already offer card transactions via Google Pay, Ewer says.</p><p>Last year, a host of digital wealth managers served up a buffet of new financial services options including banking and lending.</p><p>Betterment and many of its competitors added cash products with annual percentage yields sometimes as much as 2% more than traditional accounts at incumbent banks. (The yields depend heavily on prevailing interest rates.</p><p>Wealthfront advertised its account as the highest-yielding in the market when it announced in early 2019, and says that it attracted $1 billion in assets as a result.</p><p>The most successful may be from micro-savings app Acorns, which was one of the first to tack on additional services and now boasts checking, debit cards and retirement savings vehicles with 6.2 million accounts and $1.7 billion in AUM, according to the firm. Its retirement product, Acorns Later, built up 170,000 accounts in its first two months, according to Acorns CEO Noah Kerner.</p><p>The business strategy of partnering with financial institutions has essentially been mapped by smaller fintechs and has proved successful. Google is now emulating that model to launch its checking account slated to pilot this year. The question may now become not whether tech giants will enter wealth management - but what can possibly stop them?</p><p>Carson Wealth Management became one of the first big advisory firms to offer checking accounts to its clients last May.</p><p>Through its partnership with the digital banking provider Galileo, Carson's RIA clients have access to a Mastercard-branded debit card, online bill paying, direct deposit options and the ability to use tens of thousands of ATMs, according to the firm.</p><p>\"We view Amazon as the competition,\" Ron Carson, CEO of Carson Group, told Financial Planning after Apple announced its credit card launch in March. \"Whenever they decide to get directly into our business, we have to be prepared. They haven't yet because there is just so much low-hanging fruit. But they are coming.\"</p><p>TOO BIG TO SUCCEED?Ominously for independents, a majority of investors who are considering switching financial services providers said they would think about banking with tech companies such as Facebook, Google or Amazon if they could, according to a recent survey by MX, a digital banking technology provider.</p><p>Almost 60% of the survey respondents said they would consider depositing a paycheck with a major technology company.</p><p>\"Cash is a very easy commodity to generate income on, and once you attract clients, you can cross-sell anything,\" O'Gara says.</p><p>\"There really is not much that would stop them from building out a broader investment platform. With the right regulatory oversight, nothing is stopping them,\" he adds.</p><p>It's not a foregone conclusion, however. Google had a similar product, Google Compare, that compared different financial products for consumers, which potentially could have shifted into robo advice. It was shuttered in 2016. \"Google has a bit of attention deficit\" disorder, Mackrill says. \"They'll try something new and have no problem killing it.\"</p><p>The fintech partnerships have one important advantage: the ability to leapfrog regulatory hurdles. Many RIAs cite regulation as a top barrier preventing FAANGs from entering wealth management.</p><p>\"The team at Google Pay has been working for years to help make money simple and accessible for our users, in close partnership with banks, credit unions, and the existing regulatory and financial systems,\" the Google spokesman says. \"We believe our partners' regulatory and financial know-how is a great complement to our experience in building helpful tools and technology for our users.\"</p><p>WHAT ABOUT ROBOS?What's stopping Google from offering an off-the-shelf retirement product? The answer is, not much.</p><p>\"If I were a robo advisor, I would certainly be worried,\" says 1650 Wealth Management's Balcom. \"Amazon is probably not far behind.\"</p><p>However, the robo advice industry is also a crowded soup of new entrants, and the initial results haven't been as promising as some had hoped.</p><p>Major competitors like Schwab and Vanguard have their own megalithic robo platforms, and many of the FAANG companies may hesitate to enter a highly regulated market with entrenched competitors, says Eric Walters, founder of SilverCrest Wealth Planning, an RIA located in Greenwood Village, Colorado.</p><p>Another potential roadblock is the current economics of financial advice. Pricing pressure caused by the race to zero commission trades coupled with high customer acquisition costs has shrunk margins for many digital wealth management firms.</p><p>\"They would rather leverage their ubiquity, control of consumer data and iconic cultural status to facilitate the flow of money - including via partners like Citigroup - to the extent they become irreplaceable components of the financial services ecosystem,\" says Will Trout, a senior analyst at Celent.</p><p>Even if advisors don't expect to face direct competition for clients from big technology firms, one could well offer a new platform, like a wealth management integration, that RIAs might then adopt, says Linda Erickson, founder of Erickson Advisors, an RIA in Greensboro, North Carolina.</p><p>\"I can't see [big tech firms] replacing my money management skills,\" Erickson says. \"Where money management is a commodity - not personalized - maybe they will develop a better approach than robo advisors. I doubt client relationships will be entirely replaced by artificial intelligence.\"</p><p>Still, automated advice continues to defy the industry's initial growth expectations. Assets under robos are expected to grow to over $1.26 trillion by 2023, according to a study by Aite Group.</p><p>In fact, robo advice was listed as one of the top technologies that would change wealth management in the course of the next three years, according to Financial Planning's latest annual Tech Survey. Robos beat out other high-profile technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced risk profiling.</p><p>RESISTANCE IS UNWISEWhether or not Google ends up getting into the wealth management game, there are tangible steps RIAs can take to mitigate the potential risks. The first is to find additional value beyond what a FAANG robo advisor would provide clients.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, advisors shouldn't be focused on the tech companies coming in,\" Mackrill says. \"They should be focused on what they can actually control.\"</p><p>Advisors will need to provide value to their clients through comprehensive financial planning or a unique investment strategy that is not available through automated platforms, Mackrill says. Some good places to start include adding tax services, financial planning or estate planning.</p><p>Ultimately, the human element will be the advisor's secret weapon.</p><p>\"The future of advice looks a lot more like therapy than anything else,\" Mackrill says.</p><p>RIAs will have to open their eyes to the potential risks from tech disruptors, because ultimately technological transformation will happen, he says. It might not be the FAANGs that come into the advice marketplace, but they represent a larger ideology. Change is coming - and RIAs have traditionally been resistant to change.</p><p>\"It's certainly a growing problem,\" Mackrill says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ONWALL-0000016e-666c-d66e-a96f-7f7e4b770001-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ONWALL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH3-33F1-F06X-W507-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">170497</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1641\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Smith, Bloomberg</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US politicians have got their facts wrong on soaring corporate profits</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bernie Sanders relishes the disdain of America's business elite, proudly displaying on his campaign website his anti-endorsements from corporate titans and their apologists. It's theme he has championed his entire career \u2014 and it appears to be gaining purchase on both sides of the aisle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls corporate America the biggest threat to liberty in America. Senator Marco Rubio has a plan to discourage stock buy-backs and force companies to invest more in US workers. And don't forget Sanders's Democratic colleague and rival Elizabeth Warren, with her many anti-big-business proposals.</p><p>There's only one problem with all these proposals, apart from their wrongheadedness: The corporate greed they are meant to combat is hard to find in the data. In terms of profitability, corporate America has been stagnant since 2012, despite receiving a huge tax cut in 2017.</p><p>Where are the profits?</p><p>How about before-tax profits as a percentage of gross domestic product? That's a more consistent measure of corporate power over time. It surged in the early 2000s as the technology sector recovered rapidly from the dot-com bust and became hugely profitable, even as the rest of the economy floundered.</p><p>That surge, however, has been in the process of unwinding for some time. With the exception of a few brief upticks, profits as a share of the economy have been declining for seven years and are now almost exactly equal to the average since 1947.</p><p>Finally, there is the question about profits and wages. In profitable times, do corporations tend to keep more for themselves and share less with workers? To the contrary: Strong profits tend to be good for workers.</p><p>The sustained fall in profits as a share of GDP that began in the late 1970s corresponds with a period of declining wage growth for the working class. The 1950s and '60s, on the other hand, saw a profit share similar to where they are today.</p><p>Helping both sides</p><p>The most recent surge in profits, in the 2000s, wasn't a sign of excessive corporate greed or of companies \"giving up\" on workers. Instead, it reflected a technological revolution that created both rising profits for tech companies and rising incomes for highly skilled workers.</p><p>That revolution is now maturing, and corporate profit's share of GDP is now returning to normal. Wages for low-skilled workers are growing nearly as fast as those for high-skilled. If the US is able to keep the economic expansion going, that gap is likely to close further.</p><p>So much for the data. As for the policy: Sanders, Warren and the like shouldn't be disparaging corporate profits. When they are rising as a share of the economy, it means the economy is doing well; they begin to fall just before a recession.</p><p>In a sense, all the rhetoric around corporate greed is understandable: Politics always lags reality. Wage stagnation, and the surge in inequality that accompanies it, is the product of a process that began nearly two decades ago and is already playing itself out.</p><p>Efforts to rein in corporate profits or break up big tech amount to fighting the last war. What the US needs are pro-growth policies that keep demand for workers high \u2014 and wages for the least skilled on an upward trajectory.</p><p>That means free trade, an internationally competitive tax structure, dovish monetary policy and regulatory policy that allows companies to choose how best to invest in their workers and their businesses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-153249144</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X05-8XP1-JDJN-645V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"580\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

I've seen executives feign powerlessness as if we're not a company the size of some countries. We're told we can't take dramatic action. When we respond this way it's disingenuous. We're choosing to use our power to solve the wrong problems, and we can do better.</p><p>Yolanda Chavez, who spoke at the meeting as a representative of Silicon Valley Rising, expressed concerns about Googles plan for a giant campus in San Jose.</p><p>Yesterday's announcement (a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/18/1-billion-google-plan-ease-bay-area-housing-crisis-tech/\">$1 billion pledge</url> by the company to help with Bay Area housing) was a positive sign that Google is listening to the community, she said through a translator. But Chavez noted that the 5,000 in affordable-housing units Pichai mentioned in a blog post as part of the plan are needed in San Jose alone, according to a study she cited. What's your plan to mitigate Google's impact on San Jose?</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat answered that our announcement really underscores our commitment to Bay Area, and pointed to other initiatives by the company, including its philanthropic arm Google.org, which she said is working on housing, and in trying to teach digital skills.</p><p>One shareholder complained that Alphabet CEO Larry Page wasnt present. Page and Google co-founder Sergey Brin are seldom seen at public company events.</p><p>Maybe one year he's sick, the shareholder said. But year after year, there's no CEO here.</p><p>Because of the companys multi-class stock structure, Page and Brin together have 51 percent of voting shares, a reason shareholder resolutions fail year after year.</p><p>But theyre a way to keep putting pressure on Google, which needs it, said Don Heider, executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.</p><p>There are pockets of Google working on ethics, but not an overarching commitment that's taking place, Heider said.</p><p>Heider said big tech companies including Google have asked ethicists to talk to them in the past year as theyve increasingly come under fire, and one member of the center is working half-time with the company to try to help build ethics into the companys products and designs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-to-switch/\">        Google Chrome has become surveillance software.
