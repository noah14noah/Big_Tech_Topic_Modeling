Source: Fitch Solutions Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Main Regional Features And Latest Updates</p><p>In the most recent update of our Autos Production Risk/Reward Index (RRI), the Asia region's overall score has remained stable at 56.2 out of a possible 100. As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The region performs particularly well under the Reward pillar of our RRI (57.0), especially under the 'Competitive Landscape', 'Average wages/ labour costs' and 'Manufacturing Capability' indicators. This indicates that there are already many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) operating in the region and that due to the low labour cost and the region's manufacturing capability, there are supportive factors for more automakers to set up operations in the region. The Asia region benefits from major automotive producing countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy competition levels (as measured by the competitive landscape indicator), a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. This quarter, the overall scores for the Asia region under our RRI remained largely unchanged despite significant production growth revisions to nearly all countries that we cover due to the Covid-19 pandemic. That said, because the global autos production industry has weakened under the weight of the pandemic, the relative rankings have not changed. Japan has regained its position as the second most attractive market in Asia for vehicle production due to lower economic risks. This is because the country's economy is more robust than some of its Asian neighbours and other automotive producing economies around the world, which means that it is better placed to deal with the Covid-19 impact. However, Japan's vehicle production is under significant strain as the demand for vehicles in the domestic and external market all weaken under the weight of the Covid-19 pandemic. The country scores only 37.5 out of a possible 100 under the 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our RRI, which underperforms both the regional average of 48.9 and the global average. Having such large local industries in the region means Asia has been particularly hard hit by the spread of Covid-19 leading to production stoppages and supply chain disruptions, which is reflected in lower scores for vehicle production growth compared with last quarter for several large markets. China, with an RRI score of 71.9, remains the top-performing market in the Asia region and second-best in the global context behind only the US which scores 77.7 out of a possible 100. Being the first and one of the hardest-hit markets from the impact of Covid-19, however, it is also one of the first autos production industries to start recovering post Covid-19. This means that it remains ahead of all other Asia countries that we cover in our RRI.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19. We highlight that Japan is not shielded from suppressed output amid the pandemic, which means that its overall score is being held back by its performance under our 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our Risk/Reward Index.</p><p>Strength Of China's Autos Industry Keeps It On Top Asia - Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Heat Map</p><p>Note: Scores out of 100; higher score = more attractive market.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19. We highlight that Japan is not shielded from suppressed output amid the pandemic, which means that its overall score is being held back by its performance under our 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our Risk/Reward Index.</p><p>Strength Of China's Autos Industry Keeps It On Top Asia - Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Heat Map</p><p>Note: Scores out of 100; higher score = more attractive market.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19. We highlight that Japan is not shielded from suppressed output amid the pandemic, which means that its overall score is being held back by its performance under our 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our Risk/Reward Index.</p><p>Strength Of China's Autos Industry Keeps It On Top Asia - Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Heat Map</p><p>Note: Scores out of 100; higher score = more attractive market.

In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction. It had still called itself a \"beta.\")</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 4.3 guideline is something Apple wields to keep the App Store free from what it considers to be clutter and spam. In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc. already.\"</p><p>In the document, Apple promises to reject anything that \"doesn't offer a high-quality experience.\"</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 OFFERALL LNC.

In an open letter, Accountable Tech urges the five U.S.-based Facebook Oversight Board members to \"demand the Board be given real authority\" or quit their positions.</p><p>\"Each of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\" the letter's authors write. \"Now is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade -- that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\"</p><p>Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the 2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign's response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.</p><p>\"Facebook specializes in window dressing,\" Gill told TechCrunch. \"They have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform's problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\"</p><p>A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club. The letter cites findings from Facebook's recent civil rights audit that cast doubt on the board's real power and also notes the oversight body's delayed timeline. First announced in late 2018, the board won't be up and running in time for the 2020 election.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>SpaceX has managed a first - catching both halves of the fairing used on one of its Falcon 9 rocket launches, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p>SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p>The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>has completed another successful launch, this time on behalf of Lockheed Martin and its client South Korea. The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p>The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: Treasure8 adds Chris Cowart to its executive team as it renews pushing its tech to reduce food waste</p><p>Chris Cowart, the longtime IDEO product designer, Singularity University faculty member and consultant to a variety of venture firms and tech projects, is joining the food preservation technology developer Treasure8 as its new chief innovation and strategy officer, according to a post on LinkedIn.</p><p>\"In the last three years food has come to the fore as a theme,\" said Cowart in an interview with TechCrunch. Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p>At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p>After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise. Our goal was both simple and bold: to reinvent the venture capital industry by bringing more transparency to what has become an ever more opaque financial environment for founders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: The VCs who founders love the most</p><p>Over the past month, we have been asking founders to submit recommendations of VCs for The TechCrunch List, our newly-launched curated directory of investors who are ready to write first checks and lead venture rounds into startups. You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations. They have also been edited for clarity.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: US Commerce Dept. amends Huawei ban to allow for development of 5G standards</p><p>The United States Department of Commerce today issued a change to its sweeping Huawei ban.

While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote, it's today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices.

Founded in 2017 by ex-Googlers, the AI vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega first raised blood pressures - people hated how it referenced and poorly 'disrupted' mom-and-pop shops in one fell swoop - and then raised a lot of money. But ultimately, it was no match for COVID-19 and the hit it has had on how we live.</p><p>TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Stockwell will be shutting down at the end of this month, after it was unable find a viable business for its in-building app-controlled \"smart\" vending machines stocked with convenience store items.</p><p>\"Regretfully, the current landscape has created a situation in which we can no longer continue our operations and will be winding down the company on July 1st,\" co-founder and CEO Paul McDonald wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \"We are deeply grateful to our talented team, incredible partners and investors, and our amazing shoppers that made this possible.

The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular. But significant competition made it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>\"We are excited to be part of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond family,\" said Dinesh Lathi, Chief Executive Officer of One Kings Lane, in a statement. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for our customers, as well as our employees and business partners, to benefit from additional support and resources and gain exposure to new customers.

This comes just two weeks after the company closed a $3.5 billion equity round from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. If the deal goes through, it would mean the company has added $5.5 Billion to it coffers in the amount of time it takes a typical startup to initiate discussion of a funding round.</p><p>One benefit of Uber raising money as debt rather than equity is that it can avoid additional dilution for its employees. The company has raised $12.51 billion in equity financing since 2009. The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that.

Apple notes that the guidelines themselves haven't changed, they've just been written to be \"more helpful\" and \"provide more context.\" Unfortunately, that additional context isn't yet available for new App Store rules, like the expanded ability to monetize apps via subscriptions.</p><p>Notably, too, Apple has consolidated the iOS and Mac App Store guidelines into a single document.</p><p>This latter change represents an overall strategy of treating Apple's platforms - iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS - as being under the same umbrella, instead of having so many unique peculiarities that they require separate documentation. It also makes sense to combine the previous Mac App Store Guidelines with the App Store Guidelines as there was a lot of overlap among the rules.</p><p>In the updated documentation, Apple has set aside a special section for Mac App Store apps (2.4.5) which addresses how those apps can interoperate with Mac computers, what they're allowed to do, and how they should be updated and maintained.</p><p>Screen Shot 2016-06-14 at 11.22.09 AMOddly, Apple has also released a separate version of its new guidelines as a comic book, which is having mixed reactions.</p><p>Largely, though, Apple is correct in saying that nothing much has changed otherwise between the two documents.

Viking Global also led Ginkgo's Series B round.</p><p>Ginkgo currently makes products for the flavor, fragrance and food industries as well as works with DARPA to produce probiotics that will help U.S. soldiers stave off stomach bugs they might pick up overseas but started looking at expanding to other industries last year.</p><p>The startup announced in the spring of 2015 it would be buying 100 million base pairs of DNA to help it move into new production areas but has since upped that amount to the 600 million base pairs and will be partnering with Twist Bioscience and Gen9 to supply the synthetic DNA.</p><p>June 08: OfferAll lnc.: Accel appoints ex-Facebooker Nir Blumberger as Venture Partner to focus on Israel</p><p>VC firm Accel's London office has appointed a new Venture Partner to focus on Israel.

Most recently, Accel led a $12 million Series B in E8 Storage, an early-stage enterprise storage company founded in Tel Aviv.</p><p>Philippe Botteri, Partner at Accel, said in a statement: \"Israel is a vibrant hub for innovation, and Accel has long-held conviction in the great ideas and entrepreneurs that have emerged from the region. We are seeing exciting companies and technologies come out of Israel at an increasing pace, making it the perfect time for us to expand our presence.</p><p>June 08: OfferAll lnc.: Fujitsu signs deal to integrate Box cloud storage into its enterprise software</p><p>Box just inked one of its biggest deals in Asia so far as it focuses on international growth. Fujitsu, one of Japan's largest IT services providers, announced today that it has struck a strategic partnership with the cloud-storage company and will integrate Box into its enterprise software.</p><p>Fujitsu will first start using Box to store and manage files sent on communication tools used by its 160,000 employees around the world. The company says the internal use of Box's services will help it develop new enterprise software, including customer-relationship and enterprise-content management solutions, that it plans to release by March 2017 and market throughout Asia.</p><p>Fujitsu will also integrate Box into MetaArc, its new cloud platform, next year. MetaArc includes third-party services (like Box storage), as well as infrastructure and application hosting services. Customer data uploaded to Box will be stored at Fujitsu data centers in Japan. This will help Box appeal to businesses that don't want to store their data overseas and complements the company's new plan to offer cloud data centers, called Box Zones, in Ireland, Germany, Singapore, and Japan.</p><p>Box founder and CEO Aaron Levie has said that expanding in Europe and Asia is a priority for the company, which went public in January 2015 but has traded below its IPO price since then despite posting solid earnings.</p><p>Other partnerships Box has struck to expand internationally include an agreement with IBM that will let Box store data in IBM's cloud data centers, which are located in 16 countries.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2107201423393789000184767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DB-0JC1-DXKH-N3JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5715\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters. Catching them using the nets rather than retrieving them from the ocean after a controlled soft landing saves them a lot of time, effort, cost and risk to personnel, making it a much more effective way to reuse that component provided they can ensure the ships are able to reliably catch the fairings as they descend.</p><p>The fairing halves don't have any propellant systems to control their landing like the Falcon 9 first stages do - instead, they're slowed via parachutes, meaning there's a bigger reliance on the ships to actually be positioned correctly to anticipate their fall, since it's not specifically programmed. But there's another big reason Musk and SpaceX want to get this aspect of the launch system right: Musk has said previously that he'd potentially consider adapting the fairing catching ships to also catch Crew Dragon capsules as they return to Earth, reducing risk for astronauts and recovery crews who currently have to collect them from the Ocean.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 OFFERALL LNC.

In an open letter, Accountable Tech urges the five U.S.-based Facebook Oversight Board members to \"demand the Board be given real authority\" or quit their positions.</p><p>\"Each of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\" the letter's authors write. \"Now is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade -- that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\"</p><p>Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the 2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign's response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.</p><p>\"Facebook specializes in window dressing,\" Gill told TechCrunch. \"They have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform's problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\"</p><p>A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club. The letter cites findings from Facebook's recent civil rights audit that cast doubt on the board's real power and also notes the oversight body's delayed timeline. First announced in late 2018, the board won't be up and running in time for the 2020 election.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>has completed another successful launch, this time on behalf of Lockheed Martin and its client South Korea. The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p>The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: After numerous rejections, Struck's dating app for the Co-Star crowd hits the App Store</p><p>Founded by former Apple engineers, a new app called Struck wants to be the Tinder for the Co-Star crowd. In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p>Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction. It had still called itself a \"beta.\")</p><p>The 4.3 guideline is something Apple wields to keep the App Store free from what it considers to be clutter and spam. In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: Treasure8 adds Chris Cowart to its executive team as it renews pushing its tech to reduce food waste</p><p>Chris Cowart, the longtime IDEO product designer, Singularity University faculty member and consultant to a variety of venture firms and tech projects, is joining the food preservation technology developer Treasure8 as its new chief innovation and strategy officer, according to a post on LinkedIn.</p><p>\"In the last three years food has come to the fore as a theme,\" said Cowart in an interview with TechCrunch. Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p>At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p>After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise. Our goal was both simple and bold: to reinvent the venture capital industry by bringing more transparency to what has become an ever more opaque financial environment for founders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: The VCs who founders love the most</p><p>Over the past month, we have been asking founders to submit recommendations of VCs for The TechCrunch List, our newly-launched curated directory of investors who are ready to write first checks and lead venture rounds into startups. You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations. They have also been edited for clarity.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: US Commerce Dept. amends Huawei ban to allow for development of 5G standards</p><p>The United States Department of Commerce today issued a change to its sweeping Huawei ban.

While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote, it's today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices.

Founded in 2017 by ex-Googlers, the AI vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega first raised blood pressures - people hated how it referenced and poorly 'disrupted' mom-and-pop shops in one fell swoop - and then raised a lot of money. But ultimately, it was no match for COVID-19 and the hit it has had on how we live.</p><p>TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Stockwell will be shutting down at the end of this month, after it was unable find a viable business for its in-building app-controlled \"smart\" vending machines stocked with convenience store items.</p><p>\"Regretfully, the current landscape has created a situation in which we can no longer continue our operations and will be winding down the company on July 1st,\" co-founder and CEO Paul McDonald wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \"We are deeply grateful to our talented team, incredible partners and investors, and our amazing shoppers that made this possible.

The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular. But significant competition made it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>\"We are excited to be part of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond family,\" said Dinesh Lathi, Chief Executive Officer of One Kings Lane, in a statement. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for our customers, as well as our employees and business partners, to benefit from additional support and resources and gain exposure to new customers.

This comes just two weeks after the company closed a $3.5 billion equity round from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. If the deal goes through, it would mean the company has added $5.5 Billion to it coffers in the amount of time it takes a typical startup to initiate discussion of a funding round.</p><p>One benefit of Uber raising money as debt rather than equity is that it can avoid additional dilution for its employees. The company has raised $12.51 billion in equity financing since 2009. The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that.

Apple notes that the guidelines themselves haven't changed, they've just been written to be \"more helpful\" and \"provide more context.\" Unfortunately, that additional context isn't yet available for new App Store rules, like the expanded ability to monetize apps via subscriptions.</p><p>Notably, too, Apple has consolidated the iOS and Mac App Store guidelines into a single document.</p><p>This latter change represents an overall strategy of treating Apple's platforms - iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS - as being under the same umbrella, instead of having so many unique peculiarities that they require separate documentation. It also makes sense to combine the previous Mac App Store Guidelines with the App Store Guidelines as there was a lot of overlap among the rules.</p><p>In the updated documentation, Apple has set aside a special section for Mac App Store apps (2.4.5) which addresses how those apps can interoperate with Mac computers, what they're allowed to do, and how they should be updated and maintained.</p><p>Screen Shot 2016-06-14 at 11.22.09 AMOddly, Apple has also released a separate version of its new guidelines as a comic book, which is having mixed reactions.</p><p>Largely, though, Apple is correct in saying that nothing much has changed otherwise between the two documents.

MetaArc includes third-party services (like Box storage), as well as infrastructure and application hosting services. Customer data uploaded to Box will be stored at Fujitsu data centers in Japan. This will help Box appeal to businesses that don't want to store their data overseas and complements the company's new plan to offer cloud data centers, called Box Zones, in Ireland, Germany, Singapore, and Japan.</p><p>Box founder and CEO Aaron Levie has said that expanding in Europe and Asia is a priority for the company, which went public in January 2015 but has traded below its IPO price since then despite posting solid earnings.</p><p>Other partnerships Box has struck to expand internationally include an agreement with IBM that will let Box store data in IBM's cloud data centers, which are located in 16 countries.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2107201426183789000184767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DB-0JC1-DXKH-N3JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5859\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship. That also went to plan, meaning this booster has now flown two missions and can potentially be flown yet again. This is the 57th successful booster landing for SpaceX.</p><p>Today's mission will also include an attempt to recover the fairing halves used to protect the satellite during launch, which are jettisoned once the payload reaches space. SpaceX isn't detailing that part of the mission live, but will provide an update about its status later.</p><p>The ANASIS-II payload was also confirmed to have been delivered successfully to its target orbit.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 OFFERALL LNC.

In an open letter, Accountable Tech urges the five U.S.-based Facebook Oversight Board members to \"demand the Board be given real authority\" or quit their positions.</p><p>\"Each of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\" the letter's authors write. \"Now is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade -- that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\"</p><p>Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the 2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign's response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.</p><p>\"Facebook specializes in window dressing,\" Gill told TechCrunch. \"They have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform's problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\"</p><p>A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club. The letter cites findings from Facebook's recent civil rights audit that cast doubt on the board's real power and also notes the oversight body's delayed timeline. First announced in late 2018, the board won't be up and running in time for the 2020 election.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>SpaceX has managed a first - catching both halves of the fairing used on one of its Falcon 9 rocket launches, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p>SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p>The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: After numerous rejections, Struck's dating app for the Co-Star crowd hits the App Store</p><p>Founded by former Apple engineers, a new app called Struck wants to be the Tinder for the Co-Star crowd. In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p>Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction. It had still called itself a \"beta.\")</p><p>The 4.3 guideline is something Apple wields to keep the App Store free from what it considers to be clutter and spam. In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: Treasure8 adds Chris Cowart to its executive team as it renews pushing its tech to reduce food waste</p><p>Chris Cowart, the longtime IDEO product designer, Singularity University faculty member and consultant to a variety of venture firms and tech projects, is joining the food preservation technology developer Treasure8 as its new chief innovation and strategy officer, according to a post on LinkedIn.</p><p>\"In the last three years food has come to the fore as a theme,\" said Cowart in an interview with TechCrunch. Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p>At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p>After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise. Our goal was both simple and bold: to reinvent the venture capital industry by bringing more transparency to what has become an ever more opaque financial environment for founders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: The VCs who founders love the most</p><p>Over the past month, we have been asking founders to submit recommendations of VCs for The TechCrunch List, our newly-launched curated directory of investors who are ready to write first checks and lead venture rounds into startups. You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations. They have also been edited for clarity.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: US Commerce Dept. amends Huawei ban to allow for development of 5G standards</p><p>The United States Department of Commerce today issued a change to its sweeping Huawei ban.

While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote, it's today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices. The Apple Developer ecosystem, meanwhile, supports 23 million developers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: Stockwell, the AI-vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega, is shutting down July 1</p><p>Stockwell AI entered the world with a bang but it is leaving with a whimper. Founded in 2017 by ex-Googlers, the AI vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega first raised blood pressures - people hated how it referenced and poorly 'disrupted' mom-and-pop shops in one fell swoop - and then raised a lot of money. But ultimately, it was no match for COVID-19 and the hit it has had on how we live.</p><p>TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Stockwell will be shutting down at the end of this month, after it was unable find a viable business for its in-building app-controlled \"smart\" vending machines stocked with convenience store items.</p><p>\"Regretfully, the current landscape has created a situation in which we can no longer continue our operations and will be winding down the company on July 1st,\" co-founder and CEO Paul McDonald wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \"We are deeply grateful to our talented team, incredible partners and investors, and our amazing shoppers that made this possible. While this wasn't the way we wanted to end this journey, we are confident that our vision of bringing the store to where people live, work and play will live on through other amazing companies, products and services.\"</p><p>We originally reached out after we were tipped off by someone who had received an email about the closure.</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: Rocket Labs next mission could launch just weeks after the last one</p><p>Rocket Lab is creeping closer to its goal of weekly launches with its 13th commercial mission, nicknamed \"Pics Or It Didn't Happen,\" which, if all goes well, will take off only three weeks after the last one.</p><p>\"Don't Stop Me Now\" got to orbit successfully over the weekend, on June 13, and the next one is scheduled for July 3 - weather and other factors permitting.</p><p>\"Rocket Lab has eliminated the small sat waiting room for orbit.

The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular. But significant competition made it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>\"We are excited to be part of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond family,\" said Dinesh Lathi, Chief Executive Officer of One Kings Lane, in a statement. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for our customers, as well as our employees and business partners, to benefit from additional support and resources and gain exposure to new customers.

The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that. The company has a notoriously high burn rate despite reports that company is profitable in the North America.</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Dropbox says it is cash flow positive, in no rush to IPO</p><p>With a $10 billion valuation, cloud storage business Dropbox is larger than many public companies. But don't expect an IPO anytime soon, according to CEO Drew Houston.</p><p>\"Nothing right now,\" said Houston, when asked if the company was working on a plan to go public. Speaking at Bloomberg's Technology Conference in San Francisco, Houston said that Dropbox is \"just enjoying being focused on building and recruiting.\"</p><p>\"We can do that on our own timeline,\" he added, saying that the company is in a position where they are \"not needing to raise money.\"</p><p>It's been two years since Dropbox, which is backed top venture firms including Sequoia and Benchmark, has raised a private fundraising round. But Houston insists that despite negative publicity surrounding the company's finances, they have enough money in the bank to stick around.</p><p>Houston claimed that Dropbox has been cash flow positive, emphasizing that this milestone for a business \"means you control your destiny. Instead of being funded by your investors, you're funded by your customers.\"</p><p>June 14: OfferAll lnc.: Apple releases new App Store Review Guidelines, doest yet clarify rules around subscriptions</p><p>As part of the slew of news released this week as part of Apple's annual developer conference, WWDC, the company has also re-written its App Store Review Guidelines - the documentation that developers use to determine which apps will be accepted or rejected following their submission to the App Store. Apple notes that the guidelines themselves haven't changed, they've just been written to be \"more helpful\" and \"provide more context.\" Unfortunately, that additional context isn't yet available for new App Store rules, like the expanded ability to monetize apps via subscriptions.</p><p>Notably, too, Apple has consolidated the iOS and Mac App Store guidelines into a single document.</p><p>This latter change represents an overall strategy of treating Apple's platforms - iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS - as being under the same umbrella, instead of having so many unique peculiarities that they require separate documentation. It also makes sense to combine the previous Mac App Store Guidelines with the App Store Guidelines as there was a lot of overlap among the rules.</p><p>In the updated documentation, Apple has set aside a special section for Mac App Store apps (2.4.5) which addresses how those apps can interoperate with Mac computers, what they're allowed to do, and how they should be updated and maintained.</p><p>Screen Shot 2016-06-14 at 11.22.09 AMOddly, Apple has also released a separate version of its new guidelines as a comic book, which is having mixed reactions.</p><p>Largely, though, Apple is correct in saying that nothing much has changed otherwise between the two documents. The rules themselves - which focus on topics like privacy, spam, pornography and other objectionable content, violence, kids apps, metadata, payments, and more, are the same.</p><p>June 08: OfferAll lnc.: Ginkgo Bioworks grabs $100 million in financing to buy a whole lot of synthetic DNA</p><p>Ginko Bioworks, the Boston-based biotech startup making all sorts of scents and flavors from microbugs, has pulled in $100 million in Series C funding to obtain 600 million base pairs of manufactured DNA - or what Ginkgo claims is the \"largest amount of synthetic DNA ever purchased.\"</p><p>The startup plans to use the millions of genetic base pairs to test its production metal in new areas such as \"commodity chemicals, industrial enzymes, and human health markets.\"</p><p>The new infusion is all cash and brings the total up to $154 million in funding since Ginkgo launched out of Y Combinator less than two years ago - putting it in the top 10 most significant amounts of financing for any YC startup.</p><p>This new form of biotech (read - not pharmaceutical manufacturing) started heating up in 2014, as production costs dramatically dropped and Ginkgo was one of YC's first biotech startup investments and still faces few competitors, including West Coast counterpart Zymergen, which has raised $45 million to date, to mass produce consumer materials by manipulating microbial DNA.</p><p>The money in this round comes from YC's Continuity Fund, Senator Investment Group, Cascade Investment, Baillie Gifford, Viking Global Investors and Allen &amp; Company LLC. Viking Global also led Ginkgo's Series B round.</p><p>Ginkgo currently makes products for the flavor, fragrance and food industries as well as works with DARPA to produce probiotics that will help U.S. soldiers stave off stomach bugs they might pick up overseas but started looking at expanding to other industries last year.</p><p>The startup announced in the spring of 2015 it would be buying 100 million base pairs of DNA to help it move into new production areas but has since upped that amount to the 600 million base pairs and will be partnering with Twist Bioscience and Gen9 to supply the synthetic DNA.</p><p>June 08: OfferAll lnc.: Accel appoints ex-Facebooker Nir Blumberger as Venture Partner to focus on Israel</p><p>VC firm Accel's London office has appointed a new Venture Partner to focus on Israel. Nir Blumberger has joined from Facebook, where he was a Corporate Development executive, and, we're told, was involved in M&amp;A and strategy in areas such as virtual/augmented reality, messaging and video. He'll be based in Tel Aviv, giving Accel a much more formal presence in Israel, the country where Blumberger was born and raised.</p><p>Prior to his time at the social networking behemoth, he worked for McKinsey &amp; Company in Europe and Israel. Blumberger has an MBA from Stanford University and previously studied computer science at The Interdisciplinary Center in Israel, where he participated in the Zell Entrepreneurship Program. He has also co-founded two technology startups and was a participant at Singularity University's Graduate Studies Program.</p><p>Meanwhile, although Blumberger's appoint signals a doubling down by Accel in Israel - I'm told it's the first time in the VC firm's 30 plus year history that it has had someone based in Israel who is solely focused on Israeli investments - it's not new to investment activity in the country.</p><p>Current and past investments include enterprise security companies Aorato (acquired by Microsoft) and publicly-listed Imperva, global services marketplace Fiverr and data governance solutions provider Varonis Systems. Most recently, Accel led a $12 million Series B in E8 Storage, an early-stage enterprise storage company founded in Tel Aviv.</p><p>Philippe Botteri, Partner at Accel, said in a statement: \"Israel is a vibrant hub for innovation, and Accel has long-held conviction in the great ideas and entrepreneurs that have emerged from the region. We are seeing exciting companies and technologies come out of Israel at an increasing pace, making it the perfect time for us to expand our presence.</p><p>June 08: OfferAll lnc.: Fujitsu signs deal to integrate Box cloud storage into its enterprise software</p><p>Box just inked one of its biggest deals in Asia so far as it focuses on international growth. Fujitsu, one of Japan's largest IT services providers, announced today that it has struck a strategic partnership with the cloud-storage company and will integrate Box into its enterprise software.</p><p>Fujitsu will first start using Box to store and manage files sent on communication tools used by its 160,000 employees around the world. The company says the internal use of Box's services will help it develop new enterprise software, including customer-relationship and enterprise-content management solutions, that it plans to release by March 2017 and market throughout Asia.</p><p>Fujitsu will also integrate Box into MetaArc, its new cloud platform, next year. MetaArc includes third-party services (like Box storage), as well as infrastructure and application hosting services. Customer data uploaded to Box will be stored at Fujitsu data centers in Japan. This will help Box appeal to businesses that don't want to store their data overseas and complements the company's new plan to offer cloud data centers, called Box Zones, in Ireland, Germany, Singapore, and Japan.</p><p>Box founder and CEO Aaron Levie has said that expanding in Europe and Asia is a priority for the company, which went public in January 2015 but has traded below its IPO price since then despite posting solid earnings.</p><p>Other partnerships Box has struck to expand internationally include an agreement with IBM that will let Box store data in IBM's cloud data centers, which are located in 16 countries.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2107201431343789000184767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DB-0JC1-DXKH-N3JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5788\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

In an open letter, Accountable Tech urges the five U.S.-based Facebook Oversight Board members to \"demand the Board be given real authority\" or quit their positions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Each of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\" the letter's authors write. \"Now is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade -- that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the 2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign's response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.</p><p>\"Facebook specializes in window dressing,\" Gill told TechCrunch. \"They have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform's problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\"</p><p>A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club. The letter cites findings from Facebook's recent civil rights audit that cast doubt on the board's real power and also notes the oversight body's delayed timeline. First announced in late 2018, the board won't be up and running in time for the 2020 election.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 OFFERALL LNC.

The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p>SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p>The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>has completed another successful launch, this time on behalf of Lockheed Martin and its client South Korea. The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p>The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: After numerous rejections, Struck's dating app for the Co-Star crowd hits the App Store</p><p>Founded by former Apple engineers, a new app called Struck wants to be the Tinder for the Co-Star crowd. In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p>Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction. It had still called itself a \"beta.\")</p><p>The 4.3 guideline is something Apple wields to keep the App Store free from what it considers to be clutter and spam. In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: Treasure8 adds Chris Cowart to its executive team as it renews pushing its tech to reduce food waste</p><p>Chris Cowart, the longtime IDEO product designer, Singularity University faculty member and consultant to a variety of venture firms and tech projects, is joining the food preservation technology developer Treasure8 as its new chief innovation and strategy officer, according to a post on LinkedIn.</p><p>\"In the last three years food has come to the fore as a theme,\" said Cowart in an interview with TechCrunch. Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p>At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p>After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise. Our goal was both simple and bold: to reinvent the venture capital industry by bringing more transparency to what has become an ever more opaque financial environment for founders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: The VCs who founders love the most</p><p>Over the past month, we have been asking founders to submit recommendations of VCs for The TechCrunch List, our newly-launched curated directory of investors who are ready to write first checks and lead venture rounds into startups. You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations.

While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote, it's today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices.

Founded in 2017 by ex-Googlers, the AI vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega first raised blood pressures - people hated how it referenced and poorly 'disrupted' mom-and-pop shops in one fell swoop - and then raised a lot of money.

The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 3 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular.

This comes just two weeks after the company closed a $3.5 billion equity round from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. If the deal goes through, it would mean the company has added $5.5 Billion to it coffers in the amount of time it takes a typical startup to initiate discussion of a funding round.</p><p>One benefit of Uber raising money as debt rather than equity is that it can avoid additional dilution for its employees. The company has raised $12.51 billion in equity financing since 2009. The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that.

Apple notes that the guidelines themselves haven't changed, they've just been written to be \"more helpful\" and \"provide more context.\" Unfortunately, that additional context isn't yet available for new App Store rules, like the expanded ability to monetize apps via subscriptions.</p><p>Notably, too, Apple has consolidated the iOS and Mac App Store guidelines into a single document.</p><p>This latter change represents an overall strategy of treating Apple's platforms - iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS - as being under the same umbrella, instead of having so many unique peculiarities that they require separate documentation. It also makes sense to combine the previous Mac App Store Guidelines with the App Store Guidelines as there was a lot of overlap among the rules.</p><p>In the updated documentation, Apple has set aside a special section for Mac App Store apps (2.4.5) which addresses how those apps can interoperate with Mac computers, what they're allowed to do, and how they should be updated and maintained.</p><p>Screen Shot 2016-06-14 at 11.22.09 AMOddly, Apple has also released a separate version of its new guidelines as a comic book, which is having mixed reactions.</p><p>Largely, though, Apple is correct in saying that nothing much has changed otherwise between the two documents.

Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products. \"There are byproducts that you can break down and start to use to pull out their nutrients into probiotics and nutraceuticals,\" said Cowart.</p><p>He also thinks that Treasure8 could use its process to become a provider of biochar that can be applied in more sustainable agriculture techniques.</p><p>Treasure8 initially launched with a focus on food preservation, but quickly pivoted into working with hemp companies that wanted to work with the company to use more parts of the hemp plant in products. For now, Treasure8 is operating off of its pilot facility on Treasure Island, the man-made island in the San Francisco Bay which is currently the site of a multi-billion-dollar development project.</p><p>With its new innovation officer in tow, Treasure8 is now heading to market to raise a new round of financing, Cowart said. Targeting less than $50 million, the new round could help the company as Cowart starts to think longer term about ways that Treasure8's treatment process could contribute to the development of more functional foods.</p><p>\"Taking food waste streams to make products and ingredients and letting it be something useful rather than something that harms the environment, that's the interesting part,\" Cowart said of his role at the company. [And] if you're able to go from food security to nutritional security If you can powder vegetables, and make them into bits and food that are stable and affordable All of this nutrition feeds into the food as medicine and functional food. We're going to want to fight immunity and recover from viruses and we're going to have to rebuild our food supply.\"</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 OFFERALL LNC.

In an open letter, Accountable Tech urges the five U.S.-based Facebook Oversight Board members to \"demand the Board be given real authority\" or quit their positions.</p><p>\"Each of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\" the letter's authors write. \"Now is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade -- that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\"</p><p>Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the 2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign's response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.</p><p>\"Facebook specializes in window dressing,\" Gill told TechCrunch. \"They have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform's problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\"</p><p>A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club. The letter cites findings from Facebook's recent civil rights audit that cast doubt on the board's real power and also notes the oversight body's delayed timeline. First announced in late 2018, the board won't be up and running in time for the 2020 election.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>SpaceX has managed a first - catching both halves of the fairing used on one of its Falcon 9 rocket launches, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p>SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p>The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>has completed another successful launch, this time on behalf of Lockheed Martin and its client South Korea. The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p>The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: After numerous rejections, Struck's dating app for the Co-Star crowd hits the App Store</p><p>Founded by former Apple engineers, a new app called Struck wants to be the Tinder for the Co-Star crowd. In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p>Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction. It had still called itself a \"beta.\")</p><p>The 4.3 guideline is something Apple wields to keep the App Store free from what it considers to be clutter and spam. In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise. Our goal was both simple and bold: to reinvent the venture capital industry by bringing more transparency to what has become an ever more opaque financial environment for founders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: The VCs who founders love the most</p><p>Over the past month, we have been asking founders to submit recommendations of VCs for The TechCrunch List, our newly-launched curated directory of investors who are ready to write first checks and lead venture rounds into startups. You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations. They have also been edited for clarity.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: US Commerce Dept. amends Huawei ban to allow for development of 5G standards</p><p>The United States Department of Commerce today issued a change to its sweeping Huawei ban.

While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote, it's today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices. The Apple Developer ecosystem, meanwhile, supports 23 million developers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: Stockwell, the AI-vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega, is shutting down July 1</p><p>Stockwell AI entered the world with a bang but it is leaving with a whimper. Founded in 2017 by ex-Googlers, the AI vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega first raised blood pressures - people hated how it referenced and poorly 'disrupted' mom-and-pop shops in one fell swoop - and then raised a lot of money. But ultimately, it was no match for COVID-19 and the hit it has had on how we live.</p><p>TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Stockwell will be shutting down at the end of this month, after it was unable find a viable business for its in-building app-controlled \"smart\" vending machines stocked with convenience store items.</p><p>\"Regretfully, the current landscape has created a situation in which we can no longer continue our operations and will be winding down the company on July 1st,\" co-founder and CEO Paul McDonald wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \"We are deeply grateful to our talented team, incredible partners and investors, and our amazing shoppers that made this possible.

The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular. But significant competition made it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>\"We are excited to be part of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond family,\" said Dinesh Lathi, Chief Executive Officer of One Kings Lane, in a statement. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for our customers, as well as our employees and business partners, to benefit from additional support and resources and gain exposure to new customers.

This comes just two weeks after the company closed a $3.5 billion equity round from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. If the deal goes through, it would mean the company has added $5.5 Billion to it coffers in the amount of time it takes a typical startup to initiate discussion of a funding round.</p><p>One benefit of Uber raising money as debt rather than equity is that it can avoid additional dilution for its employees. The company has raised $12.51 billion in equity financing since 2009. The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that. The company has a notoriously high burn rate despite reports that company is profitable in the North America.</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Dropbox says it is cash flow positive, in no rush to IPO</p><p>With a $10 billion valuation, cloud storage business Dropbox is larger than many public companies.

Speaking at Bloomberg's Technology Conference in San Francisco, Houston said that Dropbox is \"just enjoying being focused on building and recruiting.\"</p><p>\"We can do that on our own timeline,\" he added, saying that the company is in a position where they are \"not needing to raise money.\"</p><p>It's been two years since Dropbox, which is backed top venture firms including Sequoia and Benchmark, has raised a private fundraising round. But Houston insists that despite negative publicity surrounding the company's finances, they have enough money in the bank to stick around.</p><p>Houston claimed that Dropbox has been cash flow positive, emphasizing that this milestone for a business \"means you control your destiny. Instead of being funded by your investors, you're funded by your customers.\"</p><p>June 14: OfferAll lnc.: Apple releases new App Store Review Guidelines, doest yet clarify rules around subscriptions</p><p>As part of the slew of news released this week as part of Apple's annual developer conference, WWDC, the company has also re-written its App Store Review Guidelines - the documentation that developers use to determine which apps will be accepted or rejected following their submission to the App Store. Apple notes that the guidelines themselves haven't changed, they've just been written to be \"more helpful\" and \"provide more context.\" Unfortunately, that additional context isn't yet available for new App Store rules, like the expanded ability to monetize apps via subscriptions.</p><p>Notably, too, Apple has consolidated the iOS and Mac App Store guidelines into a single document.</p><p>This latter change represents an overall strategy of treating Apple's platforms - iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS - as being under the same umbrella, instead of having so many unique peculiarities that they require separate documentation. It also makes sense to combine the previous Mac App Store Guidelines with the App Store Guidelines as there was a lot of overlap among the rules.</p><p>In the updated documentation, Apple has set aside a special section for Mac App Store apps (2.4.5) which addresses how those apps can interoperate with Mac computers, what they're allowed to do, and how they should be updated and maintained.</p><p>Screen Shot 2016-06-14 at 11.22.09 AMOddly, Apple has also released a separate version of its new guidelines as a comic book, which is having mixed reactions.</p><p>Largely, though, Apple is correct in saying that nothing much has changed otherwise between the two documents. The rules themselves - which focus on topics like privacy, spam, pornography and other objectionable content, violence, kids apps, metadata, payments, and more, are the same.</p><p>June 08: OfferAll lnc.: Ginkgo Bioworks grabs $100 million in financing to buy a whole lot of synthetic DNA</p><p>Ginko Bioworks, the Boston-based biotech startup making all sorts of scents and flavors from microbugs, has pulled in $100 million in Series C funding to obtain 600 million base pairs of manufactured DNA - or what Ginkgo claims is the \"largest amount of synthetic DNA ever purchased.\"</p><p>The startup plans to use the millions of genetic base pairs to test its production metal in new areas such as \"commodity chemicals, industrial enzymes, and human health markets.\"</p><p>The new infusion is all cash and brings the total up to $154 million in funding since Ginkgo launched out of Y Combinator less than two years ago - putting it in the top 10 most significant amounts of financing for any YC startup.</p><p>This new form of biotech (read - not pharmaceutical manufacturing) started heating up in 2014, as production costs dramatically dropped and Ginkgo was one of YC's first biotech startup investments and still faces few competitors, including West Coast counterpart Zymergen, which has raised $45 million to date, to mass produce consumer materials by manipulating microbial DNA.</p><p>The money in this round comes from YC's Continuity Fund, Senator Investment Group, Cascade Investment, Baillie Gifford, Viking Global Investors and Allen &amp; Company LLC. Viking Global also led Ginkgo's Series B round.</p><p>Ginkgo currently makes products for the flavor, fragrance and food industries as well as works with DARPA to produce probiotics that will help U.S. soldiers stave off stomach bugs they might pick up overseas but started looking at expanding to other industries last year.</p><p>The startup announced in the spring of 2015 it would be buying 100 million base pairs of DNA to help it move into new production areas but has since upped that amount to the 600 million base pairs and will be partnering with Twist Bioscience and Gen9 to supply the synthetic DNA.</p><p>June 08: OfferAll lnc.: Accel appoints ex-Facebooker Nir Blumberger as Venture Partner to focus on Israel</p><p>VC firm Accel's London office has appointed a new Venture Partner to focus on Israel. Nir Blumberger has joined from Facebook, where he was a Corporate Development executive, and, we're told, was involved in M&amp;A and strategy in areas such as virtual/augmented reality, messaging and video. He'll be based in Tel Aviv, giving Accel a much more formal presence in Israel, the country where Blumberger was born and raised.</p><p>Prior to his time at the social networking behemoth, he worked for McKinsey &amp; Company in Europe and Israel. Blumberger has an MBA from Stanford University and previously studied computer science at The Interdisciplinary Center in Israel, where he participated in the Zell Entrepreneurship Program. He has also co-founded two technology startups and was a participant at Singularity University's Graduate Studies Program.</p><p>Meanwhile, although Blumberger's appoint signals a doubling down by Accel in Israel - I'm told it's the first time in the VC firm's 30 plus year history that it has had someone based in Israel who is solely focused on Israeli investments - it's not new to investment activity in the country.</p><p>Current and past investments include enterprise security companies Aorato (acquired by Microsoft) and publicly-listed Imperva, global services marketplace Fiverr and data governance solutions provider Varonis Systems. Most recently, Accel led a $12 million Series B in E8 Storage, an early-stage enterprise storage company founded in Tel Aviv.</p><p>Philippe Botteri, Partner at Accel, said in a statement: \"Israel is a vibrant hub for innovation, and Accel has long-held conviction in the great ideas and entrepreneurs that have emerged from the region.

Fujitsu, one of Japan's largest IT services providers, announced today that it has struck a strategic partnership with the cloud-storage company and will integrate Box into its enterprise software.</p><p>Fujitsu will first start using Box to store and manage files sent on communication tools used by its 160,000 employees around the world. The company says the internal use of Box's services will help it develop new enterprise software, including customer-relationship and enterprise-content management solutions, that it plans to release by March 2017 and market throughout Asia.</p><p>Fujitsu will also integrate Box into MetaArc, its new cloud platform, next year. MetaArc includes third-party services (like Box storage), as well as infrastructure and application hosting services. Customer data uploaded to Box will be stored at Fujitsu data centers in Japan. This will help Box appeal to businesses that don't want to store their data overseas and complements the company's new plan to offer cloud data centers, called Box Zones, in Ireland, Germany, Singapore, and Japan.</p><p>Box founder and CEO Aaron Levie has said that expanding in Europe and Asia is a priority for the company, which went public in January 2015 but has traded below its IPO price since then despite posting solid earnings.</p><p>Other partnerships Box has struck to expand internationally include an agreement with IBM that will let Box store data in IBM's cloud data centers, which are located in 16 countries.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2107201430393789000184767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DB-0JC1-DXKH-N3JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5961\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

Always talking about his stupid family and money. You'd think with all this money and that long name he would be more confident. But he's not: he's an insecure little dick loser. And he's really starting to piss me off.</p><p>There are some perks to dating lil Garrison, though. Tonight, I told him that me and the girls were hanging out. But actuallyI'm hanging out with my friend Branden. If lil Garrison wants to be jealous so bad, I'll give him something to be jealous about!</p><p>\"This shoot with Paige is one of my favorites for many reasons,\" said Owens' co-star, DD's Branden Richards. \"Aside from the fact that Paige is an awesome person in front of and behind the camera, this is the longest release on the site at a whopping one hour and 11 minutes of filthy, dirty, hardcore sex!\"</p><p>\"Paige was also the very first Spiegler Girl I worked with, and working with 'The Patron of the Tarts' was something I had made a personal goal of when I started shooting.</p><p>June 30: YNOT Network, LP : Mainstream Social Media Discriminates, So Collect Email Addresses</p><p>There was a time when the online adult industry was littered with \"small\" but financially successful businesses. Most of these businesses consisted of single individuals or partnerships, but they made enough money to live attractive lifestyles.</p><p>Individual freedom has always been one of the biggest allures of working in the adult entertainment industry. Few people are lucky enough to live their lives as they see fit. For those who value independence, email marketing is an important tool as I'll soon explain. Modern Adult is a Challenging Business Environment</p><p>In recent years a majority of porn fans have gravitated towards a few giant destination sites. That mass migration of eyeballs has made it harder for smaller adult businesses to make money. When sites like Pornhub (and even Twitter) keep most of the potential customers occupied, it can prove challenging for small businesses to find economic oxygen.</p><p>Even worse, mainstream companies don't want your business or your participation. When you use mainstream tools and platforms to market your business, you're introducing risk into your revenue stream. As your success with mainstream platforms goes up, so too does your risk because you have more to lose.</p><p>June 29: YNOT Network, LP : JustFor.fans' Alice Skary Offering Seminars for Aspiring Cam Stars</p><p>Alice Skary, the official model liaison to top adult social platform JustFor.fans, has announced the launch of JFF Tutorials, billed as \"a new educational service dedicated to helping aspiring webcam models generate more traffic and make more money.\"</p><p>In its announcement, JFF said the new service, which includes a series of informative, publicly available videos that \"focus on the best daily online practices to engage fans, will be available to any and all aspiring performers who want to take advantage of Skary's knowledge and expertise.</p><p>\"I am massively excited about doing some online educational seminars and panels for the benefit of verified JFF models, and I am hoping to do our first of many free seminars very shortly,\" Skary said of the new endeavor. \"I think our first topic will be using mass messages/PTV messages to maximize income.\"</p><p>\"Before I started with JustFor.fans, I had been already doing seminars for my own group of friends on how to use adult social sites to their best advantage,\" Skary added. \"Now anyone can learn some essential tips and tricks from these simple tutorials.\"</p><p>Skary is currently in charge of 'strategic guidance' in assisting the adult social platform's straight, gay, trans and non-binary models, entertainers and influencers in applying JFF's online tools more efficiently while increasing their audience and customer base.</p><p>To find out more about JustFor.fans tutorials visit justfor.fans/alice_jfftutorials.</p><p>June 29: YNOT Network, LP : XR Brands Introduces Bendable, Posable Wonder Vibes Made of Liquid Silicone</p><p>XR Brands is proud to present the new gold standard of pleasure, Wonder Vibes bendable vibrators.

As it turns out, we may be getting our first hints of the answer to that question while the dust from the pandemic is still clouding the air.</p><p>On May 28, President Donald Trump signed the \"Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship,\" days after having one of his tweets flagged as \"potentially misleading\" by Twitter.</p><p>More recently, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the \"Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act,\" a bill intended to \"empower Americans to sue Big Tech companies who act in bad faith by selectively censoring political speech and hiding content created by their competitors,\" according to its sponsors.</p><p>In seeking to curb the immunity afforded to operators of interactive web services with respect to expression published by third-party users of their platforms, both Trump and Hawley want to tie the grant of immunity to a promise of political neutrality.</p><p>In remarks he made upon signing the executive order, Trump asserted that a \"small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States\" and that to this point, thanks to Section 230, those monopolies have \"had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens and large public audiences.\"</p><p>\"There's no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction,\" Trump continued.</p><p>June 18: YNOT Network, LP : FSC Issues Statement on Labor Commissioners Ruling on LA Direct, Derek Hay</p><p>Free Speech CoalitionThe Free Speech Coalition released a statement Thursday applauding the decision of the California Labor Commissioner's finding for five adult performers in their complaint against LA Direct owner Derek Hay.

Hay was not a member of Free Speech Coalition, and for years has refused to abide by the industry's testing protocols.</p><p>The Commission ruled that Hay had illegally taken fees from those he represented, that he ignored their no lists, put them in unsafe working environments, misrepresented the legality of his contract, engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with his performers, and failed to work in the best interest of those he represented. None of this is acceptable, under either California law or ethical production in the adult industry.</p><p>Unethical representation thrives when there is little to educate performers about what is right, standard, and acceptable in a contract, or within the adult industry.</p><p>June 18: YNOT Network, LP : Sportsheets Reseller Support Now Live at SportsheetsB2B.com</p><p>The Sportsheets Reseller Support website, featuring over 40 gigabytes of promotional and marketing materials, is now live at SportsheetsB2B.</p><p>As part of the company's Back 2 Business outreach for the remainder of 2020, Sportsheets will be laser-focused on supporting its reseller partners as stores begin to reopen in different parts of the country.

People attending this workshop will learn how to find, interview, and choose a clinician that fits with their personal needs,\" Penn added.</p><p>\"Model Wellness: How to Get Help When You Need It\" is presented by Grooby's Marketing and Editorial Director, Kristel Penn, and is scheduled for July 21, 2020, from 12-1250 pm PST. The workshop description is as follows:</p><p>Navigating the mental health system can be a labyrinth filled with confusing technical jargon, safety and privacy concerns, plus the fear of being judged and discriminated against because of your profession. Not to mention the extra task of trying to find a competent and affirming therapist who understands the unique concerns of being a sex worker. In this 50-minute workshop, adult industry advocate and MA in Psychology student, Kristel Penn, shares the 411 of different mental health services and its pros/cons (e.g.</p><p>July 21: YNOT Summit: HarperTheFox &amp; Max on Creating Live Hentai Cam Models</p><p>HarperTheFox and Max MoosemanIn a detailed primer on creating live animated characters the couple presented at the all-virtual YNOT Summit on Monday, HarperTheFox and Max Mooseman talked about the process of creating Abby Oddly, the world's first live hentai character - and how that process is changing as the technology used to do it is refined and enhanced.</p><p>From the outset, Harper and Max were clear that while the session would be filled with information, viewers who want to follow in their footsteps are facing a steep learning curve.</p><p>\"I wouldn't say you'll be able to walk away from this today and just go make one (a character like Abby) for yourself and just go do it,\" Max said at the start of the session. \"There are a lot of applications to learn, there's a lot of hardware to acquire, it's a pretty technical process and it's changing all the time - it's a really fast-moving technology.\"</p><p>At the same time, Harper and Max explained, \"you shouldn't be discouraged.\"</p><p>\"Stick around and listen to all the pieces, because we're going to give you the roadmap we took, as well as some of the changes that we know are happening,\" Max said, adding that when he and Harper first got started on creating Abby, \"we had no animation background, we had no programming, no networking background, basically other than camming we had none of the skill set needed to build something like this - and we learned it from scratch.\" In terms of time frame, Max said from when they first started learning how to use all the necessary hardware and software to when they went live with Abby was a \"part-time, six or seven-month process.\"</p><p>Harper and Max began the heart of the session by briefly addressing the backstory and inspiration for Abby, then turning to real nuts and bolts of the process, listing the necessary software and hardware components for creating a live cartoon cam performer of your own.</p><p>Among the core equipment and software needed are Adobe Creative Cloud, Newtek NDI, an RTMP broadcaster, a MIDI controller, two computers, a router, two microphones and a webcam.</p><p>June 30: YNOT Network, LP : Paige Owens Debuts at DickDrainers.com</p><p>Multi-nominated adult star Paige Owens headlines DickDrainers's twisted new boy/girl release, portraying a girl with a wandering eye - and a hungry asshole - who cucks her well-to-do boyfriend.</p><p>My boyfriend, Garrison Miles Phillips III, is so clingy. Always talking about his stupid family and money. You'd think with all this money and that long name he would be more confident. But he's not: he's an insecure little dick loser. And he's really starting to piss me off.</p><p>There are some perks to dating lil Garrison, though. Tonight, I told him that me and the girls were hanging out. But actuallyI'm hanging out with my friend Branden. If lil Garrison wants to be jealous so bad, I'll give him something to be jealous about!</p><p>\"This shoot with Paige is one of my favorites for many reasons,\" said Owens' co-star, DD's Branden Richards. \"Aside from the fact that Paige is an awesome person in front of and behind the camera, this is the longest release on the site at a whopping one hour and 11 minutes of filthy, dirty, hardcore sex!\"</p><p>\"Paige was also the very first Spiegler Girl I worked with, and working with 'The Patron of the Tarts' was something I had made a personal goal of when I started shooting.</p><p>June 30: YNOT Network, LP : Mainstream Social Media Discriminates, So Collect Email Addresses</p><p>There was a time when the online adult industry was littered with \"small\" but financially successful businesses. Most of these businesses consisted of single individuals or partnerships, but they made enough money to live attractive lifestyles.</p><p>Individual freedom has always been one of the biggest allures of working in the adult entertainment industry. Few people are lucky enough to live their lives as they see fit. For those who value independence, email marketing is an important tool as I'll soon explain. Modern Adult is a Challenging Business Environment</p><p>In recent years a majority of porn fans have gravitated towards a few giant destination sites. That mass migration of eyeballs has made it harder for smaller adult businesses to make money. When sites like Pornhub (and even Twitter) keep most of the potential customers occupied, it can prove challenging for small businesses to find economic oxygen.</p><p>Even worse, mainstream companies don't want your business or your participation. When you use mainstream tools and platforms to market your business, you're introducing risk into your revenue stream. As your success with mainstream platforms goes up, so too does your risk because you have more to lose.</p><p>June 29: YNOT Network, LP : JustFor.fans' Alice Skary Offering Seminars for Aspiring Cam Stars</p><p>Alice Skary, the official model liaison to top adult social platform JustFor.fans, has announced the launch of JFF Tutorials, billed as \"a new educational service dedicated to helping aspiring webcam models generate more traffic and make more money.\"</p><p>In its announcement, JFF said the new service, which includes a series of informative, publicly available videos that \"focus on the best daily online practices to engage fans, will be available to any and all aspiring performers who want to take advantage of Skary's knowledge and expertise.</p><p>\"I am massively excited about doing some online educational seminars and panels for the benefit of verified JFF models, and I am hoping to do our first of many free seminars very shortly,\" Skary said of the new endeavor. \"I think our first topic will be using mass messages/PTV messages to maximize income.\"</p><p>\"Before I started with JustFor.fans, I had been already doing seminars for my own group of friends on how to use adult social sites to their best advantage,\" Skary added. \"Now anyone can learn some essential tips and tricks from these simple tutorials.\"</p><p>Skary is currently in charge of 'strategic guidance' in assisting the adult social platform's straight, gay, trans and non-binary models, entertainers and influencers in applying JFF's online tools more efficiently while increasing their audience and customer base.</p><p>To find out more about JustFor.fans tutorials visit justfor.fans/alice_jfftutorials.</p><p>June 29: YNOT Network, LP : XR Brands Introduces Bendable, Posable Wonder Vibes Made of Liquid Silicone</p><p>XR Brands is proud to present the new gold standard of pleasure, Wonder Vibes bendable vibrators.

As it turns out, we may be getting our first hints of the answer to that question while the dust from the pandemic is still clouding the air.</p><p>On May 28, President Donald Trump signed the \"Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship,\" days after having one of his tweets flagged as \"potentially misleading\" by Twitter.</p><p>More recently, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the \"Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act,\" a bill intended to \"empower Americans to sue Big Tech companies who act in bad faith by selectively censoring political speech and hiding content created by their competitors,\" according to its sponsors.</p><p>In seeking to curb the immunity afforded to operators of interactive web services with respect to expression published by third-party users of their platforms, both Trump and Hawley want to tie the grant of immunity to a promise of political neutrality.</p><p>In remarks he made upon signing the executive order, Trump asserted that a \"small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States\" and that to this point, thanks to Section 230, those monopolies have \"had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens and large public audiences.\"</p><p>\"There's no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction,\" Trump continued.</p><p>June 18: YNOT Network, LP : FSC Issues Statement on Labor Commissioners Ruling on LA Direct, Derek Hay</p><p>Free Speech CoalitionThe Free Speech Coalition released a statement Thursday applauding the decision of the California Labor Commissioner's finding for five adult performers in their complaint against LA Direct owner Derek Hay. The full text of FSC's statement is below and available on the FSC website, as well.</p><p>FSC applauds the decision of the Labor Commission in the case finding for five adult performers in their complaint against Derek Hay. Hay has long operated outside the bounds of the industry, and FSC has spoken out about the violations repeatedly. The behavior detailed is immoral, illegal, and unacceptable. Hay was not a member of Free Speech Coalition, and for years has refused to abide by the industry's testing protocols.</p><p>The Commission ruled that Hay had illegally taken fees from those he represented, that he ignored their no lists, put them in unsafe working environments, misrepresented the legality of his contract, engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with his performers, and failed to work in the best interest of those he represented. None of this is acceptable, under either California law or ethical production in the adult industry.</p><p>Unethical representation thrives when there is little to educate performers about what is right, standard, and acceptable in a contract, or within the adult industry.</p><p>June 18: YNOT Network, LP : Sportsheets Reseller Support Now Live at SportsheetsB2B.com</p><p>The Sportsheets Reseller Support website, featuring over 40 gigabytes of promotional and marketing materials, is now live at SportsheetsB2B.</p><p>As part of the company's Back 2 Business outreach for the remainder of 2020, Sportsheets will be laser-focused on supporting its reseller partners as stores begin to reopen in different parts of the country.

Money Network has gained popularity in the gig economy in recent years for their easy-to-use pre-paid cards and intuitive money management app.</p><p>For Flirt models, one of the biggest benefits of this new payout type will be the instant payment feature. Through a simple request placed through Flirt4Free's internal account administration interface, performers can access up to 50 percent of their weekly commission simply by visiting an ATM. With their Money Network card, they'll also have immediate access to their funds for online and in-store purchases wherever debit and credit cards are accepted.</p><p>\"With a lot of uncertainty in the world, we wanted to ensure our performers could access their hard-earned money at a moment's notice,\" said Miguel Arriaga, F4F's Broadcasting Manager. \"We feel adding Money Network to our list of payment options adds a new level of convenience and security for those who cam with us.\"</p><p>US Flirts who intend to use Money Network will gain more than an instant-pay option.

Always talking about his stupid family and money. You'd think with all this money and that long name he would be more confident. But he's not: he's an insecure little dick loser. And he's really starting to piss me off.</p><p>There are some perks to dating lil Garrison, though. Tonight, I told him that me and the girls were hanging out. But actuallyI'm hanging out with my friend Branden. If lil Garrison wants to be jealous so bad, I'll give him something to be jealous about!</p><p>\"This shoot with Paige is one of my favorites for many reasons,\" said Owens' co-star, DD's Branden Richards. \"Aside from the fact that Paige is an awesome person in front of and behind the camera, this is the longest release on the site at a whopping one hour and 11 minutes of filthy, dirty, hardcore sex!\"</p><p>\"Paige was also the very first Spiegler Girl I worked with, and working with 'The Patron of the Tarts' was something I had made a personal goal of when I started shooting.</p><p>June 30: YNOT Network, LP : Mainstream Social Media Discriminates, So Collect Email Addresses</p><p>There was a time when the online adult industry was littered with \"small\" but financially successful businesses. Most of these businesses consisted of single individuals or partnerships, but they made enough money to live attractive lifestyles.</p><p>Individual freedom has always been one of the biggest allures of working in the adult entertainment industry. Few people are lucky enough to live their lives as they see fit. For those who value independence, email marketing is an important tool as I'll soon explain. Modern Adult is a Challenging Business Environment</p><p>In recent years a majority of porn fans have gravitated towards a few giant destination sites. That mass migration of eyeballs has made it harder for smaller adult businesses to make money. When sites like Pornhub (and even Twitter) keep most of the potential customers occupied, it can prove challenging for small businesses to find economic oxygen.</p><p>Even worse, mainstream companies don't want your business or your participation. When you use mainstream tools and platforms to market your business, you're introducing risk into your revenue stream. As your success with mainstream platforms goes up, so too does your risk because you have more to lose.</p><p>June 29: YNOT Network, LP : JustFor.fans' Alice Skary Offering Seminars for Aspiring Cam Stars</p><p>Alice Skary, the official model liaison to top adult social platform JustFor.fans, has announced the launch of JFF Tutorials, billed as \"a new educational service dedicated to helping aspiring webcam models generate more traffic and make more money.\"</p><p>In its announcement, JFF said the new service, which includes a series of informative, publicly available videos that \"focus on the best daily online practices to engage fans, will be available to any and all aspiring performers who want to take advantage of Skary's knowledge and expertise.</p><p>\"I am massively excited about doing some online educational seminars and panels for the benefit of verified JFF models, and I am hoping to do our first of many free seminars very shortly,\" Skary said of the new endeavor. \"I think our first topic will be using mass messages/PTV messages to maximize income.\"</p><p>\"Before I started with JustFor.fans, I had been already doing seminars for my own group of friends on how to use adult social sites to their best advantage,\" Skary added. \"Now anyone can learn some essential tips and tricks from these simple tutorials.\"</p><p>Skary is currently in charge of 'strategic guidance' in assisting the adult social platform's straight, gay, trans and non-binary models, entertainers and influencers in applying JFF's online tools more efficiently while increasing their audience and customer base.</p><p>To find out more about JustFor.fans tutorials visit justfor.fans/alice_jfftutorials.</p><p>June 29: YNOT Network, LP : XR Brands Introduces Bendable, Posable Wonder Vibes Made of Liquid Silicone</p><p>XR Brands is proud to present the new gold standard of pleasure, Wonder Vibes bendable vibrators.

As it turns out, we may be getting our first hints of the answer to that question while the dust from the pandemic is still clouding the air.</p><p>On May 28, President Donald Trump signed the \"Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship,\" days after having one of his tweets flagged as \"potentially misleading\" by Twitter.</p><p>More recently, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the \"Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act,\" a bill intended to \"empower Americans to sue Big Tech companies who act in bad faith by selectively censoring political speech and hiding content created by their competitors,\" according to its sponsors.</p><p>In seeking to curb the immunity afforded to operators of interactive web services with respect to expression published by third-party users of their platforms, both Trump and Hawley want to tie the grant of immunity to a promise of political neutrality.</p><p>In remarks he made upon signing the executive order, Trump asserted that a \"small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States\" and that to this point, thanks to Section 230, those monopolies have \"had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens and large public audiences.\"</p><p>\"There's no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction,\" Trump continued.</p><p>June 18: YNOT Network, LP : FSC Issues Statement on Labor Commissioners Ruling on LA Direct, Derek Hay</p><p>Free Speech CoalitionThe Free Speech Coalition released a statement Thursday applauding the decision of the California Labor Commissioner's finding for five adult performers in their complaint against LA Direct owner Derek Hay. The full text of FSC's statement is below and available on the FSC website, as well.</p><p>FSC applauds the decision of the Labor Commission in the case finding for five adult performers in their complaint against Derek Hay. Hay has long operated outside the bounds of the industry, and FSC has spoken out about the violations repeatedly. The behavior detailed is immoral, illegal, and unacceptable. Hay was not a member of Free Speech Coalition, and for years has refused to abide by the industry's testing protocols.</p><p>The Commission ruled that Hay had illegally taken fees from those he represented, that he ignored their no lists, put them in unsafe working environments, misrepresented the legality of his contract, engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with his performers, and failed to work in the best interest of those he represented.

In this 50-minute workshop, adult industry advocate and MA in Psychology student, Kristel Penn, shares the 411 of different mental health services and its pros/cons (e.g.</p><p>July 21: YNOT Summit: HarperTheFox &amp; Max on Creating Live Hentai Cam Models</p><p>HarperTheFox and Max MoosemanIn a detailed primer on creating live animated characters the couple presented at the all-virtual YNOT Summit on Monday, HarperTheFox and Max Mooseman talked about the process of creating Abby Oddly, the world's first live hentai character - and how that process is changing as the technology used to do it is refined and enhanced.</p><p>From the outset, Harper and Max were clear that while the session would be filled with information, viewers who want to follow in their footsteps are facing a steep learning curve.</p><p>\"I wouldn't say you'll be able to walk away from this today and just go make one (a character like Abby) for yourself and just go do it,\" Max said at the start of the session. \"There are a lot of applications to learn, there's a lot of hardware to acquire, it's a pretty technical process and it's changing all the time - it's a really fast-moving technology.\"</p><p>At the same time, Harper and Max explained, \"you shouldn't be discouraged.\"</p><p>\"Stick around and listen to all the pieces, because we're going to give you the roadmap we took, as well as some of the changes that we know are happening,\" Max said, adding that when he and Harper first got started on creating Abby, \"we had no animation background, we had no programming, no networking background, basically other than camming we had none of the skill set needed to build something like this - and we learned it from scratch.\" In terms of time frame, Max said from when they first started learning how to use all the necessary hardware and software to when they went live with Abby was a \"part-time, six or seven-month process.\"</p><p>Harper and Max began the heart of the session by briefly addressing the backstory and inspiration for Abby, then turning to real nuts and bolts of the process, listing the necessary software and hardware components for creating a live cartoon cam performer of your own.</p><p>Among the core equipment and software needed are Adobe Creative Cloud, Newtek NDI, an RTMP broadcaster, a MIDI controller, two computers, a router, two microphones and a webcam.</p><p>June 30: YNOT Network, LP : Paige Owens Debuts at DickDrainers.com</p><p>Multi-nominated adult star Paige Owens headlines DickDrainers's twisted new boy/girl release, portraying a girl with a wandering eye - and a hungry asshole - who cucks her well-to-do boyfriend.</p><p>My boyfriend, Garrison Miles Phillips III, is so clingy. Always talking about his stupid family and money. You'd think with all this money and that long name he would be more confident. But he's not: he's an insecure little dick loser. And he's really starting to piss me off.</p><p>There are some perks to dating lil Garrison, though. Tonight, I told him that me and the girls were hanging out. But actuallyI'm hanging out with my friend Branden. If lil Garrison wants to be jealous so bad, I'll give him something to be jealous about!</p><p>\"This shoot with Paige is one of my favorites for many reasons,\" said Owens' co-star, DD's Branden Richards. \"Aside from the fact that Paige is an awesome person in front of and behind the camera, this is the longest release on the site at a whopping one hour and 11 minutes of filthy, dirty, hardcore sex!\"</p><p>\"Paige was also the very first Spiegler Girl I worked with, and working with 'The Patron of the Tarts' was something I had made a personal goal of when I started shooting.</p><p>June 30: YNOT Network, LP : Mainstream Social Media Discriminates, So Collect Email Addresses</p><p>There was a time when the online adult industry was littered with \"small\" but financially successful businesses. Most of these businesses consisted of single individuals or partnerships, but they made enough money to live attractive lifestyles.</p><p>Individual freedom has always been one of the biggest allures of working in the adult entertainment industry. Few people are lucky enough to live their lives as they see fit. For those who value independence, email marketing is an important tool as I'll soon explain. Modern Adult is a Challenging Business Environment</p><p>In recent years a majority of porn fans have gravitated towards a few giant destination sites. That mass migration of eyeballs has made it harder for smaller adult businesses to make money. When sites like Pornhub (and even Twitter) keep most of the potential customers occupied, it can prove challenging for small businesses to find economic oxygen.</p><p>Even worse, mainstream companies don't want your business or your participation. When you use mainstream tools and platforms to market your business, you're introducing risk into your revenue stream. As your success with mainstream platforms goes up, so too does your risk because you have more to lose.</p><p>June 29: YNOT Network, LP : JustFor.fans' Alice Skary Offering Seminars for Aspiring Cam Stars</p><p>Alice Skary, the official model liaison to top adult social platform JustFor.fans, has announced the launch of JFF Tutorials, billed as \"a new educational service dedicated to helping aspiring webcam models generate more traffic and make more money.\"</p><p>In its announcement, JFF said the new service, which includes a series of informative, publicly available videos that \"focus on the best daily online practices to engage fans, will be available to any and all aspiring performers who want to take advantage of Skary's knowledge and expertise.</p><p>\"I am massively excited about doing some online educational seminars and panels for the benefit of verified JFF models, and I am hoping to do our first of many free seminars very shortly,\" Skary said of the new endeavor. \"I think our first topic will be using mass messages/PTV messages to maximize income.\"</p><p>\"Before I started with JustFor.fans, I had been already doing seminars for my own group of friends on how to use adult social sites to their best advantage,\" Skary added. \"Now anyone can learn some essential tips and tricks from these simple tutorials.\"</p><p>Skary is currently in charge of 'strategic guidance' in assisting the adult social platform's straight, gay, trans and non-binary models, entertainers and influencers in applying JFF's online tools more efficiently while increasing their audience and customer base.</p><p>To find out more about JustFor.fans tutorials visit justfor.fans/alice_jfftutorials.</p><p>June 29: YNOT Network, LP : XR Brands Introduces Bendable, Posable Wonder Vibes Made of Liquid Silicone</p><p>XR Brands is proud to present the new gold standard of pleasure, Wonder Vibes bendable vibrators.

Your incoming funding and outgoing payments will continue arriving as usual and without any interruptions.\"</p><p>In its statement, Paxum added that the company has \"always had strong risk mitigation policies in place, along with safeguards that ensure our clients' funds are secure.\"</p><p>\"This is why we are not dependent on our banking partners' financial viability, and why Paxum has always weathered similar situations and continued to conduct business without interruption,\" the statement continued.</p><p>June 22: YNOT Network, LP : Bucharest Summit 2020 Announces New Dates</p><p>Bucharest Summit organizers are pleased to announce that the event will be taking place in 2020 - from the 27th to the 29th of October at the Sheraton Hotel in Bucharest, Romania.</p><p>A representative stated, \"Yes, many countries are still in lockdown, and some travel bans are still active in Europe, but we believe humanity will prevail, vaccines and cures will become available and we will be able to fly, meet, do business and party together with no restrictions in just four months from now!\"</p><p>\"We will, of course, take all the precautionary measures to ensure your safety and all registrations and sponsorships are fully refundable in case health regulations will force us to delay or cancel the event,\" they continued. \"But we are very confident this will not be necessary and we will all have a chance to meet again.\"</p><p>Bucharest is known as the commercial center of Eastern Europe, and Bucharest Summit is the place to be for online, digital and entertainment companies to meet and do business.

As it turns out, we may be getting our first hints of the answer to that question while the dust from the pandemic is still clouding the air.</p><p>On May 28, President Donald Trump signed the \"Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship,\" days after having one of his tweets flagged as \"potentially misleading\" by Twitter.</p><p>More recently, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the \"Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act,\" a bill intended to \"empower Americans to sue Big Tech companies who act in bad faith by selectively censoring political speech and hiding content created by their competitors,\" according to its sponsors.</p><p>In seeking to curb the immunity afforded to operators of interactive web services with respect to expression published by third-party users of their platforms, both Trump and Hawley want to tie the grant of immunity to a promise of political neutrality.</p><p>In remarks he made upon signing the executive order, Trump asserted that a \"small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States\" and that to this point, thanks to Section 230, those monopolies have \"had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens and large public audiences.\"</p><p>\"There's no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction,\" Trump continued.</p><p>June 18: YNOT Network, LP : FSC Issues Statement on Labor Commissioners Ruling on LA Direct, Derek Hay</p><p>Free Speech CoalitionThe Free Speech Coalition released a statement Thursday applauding the decision of the California Labor Commissioner's finding for five adult performers in their complaint against LA Direct owner Derek Hay. The full text of FSC's statement is below and available on the FSC website, as well.</p><p>FSC applauds the decision of the Labor Commission in the case finding for five adult performers in their complaint against Derek Hay. Hay has long operated outside the bounds of the industry, and FSC has spoken out about the violations repeatedly. The behavior detailed is immoral, illegal, and unacceptable. Hay was not a member of Free Speech Coalition, and for years has refused to abide by the industry's testing protocols.</p><p>The Commission ruled that Hay had illegally taken fees from those he represented, that he ignored their no lists, put them in unsafe working environments, misrepresented the legality of his contract, engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with his performers, and failed to work in the best interest of those he represented. None of this is acceptable, under either California law or ethical production in the adult industry.</p><p>Unethical representation thrives when there is little to educate performers about what is right, standard, and acceptable in a contract, or within the adult industry.</p><p>June 18: YNOT Network, LP : Sportsheets Reseller Support Now Live at SportsheetsB2B.com</p><p>The Sportsheets Reseller Support website, featuring over 40 gigabytes of promotional and marketing materials, is now live at SportsheetsB2B.</p><p>As part of the company's Back 2 Business outreach for the remainder of 2020, Sportsheets will be laser-focused on supporting its reseller partners as stores begin to reopen in different parts of the country. The Sportsheets Reseller Support site, or SRS, is phase one with more B2B initiatives set to debut in Q3 and Q4.</p><p>\"It's always important for those on the front lines to have the tools they need to be successful - and now more than ever,\" says Brian Sofer, the company's freshly minted Director of eCommerce and digital marketing.\" \"The best way for Sportsheets to succeed is to ensure our partners succeed - and the first step is providing our partners the ammunition they need to effortlessly promote and sell the product.\"</p><p>The new user-friendly archive of branded resources, signature Sportsheets lifestyle photography, company logos, style guides, videos and product imagery is everything an ecommerce and/or marketing team needs to create effective Sportsheets promotions for their stores, websites, e-blasts, videos and social media channels.</p><p>\"Sportsheets is committed to supporting our B2B partners,\" said Sportsheets CEO Julie Stewart.</p><p>June 18: YNOT Network, LP : Reality Lovers Makes Virtual Reality Porn Even More Real For Families</p><p>What happens when you're at home with a VR headset on, watching VR porn when your stepmother walks in and catches you in the act? It's a fear many porn fans have because VR porn can become so immersive that you completely forget about the rest of the world happening around you.</p><p>If your stepmother is Isabella Lui, things may get even more real, as the redheaded MILF takes a turn adding a whole new dimension to your virtual sex experience! Stepmom's VR Surprise is a groundbreaking new video from Reality Lovers that proves the production team is continuing to exceed expectations by pushing the envelope in terms of new technology and story driven erotica beyond what anyone else is creating in the current corona climate.</p><p>\"When creating VR content for our audience, we understand the responsibility to produce new imaginative content goes far beyond churning out just another ordinary porn video,\" explained Berenika of RealityLovers.com. \"VR is very different from traditional porn because it has a truly immersive quality that is best when it is backed by the context of the content's backstory and this new scene does that in an amazing way.\"</p><p>To view the content and see why Reality Lovers continues to earn major awards from industry experts, review sites and fans alike, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.RealityLovers.com\">www.RealityLovers.com</url> right now!</p><p>June 17: YNOT Network, LP : Flirt4Free Adds Instant Payout Option For US Models</p><p>Flirt4Free recently announced the addition of Money Network to their catalog of payout options for models based in the United States. Money Network has gained popularity in the gig economy in recent years for their easy-to-use pre-paid cards and intuitive money management app.</p><p>For Flirt models, one of the biggest benefits of this new payout type will be the instant payment feature. Through a simple request placed through Flirt4Free's internal account administration interface, performers can access up to 50 percent of their weekly commission simply by visiting an ATM. With their Money Network card, they'll also have immediate access to their funds for online and in-store purchases wherever debit and credit cards are accepted.</p><p>\"With a lot of uncertainty in the world, we wanted to ensure our performers could access their hard-earned money at a moment's notice,\" said Miguel Arriaga, F4F's Broadcasting Manager. \"We feel adding Money Network to our list of payment options adds a new level of convenience and security for those who cam with us.\"</p><p>US Flirts who intend to use Money Network will gain more than an instant-pay option. The pre-paid card company also offers a full suite of banking options to help gig workers stay on top of their finances.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2207201157353789000188624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DH-MN91-JB4F-Y2JR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5867\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

As it turns out, we may be getting our first hints of the answer to that question while the dust from the pandemic is still clouding the air.</p><p>On May 28, President Donald Trump signed the \"Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship,\" days after having one of his tweets flagged as \"potentially misleading\" by Twitter.</p><p>More recently, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the \"Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act,\" a bill intended to \"empower Americans to sue Big Tech companies who act in bad faith by selectively censoring political speech and hiding content created by their competitors,\" according to its sponsors.</p><p>In seeking to curb the immunity afforded to operators of interactive web services with respect to expression published by third-party users of their platforms, both Trump and Hawley want to tie the grant of immunity to a promise of political neutrality.</p><p>In remarks he made upon signing the executive order, Trump asserted that a \"small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States\" and that to this point, thanks to Section 230, those monopolies have \"had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens and large public audiences.\"</p><p>\"There's no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction,\" Trump continued.</p><p>June 18: YNOT Network, LP : FSC Issues Statement on Labor Commissioners Ruling on LA Direct, Derek Hay</p><p>Free Speech CoalitionThe Free Speech Coalition released a statement Thursday applauding the decision of the California Labor Commissioner's finding for five adult performers in their complaint against LA Direct owner Derek Hay. The full text of FSC's statement is below and available on the FSC website, as well.</p><p>FSC applauds the decision of the Labor Commission in the case finding for five adult performers in their complaint against Derek Hay. Hay has long operated outside the bounds of the industry, and FSC has spoken out about the violations repeatedly. The behavior detailed is immoral, illegal, and unacceptable. Hay was not a member of Free Speech Coalition, and for years has refused to abide by the industry's testing protocols.</p><p>The Commission ruled that Hay had illegally taken fees from those he represented, that he ignored their no lists, put them in unsafe working environments, misrepresented the legality of his contract, engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with his performers, and failed to work in the best interest of those he represented.

The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19.

In addition, the publications ranked the Firm as the second largest firm in the East Bay.</p><p>Over the past year, BPM grew organically and strategically and added 73 professionals in just the Bay Area along the way. The Firm also introduced new specialty services, including Managed IT Services and IT Security Advisory, and offices in Fairfield, Calif.</p><p>February 05: Burr Pilger Mayer: OMB Releases Proposed Uniform Guidance Changes</p><p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has released their proposed changes to the Uniform Guidance requirements. Nonfederal entities can comment on the proposed changes through March 23, 2020 at regulations.gov.</p><p>Among the proposed changes are -</p><p>Procurement Revisions</p><p>The proposed guidance removes specific threshold dollar amounts from the Uniform Guidance and aligns it with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the 2017 and 2018 National Defense Acquisition Authorization Acts (NDAA), and the OMB Memorandum M-18-18. If these changes are accepted, the micro-purchase threshold would increase to $10,000 (from $3,500) and the simplified acquisition threshold would increase to $250,000 (from $150,000) for all nonfederal entities. The definition of micro-purchase also includes the purchase of supplies or services for which the aggregate amount does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold.</p><p>Governmentwide Approach to Performance and Risk</p><p>This section focuses on the Results-Orientated Accountability for Grants Cross-Agency Priority Goal (Grants CAP goal) that shifts the balance between compliance and performance while reducing burden. It encourages Federal agencies to work together to develop a risk-based approach that incorporates performance to achieve results-oriented grants.</p><p>February 04: BPM Offers Clients Wider Variety of Specialty Services in 2020</p><p>BPM, one of the 50 largest public accounting and advisory firms in the country, has been recognized by ClearlyRated as a \"Best of Accounting Diamond Award\" winner for providing superior service to its clients for five consecutive years. Just 25% of the 2020 Best of Accounting winners earned the Diamond Award distinction, which cements the Firm's commitment to its clients' business needs and goals-both through its growth of strategic services offered and expansion into new geographic regions.</p><p>\"Being recognized for the fifth consecutive year and obtaining the 'Diamond' distinction for our exceptional client service is truly an honor,\" said Jim Wallace, CEO of BPM. \"This is a testament to our professionals who are continually striving to empower our clients with the knowledge and support they need to succeed through our industry focus and specialized services.\"</p><p>The \"Best of Accounting Award\" winners are selected solely on the industry-leading satisfaction scores received from clients. BPM received satisfaction scores of 9 or 10 out of 10 from 81.4% of its clients, which is significantly higher than the industry's average of 45% in 2019. The Firm also received a Net Promoter Score of 78.4%, whereas the industry average was 24% in 2019.</p><p>\"The feedback we receive from our clients directly impact our decisions and are incorporated into our operating strategy each year,\" added Jessica Hekmatjah, Director of Marketing and Corporate Development at BPM.</p><p>February 03: Burr Pilger Mayer: Including Financial Wellness in Your Retirement Plan Strategy</p><p>Many employees are paying a high price for their inadvertent ignorance about personal finance matters, studies are concluding. The price isn't measured solely in bad investment or spending decisions, but also emotional and physical health, as well as in diminished job productivity. Employees' understanding of your retirement plan, or lack thereof, is a critical piece of the puzzle. Designing a retirement plan educational strategy without considering employees' financial wellness could yield disappointing results.</p><p>Connect Literacy to Health</p><p>A study by the Stanford Center on Longevity found that Americans are losing ground in three \"interdependent domains\": healthy living, financial security and social engagement. As a result, the study found, \"many companies are expanding their vision of wellness to include other aspects of an employee's wellbeing,\" including personal finance. And a report by Prudential found that increasing \"numbers of employers are finding it advantageous to address overall wellness - financial and physical and social engagement - in their human capital strategy.\"</p><p>For some, it begins with a crash course in financial literacy. A recent study of Americans' grasps of basic personal finance topics conducted by the TIAA Institute identified \"critical gaps in financial literacy among American adults and underscored the connection between financial literacy and financial health.\" The average survey respondent could answer only around half of the questions in a quiz that was administered as part of the study.</p><p>February 03: Burr Pilger Mayer: IRS Clarifies Meaning of Plan \"Contribution\" for Tax Deduction Purposes</p><p>When is an employer contribution to a retirement plan truly a contribution eligible for a tax deduction under ERISA Section 404(a)? Although this might seem like a rhetorical question, it was deemed worthy enough to warrant a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The IRS also addressed the matter in a chief counsel memorandum (CCM). The issue can arise when a plan sponsor does something more complicated than simply transfer corporate funds from its own bank account to that of the retirement plan trust in a straightforward manner.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 03: Burr Pilger Mayer: Employee Benefits Update February/March 2020</p><p>Click here to download the most recent copy of our Employee Benefits Update Newsletter for February/March 2020.</p><p>Featured Articles:</p><p>IRS Clarifies Meaning of Plan \"Contribution\" for Tax Deduction Purposes Now Is the Time for MEPs Including Financial Wellness in your Retirement Plan Strategy</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 03: Video: BPM's Dmitri Alexeev Discusses Cryptocurrency 1099 Reporting</p><p>BPM's Dmitri Alexeev, Tax Partner and Digital Assets and Blockchain Industry Group Co-Leader, moderated an Accounting Blockchain Coalition (ABC) webinar on January 31, 2020 that touched on 1099s and Cryptocurrency.

Organizations that violate the prohibition risk losing their tax-exempt status. They also could find themselves on the hook for an excise tax. Here's what you need to know to keep your nonprofit on the right side of the political activities law.</p><p>What are the rules?</p><p>According to the IRS, an organization intervenes in a political campaign if it:</p><p>Makes or solicits contributions to or for candidates or political organizations, Endorses a candidate or rates candidates, Distributes partisan campaign literature or written statements, Has its representatives speak out about a candidate, or Uses its resources to influence an election. Your nonprofit can, however, conduct nonpartisan activities that educate the public and help them participate in the election process.</p><p>What's OK, what isn't?</p><p>Some politics-related activities or expenses may be permissible depending on the facts and circumstances. For example:</p><p>Voter education. Voter education activities, such as publishing voter education guides, don't constitute prohibited activity if conducted in a nonpartisan manner.</p><p>January 28: Burr Pilger Mayer: Collective Impact Initiatives Rely on Harmony</p><p>Collective impact, an approach that's growing among nonprofits, is more than just collaboration. Its originators describe the phrase as the commitment of a group of important players from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem. That includes the nonprofits themselves, government, businesses and constituent communities.</p><p>In the Stanford Social Innovation Review article that introduced the concept, the authors explicitly contrasted collective impact with collaboration. Unlike most collaborations, they explained, collective impact initiatives involve a centralized infrastructure, dedicated staff and structured process.</p><p>Create the right environment</p><p>An example of the approach: In 2016, the Hampton Roads Community Foundation in Southeast Virginia initiated a regionwide process to improve the results in early care and education programs. It tapped almost 100 stakeholders in planning a program designed to unite previously disparate programs and participants to achieve greater impact. The Minus 9 to 5 initiative has been able to align actions across five cities in Virginia in only two years.</p><p>Adherents of collective impact typically cite five prerequisites that together produce the alignment necessary for successful initiatives:</p><p>First, a common agenda is paramount.</p><p>January 28: Burr Pilger Mayer: Nonprofit Observer Winter 2020</p><p>BPM Nonprofit is pleased to present to you the following articles to assist you and your nonprofit organization with timely insight on important topics facing your organization.

The IRS mandates that taxpayers substantiate single contributions of $250 or more with contemporaneous written acknowledgments. Here's what you should include in those acknowledgments.</p><p>The essentials</p><p>A written contribution acknowledgment should contain:</p><p>The name of your organization, The amount of the contribution, The date of the contribution, A description (but not the value) of noncash contributions, When appropriate, a statement that no goods or services were provided by your nonprofit, When appropriate, a description and good-faith estimate of the value of any goods or services provided in exchange for the contribution, and When appropriate, a statement that any goods or services provided consisted entirely of intangible religious benefits. Some state tax authorities also require a tax-exempt status statement with your organization's Employer Identification Number.</p><p>The IRS leaves it up to nonprofits to decide on the appropriate medium for donation acknowledgments. For example, it could be a letter, postcard, email or text.</p><p>Timing matters</p><p>According to the IRS, acknowledgments are \"contemporaneous\" when donors receive them by the earlier of 1) the date they actually file their income tax returns for the year of the contribution or 2) the due date of the return.</p><p>January 27: Burr Pilger Mayer: Trustees and Beneficiaries Can Save Taxes with the \"65-Day Rule\"</p><p>Executors of estates and trustees of complex trusts may have an opportunity to reduce 2019 income taxes. Trusts and estates begin paying taxes at the top federal rate of 37.0% when 2019 taxable income exceeds $12,750. In addition, interest, dividend, net capital gains, and other investment income is subject to the 3.8% net investment income tax, resulting in a total federal marginal tax rate of up to 40.8%. Personal federal taxes for 2019 do not reach the top tax bracket of 37.0% until taxable income exceeds $510,300 for single filers or $612,350 for married, joint filers. Individuals are also subject to the 3.8% tax on net investment income at $200,000 - $250,000 of modified adjusted gross income.</p><p>The TCJA of 2017 suspension of federal investment expense and other miscellaneous deductions may increase the trust's 2019 income. The TCJA has also created a federal Qualified Business Income deduction (Section 199A). When Section 199A is applicable and trust distributions are made, the deduction is allocable between the trust and its beneficiaries.</p><p>Income distributions made by the estate or trust to beneficiaries in a lower tax bracket during the tax year may result in overall tax savings.</p><p>January 24: BPM's HR Partner Jill Pappenheimer Featured in Profile Magazine</p><p>This month, BPM's HR and People Services Practice Leader Jill Pappenheimer talked to Profile Magazine about how effective HR management and consulting requires a delicate balance of hard and soft skills.</p><p>Jill also talks about the early stages of building a business, developing a performance management tool and how working with the BPM's tax, accounting and advisory clients provides holistic business solutions through BPM's business model.</p><p>Profile highlights real people in leadership positions who want to share their hard-won insight into today's business world.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19. We highlight that Japan is not shielded from suppressed output amid the pandemic, which means that its overall score is being held back by its performance under our 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our Risk/Reward Index.</p><p>Strength Of China's Autos Industry Keeps It On Top Asia - Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Heat Map</p><p>Note: Scores out of 100; higher score = more attractive market.

The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19.

If these changes are accepted, the micro-purchase threshold would increase to $10,000 (from $3,500) and the simplified acquisition threshold would increase to $250,000 (from $150,000) for all nonfederal entities. The definition of micro-purchase also includes the purchase of supplies or services for which the aggregate amount does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold.</p><p>Governmentwide Approach to Performance and Risk</p><p>This section focuses on the Results-Orientated Accountability for Grants Cross-Agency Priority Goal (Grants CAP goal) that shifts the balance between compliance and performance while reducing burden. It encourages Federal agencies to work together to develop a risk-based approach that incorporates performance to achieve results-oriented grants.</p><p>February 04: BPM Offers Clients Wider Variety of Specialty Services in 2020</p><p>BPM, one of the 50 largest public accounting and advisory firms in the country, has been recognized by ClearlyRated as a \"Best of Accounting Diamond Award\" winner for providing superior service to its clients for five consecutive years. Just 25% of the 2020 Best of Accounting winners earned the Diamond Award distinction, which cements the Firm's commitment to its clients' business needs and goals-both through its growth of strategic services offered and expansion into new geographic regions.</p><p>\"Being recognized for the fifth consecutive year and obtaining the 'Diamond' distinction for our exceptional client service is truly an honor,\" said Jim Wallace, CEO of BPM. \"This is a testament to our professionals who are continually striving to empower our clients with the knowledge and support they need to succeed through our industry focus and specialized services.\"</p><p>The \"Best of Accounting Award\" winners are selected solely on the industry-leading satisfaction scores received from clients. BPM received satisfaction scores of 9 or 10 out of 10 from 81.4% of its clients, which is significantly higher than the industry's average of 45% in 2019. The Firm also received a Net Promoter Score of 78.4%, whereas the industry average was 24% in 2019.</p><p>\"The feedback we receive from our clients directly impact our decisions and are incorporated into our operating strategy each year,\" added Jessica Hekmatjah, Director of Marketing and Corporate Development at BPM.</p><p>February 03: Burr Pilger Mayer: Including Financial Wellness in Your Retirement Plan Strategy</p><p>Many employees are paying a high price for their inadvertent ignorance about personal finance matters, studies are concluding. The price isn't measured solely in bad investment or spending decisions, but also emotional and physical health, as well as in diminished job productivity. Employees' understanding of your retirement plan, or lack thereof, is a critical piece of the puzzle. Designing a retirement plan educational strategy without considering employees' financial wellness could yield disappointing results.</p><p>Connect Literacy to Health</p><p>A study by the Stanford Center on Longevity found that Americans are losing ground in three \"interdependent domains\": healthy living, financial security and social engagement. As a result, the study found, \"many companies are expanding their vision of wellness to include other aspects of an employee's wellbeing,\" including personal finance. And a report by Prudential found that increasing \"numbers of employers are finding it advantageous to address overall wellness - financial and physical and social engagement - in their human capital strategy.\"</p><p>For some, it begins with a crash course in financial literacy. A recent study of Americans' grasps of basic personal finance topics conducted by the TIAA Institute identified \"critical gaps in financial literacy among American adults and underscored the connection between financial literacy and financial health.\" The average survey respondent could answer only around half of the questions in a quiz that was administered as part of the study.</p><p>February 03: Burr Pilger Mayer: IRS Clarifies Meaning of Plan \"Contribution\" for Tax Deduction Purposes</p><p>When is an employer contribution to a retirement plan truly a contribution eligible for a tax deduction under ERISA Section 404(a)? Although this might seem like a rhetorical question, it was deemed worthy enough to warrant a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The IRS also addressed the matter in a chief counsel memorandum (CCM). The issue can arise when a plan sponsor does something more complicated than simply transfer corporate funds from its own bank account to that of the retirement plan trust in a straightforward manner.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 03: Burr Pilger Mayer: Employee Benefits Update February/March 2020</p><p>Click here to download the most recent copy of our Employee Benefits Update Newsletter for February/March 2020.</p><p>Featured Articles:</p><p>IRS Clarifies Meaning of Plan \"Contribution\" for Tax Deduction Purposes Now Is the Time for MEPs Including Financial Wellness in your Retirement Plan Strategy</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 03: Video: BPM's Dmitri Alexeev Discusses Cryptocurrency 1099 Reporting</p><p>BPM's Dmitri Alexeev, Tax Partner and Digital Assets and Blockchain Industry Group Co-Leader, moderated an Accounting Blockchain Coalition (ABC) webinar on January 31, 2020 that touched on 1099s and Cryptocurrency.

Organizations that violate the prohibition risk losing their tax-exempt status. They also could find themselves on the hook for an excise tax. Here's what you need to know to keep your nonprofit on the right side of the political activities law.</p><p>What are the rules?</p><p>According to the IRS, an organization intervenes in a political campaign if it:</p><p>Makes or solicits contributions to or for candidates or political organizations, Endorses a candidate or rates candidates, Distributes partisan campaign literature or written statements, Has its representatives speak out about a candidate, or Uses its resources to influence an election. Your nonprofit can, however, conduct nonpartisan activities that educate the public and help them participate in the election process.</p><p>What's OK, what isn't?</p><p>Some politics-related activities or expenses may be permissible depending on the facts and circumstances. For example:</p><p>Voter education. Voter education activities, such as publishing voter education guides, don't constitute prohibited activity if conducted in a nonpartisan manner.</p><p>January 28: Burr Pilger Mayer: Collective Impact Initiatives Rely on Harmony</p><p>Collective impact, an approach that's growing among nonprofits, is more than just collaboration. Its originators describe the phrase as the commitment of a group of important players from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem. That includes the nonprofits themselves, government, businesses and constituent communities.</p><p>In the Stanford Social Innovation Review article that introduced the concept, the authors explicitly contrasted collective impact with collaboration. Unlike most collaborations, they explained, collective impact initiatives involve a centralized infrastructure, dedicated staff and structured process.</p><p>Create the right environment</p><p>An example of the approach: In 2016, the Hampton Roads Community Foundation in Southeast Virginia initiated a regionwide process to improve the results in early care and education programs. It tapped almost 100 stakeholders in planning a program designed to unite previously disparate programs and participants to achieve greater impact. The Minus 9 to 5 initiative has been able to align actions across five cities in Virginia in only two years.</p><p>Adherents of collective impact typically cite five prerequisites that together produce the alignment necessary for successful initiatives:</p><p>First, a common agenda is paramount.</p><p>January 28: Burr Pilger Mayer: Nonprofit Observer Winter 2020</p><p>BPM Nonprofit is pleased to present to you the following articles to assist you and your nonprofit organization with timely insight on important topics facing your organization.

The IRS mandates that taxpayers substantiate single contributions of $250 or more with contemporaneous written acknowledgments. Here's what you should include in those acknowledgments.</p><p>The essentials</p><p>A written contribution acknowledgment should contain:</p><p>The name of your organization, The amount of the contribution, The date of the contribution, A description (but not the value) of noncash contributions, When appropriate, a statement that no goods or services were provided by your nonprofit, When appropriate, a description and good-faith estimate of the value of any goods or services provided in exchange for the contribution, and When appropriate, a statement that any goods or services provided consisted entirely of intangible religious benefits. Some state tax authorities also require a tax-exempt status statement with your organization's Employer Identification Number.</p><p>The IRS leaves it up to nonprofits to decide on the appropriate medium for donation acknowledgments. For example, it could be a letter, postcard, email or text.</p><p>Timing matters</p><p>According to the IRS, acknowledgments are \"contemporaneous\" when donors receive them by the earlier of 1) the date they actually file their income tax returns for the year of the contribution or 2) the due date of the return.</p><p>January 27: Burr Pilger Mayer: Trustees and Beneficiaries Can Save Taxes with the \"65-Day Rule\"</p><p>Executors of estates and trustees of complex trusts may have an opportunity to reduce 2019 income taxes. Trusts and estates begin paying taxes at the top federal rate of 37.0% when 2019 taxable income exceeds $12,750. In addition, interest, dividend, net capital gains, and other investment income is subject to the 3.8% net investment income tax, resulting in a total federal marginal tax rate of up to 40.8%. Personal federal taxes for 2019 do not reach the top tax bracket of 37.0% until taxable income exceeds $510,300 for single filers or $612,350 for married, joint filers. Individuals are also subject to the 3.8% tax on net investment income at $200,000 - $250,000 of modified adjusted gross income.</p><p>The TCJA of 2017 suspension of federal investment expense and other miscellaneous deductions may increase the trust's 2019 income. The TCJA has also created a federal Qualified Business Income deduction (Section 199A). When Section 199A is applicable and trust distributions are made, the deduction is allocable between the trust and its beneficiaries.</p><p>Income distributions made by the estate or trust to beneficiaries in a lower tax bracket during the tax year may result in overall tax savings.</p><p>January 24: BPM's HR Partner Jill Pappenheimer Featured in Profile Magazine</p><p>This month, BPM's HR and People Services Practice Leader Jill Pappenheimer talked to Profile Magazine about how effective HR management and consulting requires a delicate balance of hard and soft skills.</p><p>Jill also talks about the early stages of building a business, developing a performance management tool and how working with the BPM's tax, accounting and advisory clients provides holistic business solutions through BPM's business model.</p><p>Profile highlights real people in leadership positions who want to share their hard-won insight into today's business world.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19. We highlight that Japan is not shielded from suppressed output amid the pandemic, which means that its overall score is being held back by its performance under our 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our Risk/Reward Index.</p><p>Strength Of China's Autos Industry Keeps It On Top Asia - Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Heat Map</p><p>Note: Scores out of 100; higher score = more attractive market.

Won't Overturn Exec's Win In $1.5M Merger Loan Suit</p><p>The Seventh Circuit recently upheld a ruling that the owner of a chemical import company does not have to repay a loan taken out in connection with a merger, since the obligation to do so ended once the merger was dissolved. The lower court ruling centered on the meaning of the \"agreement\" between the merging parties, determining that it consisted of a stock-sharing agreement and a consulting agreement along with a built-in repayment mechanism. More importantly, because the merger, agreement and loan were interdependent, canceling the merger meant canceling both the agreement and the loan as well. The Seventh Circuit said the trial court acted reasonably in its determination and therefore upheld its finding. Litigation Partner Richard Winter represented the owner in the case, which was recapped in a Law360 article.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Holland &amp; Knight LLP: Cindy Brazell Honored with Distinguished Leader Award by Daily Report</p><p>Holland &amp; Knight Partner Cindy Brazell was honored with a Distinguished Leader Award by the Daily Report on June 24 during its annual Georgia Legal Awards ceremony.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19. We highlight that Japan is not shielded from suppressed output amid the pandemic, which means that its overall score is being held back by its performance under our 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our Risk/Reward Index.</p><p>Strength Of China's Autos Industry Keeps It On Top Asia - Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Heat Map</p><p>Note: Scores out of 100; higher score = more attractive market.

Without universal health insurance, many American citizens are left to fend for themselves in a complex maze of providers, employers, and doctor networks. Due to serious gaps in the health care system, there is ample opportunity for non-traditional players to enter the space with competitive offerings and services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is why Walmart announced last week a further expansion of its \"Walmart Health\" service. Walmart Health will be available in Florida starting next year. The Sunshine State will be the third state where the offering is available, following Georgia and Arkansas. Among the planned services to be available are:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Low, transparent pricing for key healthcare services, regardless of insurance status. - Care delivered by qualified medical professionals, including physicians, nurse practitioners, dentists, counselors and optometrists. - State-of-the-art facilities that offer full-service primary and urgent care, labs, x-ray and diagnostics, counseling, dental, optical and hearing services all in one central facility. - Specialized community health resources, online education and in-center workshops to educate the community about preventive health and wellness.</p><p>While Walmart is rarely the first name that comes to mind when one thinks of \"health\", the retailer clearly feels that people will be drawn to cheap, effective health services at its all-in-one stores.</p><p>The move also reflects the continued pursuit for new business by top American companies. Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business and noted observer of the American business landscape, recently discussed the need for the biggest American companies, the Apples and Googles of the world, to go \"big game hunting.\" If these companies want to maintain and increase their sky-high valuations, they must seek out new, and more importantly big, industries. \"People ask if big tech wants to get into education and health care, and I say no, they have to get into education and health care. They have no choice,\" says Galloway.</p><p>This trend is evident all across America. With annual health care spending in the United States over $3.5 trillion dollars, top American companies view the sector as a prime target to sustain their ambitions (and meet shareholder expectations). Amazon has teamed up with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to revamp health care for its employees. Google acquired Fitbit for $2 billion. Microsoft is incredibly active in the space. Walmart is now following suit with \"Walmart Health.\" So whether it is via sleeping data, prescription delivery companies, or health centers at traditional big box stores, the biggest names in American business are seeking a slice of the lucrative health care pie.</p><p>Traditional health insurers are now having to compete with these new entrants for health care dollars in the US. That is why we continue to witness innovation and ecosystem growth. Back in February, we spoke with Dr. Robin Kiera about the state of the insurance world. He said, \"A lot of challenger insurers - or insurtech as they are called - disrupted the market. Indeed, a lot of challengers pivoted their business models and are now enabling insurers creating a win-win situation. Insurtechs get access to valuable clients and funds. Insurers receive desperately needed new technology and knowledge.\" Developing new products, establishing partnerships, and creating ecosystems are the tools being employed by insurers to stay present and relevant in their customers' lives.</p><p>Of course, health care is especially germane during the coronavirus era. This was noted by Sean Slovenski, SVP and President, Health &amp; Wellness, Walmart U.S, in their announcement last week: \"The combined crises of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic recession, and subsequent loss of health insurance for millions of Americans have reinforced the vulnerabilities of our healthcare system.\" Given the precarious situation in the U.S., citizens are likely to turn to any health provider that can deliver cheap, reliable, and practical services. Whether that is a traditional insurer or an unorthodox new entrant will be of little importance.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 EFMA SARL PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 1 EFMA SARL PROFILE</p><p>1.1 SUMMARY</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.efma.com\">http://www.efma.com</url></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>July 24: EFMA SARL: Xinja Bank to launch US share platform for Australian investors</p><p>Australia's 100% digital, built for mobile neobank, Xinja Bank, will launch a share trading platform that gives Australian investors easy access to more than 3000 US shares and exchange traded funds (ETFs) via the Xinja app.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 23: EFMA SARL: Bank earnings reports reflect major uncertainty in U.S.</p><p>The biggest American banks are girding themselves against depressed economic activity for the remainder of the year.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, especially in the United States. A few months ago, I wrote about three possible scenarios to consider as people were assessing and planning for the upcoming months. The first scenario, the optimistic hope of a V-shaped rebound of economic activity, is now off the table. As we see people re-confined to their households from Australia to Japan to Catalonia, one thing is clear: this virus, this pandemic, is the big one. It continues to spread all around the globe, with ever-changing geographic hot spots, overwhelming governments and people while causing massive disruptions to daily life.</p><p>Now, six months on from the discovery of the virus in Wuhan, China, Europe is slowly staggering back to life. While there is a long way to go yet, some figures from the Old Continent are encouraging. Retail is rebounding. Industrial production, while still far lower than the previous year, has begun to tick back up. People are planning their holidays for August. The numbers, and daily life, paint a picture of a slow but steady resumption of normal life.</p><p>It is, however, a very different story across the Atlantic. The United States has failed to meaningfully suppress the virus. Its rampant spread in various parts of the country has led governors of many states to reimpose business closings, mandate their citizens wear masks, and urge people to stay home. While the early outbreak in the U.S. was limited to certain hot spot regions like the northeast, and New York City in particular, now cases are growing rapidly in western and southern states. The country has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the world.</p><p>The surge of the virus throughout the country and the accompanying restrictive measures were clearly reflected in the earnings reports of top financial institutions last week.</p><p>July 23: EFMA SARL: UnionBank and its partners launch an app for the distribution of government bonds enabled by blockchain</p><p>The Philippine Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), together with Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank) and the Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (PDAX) - a Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) licensed entity, is the first in Asia to launch an app for the distribution of government bonds enabled by Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 22: EFMA SARL: Barclays helps close the advice gap with launch of Plan &amp; Invest</p><p>Barclays has launched a new digital advice service to tackle the UK's advice gap and give more people the confidence and support to invest their savings.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19. We highlight that Japan is not shielded from suppressed output amid the pandemic, which means that its overall score is being held back by its performance under our 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our Risk/Reward Index.</p><p>Strength Of China's Autos Industry Keeps It On Top Asia - Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Heat Map</p><p>Note: Scores out of 100; higher score = more attractive market.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19. We highlight that Japan is not shielded from suppressed output amid the pandemic, which means that its overall score is being held back by its performance under our 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our Risk/Reward Index.</p><p>Strength Of China's Autos Industry Keeps It On Top Asia - Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Heat Map</p><p>Note: Scores out of 100; higher score = more attractive market.

As such, the region maintains its position as the most attractive region for vehicle production globally, followed by Europe (53.8) and the Americas (43.4). The Asia region benefits from major automotive countries, such as China, Japan and India, all having large volume vehicle production, healthy completion, a good pool of skilled labour and strong automotive policies. However, production growth scores in these markets have fallen due to the spread of Covid-19. We highlight that Japan is not shielded from suppressed output amid the pandemic, which means that its overall score is being held back by its performance under our 'Vehicle production growth' indicator on our Risk/Reward Index.</p><p>Strength Of China's Autos Industry Keeps It On Top Asia - Autos Production Risk/Reward Index Heat Map</p><p>Note: Scores out of 100; higher score = more attractive market.

But one of the things I'm proud of at Hamilton Place Strategies is that from the very beginning, we were focused on building a durable business - focused more on the unique quality of our work than on any individual or any political moment in time.</p><p>Ten years ago, the landscape for all firms was changing. Big issues facing firms were becoming increasingly complex, public, and global. At the same time, news organizations covering these very complex issues were devoting more resources to sophisticated reporting and presentation of news. The ability to share this news was growing as well. The kinds of deep, wonky analysis usually reserved for think tanks was now showing up on popular news sites.</p><p>Working in that news environment requires a much greater depth of knowledge about the issues and challenges facing firms. We felt that analytical, evidence-based messaging, strategies, and tactics would be most effective.</p><p>We also felt that for HPS to be a credible participant on these issues - and a partner to our clients - it was also important to show our analysis and express our views, regardless of ideology, party, or politics.</p><p>July 16: HPS Announces Claire Bischoff as Director: HPS Announces Claire Bischoff as Director</p><p>Today, Hamilton Place Strategies (HPS) is pleased to announce Claire Bischoff's promotion to director at the firm.</p><p>Since joining HPS in 2016, Claire has performed invaluable work as an associate and senior associate, helping to develop and implement strategic communications, crisis management, and brand development strategies for clients in finance, mergers and acquisitions, and tech, among other industries.

Big show ahead, good morning, everyone, happy Friday, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, August 2nd, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S.-China trade turmoil today, President Trump threatens to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $300 billion on Chinese goods. The move could affect prices, at a slew of things, including smartphones, clothing, toys, now, China is vowing retaliation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are lower, Futures extending yesterday's declines right now. We are expecting a pressure -- some pressure on the market this morning, down about 87 points right now. Markets are turning sharply lower, as soon as the President tweeted the tariff threat yesterday, ending down in the triple digits. Yesterday, global markets took cue from the U.S., trading lower today.</p><p>Yesterday's close down almost 300 points, and the FT 100 is down 142, CAC Quarante is down 155, and the DAX Index in Germany, down 300 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, it was red across the board there, as well, due to the trade concerns. As you see, worst performer was Japan, as well as Hong Kong down better than two percent a piece.</p><p>Plus, jobs in America, investors waiting on the July jobs report today, economists are expecting 164,000 jobs added to the economy last month, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent. We've got special coverage, all hands on deck, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we've got a big show this morning, joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Moody's Capital Markets chief economist, John Lonski is here, and Employbridge chief workforce analyst, Joanie Courtney. It is great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JOANIE COURTNEY, CHIEF WORKFORCE ANALYST, EMPLOYBRIDGE: Good morning, glad to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a big show coming up, a lot of market impacts. Also on deck this morning, joining the conversation, Americans for Tax Reform president and founder, Grover Norquist is here. I want to talk about spending and the budget with Grover. Pennsylvania congressman, House Judiciary and Armed Services Committee member, Guy Reschenthaler is here, on the INF Treaty and Iran.</p><p>Plus, former Chicago Tribune publisher, Revolution Enterprises chairman, Tony Hunter, joining us this morning to talk big business of marijuana, wait until you see what he's doing.</p><p>Then, family medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, aka Dr. Mike, joining us to talk about the health benefits of plant-based burgers with all the hype around Impossible burger, we're going to talk about that. Don't miss a moment of it, big three hours this morning.</p><p>And, of course, our top story today is President Trump's tariff threat, hitting markets yesterday. Futures pointing to a decline at the start of trading this morning, again, extending yesterday's declines, down another 80 points. It comes after a wild day yesterday.</p><p>You can see the down slide just after President Trump announced that he is probably going to slap China with 10 percent tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of goods. We've been waiting for the president's action on this remaining 325 billion in goods coming in from China.</p><p>And he told us what he's going to do (INAUDIBLE) can go all the way up to 25, but he's doing 10 percent. The action would hit consumers in a new way, taxing everyday products, like shoes, toys, smartphones, televisions, computers, it's going to get expensive, President Trump commenting on the move last night, at a campaign rally in Ohio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've taken the toughest- ever action to stand up to China's straight abuse, and I just announced another 10 percent tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country.</p><p>For the last 20 years, China has taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now, we are stopping the theft of American jobs, we're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property.</p><p>President Xi is a good man, he's a friend of mine, he understands it. And until such time, as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that begins on September 1, with these new tariffs. Guys, let's talk about this because this is obviously going to move markets again today, John, your reaction?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: You know, we got off to a good start yesterday, these news on tariffs came out, the market sell -- sold off deeply. This issue has been with us now for more than a year. It started June 2018.</p><p>It hasn't helped the economy. We would've had faster than three percent growth for the first time since 2005, had it not been for tariffs in 2018. I don't think it's helping the president, politically, and it's definitely hurting the U.S., economically.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Actually, you make a good point because that's the angle of the Journal took today, in the op-ed, talking about this, saying these tariffs have been in place now, 18 months, and one of the uncertainties here, one of the problems, is that nobody knows when they're going to stop, Dagen, I mean, you don't know where this is going.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right, you have CEOs across the country that are sitting around watching the president's Twitter feed, all day long, rather than actually running businesses and creating jobs.</p><p>And, again, when you talk about job creation in this country and long-term investment decisions, and it was business spending that dragged down economic growth in the second quarter, you have people sitting around saying we can't plan because we don't know what's going to happen in terms of our imports from China or even the global manufacturing picture.</p><p>Again, this isn't -- this -- our tariffs hurt China and doesn't hurt anyone else, that the Journal points out in that very op-ed, that they've hurt -- our fight with China and the tariffs, it hurt U.S. exports and contributed to what is close to a global recession in manufacturing. This is not good.</p><p>We've talked about on this program, just in recent weeks, as long as we had the status quo of there are additional tariffs at this point, that they continue to negotiate with the United States, I'm talking about China, that it could, at least, stabilize the environment here, in the U.S., for the economy, but there -- and -- then, yesterday, boom.</p><p>And there's been a huge rust to treasuries. People are buying treasuries, sending the yield on the 10-year down even lower this morning, ahead of the jobs report.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, part of the issue here is that China keeps reneging on everything, I mean, it's not just the fact that they refuse to put law in place, in China, that it is unlawful to steal intellectual property, but it's also the moves on the currency.</p><p>It's the moves with the investment and forced transfer of technology, all these things that are manufactured from China, to actually just dominate, and that's one of the things, obviously, those talks broke down in Shanghai, and there was no giving in on the China side.</p><p>COURTNEY: Right. And, you know, Maria, I thought it was really interesting. President Trump's comments on the White House lawn yesterday, he also spoke about how President Xi had gone back on stopping Fentanyl from coming into the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's another issue. That's right.</p><p>COURTNEY: He also said that he was going to, you know, start buying from the farmers, that hasn't happened, so there's many things at play here, but, I think, to Dagen's point, it really is impacting the confidence of CEOs, and they're feeling, you know, that yes, we're going to make those hires.</p><p>It definitely is impacting the job market because employers are cautious, they are going to be cautious until they see what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's the impact on CapEx, like you said, and that's the angle in the Journal as well, the fact that we don't know where this is going. This uncertainty is going to, once again, push managers, businesses, CEOs, to sit on cash. That's what we saw in the GDP. CapEx was down in that last GDP, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And don't just sit -- CEOs are going to sit around, and if not -- and not making investment decisions, start laying off people. I'll point to Lowe's. Lowe's is unique -- a unique company, but what's the story in the Journal today, that Lowe's has told that it's basically laying off thousands of people. That it's going to outsource the assembly of goods and its stores.</p><p>They're offering them other jobs in the stores, but again, you're going to see a lot more of that if this -- if this continues.</p><p>LONSKI: There's no going back on globalization. You know, many U.S.-based corporations conduct manufacturing out of China. Look at Apple. Look at the problems that this is going to present for Apple if he follows through on this threat to increase tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but John, I mean, the fact is --I say this all of the time, I mean, for so many years, CEOs were so interested in getting a foothold in China, to be able to sell their products to the 1.4 billion people there, that they forgot to protect their own products.</p><p>I mean, you know, Secretary Pompeo has made this point a lot. You want to go operate in China, go with your eyes open, because they will steal from you, and they will copy everything that you have.</p><p>LONSKI: Don't you think the CEOs should have known better? I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They did. That was -- yes, all they wanted to do was expand their markets, and they didn't recognize what the threat was, really, as China was rising and rising and rising, and using their military to really be front and center.</p><p>They want to become the number one super power, militarily, that's one of the issues, and they are ahead of us in a number of technology issues, arguably, A.I.</p><p>LONSKI: And to Trump's credit, he brought this issue to the forefront.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was going to add to that. He recognized the destruction of Middle America and good-paying stable jobs in this country, which happened, literally, over decades. He recognized that. He spoke to those individuals. However, he started a fight that he will not be able to settle by the time voters go to polls next year.</p><p>The danger is, the economy continues to weaken, which it is, so far, this year. And then when that people go to polls, the economy is at or near a recession, and he will not get re-elected if that's the backdrop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point. And jobs in America is the focus today, we got the jobs number out this morning. Investors are waiting on the July number, out in just over two hours. We're expecting 164,000 jobs to have been added to the economy in the month of July. We are expecting the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7 percent.</p><p>Joanie, what are you looking for, what's most important to you from this report this morning?</p><p>COURTNEY: Yes, you know, I think it's going to be important, of course, to look at revisions for May and June, to see whether the numbers move because, obviously, we all know June was such a strong report. Wages are going to be really important, labor participation, also, very important to look at.</p><p>But, I expect we are going to see a good job report. We have over 7 million open jobs in the country, 6 million unemployed people. There definitely is a strong demand. It's going to come back to where employers, you know, number one, confident to make those hires.</p><p>And number two, were they able to find the skill and talent to meet that demand, because we still have a skill's gap issue, as we've talked about before, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we sure do.</p><p>COURTNEY: And still a big challenge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: John, what are you looking for?</p><p>LONSKI: Like you said, you know, we have, like, a million more job openings than we have unemployed. It's a pretty good market, we had a very strong reading on consumer confidence for the month of July, 170,000 new jobs, that's close to the average monthly increase for the second quarter.</p><p>You know, keep a special eye on the private-sector jobs growth, that's a little bit less, running under 160,000. Wage growth three-tenths of a percent, up year-to-year 3.2 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 3.2 percent.</p><p>LONSKI: For wages.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And manufacturing, really quickly, 5,000 gains expected in manufacturing, if that comes in light that could rattle markets even further.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's where the weakness has been. We even saw a weaker PMI in Chicago this week. We've been looking at the PMIs, Purchasing Managers' tells us the whole story.</p><p>LONSKI: Worse reading sets that slump we had in manufacturing and business sales back in 2015, 2016, so keep an eye on that, I mean, if we ever further slowing of business sales, especially outside of the energy sector, then we're going to begin to, perhaps, have problems fairly soon on the job's front.</p><p>Capital spending, as we mentioned earlier, is already suffering from the sharp deceleration by business sales. And eventually, this could find its way into hiring activity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll see. Well, that's exactly what's playing out in the markets this morning. All of these concerns that you all have just brought up, has the markets under pressure once again.</p><p>We'll take a short break. Then, we're going to turn our attentions to the tensions flurrying out with North Korea, it is launching two more short- range missiles, how the U.S. is responding to that. And then, Facebook, continues under the microscope, why the FTC is taking a closer look at the social media giant's acquisitions now, stock is under pressure this morning.</p><p>We'll be right back with a lot more, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, North Korea apparently firing two more missiles, Cheryl Casone on headlines now. Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Well, according to South Korean officials, short-range North Korean missiles were fired into the sea of the Eastern Coast. This is North Korea's third round of weapons testing in just over a week. The launch is seen as a way to increase pressure on Seoul and Washington over these stalled nuclear talks.</p><p>Well, back here at home, Boeing, planning further changes to the flight control software on its 737 Max jets. The redesign involving using both flight-controlled computers, instead of just one computer. Boeing already has announced initial changes to the system, overall, of course, linked to those two deadly crashes. Shares of Boeing, low in premarket, down a little more than half a percent right now.</p><p>Well, earning season continues this morning, with trouble at Toyota, the company cutting its profit forecast for the full year by nearly six percent due to the strong yen. The yen has been strengthening amid global trade tensions, and then, Honda's bottom line, also taking a hit, on lower U.S. car sales, company's first quarter profit, falling by 16 percent.</p><p>And then, there is Pinterest, the stock is actually higher in the premarket right now, their latest results coming in better-than-expected. Pinterest is also raising guidance for 2019. There is Pinterest, Maria, in the premarket, down a little -- excuse me, higher by almost 17 percent and, of course, we are waiting on two Dow components this morning as well, managing sectors, so it's another big morning for earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sure is. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You mentioned the Yen, I know Jon Hilsenrath's going to bring up the dollar. We're going to talk about that as well, because this is all getting impacted here, and part of the story for earnings, as well as these markets.</p><p>We'll take a break. When we come back, the Dow's wild day yesterday, markets taking a dive after President Trump's tweets on tariffs, 10 percent on that 300 plus billion from China.</p><p>We showed you the mustard-flavored ice cream yesterday. Meanwhile, Oscar Mayer's new flavor is a perfect compliment. We're going to check that out today, ahead of National Mustard Day tomorrow, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are lower this morning on top of yesterday's big selloff. Check Futures, Dow Futures down 45, S&amp;P Futures down 7, NASDAQ Futures down 35, markets declining for second day in a row on news that President Trump is planning to put in place new tariffs on China, beginning September 1st.</p><p>Joining us right now is Cornell Capital partner, Ann Berry. And Ann, it is good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ANN BERRY, PARTNER, CORNELL CAPITAL: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The impact on investing, from your standpoint, to all of this?</p><p>BERRY: Well, I think, what we're going to continue to see is companies rattling to figure out now what to do with supply chains. I think, you know, up until yesterday, there was some assumption that we, at least, at the point of stability. And the time has come to start planning to, maybe, redirect production out of China, or I think this has, sort of, throwing that -- throwing that into haywire a little bit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the supply chain getting disrupted is a big deal, right? I mean, we've seen a handful of companies announced they're going to move their production out of China, going to Vietnam. That's not an easy thing to do. Tell us how you see this playing out.</p><p>BERRY: It's definitely (INAUDIBLE) if you look at Apple, for example, there was a lot of speculation they'd stop moving their supply chain quite quickly. And then, you know, reports came out, it'll probably take 3 years just to move 15 percent of their supply chain base. It's a very big investment, it takes a long time.</p><p>I think, in this instance, businesses will be trying to anticipate with more change coming, and this is the time to move, or will they sit tight and wait to how this plays out?</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's a feeling -- there was a talk yesterday, on Wall Street, maybe you guys heard it, that now, there's this competition between the tariff situation and the Fed, that maybe the president wasn't happy with Jay Powell's moves yesterday.</p><p>And Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said that the Central Bank will monitor global growth and trade policy uncertainty. Could the new tariffs be a push to get Powell to cut rates bigger and faster?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That would be the most insane thing on the planet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That would be insane. But people were talking about this yesterday on trading desks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That would be a -- like, that would be a world of insanity that I can't even get my head around. Because, again, it's like, what's more -- it would -- that's the essential question, is another rate cut going to offset the decline in business spending, right, John? The Journal writes about it today.</p><p>LONSKI: Who knows? There may be some truth of this semi-madness, but I'd look, you know, this morning. The Futures market assigns 90 percent odds to a rate cut at the September 18th meeting, the next meeting of the FOMC, and by the end of the year, 75 percent odds, a Fed funds being no higher than 1.63 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And look at the selloff we got on the 25 basis point cut earlier this week. Investors wanted 50 basis points.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, the tariff threat, it's not a threat. The plan, yesterday, announced by President Trump, it has driven longer-term interest rates lower for the central question among the likes of John Lonski is, will lower borrowing costs basically wipe away the investment shield, the business investment shield of the trade uncertainty, and many said no.</p><p>COURTNEY: But there was -- it was -- it was so interesting. There was so much news yesterday, obviously, following this, because there was a lot of talk in the morning about Powell's comments and certainly, that he was, like, very, like, middle of the road, noncommittal about whether they were going to be aggressively cutting rates, you know, throughout the year. Like, he really played it off that way.</p><p>Then, obviously --</p><p>LONSKI: The press conference.</p><p>COURTNEY: -- the press conference. And we hear about the tariffs with China, so it was interesting timing, so I understand why people were really talking about that, but it speaks to uncertainty --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>COURTNEY: -- in the market.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LONSKI: You know, this might provide a little bit of a lift to the consumer. Last four weeks, applications for mortgage re-financings are up 85 percent --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, 85 percent.</p><p>LONSKI: -- year-over-year. That's incredible, and applications for the purchase of home, mortgage applications for home buying, up six percent, perhaps home buying will come alive.</p><p>COURTNEY: And I saw that John, too, with pending home sales, was up significantly, which is also another good sign, so maybe you'll start to see, you know, we talked about consumer confidence earlier.</p><p>LONSKI: OK.</p><p>COURTNEY: That also is -- has jumped up quite a bit, almost --</p><p>LONSKI: Yes, destroying labor market. What we see right now, I believe, you have business investment spending is sagging, so it's the U.S. consumer that's not only providing buoyancy to the U.S. economy, but I think to the global economy, in general.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, we keep seeing that in all the reports. Ann, jump in here, because we've got the consumer strengthening, but business is holding back and pushing back on CapEx.</p><p>BERRY: Yes, I think it's likely -- and when you think about it, it's almost a tale of two economies at the moment. The consumer spending tear is quickly and easily reversible. It's very easy for consumers to stop going out there and start spending money or converted to go and do more.</p><p>If you look at what's happened in earning season, so far, whether it was the auto sector, whether it's the chemical sector, businesses have not been saying cost of capital is what's hurting our investment cycle. They're not saying rates have been too high, they've been saying the uncertainty that has come with the trade situation, it's the slowdown in the global growth that's hurting us.</p><p>So, I'm not sure that another Fed cut is going to create sustainable growth even if you get a small (INAUDIBLE) to do that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that's something you've been saying all along, Dagen, how much, really, can a cut in interest rates, 25 basis points here and there, really move the needle on what we're seeing today?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Fed Chief Jay Powell did not say this, he probably should have in the meeting earlier in the week, but this is just a reversal of what happened in December. He called it a mid-cycle adjustment, better than calling it an in-cycle adjustment. So, again --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, better than calling it my mistake.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Again, it's not the Fed's job to, basically, boost your portfolio. That's not -- that's not in the Fed mission statement. It's not Jay Powell's job to telegraph moment by moment, month by month, where short-term interest rates are going to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: There's a big difference between a mid-cycle adjustment and then end of cycle series of rate cuts that aim to keep the U.S. out of a recession. I mean, that's what you don't want to have happened.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. So --</p><p>LONSKI: Mid-cycle adjustments are great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He said mid cycle adjustment.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Embrace it, because if he was -- he was more concerned, he would be saying, whoops, the economy is headed to a recession. So, I don't -- the push and pull, the tug of war between the Fed and the president, right now, not helpful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, not helpful. Ann, at this point, you want to stay away from equities, you want to buy into this weakness, what do you want to do?</p><p>BERRY: I think we're still pretty optimistic that the economy is remaining very strong. They think, to this point, that John raised, which is coming towards an end of the cycle, at this point, you have to, sort of, ask if a recession comes, what levers are left to pull, to try and get a stimulus or the rates coming down --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are out of bullets.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, except that we just raised spending.</p><p>BERRY: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The senate yesterday just passed that giant spending bill, which if we are slowing dramatically, in terms of economic growth, then the timing is wise, but long run, running $1 trillion budget deficits at $22 trillion plus debt, we don't have a lot more room to spend, particularly if rates eventually start going up, then you're swamped with just the interest payments.</p><p>COURTNEY: And we'll get right back into another round of cuts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, there's your additional stimulus, the spending.</p><p>MCDOWELL: At least, in the short run, it's the consumer and it's the fiscal they're spending out of the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ann, it's great to have you on the program. Thanks so much.</p><p>BERRY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to get your insights, Ann Berry there. Coming up, government spending in focus, the Senate passed that two-year deal, making decision on the debt ceiling yesterday, the bill now headed to the president's desk.</p><p>Then, the FTC going after Facebook, again, the social media giant's acquisitions are now under the microscope. It is affecting the stock this morning, down three quarters of a percent. We're taking a look when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. TGIF, it is Friday, August 2nd.</p><p>Your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast. U.S.-China trade turmoil this morning. President Trump is planning to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $300 billion in Chinese goods coming into the U.S. That move happens on September 1st, according to the president.</p><p>The move could impact the prices of a slew of items, including smartphones, clothing, toys. Now, China is vowing retaliation. Markets are lower as a result. Futures extending yesterday's big decline with the Dow Futures down 39, S&amp;P Futures down seven, and Nasdaq Futures also down 39 points.</p><p>Markets turning sharply lower yesterday, as soon as the president tweeted on the tariff story. Dow Industrials on all of the said and done, down 280 point that was better than one percent.</p><p>S&amp;P was down 26 and the Nasdaq was lower by 64. Global reaction following the U.S. lower this morning. European Indexes down across the board. FT- 100 down, 1-2/3 percent, 127 points. CAC Quarante in Paris down 140 points, that's 2-1/2 percent. And the DAX Index in Germany down 282, that's 2-1/3 percent lower in Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight, it was right across the board as well. Trade concerns there. Undermining stocks. Shanghai Composite in China down 1-1/2 percent. Hang Seng in Hong Kong, down 2-1/3 percent.</p><p>Jobs in America this morning. Investors are waiting on the July jobs report. We are expecting 164,000 jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent according to economists. We have special coverage this morning. All hands on deck at 8:00 a.m. Eastern for our \"JOBS IN AMERICA\" special, where we identify where the jobs are, and where the highest-paid are as well.</p><p>Facebook, reported the focus of an antitrust probe. The FTC regulators are taking a closer look at companies, the social media giant have purchased. Those details coming up.</p><p>Then another new ice cream flavor to tell you about. Yesterday, we told you about mustard ice cream. Wait until you hear the latest frozen treat, it actually might go well with some of that mustard. We've got it for you this morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour. Government spending. The Senate passed a two-year spending deal, lifting the government's borrowing limit and raising the federal spending. The bill suspends the federal debt ceiling until 2021.</p><p>Ahead of the Senate vote yesterday, I spoke with three senators on where they stood on this legislation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are voting no. Tell us why you're putting your stance on this?</p><p>SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): The budget spends too much, it's $300 billion in new spending. There are no pay-force it's 1.7 trillion on to the debt. And we have to get a handle on the debt.</p><p>SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK): This time, the debt ceilings just being included into the budget agreement, and we're not doing anything on debt in depth. So, I think we need to at least, address it all.</p><p>SEN. MAGGIE HASSAN (D-NH): I think, all in all, it's a good bipartisan deal. It allows us to address the priorities, invest in critical priorities to support small businesses and American families. And keep our country safe, secure, and free.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely. Two out of three of those senators there voted no for the bill. Joining us right now is Americans for tax reform president and founder, Grover Norquist.</p><p>Grover, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: Absolutely, good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We were talking earlier about how this spending bill -- you know, no matter what you think about, $1 trillion deficits year after year. The spending bill is representing stimulus for this economy. What do you - - how do you see it?</p><p>NORQUIST: Well, I guess somewhat that I do worry that the continued growth of spending is obviously not good for the economy. It'd be better if the private sector was spending that money instead of having it borrowed out of the economy and spent by the government.</p><p>Way too much spending, this is the cost of losing the House of Representatives. When the Republicans had the House of Representatives and they fought against Obama, they got Obama to agree to $2 trillion reduction in his spending plans.</p><p>They got the sequester, they did a lot of damage, they ended the Obama administration in terms of new initiatives.</p><p>So, when you lose the house you lose a lot of clout in Washington, D.C. The deal they came up with, could've been a lot worse. If you'd had a Republican House, it could have been a lot better. The problem you have as the Democrats run the House and they want to spend money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are the odds that the president gets the House back next, time up?</p><p>NORQUIST: Well, we only need 18 seats for the Republicans to take the House back in 13 of those Trump won by more than six percent of the vote. So, if you have Republican energy as high as Democrat energy in 2020 as you didn't have in 2018, you could take those seats back.</p><p>It's -- you don't have to win -- you only have to win about five of the contested races. He should be able to do this, but that really means contrasting between the two parties and saying look, we kind of deal with the D.S. because we had to. But we need to do better and you need a vision not only on tax reduction and deregulation but on fixing entitlements.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I know, I only ask because he can't get anything done, Dagen. He's got to get both Houses otherwise, he can't get anything done.</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look at--look at where USMCA is right now.</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes, this --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But with this spending deal, they caved in to a Democratic House, it was only there for seven months when you still control the Senate. And you could have held --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they've got nothing done so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And you could have held him up, and said, hey, we're just raising the debt ceiling and that's all we're doing. We're going to wait and do a separate spending deal. And I'll point out to Grover's point that the Republicans need only 18 seats to retake the House. We'll heard announced yesterday.</p><p>The congressman from Texas say he's not running for re-election that's a huge loss for the Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is again happening. That's what happened last time around. People -- too many people were saying, I'm retiring.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Under the Trump administration's new tax plan, more companies could have more of an incentive to keep corporate headquarters in the U.S. though, Grover. The report in The Journal this morning that's citing the recent Mylan-Pfizer merger. Moving the corporate address back into the U.S. after Mylan moved to the Netherlands back in 2015.</p><p>Look, we all remember that moment in time during the Obama administration with so many companies, we're making acquisitions for the sole reason to move their headquarters to Ireland, Grover. That's reversing now.</p><p>NORQUIST: Well, absolutely. As we pointed out then, the reason companies were either being bought out of the United States or we're moving out of the United States was American tax policy was so destructive to any international company based in the U.S. A company was worth more headquartered in Canada than in the U.S., Burger King, just because of our stupid tax law.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NORQUIST: And we fixed that. We ended the worldwide tax system, which the rest of the world doesn't do. I mean, stupider than France is not where you want to be, but it's where we were. And we had rates higher than everybody else in the world.</p><p>So, we took the rates down, went to territorial, all of the incentives to leave the United States disappear just about overnight.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST: And the idea that these companies were not patriotic is really the disgusting thing that the Democrats said when their policies were pushing people out of the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you worry that all of the benefit from the tax cut plan is going to go away with this tariff situation? The president now going to slap another 10 percent on $300 billion in goods coming from China.</p><p>NORQUIST: The tax cut gave strong growth, higher CapEx expenditures in the United States, money flowing in the United States. These tariffs give you uncertainty, it's unhelpful to the economy. Tariffs are just taxes that on American consumers. They're not paid by Chinese people, they're paid by people in the United States consumers and businesses trying to buy things.</p><p>It is damaging. I understand what the president's trying to do in negotiating. But while he negotiates using these tariffs, this is slowing the economy from where we could be. Get a deal with China, I think that the stock market goes up, capital investment goes way up. That would get us back on track to really go into 2020 with the strong economy. Dragging it out past 2020, I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just to be clear, I think the U.S. wants to get a deal done. I think they were there, 90 percent there in May when the Chinese reneged on everything.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I think that happened again this past week when the Chinese refused to put in place. The thing is that the U.S. have as must-haves, like forced transfer of technology. I know how much you like the tax cut plan because I know that you hate taxes that are dominant and that get in the way of economic growth.</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We finally found somebody who hates taxes more than you do. Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What's been -- where has all your money gone, buddy?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taxes. Nine, 10, 1. I need to fix my houses.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But, it's OK. It's part of the game. It is --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it's not. It's not fun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not fun to what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's the worst part of the game.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Of -- is what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taxes.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The worst part of monopoly, taxes. Worst part of life. Grover, what do you think?</p><p>NORQUIST: I think this is a good teaching moment for children everywhere. My father, when we'd come back from church, we get us all ice cream -- all the kid's ice cream. He wouldn't get ice cream, but he'd come and borrow yours and say, \"One second, income tax, up sales tax, excise tax. So I had a pretty good idea of the nature of taxation at a young age.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's why you're so smart about taxes.</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes, this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, you learned it firsthand. Grover, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much.</p><p>NORQUIST: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Grover Norquist, joining us there. Meanwhile, this, Puerto Rico's governor stepping down today with no replacement in place. Cheryl Casone with the details there, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria. Ricardo Rossello is leaving office today, following a massive protest over accusations of corruption, mismanagement of funds, and the real (INAUDIBLE) and very offensive chats that went public.</p><p>Governor Rossello has nominated a veteran politician, and attorney to succeed him. But yesterday, Puerto Rico's legislature delay the confirmation votes. So, they are without a leader right now.</p><p>And is it. That thruster views against big tech companies rage on. The Federal Trade Commission is now examining Facebook's acquisitions as part of its investigation.</p><p>Wall Street Journal is reporting that the FTC is trying to determine if those acquisitions were part of a campaign to snap up potential rivals, and that, of course, would be heading off competition.</p><p>Facebook has purchased about 90 companies since 2003 including Instagram.</p><p>Taking a look at the stock, it's lower more than half a percent right now.</p><p>Oscar Mayer go on from the grill to the freezer. They are introducing, a, yes, ice dog sandwich. And it's got -- you guessed it, Frank, footer flavored ice cream. Hotdog ice cream, everybody.</p><p>Nice complement to the mustard ice cream we talked about on the show. Yesterday, Maria, Oscar Mayer's fair is definitely going to be an acquired taste for everybody, it's got real bits of candied Oscar Mayer hot dogs in it.</p><p>I'm just giving you what? Isn't it? Spicy mustard gelato in a cookie van. That's going to be serve out on the (INAUDIBLE) Mobil later this month right here in New York City.</p><p>So Geraldo's going to rush right down there. There we go, yes.</p><p>I come up with some of the most disgusting food stories this week. I'm on a roll with you right now. I don't know what it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes. Well, it a National Mustard Day yesterday, but I think it's enough with the mustard ice cream, frankly and hotdog ice cream.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is the -- this is the equivalent of Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez on Instagram and on social media, on Twitter. Again, it's like about instant gratification and attention-seeking behavior.</p><p>This is only for the attention, so they get like of 30-second clip on a news show.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, we just gave it to them.</p><p>COURTNEY: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it does.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>COURTNEY: We did. We give them the attention, but, at 6:42 in the morning, it's a little early to even think about hotdogs, nonetheless, and ice cream.</p><p>CASONE: You understand I'm going to go right now and call up the company and see if I can get.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can get you a dirty water dog in about two minutes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true. Go down -- we go right downstairs. Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>Coming up, the end of drive-through windows. Why one city wants to mix the convenience of fast-food windows? We'll tell you why.</p><p>And then, the big business in marijuana. I'm talking to one media mogul who switched careers and sees that's as did they growth industry. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The Courier Journal reports: \"I thought the world was coming to an end. One dead in Lincoln County gas explosion.\" The flames reached 300 feet and could be seen 70 miles away. One woman was killed. The inferno sent panicked community running for their lives. One neighbor said that the heat was so intense it felt like having your hand in the oven. Pretty incredible stories there.</p><p>Then, the Star Tribune this morning writes: \"Minneapolis City Council Committee votes to bans new drive-through facilities. The unanimous vote is pushing the ban one step closer to reality on the road to making Minneapolis the first U.S. city of its size to ban all drive-throughs. The full council vote is planned for August 8th. The goal: reduce vehicle noise, idling, and traffic.</p><p>And the Seattle Times says this morning: \"Plane makes emergency landing on busy Pacific Avenue South in Spanaway.\" And the apparent fuel malfunction forcing the single prop KK-2 to land unexpectedly. The pilot reportedly saying that he was fly to work when his engine stalled. A trooper noticed what was happening, slowed down traffic, federal investigators are looking into what happened.</p><p>I don't know if doing away with drive-throughs will do anything for traffic and idling, it just doesn't seem -- I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, if the left-wing Democrats want to fight climate change in the way that they're talking about, even Joe Biden, the Vice President, talked about getting rid of all fossil fuels at the debate the other night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my god.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, what is that going to do to Americans? It has lifted people out of poverty because gasoline cheap and it gives us an easy way to get to work and an easy way to get to grocery store. So, again, if you're going to send gasoline prices to, I don't know, from three bucks to $10.00 a gallon, it's going to hurt people and hurt those who can't afford it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, it doesn't make any sense that we're going to get rid of all fossil fuels within 10 years, it's not going to happen, it doesn't make sense. You have to --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not realistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We need fossil fuels for airplanes, and for cars, et cetera.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm going to be flying a bird to L.A. Like, literally, a bird.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They can't talk about the economy and jobs and other things so I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. It's too good of a story.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, from media to marijuana, my next guest talks about career change in the big business of cannabis, why he's getting in? Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. From media to marijuana, my next guest using his experience to transform a company within a growing industry that's catching a lot of attention. Joining me right now is the former publishing -- Tribune Publishing CEO and former Chicago Tribune Publisher, now Revolution Enterprises Chairman Tony Hunter. Tony, it's great to see you.</p><p>TONY HUNTER, CHAIRMAN, REVOLUTION ENTERPRISE: Great to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. And you've seen everything in the newspaper business coming from tribune and you've really been there at the time of tremendous change. Now, you're in another industry in the new time of change, tell me how this transition went?</p><p>HUNTER: Yes, might not be clear right out in the surface, Maria, but to unpack that, I would say personally, first of all, I've seen benefits of friends and family in using cannabis for medicine, whether it's for folks going through cancer treatment or the (INAUDIBLE) illnesses. So, I've witnessed it firsthand with friends and family and I have a passion for exposing that alternative medicine to more people, so I checked the box, really, on the personal level.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, cannabis works in terms of using it as medicine?</p><p>HUNTER: Yes, I believe it does and that's where we entered the market at Revolution. And then on the business side, I was looking for another mission-based company to join and industry, to join after my long career at Tribune. I was also looking for a company innovative, competitive people, high integrity people. And last to your point, you might say I'm a little overbudget in disruption with my career in publishing being disrupted --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right.</p><p>HUNTER: I'd like to take those transformation skills to a growing industry and turn from disrupted to disruptor. And it checked all those boxes for me, so it came together nicely and Revolution was the place that I really had passion for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is the growth in this industry more of about CBD products, I mean, they've become popular whether as the big-box chains, exploring, or even starting selling cannabis, CBD products or is it marijuana and legalization? This week you had Governor Cuomo in New York, decriminalizing -- legislation decriminalizing marijuana use. Where is the real growth story here?</p><p>HUNTER: I think it's in both sectors. Revolution has positioned as a health and wellness company and that broad space allows you participate with all parts of the plan. Part of our mission to be good stewards, find all of the value within the plan whether that being cannabis or which is the CBD you're talking about or the (INAUDIBLE) or in THC. But we think there's growth in both and we entered the market in the medical side and we're in Illinois now, we'll be in Florida, an Arkansas next, and then Michigan and Maryland following. So, we think there's plenty of growth in the cannabis sector and also in the CBD cannabinoid space?</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is it about cannabinoids or CBD products that have such great medicinal use?</p><p>HUNTER: Well, I think there's research now that's beginning to come out regarding the benefits. The FDA just approved a drug for kids that are having seizures and it's early.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's interesting to me when you look at the marijuana side of things, that here we are having a discussion about Juul, about vapes not being safe and yet you've got an increase usage of marijuana, and do we know that marijuana does not cause cancer?</p><p>HUNTER: Well, I think at this point, there's not research because this has been a drug that's been illegal. There's not a lot of research to indicate one way or another. What I would say is with respect to our products, we ensured that those products have high integrity, no pesticides and we're really focused on ensuring people truth in labeling. It's also a very important part of what we want.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sounds like an incredible growth story. Tony, it's great to have you. Thank you.</p><p>HUNTER: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tony Hunter. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning.

The rate will likely fall back in July, but the BBSW - which represents the short-term funding costs of the banks - appears to have moved firmly away from the levels achieved when liquidity was abundant.</p><p>More repo, or repurchasing, activity going on in the lead-up to June 30 means that cash is more expensive for market participants who have to reduce their exposures before the calendar year is ruled off. To do this they need physical cash or cash equivalents, largely for technical and regulatory reasons, but the impact of this had a pronounced effect on BBSW at the March quarter-end too.</p><p>But this time, rates experts have noticed that Australian dollar financing has become sharply more expensive than its US equivalent. This is evident in the gap between three-month BBSW and LIBOR, the benchmark for US funding, over their respective overnight rates, which is at its widest in seven years.</p><p>This can also be observed currently in foreign exchange forwards, repo rates and in the cross-currency basis swap market, which is where investors can swap floating rates between different currencies.</p><p>\"There's nothing to suggest that it's sinister just yet, we expect these things to be high as we get to quarter-end as the historical pattern shows,\" said Tamar Hamlyn, portfolio manager at fixed income boutique Ardea. \"My feeling would be that it's a bit too early for a pronounced and sustained increase, these are wholesale financial markets. Most corporates don't refinance every day, but a lot of corporate borrowing will be tied to a bank bill swap rate plus a spread.</p><p>\"If that rate remains high it is going to mean higher financing costs for anybody that's got variable rate financing in Australia, banks have to borrow money at BBSW as well.\"</p><p>The move is not being attributed to the updated composition of BBSW, which changed in May.</p><p>\"There is a global dimension to this starting with the US,\" said Nomura rates strategist Andrew Ticehurst, who observes that multinationals outside the US are holding fewer US dollars. This is a consequence of President Donald Trump's move to incentivise US firms to repatriate money sitting idle offshore. The equivalent US bank bill rate moved higher and most reference rates moved in sympathy. It also meant, according to ANZ, that big tech companies would no longer be the marginal buyers of US Treasury bills.</p><p>That global dimension is missing in the run-up to June 30, Mr Ticehurst pointed out, where the move in Australia is not being replicated to the same extent in New Zealand, Britain or the US. Some participants speculated that it was because Australian banks were inclined to raise more of their short-term financing in the domestic market instead of in the offshore market, but others believed this to be a strictly an anticipatory effect for now.</p><p>\"Australia has a large need for $A funding reflective of local funding needs and Australia's current account deficit,\" wrote Richard Grace, Commonwealth Bank's chief currency strategist, on Thursday. At the same time, Australia's US-dollar funding needs are minimal.</p><p>The volume of repo outstanding is at a record high, according to ANZ, including the usage of repo by non-resident investors, which is at 52 per cent of total outstanding repo as of March.</p><p>Key pointsAustralian dollar financing has become more expensive than its US equivalent.</p><p>Australian corporations are more reliant on local currency financing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc70oee18wyk7ibqz6cje</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM3-NB11-F0J6-J20F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Jurrien, good to see you, can that divergence continue?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIMMER</emphasis>:  Yes, you know, it's really an amazing thing that we're seeing, you know. So it's not unusual for the E.M. to lag behind the S&amp;P or even lead it but it tends to always happen when everything is going in the same direction, right. So just one cycle it's consistent with the other, but it's deeper or stronger. But what we're seeing today actually is something that I've never seen before.  </p><p>      So, earnings growth in E.M. is decelerating from, let's say 20 percent six months ago to only eight percent which is still decent but it's a very significant deceleration. And U.S. earnings growth is accelerating from 12 percent to 24 percent. So, having one actually go up and the other go down is very unusual. And when you look at prices, it's the same thing, right. So off the January highs that we said for all markets at the MSCI, E.M. index is down 19 percent, the S&amp;P is up one percent. So we have a 20 percentage point differential but it's happening in completely opposite direction. So that's really a first.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  And Jurrien, we have a chart that you brought to us that shows just that and I love this. It's hard to get a read on here otherwise. You have earnings growth is the purple line in the U.S. and then everything else is everything else. You got E.M., you got Europe, et cetera. What does that mean? Does that mean they were having like small caps and big tech lead the rally here and can that continue at some point as the rest of the world like catch up or do we drift lower?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIMMER</emphasis>:  So the U.S. cycle is very strong and it certainly got a big shot in the arm from the corporate tax cuts. So, the U.S. economy is basically booming, you know, we saw that PMIs yesterday at new highs since 2004. And the economy, I would say it's overheating but it's certainly growing very strongly that puts the Fed into play. And this is happening at a time when, you know, E.M. and Europe are OK but they're much softer and certainly China is going through a weakening cycle here.  </p><p>      And so when the U.S. is tightening policy monetarily and the rest of the world is still easy, then you get a stronger dollar, you get tightening liquidity conditions. And as you know, E.M. is always at sort of the in the crosshairs of either tightening liquidity or easing liquidity because E.M. tends to borrow in dollars, they tend to borrow a lot. So as the dollar goes off, liquidity conditions tightened.  </p><p>      So, this is a tale of two cycles sort of mind the gap if you will between the two. Eventually, the gap will resolve when the markets starts to see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of when the Fed is going to be done with its tightening cycle and when the ECB and other central banks get closer and closer to the end of their easing cycle. But we're not really there yet and I don't suspect that we'll be there for the next really 3-6 months at the earliest.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So Jurrien, as you were speaking as we put up a chart that illustrated the fact that now the balance sheets of the central banks has started to come off. And so that start with the tightness, I think global liquidity's tightening up at the same time. That necessarily exacerbates what we're seeing with E.M. because that tends to strengthen the dollar. Is it possible that Fed might actually take this through account and slow down a little bit on what is called normalization?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIMMER</emphasis>:  Not yet, I don't think. So, we at least (ph) in 2015 into early 2016, where we had a similar divergence between the U.S. and E.M. and that was centered around China, of course, China love capital flight, because, again, it was importing this stronger dollar from the U.S. and China's currency of course is linked to the U.S. dollar. And at that point we had the so called Shanghai accord and nobody really knows if it actually ever happened, but in early '16, the Fed started to back off by slowing down its hawkish forward guidance.  </p><p>      And, you know, the irony is is that the Fed basically eased by tightening less quickly than it said it was going to. So it's always a reminder that flow is what drives the market, not the level. It's the rate of change. But at this point we're 2.5 years later further into the cycle. We're closer and closer to late cycle. I don't think the Fed has the luxury of just saying, you know what, we're going to hold off here for six months. I think we're close enough towards late cycle that the Fed doesn't feel it has the luxury that it had 2.5 years ago to just pause. And if it doesn't have that luxury, that means it's going to keep raising rates, maybe another three or four over the next 12 to 18 months. And what the ECB is still kind of not starting its taper, let alone actually shrinking its balance sheet, that create still this policy divergence.  </p><p>      And, you know, to the point about central bank balance sheets, we look at the big for balance sheets, their assets relative to the debt of the countries is peaking at about 36 percent. Three years from now it's likely to be about 31 percent, so we are going slowly towards that more global tightening regime.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIMMER</emphasis>:  And what that does to term premiums and risk premiums everywhere is a big question more often.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  So Jurrien, quickly, where is the value though in E.M.? What's getting taken out to the wood shed that shouldn't be?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIMMER</emphasis>:  Well, I mean even within China there's a lot of different sectors. You know, India is a great story but it's very expensive, it's actually more expensive than the U.S. Russia's trading at a six P.E. but, you know, it's Russia. So, there are always values but I think it's more on the sector basis.  </p><p>      So if you can buy a solid consumer kind of Staples Company in China, you know there's going to be a market for that, but those stocks even when E.M. had sold off in the past had been relatively expensive. So you have to go into the cyclical side and playoff of, you know, the copper energy and metals materials and then you get into sort of the countries that produce commodities for China.  </p><p>      But China is the key here. It's slowing. The Chinese policymakers are starting to ease fiscally, monetarily. China goes through this two-year cycle and we're kind of getting to the bottom of it. So, at some point we're going to get a policy response out of China that will start lifting the growth rates over there and maybe that's when this pick up between E.M. and the U.S. market starts to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity Investments will be staying with us.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So Jurrien, if that plays out that way, I mean deregulations still here. We have the tax cut don't seem to be going away. What differences it make to their ordinary investor whether in fact the Democrats take the house?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIMMER</emphasis>:  Yes. I don't think it makes a big difference. As you said, you know, we have the tax cuts, the deregulation or the lesser enforcement of existing regulations is already happening. It's likely to continue to happen. And trade obviously is likely to continue to be an issue especially into the next presidential election cycle. I do think it's a political issue.  </p><p>      So I don't really see anything really changing from the markets perspective, because those are the things that the markets care about things that affect the economy. And so in that sense, a lot has already been done and if there's a lame duck, you know, situation over the next two years, I don't think it really hurts the market. It's not like there's something that really needs to happen that won't happen in terms of the economy.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Jurrien, what about trade and specifically Canada when it comes to NAFTA because there are a lot of Republicans as well as Democrats right now who are saying they are not happy with the notion of leaving Canada out and there are arguments -- good arguments that the president can do that by himself?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIMMER</emphasis>:  Yes, you know, I mean it's hard to really know what is real and what isn't anymore. So, if Canada walks away one day, that doesn't mean there won't be a deal a week later. So, I don't know how to handicap that, but I think, you know, the U.S. certainly is playing from a position of strength right now and I think, you know, the White House is taking full advantage of that. But, you know, I don't really know how that's going to play out but my guess is that ultimately there will be bilateral deals, maybe not a NAFTA deal but certainly a country to country deal.  </p><p>      But, you know, that's going to be here six months from now as it is now and I don't think those issues are going to go away very soon, and even if there's a Canada deal, the issues with China will probably linger on for some time because that's much more of a bigger stage in terms of this whole trade chess game if you will. But, you know, ultimately I think what is going to really drive the markets over the next 12-18 months is the Fed and how far do they go and at what point do they declare victory and say, you know what, we've tightened enough. And that's something that nobody knows and ultimately it will be driven by inflation and whether that starts to really accelerate or not.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  OK, Jason Draho of UBS Global Wealth Management thank you so much. Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity is going to be staying with us.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So, Jurrien, I'm going to put up chart here actually. It shows the U.S. monthly trade balance over time and this was as of last month of about 57 -- $47 billion is going to be farther to the south and (ph) $50 billion over to the far right. But, does this illustrate something fundamental with the economy? We talked about how it's really going gang busters, the U.S. economy, but aren't we doing that by borrowing money? And as of a practical manner by borrowing money, doesn't that almost inshore trade balance deficit?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIMMER</emphasis>:  Yes. I mean, you know, trade balances are not necessarily bad. I mean, the U.S. is a strong economy that's very much a consumption driven economy. It's about 70 percent of GDP. And so, it kind of makes sense that if goods are produced cheaper elsewhere that we would buy them from there and that would create a trade deficit and then those dollars get recycled and you end up with, you know, China holding treasury bonds as far as their F.X. reserves. And you see historically a very strong correlation with when foreign exchange reserves rise which happens when there's trade, it tends to boost E.M.  </p><p>      So right now, you know, reserves are falling, they're still growing but at a decelerating pace. And that's how I would describe the global economy. You know, the global economy is growing but in the U.S. it's growing and acceleration and in the rest of the world it's growing and decelerating.  </p><p>      So, especially when you have these divergent cycles in place, you're going to see some of these numbers sort of pop out as they have.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIMMER</emphasis>:  And, again, as I said earlier, ultimately, how this cycle converges again is really the big question, you know, does the U.S. fall and catch up to the rest of the world or does the rest of the world catch up by going up?  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Fair point. Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity and Bloomberg's Michael McKee thank you very much.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6N-D3W1-F15W-H4YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

And at that point we had the so called Shanghai accord and nobody really knows if it actually ever happened, but in early '16, the Fed started to back off by slowing down its hawkish forward guidance.</p><p>And, you know, the irony is is that the Fed basically eased by tightening less quickly than it said it was going to. So it's always a reminder that flow is what drives the market, not the level. It's the rate of change. But at this point we're 2.5 years later further into the cycle. We're closer and closer to late cycle. I don't think the Fed has the luxury of just saying, you know what, we're going to hold off here for six months. I think we're close enough towards late cycle that the Fed doesn't feel it has the luxury that it had 2.5 years ago to just pause. And if it doesn't have that luxury, that means it's going to keep raising rates, maybe another three or four over the next 12 to 18 months. And what the ECB is still kind of not starting its taper, let alone actually shrinking its balance sheet, that create still this policy divergence.</p><p>And, you know, to the point about central bank balance sheets, we look at the big for balance sheets, their assets relative to the debt of the countries is peaking at about 36 percent. Three years from now it's likely to be about 31 percent, so we are going slowly towards that more global tightening regime.</p><p>STEEL: Right.</p><p>TIMMER: And what that does to term premiums and risk premiums everywhere is a big question more often.</p><p>STEEL: So Jurrien, quickly, where is the value though in E.M.? What's getting taken out to the wood shed that shouldn't be?</p><p>TIMMER: Well, I mean even within China there's a lot of different sectors. You know, India is a great story but it's very expensive, it's actually more expensive than the U.S.Russia's trading at a six P.E. but, you know, it's Russia. So, there are always values but I think it's more on the sector basis.</p><p>So if you can buy a solid consumer kind of Staples Company in China, you know there's going to be a market for that, but those stocks even when E.M. had sold off in the past had been relatively expensive. So you have to go into the cyclical side and playoff of, you know, the copper energy and metals materials and then you get into sort of the countries that produce commodities for China.</p><p>But China is the key here. It's slowing. The Chinese policymakers are starting to ease fiscally, monetarily. China goes through this two-year cycle and we're kind of getting to the bottom of it. So, at some point we're going to get a policy response out of China that will start lifting the growth rates over there and maybe that's when this pick up between E.M. and the U.S. market starts to close.</p><p>WESTIN: Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity Investments will be staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: So Jurrien, if that plays out that way, I mean deregulations still here. We have the tax cut don't seem to be going away. What differences it make to their ordinary investor whether in fact the Democrats take the house?</p><p>TIMMER: Yes. I don't think it makes a big difference. As you said, you know, we have the tax cuts, the deregulation or the lesser enforcement of existing regulations is already happening. It's likely to continue to happen. And trade obviously is likely to continue to be an issue especially into the next presidential election cycle. I do think it's a political issue.</p><p>So I don't really see anything really changing from the markets perspective, because those are the things that the markets care about things that affect the economy. And so in that sense, a lot has already been done and if there's a lame duck, you know, situation over the next two years, I don't think it really hurts the market. It's not like there's something that really needs to happen that won't happen in terms of the economy.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: Jurrien, what about trade and specifically Canada when it comes to NAFTA because there are a lot of Republicans as well as Democrats right now who are saying they are not happy with the notion of leaving Canada out and there are arguments -- good arguments that the president can do that by himself?</p><p>TIMMER: Yes, you know, I mean it's hard to really know what is real and what isn't anymore. So, if Canada walks away one day, that doesn't mean there won't be a deal a week later. So, I don't know how to handicap that, but I think, you know, the U.S. certainly is playing from a position of strength right now and I think, you know, the White House is taking full advantage of that. But, you know, I don't really know how that's going to play out but my guess is that ultimately there will be bilateral deals, maybe not a NAFTA deal but certainly a country to country deal.</p><p>But, you know, that's going to be here six months from now as it is now and I don't think those issues are going to go away very soon, and even if there's a Canada deal, the issues with China will probably linger on for some time because that's much more of a bigger stage in terms of this whole trade chess game if you will. But, you know, ultimately I think what is going to really drive the markets over the next 12-18 months is the Fed and how far do they go and at what point do they declare victory and say, you know what, we've tightened enough. And that's something that nobody knows and ultimately it will be driven by inflation and whether that starts to really accelerate or not.</p><p>WESTIN: OK, Jason Draho of UBS Global Wealth Management thank you so much. Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity is going to be staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: So, Jurrien, I'm going to put up chart here actually. It shows the U.S. monthly trade balance over time and this was as of last month of about 57 -- $47 billion is going to be farther to the south and (ph) $50 billion over to the far right. But, does this illustrate something fundamental with the economy? We talked about how it's really going gang busters, the U.S. economy, but aren't we doing that by borrowing money? And as of a practical manner by borrowing money, doesn't that almost inshore trade balance deficit?</p><p>TIMMER: Yes. I mean, you know, trade balances are not necessarily bad. I mean, the U.S. is a strong economy that's very much a consumption driven economy. It's about 70 percent of GDP. And so, it kind of makes sense that if goods are produced cheaper elsewhere that we would buy them from there and that would create a trade deficit and then those dollars get recycled and you end up with, you know, China holding treasury bonds as far as their F.X. reserves. And you see historically a very strong correlation with when foreign exchange reserves rise which happens when there's trade, it tends to boost E.M.</p><p>So right now, you know, reserves are falling, they're still growing but at a decelerating pace. And that's how I would describe the global economy. You know, the global economy is growing but in the U.S. it's growing and acceleration and in the rest of the world it's growing and decelerating.</p><p>So, especially when you have these divergent cycles in place, you're going to see some of these numbers sort of pop out as they have.</p><p>STEEL: Yes.</p><p>TIMMER: And, again, as I said earlier, ultimately, how this cycle converges again is really the big question, you know, does the U.S. fall and catch up to the rest of the world or does the rest of the world catch up by going up?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>STEEL: Fair point.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Joining us from Boston is Jurrien Timmmer,  Fidelity Investments Director of a Global Macro.  Jurrien, good to see you,  can that divergence continue?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JURRIEN TIMMER, DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL MACRO, FIDELITY INVESTMENT:  Yes, you  know, it's really an amazing thing that we're seeing, you know.  So it's  not unusual for the E.M. to lag behind the S&amp;P or even lead it but it tends  to always happen when everything is going in the same direction, right.  So  just one cycle it's consistent with the other, but it's deeper or stronger.   But what we're seeing today actually is something that I've never seen  before.</p><p>So, earnings growth in E.M. is decelerating from, let's say 20 percent six  months ago to only eight percent which is still decent but it's a very  significant deceleration.  And U.S. earnings growth is accelerating from 12  percent to 24 percent.  So, having one actually go up and the other go down  is very unusual.  And when you look at prices, it's the same thing, right.   So off the January highs that we said for all markets at the MSCI, E.M.  index is down 19 percent, the S&amp;P is up one percent.  So we have a 20  percentage point differential but it's happening in completely opposite  direction.  So that's really a first.</p><p>STEEL:  And Jurrien, we have a chart that you brought to us that shows just  that and I love this.  It's hard to get a read on here otherwise.  You have  earnings growth is the purple line in the U.S. and then everything else is  everything else.  You got E.M., you got Europe, et cetera.  What does that  mean?  Does that mean they were having like small caps and big tech lead  the rally here and can that continue at some point as the rest of the world  like catch up or do we drift lower?</p><p>TIMMER:  So the U.S. cycle is very strong and it certainly got a big shot  in the arm from the corporate tax cuts.  So, the U.S. economy is basically  booming, you know, we saw that PMIs yesterday at new highs since 2004.  And  the economy, I would say it's overheating but it's certainly growing very  strongly that puts the Fed into play.  And this is happening at a time  when, you know, E.M. and Europe are OK but they're much softer and  certainly China is going through a weakening cycle here.</p><p>And so when the U.S. is tightening policy monetarily and the rest of the  world is still easy, then you get a stronger dollar, you get tightening  liquidity conditions.  And as you know, E.M. is always at sort of the in  the crosshairs of either tightening liquidity or easing liquidity because  E.M. tends to borrow in dollars, they tend to borrow a lot.  So as the  dollar goes off, liquidity conditions tightened.</p><p>So, this is a tale of two cycles sort of mind the gap if you will between  the two.  Eventually, the gap will resolve when the markets starts to see  the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of when the Fed is going to be  done with its tightening cycle and when the ECB and other central banks get  closer and closer to the end of their easing cycle.  But we're not really  there yet and I don't suspect that we'll be there for the next really 3-6  months at the earliest.</p><p>DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  So Jurrien, as you were speaking as we put  up a chart that illustrated the fact that now the balance sheets of the  central banks has started to come off.  And so that start with the  tightness, I think global liquidity's tightening up at the same time.  That  necessarily exacerbates what we're seeing with E.M. because that tends to  strengthen the dollar.  Is it possible that Fed might actually take this  through account and slow down a little bit on what is called normalization?</p><p>TIMMER:  Not yet, I don't think.  So, we at least (ph) in 2015 into early  2016, where we had a similar divergence between the U.S. and E.M. and that  was centered around China, of course, China love capital flight, because,  again, it was importing this stronger dollar from the U.S. and China's  currency of course is linked to the U.S. dollar.  And at that point we had  the so called Shanghai accord and nobody really knows if it actually ever  happened, but in early '16, the Fed started to back off by slowing down its  hawkish forward guidance.</p><p>And, you know, the irony is is that the Fed basically eased by tightening  less quickly than it said it was going to.  So it's always a reminder that  flow is what drives the market, not the level.  It's the rate of change.   But at this point we're 2.5 years later further into the cycle.  We're  closer and closer to late cycle.  I don't think the Fed has the luxury of  just saying, you know what, we're going to hold off here for six months.  I  think we're close enough towards late cycle that the Fed doesn't feel it  has the luxury that it had 2.5 years ago to just pause.  And if it doesn't  have that luxury, that means it's going to keep raising rates, maybe  another three or four over the next 12 to 18 months.  And what the ECB is  still kind of not starting its taper, let alone actually shrinking its  balance sheet, that create still this policy divergence.</p><p>And, you know, to the point about central bank balance sheets, we look at  the big for balance sheets, their assets relative to the debt of the  countries is peaking at about 36 percent.  Three years from now it's likely  to be about 31 percent, so we are going slowly towards that more global  tightening regime.</p><p>STEEL:  Right.</p><p>TIMMER:  And what that does to term premiums and risk premiums everywhere  is a big question more often.</p><p>STEEL:  So Jurrien, quickly, where is the value though in E.M.?  What's  getting taken out to the wood shed that shouldn't be?</p><p>TIMMER:  Well, I mean even within China there's a lot of different sectors.   You know, India is a great story but it's very expensive, it's actually  more expensive than the U.S.  Russia's trading at a six P.E. but, you know,  it's Russia.  So, there are always values but I think it's more on the  sector basis.</p><p>So if you can buy a solid consumer kind of Staples Company in China, you  know there's going to be a market for that, but those stocks even when E.M.  had sold off in the past had been relatively expensive.

So, at some point  we're going to get a policy response out of China that will start lifting  the growth rates over there and maybe that's when this pick up between E.M.  and the U.S. market starts to close.</p><p>WESTIN:  Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity Investments will be staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN:  So Jurrien, if that plays out that way, I mean deregulations still  here.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Joining us from Boston is Jurrien Timmmer, Fidelity Investments Director of a Global Macro. Jurrien, good to see you, can that divergence continue?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JURRIEN TIMMER, DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL MACRO, FIDELITY INVESTMENT: Yes, you know, it's really an amazing thing that we're seeing, you know. So it's not unusual for the E.M. to lag behind the S&amp;P or even lead it but it tends to always happen when everything is going in the same direction, right. So just one cycle it's consistent with the other, but it's deeper or stronger. But what we're seeing today actually is something that I've never seen before.</p><p>So, earnings growth in E.M. is decelerating from, let's say 20 percent six months ago to only eight percent which is still decent but it's a very significant deceleration. And U.S. earnings growth is accelerating from 12 percent to 24 percent. So, having one actually go up and the other go down is very unusual. And when you look at prices, it's the same thing, right. So off the January highs that we said for all markets at the MSCI, E.M. index is down 19 percent, the S&amp;P is up one percent. So we have a 20 percentage point differential but it's happening in completely opposite direction. So that's really a first.</p><p>STEEL: And Jurrien, we have a chart that you brought to us that shows just that and I love this. It's hard to get a read on here otherwise. You have earnings growth is the purple line in the U.S. and then everything else is everything else. You got E.M., you got Europe, et cetera. What does that mean? Does that mean they were having like small caps and big tech lead the rally here and can that continue at some point as the rest of the world like catch up or do we drift lower?</p><p>TIMMER: So the U.S. cycle is very strong and it certainly got a big shot in the arm from the corporate tax cuts. So, the U.S. economy is basically booming, you know, we saw that PMIs yesterday at new highs since 2004. And the economy, I would say it's overheating but it's certainly growing very strongly that puts the Fed into play. And this is happening at a time when, you know, E.M. and Europe are OK but they're much softer and certainly China is going through a weakening cycle here.</p><p>And so when the U.S. is tightening policy monetarily and the rest of the world is still easy, then you get a stronger dollar, you get tightening liquidity conditions. And as you know, E.M. is always at sort of the in the crosshairs of either tightening liquidity or easing liquidity because E.M. tends to borrow in dollars, they tend to borrow a lot. So as the dollar goes off, liquidity conditions tightened.</p><p>So, this is a tale of two cycles sort of mind the gap if you will between the two. Eventually, the gap will resolve when the markets starts to see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of when the Fed is going to be done with its tightening cycle and when the ECB and other central banks get closer and closer to the end of their easing cycle. But we're not really there yet and I don't suspect that we'll be there for the next really 3-6 months at the earliest.</p><p>DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: So Jurrien, as you were speaking as we put up a chart that illustrated the fact that now the balance sheets of the central banks has started to come off. And so that start with the tightness, I think global liquidity's tightening up at the same time. That necessarily exacerbates what we're seeing with E.M. because that tends to strengthen the dollar. Is it possible that Fed might actually take this through account and slow down a little bit on what is called normalization?</p><p>TIMMER: Not yet, I don't think. So, we at least (ph) in 2015 into early 2016, where we had a similar divergence between the U.S. and E.M. and that was centered around China, of course, China love capital flight, because, again, it was importing this stronger dollar from the U.S. and China's currency of course is linked to the U.S. dollar. And at that point we had the so called Shanghai accord and nobody really knows if it actually ever happened, but in early '16, the Fed started to back off by slowing down its hawkish forward guidance.</p><p>And, you know, the irony is is that the Fed basically eased by tightening less quickly than it said it was going to. So it's always a reminder that flow is what drives the market, not the level. It's the rate of change. But at this point we're 2.5 years later further into the cycle. We're closer and closer to late cycle. I don't think the Fed has the luxury of just saying, you know what, we're going to hold off here for six months. I think we're close enough towards late cycle that the Fed doesn't feel it has the luxury that it had 2.5 years ago to just pause. And if it doesn't have that luxury, that means it's going to keep raising rates, maybe another three or four over the next 12 to 18 months. And what the ECB is still kind of not starting its taper, let alone actually shrinking its balance sheet, that create still this policy divergence.</p><p>And, you know, to the point about central bank balance sheets, we look at the big for balance sheets, their assets relative to the debt of the countries is peaking at about 36 percent. Three years from now it's likely to be about 31 percent, so we are going slowly towards that more global tightening regime.</p><p>STEEL: Right.</p><p>TIMMER: And what that does to term premiums and risk premiums everywhere is a big question more often.</p><p>STEEL: So Jurrien, quickly, where is the value though in E.M.? What's getting taken out to the wood shed that shouldn't be?</p><p>TIMMER: Well, I mean even within China there's a lot of different sectors. You know, India is a great story but it's very expensive, it's actually more expensive than the U.S.Russia's trading at a six P.E. but, you know, it's Russia. So, there are always values but I think it's more on the sector basis.</p><p>So if you can buy a solid consumer kind of Staples Company in China, you know there's going to be a market for that, but those stocks even when E.M. had sold off in the past had been relatively expensive. So you have to go into the cyclical side and playoff of, you know, the copper energy and metals materials and then you get into sort of the countries that produce commodities for China.</p><p>But China is the key here. It's slowing. The Chinese policymakers are starting to ease fiscally, monetarily. China goes through this two-year cycle and we're kind of getting to the bottom of it. So, at some point we're going to get a policy response out of China that will start lifting the growth rates over there and maybe that's when this pick up between E.M. and the U.S. market starts to close.</p><p>WESTIN: Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity Investments will be staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: So Jurrien, if that plays out that way, I mean deregulations still here. We have the tax cut don't seem to be going away. What differences it make to their ordinary investor whether in fact the Democrats take the house?</p><p>TIMMER: Yes. I don't think it makes a big difference. As you said, you know, we have the tax cuts, the deregulation or the lesser enforcement of existing regulations is already happening. It's likely to continue to happen. And trade obviously is likely to continue to be an issue especially into the next presidential election cycle. I do think it's a political issue.</p><p>So I don't really see anything really changing from the markets perspective, because those are the things that the markets care about things that affect the economy. And so in that sense, a lot has already been done and if there's a lame duck, you know, situation over the next two years, I don't think it really hurts the market. It's not like there's something that really needs to happen that won't happen in terms of the economy.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: Jurrien, what about trade and specifically Canada when it comes to NAFTA because there are a lot of Republicans as well as Democrats right now who are saying they are not happy with the notion of leaving Canada out and there are arguments -- good arguments that the president can do that by himself?</p><p>TIMMER: Yes, you know, I mean it's hard to really know what is real and what isn't anymore. So, if Canada walks away one day, that doesn't mean there won't be a deal a week later. So, I don't know how to handicap that, but I think, you know, the U.S. certainly is playing from a position of strength right now and I think, you know, the White House is taking full advantage of that. But, you know, I don't really know how that's going to play out but my guess is that ultimately there will be bilateral deals, maybe not a NAFTA deal but certainly a country to country deal.</p><p>But, you know, that's going to be here six months from now as it is now and I don't think those issues are going to go away very soon, and even if there's a Canada deal, the issues with China will probably linger on for some time because that's much more of a bigger stage in terms of this whole trade chess game if you will. But, you know, ultimately I think what is going to really drive the markets over the next 12-18 months is the Fed and how far do they go and at what point do they declare victory and say, you know what, we've tightened enough. And that's something that nobody knows and ultimately it will be driven by inflation and whether that starts to really accelerate or not.</p><p>WESTIN: OK, Jason Draho of UBS Global Wealth Management thank you so much. Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity is going to be staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>WESTIN: So, Jurrien, I'm going to put up chart here actually. It shows the U.S. monthly trade balance over time and this was as of last month of about 57 -- $47 billion is going to be farther to the south and (ph) $50 billion over to the far right. But, does this illustrate something fundamental with the economy? We talked about how it's really going gang busters, the U.S. economy, but aren't we doing that by borrowing money? And as of a practical manner by borrowing money, doesn't that almost inshore trade balance deficit?</p><p>TIMMER: Yes. I mean, you know, trade balances are not necessarily bad. I mean, the U.S. is a strong economy that's very much a consumption driven economy. It's about 70 percent of GDP. And so, it kind of makes sense that if goods are produced cheaper elsewhere that we would buy them from there and that would create a trade deficit and then those dollars get recycled and you end up with, you know, China holding treasury bonds as far as their F.X. reserves. And you see historically a very strong correlation with when foreign exchange reserves rise which happens when there's trade, it tends to boost E.M.</p><p>So right now, you know, reserves are falling, they're still growing but at a decelerating pace. And that's how I would describe the global economy. You know, the global economy is growing but in the U.S. it's growing and acceleration and in the rest of the world it's growing and decelerating.</p><p>So, especially when you have these divergent cycles in place, you're going to see some of these numbers sort of pop out as they have.</p><p>STEEL: Yes.</p><p>TIMMER: And, again, as I said earlier, ultimately, how this cycle converges again is really the big question, you know, does the U.S. fall and catch up to the rest of the world or does the rest of the world catch up by going up?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>STEEL: Fair point. Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity and Bloomberg's Michael McKee thank you very much.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Joining us from Boston is Jurrien Timmmer,  Fidelity Investments Director of a Global Macro.  Jurrien, good to see you,  can that divergence continue?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> JURRIEN TIMMER, DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL MACRO, FIDELITY INVESTMENT:  Yes, you  know, it's really an amazing thing that we're seeing, you know.  So it's  not unusual for the E.M. to lag behind the S&amp;P or even lead it but it tends  to always happen when everything is going in the same direction, right.  So  just one cycle it's consistent with the other, but it's deeper or stronger.   But what we're seeing today actually is something that I've never seen  before.</p><p> So, earnings growth in E.M. is decelerating from, let's say 20 percent six  months ago to only eight percent which is still decent but it's a very  significant deceleration.  And U.S. earnings growth is accelerating from 12  percent to 24 percent.  So, having one actually go up and the other go down  is very unusual.  And when you look at prices, it's the same thing, right.   So off the January highs that we said for all markets at the MSCI, E.M.  index is down 19 percent, the S&amp;P is up one percent.  So we have a 20  percentage point differential but it's happening in completely opposite  direction.  So that's really a first.</p><p> STEEL:  And Jurrien, we have a chart that you brought to us that shows just  that and I love this.  It's hard to get a read on here otherwise.  You have  earnings growth is the purple line in the U.S. and then everything else is  everything else.  You got E.M., you got Europe, et cetera.  What does that  mean?  Does that mean they were having like small caps and big tech lead  the rally here and can that continue at some point as the rest of the world  like catch up or do we drift lower?</p><p> TIMMER:  So the U.S. cycle is very strong and it certainly got a big shot  in the arm from the corporate tax cuts.  So, the U.S. economy is basically  booming, you know, we saw that PMIs yesterday at new highs since 2004.  And  the economy, I would say it's overheating but it's certainly growing very  strongly that puts the Fed into play.  And this is happening at a time  when, you know, E.M. and Europe are OK but they're much softer and  certainly China is going through a weakening cycle here.</p><p> And so when the U.S. is tightening policy monetarily and the rest of the  world is still easy, then you get a stronger dollar, you get tightening  liquidity conditions.  And as you know, E.M. is always at sort of the in  the crosshairs of either tightening liquidity or easing liquidity because  E.M. tends to borrow in dollars, they tend to borrow a lot.  So as the  dollar goes off, liquidity conditions tightened.</p><p> So, this is a tale of two cycles sort of mind the gap if you will between  the two.  Eventually, the gap will resolve when the markets starts to see  the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of when the Fed is going to be  done with its tightening cycle and when the ECB and other central banks get  closer and closer to the end of their easing cycle.  But we're not really  there yet and I don't suspect that we'll be there for the next really 3-6  months at the earliest.</p><p> DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  So Jurrien, as you were speaking as we put  up a chart that illustrated the fact that now the balance sheets of the  central banks has started to come off.  And so that start with the  tightness, I think global liquidity's tightening up at the same time.  That  necessarily exacerbates what we're seeing with E.M. because that tends to  strengthen the dollar.  Is it possible that Fed might actually take this  through account and slow down a little bit on what is called normalization?</p><p> TIMMER:  Not yet, I don't think.  So, we at least (ph) in 2015 into early  2016, where we had a similar divergence between the U.S. and E.M. and that  was centered around China, of course, China love capital flight, because,  again, it was importing this stronger dollar from the U.S. and China's  currency of course is linked to the U.S. dollar.  And at that point we had  the so called Shanghai accord and nobody really knows if it actually ever  happened, but in early '16, the Fed started to back off by slowing down its  hawkish forward guidance.</p><p> And, you know, the irony is is that the Fed basically eased by tightening  less quickly than it said it was going to.  So it's always a reminder that  flow is what drives the market, not the level.  It's the rate of change.   But at this point we're 2.5 years later further into the cycle.  We're  closer and closer to late cycle.  I don't think the Fed has the luxury of  just saying, you know what, we're going to hold off here for six months.  I  think we're close enough towards late cycle that the Fed doesn't feel it  has the luxury that it had 2.5 years ago to just pause.  And if it doesn't  have that luxury, that means it's going to keep raising rates, maybe  another three or four over the next 12 to 18 months.  And what the ECB is  still kind of not starting its taper, let alone actually shrinking its  balance sheet, that create still this policy divergence.</p><p> And, you know, to the point about central bank balance sheets, we look at  the big for balance sheets, their assets relative to the debt of the  countries is peaking at about 36 percent.  Three years from now it's likely  to be about 31 percent, so we are going slowly towards that more global  tightening regime.</p><p> STEEL:  Right.</p><p> TIMMER:  And what that does to term premiums and risk premiums everywhere  is a big question more often.</p><p> STEEL:  So Jurrien, quickly, where is the value though in E.M.?  What's  getting taken out to the wood shed that shouldn't be?</p><p> TIMMER:  Well, I mean even within China there's a lot of different sectors.   You know, India is a great story but it's very expensive, it's actually  more expensive than the U.S.Russia's trading at a six P.E. but, you know,  it's Russia.  So, there are always values but I think it's more on the  sector basis.</p><p> So if you can buy a solid consumer kind of Staples Company in China, you  know there's going to be a market for that, but those stocks even when E.M.  had sold off in the past had been relatively expensive.  So you have to go  into the cyclical side and playoff of, you know, the copper energy and  metals materials and then you get into sort of the countries that produce  commodities for China.</p><p> But China is the key here.  It's slowing.  The Chinese policymakers are  starting to ease fiscally, monetarily.  China goes through this two-year  cycle and we're kind of getting to the bottom of it.  So, at some point  we're going to get a policy response out of China that will start lifting  the growth rates over there and maybe that's when this pick up between E.M.  and the U.S. market starts to close.</p><p> WESTIN:  Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity Investments will be staying with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> WESTIN:  So Jurrien, if that plays out that way, I mean deregulations still  here.  We have the tax cut don't seem to be going away.  What differences  it make to their ordinary investor whether in fact the Democrats take the  house?</p><p> TIMMER:  Yes.  I don't think it makes a big difference.  As you said, you  know, we have the tax cuts, the deregulation or the lesser enforcement of  existing regulations is already happening.  It's likely to continue to  happen.  And trade obviously is likely to continue to be an issue  especially into the next presidential election cycle.  I do think it's a  political issue.</p><p> So I don't really see anything really changing from the markets  perspective, because those are the things that the markets care about  things that affect the economy.  And so in that sense, a lot has already  been done and if there's a lame duck, you know, situation over the next two  years, I don't think it really hurts the market.  It's not like there's  something that really needs to happen that won't happen in terms of the  economy.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> WESTIN:  Jurrien, what about trade and specifically Canada when it comes to  NAFTA because there are a lot of Republicans as well as Democrats right now  who are saying they are not happy with the notion of leaving Canada out and  there are arguments -- good arguments that the president can do that by  himself?</p><p> TIMMER:  Yes, you know, I mean it's hard to really know what is real and  what isn't anymore.  So, if Canada walks away one day, that doesn't mean  there won't be a deal a week later.  So, I don't know how to handicap that,  but I think, you know, the U.S. certainly is playing from a position of  strength right now and I think, you know, the White House is taking full  advantage of that.  But, you know, I don't really know how that's going to  play out but my guess is that ultimately there will be bilateral deals,  maybe not a NAFTA deal but certainly a country to country deal.</p><p> But, you know, that's going to be here six months from now as it is now and  I don't think those issues are going to go away very soon, and even if  there's a Canada deal, the issues with China will probably linger on for  some time because that's much more of a bigger stage in terms of this whole  trade chess game if you will.  But, you know, ultimately I think what is  going to really drive the markets over the next 12-18 months is the Fed and  how far do they go and at what point do they declare victory and say, you  know what, we've tightened enough.  And that's something that nobody knows  and ultimately it will be driven by inflation and whether that starts to  really accelerate or not.</p><p> WESTIN:  OK, Jason Draho of UBS Global Wealth Management thank you so much.   Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity is going to be staying with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> WESTIN:  So, Jurrien, I'm going to put up chart here actually.  It shows  the U.S. monthly trade balance over time and this was as of last month of  about 57 -- $47 billion is going to be farther to the south and (ph) $50  billion over to the far right.  But, does this illustrate something  fundamental with the economy?  We talked about how it's really going gang  busters, the U.S. economy, but aren't we doing that by borrowing money?   And as of a practical manner by borrowing money, doesn't that almost  inshore trade balance deficit?</p><p> TIMMER:  Yes.  I mean, you know, trade balances are not necessarily bad.  I  mean, the U.S. is a strong economy that's very much a consumption driven  economy.  It's about 70 percent of GDP.  And so, it kind of makes sense  that if goods are produced cheaper elsewhere that we would buy them from  there and that would create a trade deficit and then those dollars get  recycled and you end up with, you know, China holding treasury bonds as far  as their F.X. reserves.  And you see historically a very strong correlation  with when foreign exchange reserves rise which happens when there's trade,  it tends to boost E.M.</p><p> So right now, you know, reserves are falling, they're still growing but at  a decelerating pace.  And that's how I would describe the global economy.   You know, the global economy is growing but in the U.S. it's growing and  acceleration and in the rest of the world it's growing and decelerating.</p><p> So, especially when you have these divergent cycles in place, you're going  to see some of these numbers sort of pop out as they have.</p><p> STEEL:  Yes.</p><p> TIMMER:  And, again, as I said earlier, ultimately, how this cycle  converges again is really the big question, you know, does the U.S. fall  and catch up to the rest of the world or does the rest of the world catch  up by going up?</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> STEEL:  Fair point.  Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity and Bloomberg's Michael  McKee thank you very much.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

As its owner becomes the richest man on the planet, John Arlidge asks whether the price of convenience is too high Most people who get offthe train in Cambridge head straight to the River Cam for a punt and a stroll past the colleges and laboratories where DNA, embryonic stem cells and much else besides were discovered. Few notice the building opposite the station. With its dull beige walls and green windows, it's no King's College Chapel, but this is where the hi-tech innovations that are changing our lives in once-unimaginable ways are being dreamt up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the secret labs on the top floor, with windows frosted to protect from prying eyes, Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled electronic \"assistant\", learns how to respond to our questions and commands. Alexa is the device that has kick-started the latest arms race in tech: voice-controlled and -operated smart devices.</p><p>Look higher still and you will soon see drones flying over the roof of the Amazon Cambridge Development Centre, to give the building its proper name. These aircraft, which will deliver a six-pack of beer direct to your garden in half an hour or less when the barbecue is running dry, are being designed and tested here by British scientists.</p><p>\"We're right out at the edge of what you can do with technology,\" David Hardcastle, the centre's director, says, although the test drone he has just plonked on his desk makes his point rather better. So what's next, I ask. He just smiles and fiddles with his cufflinks, which will probably soon be Alexa-enabled.</p><p>Second-guessing Amazon is a mug's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.game.No\">www.game.No</url> one will spill the magic beans. But there is one thing that we can predict. Amazon, already nicknamed \"the everything store\", is fast becoming the \"everything, everywhere, every time\" store. It's growing so fast that it's now the world's third-largest tech company by revenue, on course to generate sales of $200bn this year. That's $547m a day. Analysts expect sales to reach $350bn by the end of 2020 and to surpass the $500bn mark by 2023.</p><p>Its shares are soaring at such a clip - up more than 50% this year - that it is expected to pip Apple to become the world's first trillion - million million - dollar listed company. Last week it became only the second company, after Apple, to pass the $900bn market-value milestone.</p><p>That made the firm's founder, JeffBezos, 54, the wealthiest man in modern history, worth $150bn, according to Bloomberg. That's enough to cover Britain's budget deficit. More than twice.</p><p>As it grows online - and makes the odd foray into the physical world, notably its recent \u00a311bn acquisition of the US and UK supermarket chain Whole Foods - it will have an even bigger effect on the way we behave, on our towns and cities, and our jobs than it has already wrought - for good or bad.</p><p>Make that BAD!, as far as Donald Trump is concerned. The world's most powerful critic is waging a Twitter war on Amazon, accusing it of avoiding tax, bankrupting high-street retailers and destroying the fabric of towns and cities. \"Amazon is doing great damage to tax-paying retailers. Towns, cities and states are being hurt - many jobs being lost!\" he says.</p><p>It's not hard to see why Trump, and many on this side of the Atlantic, are furious, especially those who work at struggling bricks-and-mortar retailers. Amazon's global digital shop is fast replacing the high street. It's already on our desktops, iPads and mobile phones, and now, thanks to Alexa, in our homes and even our cars, with manufacturers such as Toyota, BMW and JaguarLand Rover installing \"her\".</p><p>Whatever device we use to shop, there's always more to buy. The firm's recent $1bn acquisition of PillPack, an online pharmacy start-up, takes it into healthcare, threatening Boots in the same way that the first product it sold, books, threatened Waterstones. Banks are in the firing line. Amazon wants to offer current accounts. Ocado is under attack, too, after Amazon's decision to partner with Morrisons to offer Amazon Fresh home food delivery.</p><p>And shopping is just the start. Amazon is fast becoming a media giant. Amazon Music is already the world's third-largest digital music service by subscribers, behind Spotify and Apple Music. Television shows like Jeremy Clarkson's The Grand Tour have helped to make Amazon's Prime Video the fastest-growing new entertainment service in Britain last year, overtaking Netflix. Subscribers increased 41% to 4.3m households last year, says Barb, the ratings body. Subscriber figures will rise sharply once it starts screening sports. It has bought the rights to the US Open tennis and will livestream 20 Premier League football matches per season from 2019-2020.</p><p>What makes a simple shop so irresistible that even those of us who agree with Trump's criticism still use it to buy most of the stuffwe need, read novels on Kindle, watch TV and now wake up with Alexa? Can it continue to escape the scrutiny and public disgust hammering the other tech giants, notably Facebook? Amazon has grown so big, so fast and been largely ignored by regulators because it is different. Not necessarily better than its west coast US rivals, but different. To find out how, you have to go to 2117-2127, 7th Avenue, Seattle.</p><p>The first distinction is as clear as the summer sky around the company's head office the day I arrive. Amazon is not, like its biggest tech competitors, in Silicon Valley. Nor does it look like anything in \"the Valley\". Its 45,000 Seattle-based staffdo not work in a perfectly formed bubble, unencumbered by the awkward intrusion of reality. Amazon's $4bn mothership is spread over 10m sq ft in more than 40 buildings downtown. That helps Amazon never to lose sight of its customers. \"It inspires us to invent for them every day,\" says Sam Kennedy, from Nashville, the first Amazonian I meet.</p><p>Customers never lose sight of Amazon, either. The entrance to Amageddon is marked by glass domes. The Spheres - to Amazon, or \"JeffBezos's balls\" to everyone else - are 90ft high and 130ft wide, and filled with 40,000 plants. Modelled on the greenhouses at Kew Gardens, they are a place for employees \"to feel differently, to think differently\", Amazon says. (Not for too long, though. Bezos monitors the time his employees spend there). Their main role is to demonstrate transparency. They practically scream: \"Look inside. We've nothing to hide. We're not Facebook!\" All the tech behemoths like to think they are take-no-prisoners innovators, but Bezos raises the bar. He reminds his human drones to push harder every day by calling the main 37-storey tower of his HQ Day 1 because \"every day is day one at Amazon\". If they forget the firm's scrappy start-up culture, what will follow is \"painful decline. Followed by death.\" The company's values, pasted on walls everywhere, increase the pressure. \"Have Backbone! Bias for action!\", the signs scream.</p><p>It's tough all right, but also a refreshing change from the platitudes beloved of most west coast US firms - \"Don't be evil\" (Google) or \"Connect the world\" (Facebook). But do the people who work at a firm that is almost 25 years old and set to become the most valuable in the history of modern capitalism really buy such motivational woo-woo? They do. Really. \"I love waking up every day worried about my customers,\" Prentis Wilson, who heads up Amazon's business services, tells me - with one of his trademark awkward corporate smiles that seems to mimic Amazon's logo. Stephenie Landry, who pioneered the Prime Now service that offers delivery in cities in a couple of hours, may dress like a hippie but she describes gleefully how \"ruthless prototypation\" and long, long days enabled her to set up Prime Now in New York in just 111 days. That's not moving fast and breaking things. That's being on tech crack.</p><p>Perhaps that's why Amazonians don't mind doing without the perks enjoyed by staffat Google and Facebook. Another of Amazon's core values posted on every noticeboard is \"Frugality!\" There's no free food and stafftravel economy class - all except Bezos, who has a private jet and a spaceship, New Shepard, in case he can't find anywhere on earth he wants to fly to.</p><p>Bezos may be tough, but he likes to be challenged himself. Amazon HQ staffare encouraged to write their own messages on the walls alongside company values. Not all criticism is wiped clean by the thought police. On my visit, Amazonians ridiculed Bezos's decision to sell limited-edition 355ml bottles of Amazon-branded Coca-Cola at $10, five times the price of a regular bottle. Over a large poster advertising the drink, one wrote \"$10 fan coke is wrong\". Another drew a face crying with laughter.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest difference between Amazon and its Silicon Valley peers is its attitude to making money. Most big tech outfits like to charge a lot for the gadgets they create and rack up vast profits. Amazon, by contrast, does not seek to make much money at all from its devices. \"We break even,\" says David Limp, head of devices, whose haircut is so neat and whose clothes are so crisp he looks rather like a device himself. He's not kidding. A Kindle ereader starts at \u00a360, compared to \u00a3400 for an Apple iPad Mini, and an Alexa \"Echo\" Dot can be yours for \u00a350, six times less than Apple's rival HomePod.</p><p>Amazon can do this because it subsidises devices and its retail arm with the vast profit its makes from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud-computing arm. AWS sells pay-as-you-go computing power, data storage and content delivery to everyone from the smallest start-up to the CIA, raking in $20bn a year. It's the little-known power behind Bezos's empire and even if you want to escape it, you can't. Like Netflix? You're swelling Amazon's coffers. The streaming giant depends on AWS.</p><p>Amazon does, of course, work very hard to hook us on using its devices once we've bought them - and then charge us even more for premium subscriptions, such as Prime, which offers almost unlimited fast delivery and TV. It does this because the more we shop, watch and download, the more data it gathers that it can use to offer us new products. Even then, it uses low prices to lure us, which means lower margins. It made just $3bn profit on $178bn revenues last year. Huge investment in research and development also eats into profits. Amazon sunk $23bn into R&amp;D last year, a record for any company.</p><p>Amazon has enjoyed a stellar run by any measure, but nothing lasts for ever. The company is coming under scrutiny as concerns about privacy and the monopoly power the big tech firms enjoy increase. Trump, riled as much by criticism in The Washington Post, which Bezos owns, as by Amazon's growth, accuses the firm of everything from tax avoidance to bankrupting the US post office by not paying its fair share of delivery costs.</p><p>Rival retailers are lobbying Trump to break up Amazon. Bill Simon, former boss of Walmart, the largest big box retailer in the world, argues Amazon abuses its dominant position in ecommerce to undercut and drive competitors out of business. He has a point. A cursory web search reveals story after story of vendors who complain that Amazon has forced them to sell their goods on its platform on lousy terms. Some smaller companies even claim Amazon has tried to bankrupt them by copying their hit products and then selling them at a lower price, sometimes below cost. One small San Francisco-based company, Rain Design, sold a $43 aluminium laptop stand that garnered almost universally positive reviews, making it the bestseller in its category. Then last year Amazon came out with an eerily similar stand for $20. Sales of the Rain Design original slipped. \"We don't feel good about it,\" says Harvey Tai, Rain's general manager, with crashing understatement. Amazon has not commented on claims it \"copied\" the stand.</p><p>Although the Rain Design stand is still selling decently on Amazon, it's cases like this that prompt critics to say Bezos is mounting a cut-price land grab to secure market domination. Then, once he has achieved it, he will push up prices and we will have no choice but to pay. From his office in New York, Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University and an outspoken critic of big tech, tells me: \"Dictators always start benign, but power corrupts.\" Many consumers are already complaining that despite signing up to \"all you can eat\" packages, such as Prime, they are charged extra to watch movies and listen to music.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the fearsome EU competition chief, is also on Amazon's case. She's fed up with being given the runaround by companies, including Amazon, that - legally - try to avoid tax by shifting profits from high-tax countries, such as Britain, to low-tax ones such as Luxembourg and Ireland, or simply structure their businesses so that they make little profit to avoid tax. Amazon paid \u00a37.4m in tax in Britain in 2016, despite generating more than \u00a37bn in revenues here. Amazon points out it has restructured its tax arrangements, so that it now pays more tax. But it still has a big cost advantage over its bricks-and-mortar rivals. Paula Nickolds, the new boss of John Lewis, points out that, unlike her company, Amazon does not have to pay rent or business rates here on branded stores because it does not have any.</p><p>It's certainly tempting to paint Bezos as a 21st-century version of the robber barons of the oil or railways age. Amazon will control nearly half of the ecommerce market in the US by the end of this year, a new report from eMarketer says. It is set to become No 1 in US clothing and footwear later this year, with 38% of those markets. In western Europe it accounts for 22% of the ecommerce market and controls more than 80% of the ebook market.</p><p>It's also hard to disagree that Amazon and other online retailers are hollowing out town and city centres and malls. One lunchtime in Seattle I walk the few blocks from Amazon's HQ to Macy's department store on Pine Street. It's so quiet inside that shopping is like intruding on private grief. Or it would be, if there were anything to buy: the shelves are a jumble of outdated styles. Last year was a record year for store closures in America, with nearly 8,000 shutting and only 3,000 opening. Here, House of Fraser, Maplin, Toys R Us and Comet have all fallen victim to the rise of online retail. Some 5,855 shops closed across Britain last year, according to the accountancy firm PWC, more than in any year since 2010. The number of new shops opening also continued to fall, with a net loss of 1,700.</p><p>But Amazon thinks it has a trump card. By delivering ever lower prices, it argues it is the opposite of a greedy monopolist. \"I wake up every day thinking customers are better offthan they were 10 years ago,\" says Greg Greeley, former head of Amazon Prime, when I pose the question everyone always wants to ask Amazon: do you wake up worrying about putting yet another bricks-and-mortar store out of business? Amazon executives add that while it may dominate certain markets, notably online books, when you take into account the total retail market, it is only a small fraction - 2% in the UK and 4% in the US. As for pressuring smaller rivals, they point out that 2m small-and medium-sized businesses around the world rely on Amazon to fulfil their orders. Last year, for the first time, independent companies' orders fulfilled by Amazon exceeded sales by Amazon itself.</p><p>But what about all the jobs that are disappearing from the high street? Surely Russ Grandinetti, a man-mountain of a hometown boy who runs Amazon's international business, feels a little guilty about what his firm has wrought? \"The building we're in now didn't exist three years ago. I see a building going up over there that we are constructing. What we've done for this town, for the country, for the world is productive,\" he insists as he gestures out of his many office windows. \"We create lots of jobs not only in the company - 100,000 in the US last year alone, 5,000 in Britain - but also in the suppliers we serve.\" He adds that the firm is set to open a new $5bn campus in North America, creating up to 50,000 jobs.</p><p>Grandinetti does concede that there are losers in the ecommerce revolution and helping them is \"important\". But \"where that nets out I don't really think is ours to tally. Companies have often invented technologies that have then required us to figure out how to reinvest the productivity improvements in new jobs and new ways. That's an important societal thing to do, an important governmental thing to do. I don't think it's our job to do anything but try to be really good at what we do.\" Shareholders will cheer his relentless focus on the bottom line. Critics will respond that he is turning a blind eye to the disruption Amazon causes.</p><p>If Amazon has an Achilles heel, it is in its comically named fulfilment centres - its giant warehouses. They are anything but fulfilling for the people who work there. Scarcely a month goes by without a newspaper sending an undercover reporter to record how staffwork crippling shifts. To meet performance targets, insiders say pickers must collect as many as 1,000 items and walk up to 15 miles in a single shift. Timers count the seconds needed to retrieve each item, with penalties for those who are too sluggish. Pressure to hit targets means there is scant time for lavatory breaks or lunch, workers claim. James Bloodworth, who got a job at Amazon's warehouse in Rugeley in Staffordshire, revealed in a recent book that workers who have a day offsick - even with a doctor's note - get a disciplinary point against their name. Amazon has since ended this practice. Wages, however, remain low. Amazon disclosed in April its workers' median annual salary is $28,446, which means a typical employee would have to work more than 5m years to rack up Bezos's current net worth. Thousands of workers at Amazon's warehouses in Germany went on strike earlier this month to demand better working conditions, joining colleagues in Spain and Poland. Germany's Verdi services union accused the company of getting rich by \"saving money on the health of its workers\".</p><p>Grandinetti concedes that \"specific anecdotes\" are \"not as we would like\", but points out that Amazon staffget company pensions, health insurance and shares.</p><p>Fulfilment centres \"are and have been good places to work. Absolutely.\"</p><p>Can anything stop the world's biggest data-driven instant-gratification company? On my final afternoon in Seattle, I ask Gur Kimchi, the Israel-born scientist, who oversees Amazon's tech centre in Cambridge and has already test-flown the first local delivery - a bag of popcorn. We debate the rights and wrongs of big tech but he's heard it all before and it has turned his hair salt'n'pepper. He wants to move on. \"Let me leave you with a parting thought,\" he says. \"If you think drones are exciting, think about the other 50 projects - bonkers, crazy projects - we can't tell you about.\" Alexa-enabled spectacles? Not weird enough.</p><p>An Alexa implant so she can tell us what to do, not the other way around? Like Hardcastle, Kimchi is not giving anything away, but his parting message is clear: Trump or no Trump, the online mega mall that sells soap powder and makes soap operas, online marketplace, music box, online advertiser, cloud-computer services provider, bank, audible-books player, supermarket chain, food-delivery service, ereader manufacturer, always-on home help, CIA's little helper, online car dashboard, drone squadron, pharmacy chain, creator of warehouses where Dickens meets robots and much, much else - is only just getting started</p><p>Early learning Amazon's first name was Cadabra but became Amazon after a lawyer misheard it as \"Cadaver\".

Tech of the Town    DEMS SOUND THE ALARM ON FACEBOOK AND HEALTH MISINFO \u2014 Democratic lawmakers are sounding off over a new report from activist group Avaaz finding that networks spreading bogus health news racked up an estimated 3.8 billion views on Facebook this past year.   \u2014 What\u2019s new: \u201cWebsites disseminating false or misleading health news generated nearly half a billion views on the social media platform in April alone, Avaaz said, with the trend peaking just as states across the U.S. expanded lockdowns due to the pandemic,\u201d according to a dispatch out this morning from Cristiano . \u201cAnd the report found that 10 \u2018superspreaders\u2019 of health misinformation racked up four times as many views as the top 10 leading global health agencies that same month, even as Facebook took new steps to show users information from authoritative health sources.\u201d   \u2014 What Dems are saying: Congressional Democrats, who have long accused Facebook of failing to take misinformation on its platform seriously enough, are hammering the company over the study. \u201cThese findings underscore the fundamental flaw in Facebook\u2019s business model: it values lies over lives,\u201d said Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) responded by alluding to her past calls to break up Facebook, saying: \u201cNo company should be too big to be held accountable for distorting facts and spreading falsehoods, especially during a public health crisis.\u201d   \u2014 What Facebook\u2019s saying: \u201cWe share Avaaz\u2019s goal of limiting misinformation, but their findings don\u2019t reflect the steps we\u2019ve taken to keep it from spreading on our services,\" Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement ahead of the report's release.   \u2014 More on the role of tech during the pandemic in POLITICO\u2019s new Future Pulse newsletter .   DNC-WATCH: WHAT HAPPENED, AND WHAT\u2019S NEXT \u2014 Day 1 brought some tech industry titans (including some Republicans) throwing their weight behind Joe Biden . Day 2 brought some chatter about rural broadband: Sen. Chuck Schumer pledged a Biden administration would rebuild U.S. infrastructure and \u201cmake sure every home, from inner city to rural America, has broadband,\u201d and the Montana delegate who nominated Biden weighed in that \u201crural broadband can be a gamechanger for rural communities like mine, and Joe Biden has a plan to make it happen.\u201d ( More here on Biden\u2019s views on the issues, including broadband.)   \u2014 But as far as tech goes, that was about it. Will we continue to see a largely policy-free Democratic convention?   \u2014 What\u2019s next: My colleague Nancy Scola is interviewing Caitlin Mitchell, senior adviser for digital on the Biden campaign, on Thursday morning as part of POLITICO\u2019s virtual convention programming. (Sneak peek: You\u2019ll hear how the campaign is thinking about everything from digital organizing to online fundraising to using social media in the bid to get Biden elected.) What questions do you have around the former veep\u2019s digital strategy and the campaign\u2019s stance on tech issues? Send your ideas Nancy\u2019s way: [email protected]  And register in advance here .   \u2014 First in MT: Niki Christoff, an alum of Salesforce, Uber and Google, is coordinating with the Biden campaign to organize McCain alums for Biden.    TRUMP WEIGHS IN ON ORACLE INTEREST IN TIKTOK \u2014 Asked Tuesday in Yuma, Arizona whether Oracle would be a good buyer for TikTok , President Donald Trump said \u201cOracle is a great company, and I think its owner is a tremendous guy. \u2026 I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it. Yeah.\u201d   \u2014 Would you rather: Oracle, or Microsoft? \u201cMicrosoft wants it and so does Oracle, and probably so do other people, but they have to also make sure the United States is well compensated because we're the ones making it possible. \u2026 So our Treasury has to be very well compensated.\u201d   \u2014 Explain: How would that work? \u201cIt\u2019s very simple how it would work,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s called: \u2018You have to put money into the Treasury.\u2019\u201d   WHERE TECH MEETS CLIMATE CRISES: \u2018THE FIRST FIVE CONSORTIUM\u2019 \u2014 Microsoft may be shoulder-deep in TikTok negotiations , but the tech giant is also part of a new Trump administration effort focused on channeling AI expertise and data into predicting and fighting natural and humanitarian disasters. The First Five Consortium , which Microsoft is co-chairing with the Department of Energy\u2019s Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office alongside the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center at the Department of Defense, launched on Tuesday.   \u2014 What they\u2019re doing: The group, born out of a January White House forum on disaster response, is working on accelerating the development of AI-powered tech that can, for example, provide near-real-time assessments of wildfires and floods and aid search-and-rescue operations. (CALFIRE deputy chief Phillip Selegue spoke during a briefing Tuesday about how first responders could have used these tools as recently as this week to map and analyze the nearly 9,000 lightning strikes that have caused more than 350 fires across California over the past several days.)   \u201cThe idea here really is to augment human intelligence,  not to replace human intelligence , and to get the data to the right people at the right time as quickly as we possibly can so that they can make better-informed decisions,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer for federal, Susie Adams, said Tuesday.   \u2014 What\u2019s in a name? \u201cThe first five minutes of any disaster \u2014 that response is really critical,\u201d DOE White House fellow Jermon Bafaty said Tuesday, explaining the meaning behind the organization\u2019s name. \u201cBeing able to get the data and the information that you need within the first five minutes of the incident can really affect the outcome of either positioning or how we respond to that incident, whether it be wildfire, damage assessment for hurricanes or floods, etcetera.\u201d   \u2014 What\u2019s next: The consortium is expected to have a kickoff meeting in early September and plans to announce more partners soon.   BROADBAND LAND: POMPEO ON BOARD FOR RESCHEDULED 5G FORUM \u2014 Federal Communications Commission Chair Ajit Pai announced Tuesday that a forum originally planned for March is back on, virtually this time and featuring Secretary of State Mike Pompeo along with industry officials from Rakuten, Intel, VMWare and other companies. The session, now happening Sept. 14 , will focus on a new way of building 5G wireless networks by opening the radio access protocols in a way to enable software-based network architecture.   \u2014 Some see this 5G network move as a way to counter China , whose telecom giant Huawei is a leader in the 5G hardware that these new techniques could replace. Pompeo has repeatedly slammed Huawei in recent months and told senators he supports coming up with a worthy Western alternative.   \u2014 \u201cOpen RAN networks enable providers to bring together  best-in-class vendors, including from the U.S. , unleashing innovation and unlocking the economic potential enabled by 5G,\u201d DISH Executive Vice President Stephen Bye, who is participating in the forum, said in a statement. DISH is planning to build what Bye dubbed \u201cthe nation's first cloud native Open RAN based 5G network.\u201d          Transitions    The latest class of TechCongress fellows has landed on the Hill . For the next 10 months, Zach Barnes will serve the House Energy and Commerce Committee minority staff, under ranking member Greg Walden (R-Ore.); Jackson Brietzke will serve the Senate Homeland Security Committee majority staff, under Chairman Rand Paul (R-Ky.); Genevieve Fried will serve Sen.

Even though financial analysts on Wall Street think YouTube makes about as much money as the Gap, General Mills or Netflix, the video service's financial results are a secret. They are lumped in with the rest of Google, an even larger internet company that last year generated $137 billion in revenue. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  That secrecy has led to growing frustration among analysts and investors, who will be looking for more details about YouTube when Google's parent company, Alphabet, reports results for its second financial quarter on Thursday. Three months ago, Alphabet executives pointed to issues with YouTube as a factor in disappointing financial results in the first quarter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''I think their reticence to provide information borders on paranoia, as if they would be admitting failure if they allowed us to discover whether one of their businesses was performing more poorly than expected,'' said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.</p><p>  Big tech companies have been under pressure from regulators and lawmakers to provide more insight into how their businesses operate. The lack of disclosure around YouTube's finances is a reminder that some of them have actually made understanding how they make money more difficult over the last year.</p><p>  [The Justice Department will open an antitrust review of big tech companies.]</p><p>  In November, Apple announced it would stop disclosing iPhone sales figures. The company had been providing that data for a decade. But now that iPhone sales are slowing, Apple argues that they are no longer representative of the strength of the company's overall business.</p><p>  In July, when Facebook reported slower than expected growth in users for its main service, the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, disclosed a new, more positive metric: 2.5 billion people used at least one of the company's apps -- Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger -- in June.</p><p>  The obfuscation of information that investors want more of has become a ''foundational practice'' by tech companies, said Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm, who was a financial analyst for 20 years. ''Companies change the disclosures to change the narrative and make it more difficult to get to the things investors want to know.''</p><p>  When it reports financial results, Alphabet groups YouTube with other Google properties like search, the Google Play app store and Gmail. Analysts who follow the company say putting everything under Google makes it hard to parse out the performance of YouTube, especially because search remains the biggest business at the company.</p><p>YouTube does not disclose revenue, profitability, how many ads it runs alongside videos, user numbers and how often those users visit the site -- all metrics that would help an investor ''understand the health of the business and its growth trajectory,'' said Mr. Pachter.</p><p>  ''I don't think the company provides anything that helps us understand the business,'' he said.</p><p>  More details around YouTube's business may confirm that it does not compare favorably to Facebook in key metrics for gauging its popularity, such as how long users stay on the site and how frequently they visit, Mr. Pachter said.</p><p>  An Alphabet spokeswoman, Winnie King, declined to comment for the story.</p><p>  When Alphabet last reported quarterly earnings in April, the company stunned investors as revenue came in $1 billion below Wall Street expectations.</p><p>  In response to a question from a financial analyst about the company's first-quarter shortfall, Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, said growth in clicks for YouTube ads had ''decelerated'' because of tighter restrictions in early 2018 on what videos could carry advertising. Ms. Porat said YouTube had made ''important'' and ''strong'' contributions to revenue, but was not more specific.</p><p>  When Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, spoke about YouTube in the call, he announced new features or policy changes that for the most part had already announced. The new information he did reveal -- such as viewership of Super Bowl commercials was up 60 percent on YouTube -- was a narrow sliver of YouTube's business.</p><p>  Companies in the United States have significant leeway in determining what information is considered ''material'' and has to be disclosed in financial results reported to regulators.</p><p>  In 1976, the Supreme Court in TSC Industries v. Northway established the definition of material as information that would have been considered important to a reasonable investor. The definition, however, was vague, and companies have generally been allowed to make their own decisions about what would be important to a reasonable investor.</p><p>  When big tech companies have offered more insight into their far-flung operations, it has been well received by Wall Street.</p><p>  When Amazon disclosed revenue and profit for its high-margin Amazon Web Services unit in 2015, it eased concerns about the company's ability to turn a profit.</p><p>  Last year, Google surprised analysts on an earnings call by announcing that its Google Cloud business had surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue. At the time, Google had been fighting the perception that its cloud business was struggling to make inroads against A.W.S. and Microsoft's cloud-computing competitor, Azure.</p><p>  ''Companies usually pull back disclosure when items turned negative, and then they try to offset with more positive disclosure,'' said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who follows Alphabet and other internet companies.</p><p>  He said he did not expect Alphabet to change its disclosure for YouTube anytime soon. But Mr. Mahaney said -- frustration aside -- that he did not believe more detail about YouTube's business would alter investor's perception of Alphabet.</p><p>  Investors generally see YouTube accounting for about 20 percent of Google's revenue. There are more questions around YouTube's profitability, but he said the general view was that it was ''modestly profitable but not dramatically so.''</p><p>  Starting in July 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission sent three letters to Alphabet asking, among other things, for an explanation on why it does not need to break out YouTube from Google.</p><p>  In its response, Alphabet said that since Larry Page, its chief executive, did not receive weekly updates on how YouTube's business performed to assess the performance of Google, the disclosure requirement was ''not applicable.''</p><p>Alphabet also said detailing its advertising revenue by different product areas was unnecessary because its goal was to sell one product -- online advertising -- regardless of how a customer paid for it or where that ad appeared.</p><p>  In January 2018, the S.E.C. said it completed its review with no further action.</p><p>  Marcia Narine Weldon, a lecturer in law at the University of Miami who specializes in compliance and corporate governance, said the arguments made by Alphabet to the S.E.C. for not disclosing YouTube separately ''don't hold water.''</p><p>  ''I'm surprised that the S.E.C. hasn't pressed it more,'' said Ms. Narine Weldon. ''It's a legitimate question for shareholders given the size of the business.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Alphabet groups YouTube with other properties in reporting results, making it hard to assess its performance.

The DOJ also briefed a group of state attorneys general on the status of its long-awaited case against Google for monopolistic behavior, sources familiar with the situation told Axios. What's happening: Attorney General William Barr promised he'd send a Section 230 proposal to Congress and said he wanted to see a Google suit filed by the end of September. </p><p>He appears to have achieved the first goal and moved toward the second. Yes, but: Although efforts to change Section 230 have garnered bipartisan support, Congress is preoccupied with the election, the pandemic, and a Supreme Court vacancy. Any Google suit will likely take years to play out. These projects' fate will almost certainly be determined in the next administration.How it works: In an unusual move, the DOJ released the text of its own proposed legislation to revamp the Section 230 rules. The proposal would remove legal immunity when platforms facilitate criminal activity or fail to report unlawful conduct, or when platforms don't follow their own content moderation principles \"consistently.\" The proposal would also allow civil suits to be brought against platforms relating to content that promotes online child exploitation and terrorism.Industry groups quickly raised alarms. 'Amid a pandemic and an election, undermining the tools social media companies use to respond to problematic content like disinformation is more dangerous than ever,\" said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group that represents major tech companies like Google and Facebook. \"The U.S. government should be enabling efforts to address nefarious content and behavior, not hamstringing them in misguided pursuit of political gain.' Details: Wednesday afternoon, at a White House gathering for Republican state attorneys, President Trump said his administration was weighing further \"concrete legal steps\" against platforms it believes censor conservatives. Trump said companies \"rig\" their terms of service to \"mislead or defraud,\" and urged the AGs to investigate social media companies in their states.\"I'm learning what role we can play as state AGs\" to support Trump's executive order on social media and the DOJ's proposed Section 230 policy change, South Carolina attorney general Alan Wilson told Axios after the meeting. \"We're not all treated fairly in the new virtual town square.\" \"We discussed with the President our commitment to combatting platforms that are unlawfully censoring speech or stifling the voices of individuals based on personal political ideology, which only grows more important as we get closer to Election Day,\" said Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry. What's next: The DOJ Section 230 proposal will join a host of other bills circulating in Congress to regulate tech platforms. Barr has reportedly pushed for the delivery of a Google suit by the end of September, which is fast approaching, while prosecutors have sought additional time to strengthen the case.. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544160094374258275776100123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-8H01-JCMN-Y2GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><timeReceived>11:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00031BS</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The DOJ's new effort aims to explore \"widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,\" according to the agency. The DOJ did not explicitly mention any major tech giant by name, but its stated interests track closely with Google's dominance in search, Facebook's leadership in social media and Amazon's position as the country's e-commerce leader. </p><p>All three companies control vast amounts of data that give them an edge over smaller rivals, critics say. (Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) DOJ officials said they would \"seek redress\" if in the course of their investigation they find big tech companies committed violations of federal competition laws. The DOJ's review taps into growing, bipartisan fears that tech giants have grown too large and powerful, threatening rivals, harming consumers and undermining new innovations. It could sweep up the whole of Silicon Valley into the government's regulatory crosshairs, a broad inquiry that mirrors the DOJ's probes from generations ago into entire industries, such as oil and gas giants. \"It looks like the antitrust winter is over,\" said Columbia University law professor Tim Wu, who chronicled the subject in his book \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.\" Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google declined to comment on the DOJ probe, but it pointed to previous testimony to Congress that said the company doesn't threaten competitors. The nascent probe appears to differ from a formal, targeted government investigation into how Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook may have acted anti-competitively. The new effort is led by Makan Delrahim, the DOJ's assistant attorney general for antitrust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001082654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP7-J4D1-DY6F-J2MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"344\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It did not mention any major tech giant by name, but its stated interests track closely with Google's dominance in search, Facebook's leadership in social media and Amazon's position as the country's e-commerce leader. All three control vast amounts of data that give them an edge over smaller rivals, critics say.</p><p>Justice Department officials said they would \"seek redress\" if in the course of their investigation they find tech companies committed violations of federal competition laws.</p><p>The review taps into intensifying, bipartisan fears that tech giants have grown too large and powerful, threatening rivals, harming consumers and undermining innovations. It could sweep up the whole of Silicon Valley into the government's regulatory crosshairs, a broad inquiry that mirrors Justice Department probes from generations ago into entire industries, such as oil and gas.</p><p>\"It looks like the antitrust winter is over,\" said Columbia University law professor Tim Wu, who chronicled the subject in his book \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.\"           </p><p>Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google declined to comment on the DOJ probe but pointed to previous testimony to Congress stressing it doesn't threaten competitors. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.</p><p>The nascent probe appears to differ from a targeted government investigation into how Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook may have acted anti-competitively. Another Washington antitrust agency, the Federal Trade Commission, recently created a special task force to examine industry competition issues.</p><p>The new effort is led by Makan Delrahim, the DOJ's assistant attorney general for antitrust, who raised concerns in a statement Tuesday that \"digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\" </p><p>In recent months, Delrahim appeared to offer a road map for the government's coming review. Speaking at a conference in Israel, he warned that Washington would take a broad view of what constitutes a threat to competition. He pointed to the U.S. government's case against Microsoft in the 1990s to show that federal regulators \"already have in our possession the tools we need to enforce the antitrust laws in cases involving digital technologies.\" </p><p>To start, DOJ officials are planning a meeting this week with attorneys general from states such as Colorado, Nebraska and Iowa to examine the potential for bringing state-level cases against tech giants, according to two people familiar with the meetings who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Some of those states have urged the federal government to open competition probes of tech giants, and many attended a private gathering hosted by the Justice Department in September to discuss the power of online platforms, including concerns about competition, privacy and free speech.</p><p>The department declined to provide further details about its plans.</p><p>The probe comes at the beckoning of Democrats and Republicans. President Trump has repeatedly swiped at Silicon Valley in recent months, at one point last month threatening unspecified lawsuits against Facebook and Google. Earlier this month, Trump convened a summit at the White House during which he attacked the industry for what he called the censoring of conservatives - and pledged to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\" </p><p>But many Democrats seeking the White House in 2020 have signaled their interest in probing tech companies, too. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has been the most aggressive, calling for tech giants to be broken up. And Democrats and Republicans have joined on Capitol Hill to launch an investigation into Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google on competition grounds, holding a hearing with all four companies earlier this month.</p><p>\"Antitrust enforcers must now be bold and fearless in stopping Big Tech's misuse of its monopolistic power,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement. \"I have called for this kind of inquiry repeatedly and hope that Department of Justice enforcers will match their rhetoric with real action.\" </p><p>Gene Kimmelman, a former DOJ antitrust official now working as a senior adviser to the public interest advocacy group Public Knowledge, said Silicon Valley is ripe for a closer examination of the power of its dominant companies.</p><p>\"This is a welcome step to shine a light on whether there's antitrust problems and whether there needs to be updated laws to promote competition,\" Kimmelman said.</p><p>But the president's attacks prompted concerns among some experts about the rationale for the new review.</p><p>Thinking ahead to the 2020 election, \"if the Democrats are going to stake out an aggressive antitrust platform, this is a way for Republicans to neutralize it politically without actually doing anything,\" said Robert Litan, a partner in the law firm Korein Tillery and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's antitrust division who helped prosecute Microsoft. \"Another way to read this is that the administration doesn't like any of these tech firms because they think they all lean Democratic and stifle conservative voices, and this is just pure, raw-knuckles payback.\" </p><p>Before Tuesday's announcement, federal regulators had divvied up scrutiny of Silicon Valley in a move that also presaged more formal antitrust probes. The Justice Department assumed responsibilities for Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission took on Amazon and Facebook. Experts said they did not believe the DOJ's broad look at the tech industry affected the two agencies' work, which is still in its preliminary stages.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-39dd3f44adfa41b1a34d20ed48c3d8b7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-35G1-DXKP-J155-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1028\"/><timeReceived>9:13 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They dominated their industry. Their products revolutionized society, and they became the focus of constant debates about inequality and economic change and corporate power. Today, such debates center on the big four tech companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google. Congress has questioned their privacy protections and the spread of false information, and now the Justice Department says it is starting an antitrust investigation.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NPR's Aarti Shahani is here. Hi there, Aarti.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Hi.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 So what is the Justice Department saying?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Well, the DOJ didn't name names, but in its announcement, the agency says it's looking at market-leading online platforms that work in search, social media and some retail services online. So you get the gist.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 The key issue is whether these brands that we all know - they either make our smartphone or we have apps on our phone that - they're by them - whether they're stifling competition.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Although it is fair to ask, how do you stifle competition when you're very often giving things away? These are often free platforms, free apps. You go to the Apple Store to shop for things, and you don't pay anything to do that.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Right. So yeah, there's one school of thought that says, hey, if a product's free, that's fantastic. It can't be bad for you; you can't beat free. But that's coming under attack with this other school, that free isn't really free. In the case of Facebook or Google, the user who provides the data has been turned into the unwitting product. In the case of Amazon, small businesses that sell on the platform have to pay to play, advertise to be seen, and then their data gets turned into corporate intelligence for Amazon to drive them out of business. Apple may be giving its developers, who are the heart and soul of the app store, a raw deal.             </p><p>                So the Justice Department is going to look into whether small businesses, would-be startups and consumers are getting harmed and also how these companies got to be so big - were laws violated along the way?             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 How did the companies respond?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Well, in response to NPR's inquiry, Google pointed to its testimony in Congress last week. Google's head of economic policy made the case at a hearing that his company creates lots of opportunities for others. Its advertising tools have helped small businesses grow. Its employees have gone on to build more than 2,000 startups. In the case of Amazon and Apple, they didn't immediately respond to our request, but Apple has made the case that its app store is a safe and trusted place for customers and great for developers. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has pointed out that other businesses are selling more to customers on his site than Amazon is.             </p><p>Facebook declined to comment, though they have said before they face vigorous competition from other platforms. I would note that, at two separate hearings also last week, one of Facebook leaders was making the case that regulators should let the company mint its own money. So while the government's worried about tech giants being too big, Facebook, in trying to create digital currency with a few partners, is trying to get way bigger.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Yeah. And what about the other investigations of Facebook? Because there's more than one.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 That's right. The other one is about privacy, though, not antitrust. In the company's last investor call, Facebook disclosed that it plans to pay a multibillion-dollar fine to the Federal Trade Commission. And it looks like the FTC is going to hold CEO Mark Zuckerberg directly responsible for privacy in a kind of stunning way.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Wow.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 That's according to a Wall Street Journal report. Zuckerberg, who is Harvard's most famous dropout, will have to start handing in homework to regulators, personally signing off on reports documenting that his company is finally playing by the rules. So, you know, that means the government would be inserting itself into Facebook's governance. We should have more details on that settlement shortly.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Yeah, and not the company being held responsible, but the person. Wow.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 That (inaudible).             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Aarti, thanks so much.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Thank you.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 NPR's Aarti Shahani.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-2019072420</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-BX41-JBJH-325J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"846\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The department also is examining Google's online advertising practices, said the person, who could not discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Antitrust officials at the department briefed state attorneys general Thursday on the planned action against Google, seeking support from states across the country that share concerns about Google's conduct.    The anticipated lawsuit against Google could be the government's biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the groundbreaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.    Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.    Spokespeople for Google, whose parent company is Alphabet Inc., and headquarters is in Mountain View, California, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.    Google has maintained that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. The company says its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.    For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behavior.\"    Now with 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department is approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement. Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google.    The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to President Donald Trump said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.    The company has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views.    Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.    Google controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.    Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world's largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Antitrust officials at the department briefed state attorneys general Thursday on the planned action against Google, seeking support from states across the country that share concerns about Google's conduct.The anticipated lawsuit against Google could be the government's biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the groundbreaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.Spokespeople for Google, whose parent company is Alphabet Inc., and headquarters is in Mountain View, California, declined comment Thursday.Google has maintained that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. The company says its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. </p><p>And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behavior.\"Now with 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department is approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement. Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google.The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to President Donald Trump said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.The company has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views.Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices. Among other things, the regulators found that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.Google controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world's largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Associated Press Writers Michael Balsamo and Marcy Gordon.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tampabay.com/resizer/Q05QNH2WxkBBYyBq3YSmXaikPs0=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/5Y2CVNRHFNATRD2FVW6NIIX3QI.jpg\">See image link</url><br/>This 2013 photo shows Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.<br/></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STPETE-AC6ECGERDRFVFEVRG55R2SJLSE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STPETE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XC-WYH1-DYTM-N3PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tampa Bay Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
