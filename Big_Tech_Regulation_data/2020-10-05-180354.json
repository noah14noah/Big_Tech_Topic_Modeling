Ben Chu: \"McKinsey's fingerprints can be found at the scene of some of the most spectacular corporate and financial debacles[1] of recent decades.\" And that list of McKinsey achievements includes scandals as diverse as Enron, ICE, the dismembering of Jamal Khashoggi (which Mayo Pete is not accused of participating in), China's Uyghur concentration camps... and, of course, McKinsey is in it up to their eyeballs in both Ukraine and Turkey.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EtK4zUMuWtM/Xa9EIsE5xII/AAAAAAABq2A/id6L9jN6ALoesJwLmi9NGne5jW08FGtOwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-22%2Bat%2B9.44.55%2BAM.pngNorman\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EtK4zUMuWtM/Xa9EIsE5xII/AAAAAAABq2A/id6L9jN6ALoesJwLmi9NGne5jW08FGtOwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-22%2Bat%2B9.44.55%2BAM.pngNorman</url> Solomon's essay for Common Dreams this week, Beware, Pete Buttigieg Is a Sharp Corporate Tool[2], is an apt warning about how dangerous Mayo Pete is and what an inappropriate candidate he is for Democrats. \"With the mutual alignment of Buttigieg and his corporate healthcare-industry donors,\" wrote Solomon, \"Mayor Pete's approach seems to be a case of a flimflamming candidate who poses as a forthright leader. [He] burst on the national scene early this year as a new sort of presidential candidate. But it turns out he's a very old kind-- a glib ally of corporate America posing as an advocate for working people and their families. That has become apparent this fall as Buttigiegescalateshis offensive against Medicare for All.\" A not-funny thing has happened to Buttigieg on the campaign trail. As he kept collecting big checks from corporate executives and wealthy donors, he went from being 'all for[3]' a single-payer Medicare for All systemin Januaryto trashing itin the debate last weekas a plan that would kick '150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years.' The demagoguery wonpraisefrom corporate media outlets.Those outlets have often lauded Buttigieg for his fundraising totals this year without scrutiny of the funding sources. They skew toward the wealthy-- and toward donors with a vested interest in protecting the status quo.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_LWf0A7iENg/Xa9EkMapsuI/AAAAAAABq2I/ybAz-GJP0pAVeEtrNXJJTZ13gciu1nPYQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-22%2Bat%2B10.26.22%2BAM.png...The\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_LWf0A7iENg/Xa9EkMapsuI/AAAAAAABq2I/ybAz-GJP0pAVeEtrNXJJTZ13gciu1nPYQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-22%2Bat%2B10.26.22%2BAM.png...The</url> sordid story of Buttigieg's about-face on Medicare for All was well-documented and deftly analyzed days ago byJezebelwriter Esther Wang under the headline A Brief History of Pete Buttigieg Faking It on Medicare for All[4]. She observed: Buttigieg is not the only Democratic presidential candidate who has switched positions on supporting Medicare for All, or isjust generally usingthe public and political confusion around the issue to undermine real efforts to move to a universalsystem. Kamala Harris, who co-sponsoredBernie Sanders' Senate bill, has consistently waffled, and has settledon a plan that continues to let private insurers play a role. But Buttigieg is the only candidate who is now making opposition to the Sanders- and Warren-backed Medicare for All a central focus of his campaign. ...As for Buttigieg's slippery slogan of 'Medicare for all who want it,' Rep. Ro Khannapointed outthat such a setup 'won't bring the administrative costs down of private insurers or maximize negotiation with Big Pharma and hospitals.' And: 'This means higher premiums, higher drug costs, higher deductibles, and more denied claims for the middle class.'...Buttigieg has joined with Joe Biden to open up a well-funded, double-barreled assault on Medicare for All.'I am tired of seeing Democrats defend a dysfunctional healthcare system where 87 million people are uninsured or underinsured and 30,000 people die every year because they lack adequate coverage,' Bernie Sanders wrote last Friday in an email to supporters. 'So I was disappointed this week to see that Joe Biden used the talking points of the health insurance industry to attack Medicare for All and our campaign.'While Buttigieg is not strong in national polls right now, he'spolling notably well in Iowa, where the first voting for the Democratic presidential nomination will occur in early-February caucuses. And with $23.4 million in the bank, he's got much more money in hand than Biden ($9 million). The only rivals with more money than Buttigieg are the two he's assailing for their resolute support of Medicare for All-- Sanders ($33.7 million) and Warren ($25.7 million).While I personally support Sanders, I'm equally appalled by Buttigieg's attacks on Warren. As part of a campaign strategy that aims to undermine both of his progressive opponents, the mayor continues to falsely characterize Medicare for All-- no matter how much confusion and disinformation he creates along the way.Whether or not Pete Buttigieg can win the nomination, he has certainly emerged as a sharp corporate tool.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bofxT09_8p0/Xa9GRfgYfSI/AAAAAAABq2s/DFxw0gPVZ441HmcivDWvgWeoyIQ2ghizACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/MayorPete.jpgYesterday\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bofxT09_8p0/Xa9GRfgYfSI/AAAAAAABq2s/DFxw0gPVZ441HmcivDWvgWeoyIQ2ghizACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/MayorPete.jpgYesterday</url>, Tucker Higgins, reporting for CNBC, noted[5] that Mayo Pete (new nickname: Mayor Elite?) has hired Sonal Shah, a former Goldman Sachs vice president and Google executive as his national policy director. And... over at Bloomberg[6], a team of reporters wrote that the Silicon Valley CEOs are pushing Pete. \"The technology industry is looking for something different in a president in 2020. And it appears Pete Buttigieg is their candidate... California's deep-pocketed Silicon Valley is donating to the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana over the former vice president by a 5-to-1 margin... 'Well-educated recognizes well-educated,' Moran said, adding that Buttigieg could have come to Silicon Valley after graduating from Harvard as many Ivy League graduates do.

'His message is consistent with innovation and forward-looking technology. He has not given the impression that he would threaten their interests.'While he hasn't said much about competition and antitrust, Buttigieg has focused on improving regulations as opposed to breaking up big tech.'We're going to need to empower the FTC to be able to intervene, including blocking or reversing mergers, in cases where there's anti-competitive behavior by tech companies,' he said in a CNN town hall in April, referring to the Federal Trade Commission.Buttigieg was his high school's valedictorian and went on to Harvard, where he befriended two roommates of future Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and was one of the first 300 users on the social media platform. He was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, joined McKinsey .... as a consultant, and volunteered for Barack Obama's tech-savvy 2008 presidential campaign before joining the U.S. Navy Reserve and serving in Afghanistan.His relationship with Zuckerberg persisted. Zuckerberg, 35, visited South Bend in 2017 while doing research for his philanthropic organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and got a personal tour from Buttigieg. That relationship lasted into this year, when Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, recommended two people that Buttigieg ultimately hired for his campaign. Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Zuckerberg and Chan, said the couple hasn't yet decided whom to support for president.California voters have an unusually large influence in choosing the party's nominee this cycle. The state primary next year is in March instead of its previous June slot and its donors contributed 1 of every 5 dollars raised by the party's presidential candidates in the first six months of this year, data from the Center for Responsive Politics show.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6TZvCRvn4aA/Xa9FBbpeHMI/AAAAAAABq2U/nVGy6YWUWNAdl0tuPmygODWaPZ3fCo2_ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-22%2Bat%2B10.50.57%2BAM.pngButtigieg\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6TZvCRvn4aA/Xa9FBbpeHMI/AAAAAAABq2U/nVGy6YWUWNAdl0tuPmygODWaPZ3fCo2_ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-22%2Bat%2B10.50.57%2BAM.pngButtigieg</url> is second only to home-state senator Kamala Harris in the percentage of his campaign money that comes from California.

Gavin Newsom wants California corporations to match the $500 million he is setting aside to build middle-income, workforce housing.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday called on Silicon Valley companies powering the states economy to step up and match the money he intends to set aside to build workforce housing, in an effort to ease Californias housing crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking to reporters after unveiling his first proposed budget as Californias new governor  which earmarks $500 million for the creation of middle-income housing  Newsom said he expects corporate California to help build the state out of its housing shortage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to see the Valley step up and match our contributions, he said. The workforce housing issues have been exacerbated by the success of a lot of these companies. I do not begrudge other people's success, but that success has created burdens and stress, and we are doing our part, and I would be asking them to do their part to amplify our efforts, to match those efforts and to increase our capacity to deliver.</p><p>Newsom did not provide specifics on how he would get California companies to cough up that money, but he said he already has been having quiet conversations to move his plan forward.</p><p>In all, Newsoms proposed budget includes $7.7 billion to address housing and homelessness.\u00a0He intends to give grants to encourage local governments to build housing, expand the state tax credits used to fund affordable housing, use state properties for affordable housing development and do more to hold cities accountable when they fail to meet their state-mandated housing goals.</p><p>Carl Guardino, president and CEO of business-backed public policy and advocacy organization the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, welcomed the governors challenge to local companies.</p><p>It is serious money, he said. And we have a serious need, with employers seriously concerned about it. So I think the timing is right.</p><p>But while California companies have an opportunity\u00a0to play a role in relieving the regions housing shortage, they dont have a responsibility to do so, Guardino said. Thats because the problem isnt their fault.</p><p>What we want to make clear, he said, in the next economic downturn, jobs are no longer going to be a four-letter word, as they seem to have become.</p><p>Guardino said his group, which counts all the Valleys big tech companies among its members, also has been in talks with local companies, coalitions and foundations about investing in housing creation. He said he expects announcements about specific commitments to come soon.</p><p>Facebook and Google, both of which are expanding their campuses, declined to comment on Newsoms budget remarks.</p><p>Affordable housing advocates for years have been pressuring and cajoling Silicon Valley companies to do more. Cash-flush tech companies that flood the region with high-paying jobs\u00a0and bring in new workers often are blamed for the shortage of housing that has choked the region and driven home and rent prices sky-high. Here and there, companies have been chipping in to address the problem.</p><p>In November, Cisco, LinkedIn and Pure Storage donated a total of $20 million to nonprofit Housing Trust Silicon Valley to build affordable homes. Cisco pledged $50 million to fight homelessness in Silicon Valley in March. Meanwhile, Facebook has raised nearly $20 million for affordable housing through its Catalyst Housing Fund, and Salesforce has made several donations to fight homelessness in the Bay Area. Google is planning to include up to 8,000 homes on a new campus in the North Bayshore area of Mountain View.</p><p>While those efforts have been piecemeal, Newsoms words on Thursday may bring\u00a0more companies to the effort, said Michael Lane, deputy director of affordable housing advocacy organization SV@Home. And its not just Newsoms words  its also the $500 million set aside for middle-income housing.\u00a0Companies likely will be more willing to invest once they see the cash Newsom already has put forward, Lane said.</p><p>To have the state step in as a strong partner with a new governor, I think that sends a strong signal, he said.</p><p>Lane said hes excited to work with the Newsom to address the shortage of housing, which Lane called an existential crisis marring California.</p><p>This is the most exciting budget around housing, he said, that Ive ever seen in my career.</p><p>Rufus Jeffris, spokesman for the pro-business Bay Area Council, agreed, and commended the governor for his interest in reforming some of the hurdles that restrict housing development, such as building fees and environmental regulations.</p><p>Businesses absolutely want to do their part to help address California's housing crisis, he wrote in an email. They also want to see meaningful progress in fixing state and local policies that are largely to blame for creating that crisis over many decades.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-5914691</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V5H-SG91-JCX4-62DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Do you think that this time around, the government focus would be on privatisation of PSUs?They may have no choice. </p><p>Let us be very clear, what has brought them here is the clear brutal focus on the broad-based economy. We in Mumbai and south Delhi would like to believe that we are where it matters but I do not think that the focus is somewhere else. We are important but ancillary to the process. The important thing to focus on is what is going to give a larger uplift to the economy as a whole and if that means greater thrust on infrastructure in the rural space, agriculture stress, etc, These will really be the focal points they need to look at. In order to arrive at that, you probably need to spend a lot of money which is where things like... When NDA-1 came to power, we saw similar kind of market action from PSU banks to PSU mining companies to construction companies. People were blown away with the NDA-1 mandate. The promise and the appeal was so extra-ordinary that it led to a complete magical re-rating of Indian markets. But after five years of the NDA-1, we see that Nifty has simply mapped global markets. This is history rhyming again. Initial euphoria could be back to global cues, earnings and other factors.There is a small subtle difference I want to make out. Markets tell a story that we may not always hear. It is not that the PSUs move as a basket, but where the risk of dilution does not exist, it moves. Why do multinational pharmas continue to rule at higher multiples. They do not raise capital.Because they do not raise capital. You are at that inflexion point as far as PSU banks is concerned because most of them are down to the 50-55% range, at least the two-three big boys which matter. NTPC, SBI, which are the other ones which matter?The PSU banks I am saying. SBI is the big one which is down...Bank of Baroda for instance and some of these namesThey may be in the middling fifties in terms of government ownership, may not be at the 75-80 where there is scope for capital raising through the market. If that is kind of limited and the government broadly believes that 51% is a Laxman Rekha and no further, then for the first time that growth will come through internal efficiency improvements, not dollops of equity that come from outside.  The first fundamental reason why I will be very bullish on PSU banks names and top two-three really matter, I may not name them but these are going to be growing essentially through organic expansion, efficiency, better NPA recognition, etc. Most of the problems are behind them. I think that could be a secular bull market in PSU banks.  Is that the case with oil marketing companies, etc? No, because, you never know if there is large profits coming in and the government could well step in and say we want to prune profits, we want to cap marketing margins, blah, blah, blah... Those kind of things still exist. Why? Because at the end of the day, the surplus the government is generating for many of these. The PSU banks now I think have stopped giving out surpluses. It is in fact an area which needs capital and the government is happy that they access the capital markets rather than come to the government for money. So from that perspective, the PSU bank is different from the PSU space as a whole. But if you ask me what happens to SAIL etc, those are completely different issues. They may still need capital. You are not willing to look at them just yet...I do not think so. This is a market you need to be brutally focussed on stocks because the same sector you could have stocks that go burst and stocks that hit new 52-week high and that is going to happen. Look at the aviation space, It is going to be a brutal discretion between one stock and the other. In every industry, you will find this but there may be some stocks that have that tailwinds of growth.  For instance, the road sector could get huge orders because one of the manifesto mentions if you will is that there is connectivity both digitally and physically which means they are going to have ride down to the smallest talukas, etc. You are going to have connectivity digitally and you got to have roads, bridges, highways, etc, built. It has been seen that that ministry has actually performed exceptionally well in the first NDA regime as well.  Given that kind of thing and then there could be the other mention which is pipe water to people down the length and breadth of India. You could look at companies that are in the space and draw your own conclusion -- three or four companies will be huge beneficiaries of orders.  At the end of the day, whether these orders are profitable, etc, etc, different question but at least in terms of a space, the infrastructure and the pipe space could be an interesting place. I mentioned PSU banks. The transport infrastructure which means aviation could be one, roads could be the other, railways could be the other and they could be beneficiaries of these.  All of these represent benefits to the mass as a whole and the base of the pyramid sort of moves up. In the first two years, money is going to be spent on these two. Where will the money come from? It has to be privatisation. I do not see any other way or you have serious FDI flow in and the FDI window opening up dramatically. I think those are the areas. A bullet train from Ahmadabad to Mumbai is not relevant, but deep down connectivity is big. It could generate employment. It could generate some kind of capital formation in the private space which otherwise today is lacking. The government needs to be on the front foot for spending money. Who else is going to spend?  You have fleetingly mentioned aviation and since the last time that we talked, we are down to two listed players now and within one as well....Well not listed players. We still have three listed players. So what happens now? Do warring promoters worry you or are you fine with the growth and the kind of guidance and capacity addition that is happening?The space itself is evolving. There have been people in the past that have been in the space and new players have come up, etc. That is part and parcel of any kind of industry. There will be a lot more action. There is a lot that is still waiting to happen. I think it is unfortunate what has happened to Jet but I do not believe it is down and out. But in this kind of transaction historically do you think minority shareholders will get their lease of life or will there be anything left on the table? Look at Bhushan Steel and Tatas. The Tatas may have got a good deal, the banks may have got good deal but frankly for minority shareholder the CDR and all and what happened to....So if you take finance 1.0 or now 2.0 or 3.0, it says basically that in a liquidation scenario a going concern is different. But these are not going concerns situations. The debt guys have to be paid off first. When the debt guys start taking haircuts, where is the question of equity guys getting anything? They are below the pecking order very clearly. So do not buy Jet?Well, you can infer that but the issue is not about one specific thing or the other, I am not even remotely alluding to stocks because I could be conflicted, in fact, I will be conflicted but I think the important thing is where shareholders have to wait for debt holders to get paid off and the restructuring is through courts etc. Very often, if not in all cases, the equity holders will just get finished. That is very clear. What about the market leader, any worry with regards to what is going on with the promoters?I think commerce and economics are big levellers. These things will get sorted out.In their better interest?Absolutely, no question.You talked about public sector banks, infrastructure, key drivers post the solid election verdict, consumption did not figure on that list. Does it figure at all?Not really. I will tell you why. There is a very good reason and there is also shades of consumption across durables. But the real issue the availability of debt and NBFCs. In the first flush of panic, people said this will happen. The NBFCs by definition were well capitalised, but at the root of an NBFC business plan is a simple thing which is that equity will keep coming but there is leverage, whether four times, five times, six times, depends on the euphoria and the exuberance of promoters. That leverage needs to keep getting paid down to banks because these are regular payments and to bond holders and keep getting supplemented back.  The moment you tell an NBFC that you will start paying down your debts, but we are not going to give you fresh money, it is actually an executive summary of please close down shop because then even people who owe you money will turn around and say they have shut shop, what is the point in giving more money?  That means the people who have borrowed for progressive payment of their houses, builders who have been given Rs 150 crores in five stages, if they give the first two stages and say you are not getting the balance, they will turn around and say let it be an NPA, re-posses kar lo kya farak padta hai (Let's repossess it. What's the difference?)So we are yet to see the worst of the NBFC crisis?The way I see it, this is 35% of virtually all credit in the market. Suddenly people say go from 9:1 or 6:1 to 2:1. First of all you cannot do that overnight, you cannot crunch debt like this. Number two, the RBI still seems to be in denial that there is a problem in the space. Yesterday, where there has been a clarion call for liquidity, they came in and start talking about norms for fresh lendings being even more restrictive which essentially means that somewhere along the line, we are walking on completely two different alleys as it were. Somebody is calling for liquidity, now you could turn around and say that this leverage was never okay but the reality is and you will need to understand this when a bank lends a Rs 100 to an NBFC, they put aside Rs 10 as capital. The NBFC lends to you and me as MSME or small finance and they put aside Rs 10-15 further of capital.  So the money that goes to the banking system to you and me is Rs 20-25 of capital because the capital adequacy is based on two layers of lending. The moment it goes from bank to you and me a) the bank does not have the mechanism, it is only a one time capital that is there and b), the recovery is far better in the hands of NBFCs than in banks which is the reason why para banking came in, will remain and is there in every part of the world.  You can be restrictive etc but these have to be phased out. The moment you say liquidity comes down and they are financing all your durables, the consumption that you talk about, is going to be affected until the liquidity in this sector continues. One Bajaj Finance or a set of HDFCs cannot address all needs of affordable housing, all needs of durables, all needs for white goods etc. It is a reality. The purist would say NBFCs forgot risk management. They completely forgot about ALM....I do not think that is true. What they did forget was they assumed that credit would continue coming to them. The source of capital would be infinite.But what triggered this off was this IL&amp;FS which is not an NBFC. IL&amp;FS is a core investment company under which there is an NBFC which lends and there were all kinds of violations that are coming out in IL&amp;FS which has nothing to do with the way 95% of the NBFCs in the market run, which is reality, NBFCs report into RBI. I think a greater oversight is called for, maybe norms should...  I think that is what they have issued last Friday?But they are more restrictive. Right now, in the short run it is like saying the patient is in ICU he needs ABCD, no, no. In general, he should not be walking 20 kms a day, let us make sure he only walks 10. That is great, if he survives. The heightened anxiety of the market is not resonating with the regulators who tend to believe that one or two players may have an issue but they may die, they may get consolidated, maybe they will, but there is an opportunity here for a lot of foreign capital to walk in. We have seen perhaps Piramals are talking to different...So different people in different forms, different buckets of the NBFC space are bringing in capital and hopefully will get in foreign debt as well to supplement the unwillingness, if not the inability of the Indian banks to lend. My point is these prices will not come back. All this consumption slowdown, the market has already digested all of that. Are these not levels where you should be maybe start nibbling into at least the market leaders?That presupposes a return of consumption and return of normalcy of some of this, we have not seen any steps taken. To me, consumption is not a slam dunk buy, it may have been for a long time and as they say new regimes, new markets bring new leaders. Maybe it is time that we start focussing on a lot more of the beaten down and a lot more selectively. So, it may not be an across the board. The index is very misleading. 80%, if not 90% of the market is at 25% below. These, may have moved up a little bit but I think we need to look at some of that.  I do not think it is going to be very easy hiding in the same pockets and expecting returns.In the next five years, will leadership remain with HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance or will there be new leaders who will displace them?That is a very tough call to make. They are doing perfectly well whether they get displaced I do not know but the question is will you get better returns from other stocks, the answer may be yes. In the Nifty?Whether within the Nifty or outside, so you look at stocks that...I am sure you would in the next five years...You know it is not easy for me to make that kind of a call because there are so many moving parts and I do not want to hazard a guess. ET Now: So they could be outside financials too?N Jayakumar: In fact I personally think PSU banks could be a very big place for returns for all the reasons that we talked about. Do we differentiate between the kind of returns we may see on the index versus what we may seen on select names?I think the index returns may well be muted because I think the index at the end of the day attracts ETF money, ETF money is a function of what happens internationally and as we know we are in the throes of slowdown in various parts of the world where interest rates are coming off reflecting that, oil has not cooled off. So, the cocktail is not particularly exciting and then there is also this overhang of the US-China trade war which could be beneficial to valued added textiles which could move from China to here. There could be some chemical exports from here, maybe pharma benefits.  It has become more noisy and I think the overhang of a US-China imbroglio could be huge, the fact that the world has been hiding in the big tech names, that could change. There are a lot of things that could change, especially the fact that ETF money coming in is entirely the function of what happens to flows in emerging markets allocation and we have already been outperforming.  Of course, there has been some catching up to do which we have done. I am not sure the index is necessarily the place to hide only because the allocation of money gets there and definitely as a stock picker in the market I would not just put my money on the index and while people may allocate, and they still come out ahead but for true stock pickers I think the answer lies elsewhere for sure.

It's hard to see why these companies wouldn't want to get bigger,\" she said, referring to companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Sundararajan also said that these tech companies are becoming \"too big to fail\" and most promising start ups get folded into one of these big companies. Sundararajan made these remarks at a panel discussion hosted by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) here in New Delhi on September 24. The panel also discussed about the importance of access to non-personal data and who should claim ownership of it (see below).</p><p>BJP's Baijayant Panda, also a panellist, countered Sundararajan's argument by saying that \"with the growth of China and the growth of big tech in China, American companies are saying that if you [US government] break us up, or if you impose more onerous regulations on us, you are affecting our ability to compete with the Chinese. So you [US government] need to be fair and promote America, if you want to make America great. Again, if you want America to become the innovation hub in the world, which is taking by China, you'll have to let us alone, don't break us up, don't put us under\".</p><p>'Don't have a deterministic view on data localisation': Sundararajan</p><p>Sundararajan also said that she hadn't made her mind on data localisation yet. But, she said that companies like Apple and Amazon have been reaching out to Indians to build up their AI. \"Let's look at AI and Indian languages, right? If we have another one or two years of the same pace at which Siri or an Alexa is interacting with the Indian populace, they would have just built up such powerful AI engines, that no matter what, for the next 50 years, hundred years, you just cannot overtake them,\" Sundararajan said.</p><p>Panda meanwhile said that Facebook's Nick Clegg, who met India's home and IT minister recently, made a strong argument for open and free access to data without insisting on it being localised is the way to go. \"But I don't believe that the verdict is out yet [on data localisation]. Look at what China has done. And we may not like the outcome of that because it fragments the internet. But, you have to also recognise another byproduct of what they have done is that they have created enormous local capacity, they've created enormous giant organizations of their own and not to mention have taken the lead in certain areas such as in 5G, and AI,\" Panda added.</p><p>Who owns our non-personal data?</p><p>MediaNama's founder and editor, Nikhil Pahwa, who was in the audience asked the panel as to who should claim ownership of non-personal data. \"As far as I can see whatever's not personal information is intellectual property of a company. So, how does this play out in the global intellectual property regime if you are forcing companies to do compulsory licensing of their data to any startup that wants it [the data] because that's essentially what's been talked about in the context of non-personal data and sharing of data,\" said Pahwa.</p><p>To that, Sundararajan said that anonymised community data can be of critical value in the future. \"There's a company in Bangalore, which by just harvesting the data of traffic flows developed this global engine, which they are now marketing internationally as one of the most efficient engines for predicting data flows and managing data flows. Now, there is no reason for India to have a stance [on non-personal data] in perpetuity. But, let's say all my agricultural data which you collect, whereby, you'd probably be able to predict, where's the water shortage. Where is it that the greens are with productivity is going up? Let's not forget that community data, anonymised data also has huge value. It will be of critical value in the future,\" she added.</p><p>She further retorted by arguing, \"So, are we saying that we will sign off all this to some random company that just manages to collect this data, and therefore, India and Indians will have no right to use this data?

Illegal?\" Trump\u00a0said in his tweet, adding that \"96% of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google &amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That 96 percent figure probably comes from an  article I wrote at PJ Media about what happened when I plugged \"Trump\" into the search engine's \"News\" tab. Let me be clear: While suspicions about inherent biases being baked into the systems at Google and other tech platforms are certainly warranted, I do not believe that government regulations are the answer to that problem. </p><p>In my article, I reported that 96 of 100 results returned were from left-leaning news outlets. In fact, nearly one-fourth of the results (21) were from CNN. (To determine which sites were right- or left-leaning  , I used \u00a0a   chart  from former CBS   News   correspondent Sharyl   Attkisson  .) I stressed in my report that my research was not scientific and that it included only a small sample size (100   results). I did, however,\u00a0 link to a report  from a reputable online-traffic software company that studied 2,000   search results and found that left-leaning sites received far more hits on hot-button political issues than right-leaning sites. </p><p>The president, who likely saw a story on Lou Dobbs's Fox Business Network show about my piece, took that 96 percent figure and ran with it, calling for an investigation into the \"rigged\" search results and suggesting that the government might need to regulate big tech companies.</p><p>As a conservative who tends to be rather libertarian on tech issues, I beg to disagree. The government has no business regulating private companies for their political views, and it would set a dangerous precedent to do so in this case. Government regulation would only make things worse. The Internet would be less free, and fewer voices would be allowed to have a say.</p><p>That said, I'm sympathetic to fears that conservative voices will be silenced. Media reports, including one by\u00a0Chris Cillizza at CNN, have been quick to lump Trump's tweets - and by association my article - into the category of an Alex Jones-style conspiracy theory, without putting it into context. Many of the media outlets chafed at being branded as a left-leaning site.</p><p>Here's a dirty little secret of the news business: No media outlet is unbiased. Even if a site isn't blatantly partisan, its biases come out in story choices and headlines that lead readers to certain positions, encouraging them to care about the things the media outlet thinks are important.</p><p>There have been plenty of credible reports over the past two years claiming anti-conservative bias at the Big Three Internet platforms, including the 2016 revelation that Facebook\u00a0had routinely suppressed conservative outlets in the network's \"trending\" news section. Further, when Alphabet-owned YouTube\u00a0pulls down and demonetizes mainstream conservative content from sites such as PragerU, it certainly gives the impression that the company has its thumb on the scale.</p><p>Many, including my PJ Media colleague Roger L. Simon,\u00a0have suggested that there should be an investigation into whether these behemoth tech companies are violating antitrust laws. The president seems to share that sentiment, as does his economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who said Tuesday that the White House is \"taking a look\" at regulating Google.</p><p>There is no easy answer to this problem. But perhaps a better approach would be for consumers to refuse to let big tech companies dictate what news they see. These companies - cocooned in their Silicon Valley bubble where tech leaders\u00a0are, by and large, liberal - don't understand the flyover states and the people who live there. I'm not optimistic that these companies are motivated to fix this problem on their own or change their hiring practices to include a balance of liberal and conservative voices. And they shouldn't have to.</p><p>Rather, users should be proactive in seeking sites and sources they trust. When you find a site you like, visit it regularly and turn off your ad blocker or pay for a subscription. It costs money to pay writers and run a website, and if you're not willing to subsidize organizations you like, they might not exist in the very near future, leaving all of us at the mercies of Silicon Valley algorithms.</p><p>I wrote in my article at PJ Media that these big tech companies have the power to influence elections and even the state of democracy itself. I stand by that statement. And while the president might have gone too far in calling for government intervention, I agree that Americans need to pay attention to this issue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-0d3e52b8abc311e88a0c70b618c98d3c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4V-MBP1-DXKP-J3F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><timeReceived>7:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 29, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGF</classCode><className>LIBERAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000369</classCode><className>CONSPIRACY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0FGMDkyQTE0NTI1NEUyNkE0NjUxM0E2OTBDQjQ0NUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBMzM3QjFDOTcxNENCNzhBNTE0MzVGMzBBMzdERUY</classCode><className>Conspiracy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001333</classCode><className>PLATFORMS &amp;

Continue reading Jack Dorsey is in for the fight of his life</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The most feared investor in America  has Twitter s CEO in his sights</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Were there not a deadly coronavirus spreading across the globe, I suspect more of us might be talking about a different disruption to life as we know it: the potential end of Jack Dorsey s latest tenure as the CEO of Twitter.</p><p>Dorsey cofounded Twitter, was its first CEO, and returned in 2015 as its fourth. Throughout that time, he has been one of the more unconventional leaders in business. As recounted in Nick Bilton s history of the company s early years, Hatching Twitter, Dorsey was forced out of the job initially because he spent too much time doing yoga and attending fashion design classes.</p><p>When he returned as CEO in 2015, replacing Dick Costolo, it was just as improbable. The board had said initially it would consider only a full-time employee to run the company. By that point Dorsey had founded a second successful business, the payments company Square, and was leading it as CEO. But after a search, Twitter s board   of which Dorsey was then chairman   settled on him anyway, and he has led it ever since.</p><p>It has been a rocky tenure. For most of Dorsey s time as CEO, Twitter has been unprofitable. It has not offered much product innovation, nor has it acquired its way to significant user growth. Like other tech platforms, it was exploited productively by Russia during the 2016 election. The company has made many, many promises about what it might do eventually, starting with its unyielding problem with users harassing one another, and then mostly under-delivered.</p><p>Then there is the question of stock price   the metric that, for good and bad, all CEOs are ultimately held accountable to. Since he returned, Twitter shares are down 6.2 percent, Bloomberg reported last week, while Facebook s are up 121 percent.</p><p>(Also Dorsey plans to decamp to somewhere in Africa at some point this year, for an unspecified length of time. Lot going on with this man!)</p><p>It is not difficult, in short, to make a case against Jack Dorsey, and now someone has. The activist investor Elliott Management Corp. has taken a roughly 4 percent stake in Twitter and has now put forth four nominees to the company s board, with the goal of replacing Dorsey as CEO.</p><p>In Axios, Dan Primack argues Elliott s case:</p><p>  Dorsey only can devote part of his attention to Twitter, given that he also runs payments company Square (in which he has a larger financial interest). And this is only exacerbated by Dorsey s plans to spend much of 2020 in Africa, to better understand the continent s fintech revolution (i.e., something that is much more pertinent to Square than to Twitter).</p><p>Twitter under Dorsey has experienced consistent executive turnover and has repeatedly dropped the product innovation ball (particularly in mothballing Vine, which was TikTok before TikTok).</p><p>What is this Elliott Management Corp.? It s a hedge fund led by the billionaire Paul Singer. Sheelah Kolhatkar profiled him in the New Yorker in 2018. Kolhatkar described Singer as  </p><p>one of the most powerful, and most unyielding, investors in the world. Singer, who is seventy-three, with a trim white beard and oval spectacles, is deeply involved in everything Elliott does. The firm has many kinds of investments, but Singer is best known as an  activist  investor, using his fund s resources about thirty-five billion dollars to buy stock in companies in which it detects weaknesses. Elliott then pressures the company to make changes to its business, with the goal of improving the stock price. Elliott s executives say that most of their investment campaigns proceed without significant conflict, but a noticeable number seem to end up mired in drama. A signature Elliott tactic is the release of a letter harshly criticizing the target company s C.E.O., which is often followed by the executive s resignation or the sale of the company. One of Singer s few unsuccessful campaigns, to block a merger within Samsung, eventually led to the impeachment and imprisonment of the South Korean President after Singer s opponents became so desperate to fend off his attack that they allegedly began bribing government officials. From the outside, it can seem as if Elliott is causing the drama, but the firm argues that it simply identifies pre\u00ebxisting problems and acts as a check on the system.</p><p>Activist investing is controversial: critics believe that it can force companies to lay off workers and curtail investment in new products in favor of schemes that boost short-term profits, while proponents view it as a useful source of pressure on C.E.O.s to reduce waste and manage their companies more effectively. In the press, Singer and similar investors have been compared to vultures, wolves, and hyenas. Bloomberg has called Singer  aggressive, tenacious and litigious to a fault,  anointing him  The World s Most Feared Investor.  Singer s ventures have been consistently successful, with average annual returns of almost fourteen per cent, making him and his employees enormously wealthy. The mere news that Elliott has invested in a company often causes its stock price to go up creating even more wealth for Elliott. Singer has been deploying his riches in Republican politics, where he is one of the G.O.P. s top donors and a powerful influence on the Party and its President. According to those who know Singer, in politics, as in business, he is intent on doing whatever it takes to win.</p><p>To reiterate: the world s most feared investor now has Jack Dorsey in his sights. What happens next?</p><p>In the short term, employees and allies have rallied around Dorsey. On Monday, internal pro-Dorsey discussions bubbled onto Twitter itself, where a few dozen employees tweeted with the hashtag #WeBackJack. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who recently appeared via FaceTime at Twitter s annual employee conference, tweeted his support as well, posting that Dorsey has  a good [heart emoji]. </p><p>In the long term, Bloomberg s Matt Levine speculates that the move might push more founders to seek dual-class voting stock to insulate them from activist investors like Singer. That s what Mark Zuckerberg did at Facebook, and later Evan Spiegel did at Snap. Noting that Snap is in a far worse financial position than Twitter   and facing zero consequences from investors over it, because they have no real means of legal resource   Levine writes:</p><p>An Elliott-led ejection of a public-company CEO is not a pretty sight. (One CEO deposed by Elliott memorably commented that  when he began to research Elliott online, the experience was like  Googling this thing on your arm and it says,  You re going to die.   ) If you re a public investor and you bought shares of Snap in its IPO, the experience might lead you to object to dual-class stock in future IPOs. But if you re a tech founder and you watch Elliott wage an ugly proxy fight to get rid of Jack Dorsey for the venial sin of working half-days at his company, the experience might lead you to insist on dual-class stock in your own IPO. Twitter is a little bad, and its founder is in the crosshairs of big scary Elliott; Snap is worse, and its founders are fine because they had the foresight to prevent this. The whole point of dual-class stock is to protect tech founders from Elliott so that they can follow their bliss in a long-term visionary way!</p><p>But the most interesting question is the least answerable question, and that s what happens in the medium term. Which is to say: can Dorsey survive this? The experience of previous CEOs whom Singer has put through the ringer suggests that the answer might well be no. The case against Twitter leadership over the past decade is thick and damning, and promising it will all get better in the future won t play as well with a hedge fund as it has on the podcast circuit.</p><p>At the same time, it s at least a little curious that Singer is making his move now, when Twitter has become consistently profitable, returned to user growth, and finally started to pick up the pace of product development. It s still easy to make the case that Twitter can and should be much bigger and better than it is   it just feels a bit rude to make that case when the company finally, and to the surprise of many of those of us who have covered it for the past decade, begins to turn it around.</p><p>But business ain t beanbag, and  good enough  clearly isn t cutting it for Paul Singer. Unless something changes dramatically, it would appear that Jack Dorsey is in for the fight of his life.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PUSHBACK</emphasis></h><p>Yesterday in the newsletter I wrote  Today Facebook is arguably the entry point to technology for most people.

Everything you think about, when you start to worry, you make rules and laws,\" Ma said. \"I worry about Europe, and I worry about the worries of Europe.\"</p><p/><p>Ma's comments come as the European Union looks to tighten technology regulations. Last year, the continent put in place the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a set of rules for all companies that have operations in the region to ensure they gather personal data legally and protect that data from being misused.</p><p/><p>This week, the European Commission, representing nations such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Britain, joined New Zealand's rallying call to curb online extremism through a series of measures aimed at holding tech companies more accountable for content published on their platforms.</p><p/><p>And in April, the EU released guidelines on developing artificial intelligence (AI) ethically.</p><p/><p>Ma suggested worries about AI and the dangers it presented were overblown, pointing out that while AI could be used for bad, it could also be used for good.</p><p/><p>He used Alibaba as an example. The company uses AI to \"catch a lot of thieves\" who wish to steal from the millions of payment transactions made on its platform every day.</p><p/><p>\"[Europe worries] that you don't have the solution to artificial intelligence, that it may destroy a lot of things ... forget it,\" Ma said. \"Bad guys are using artificial \u00adintelligence to do bad things, but we're using artificial intelligence to catch bad guys [on Alibaba].\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-23cb1c5e-784c-11e9-933d-71f872cf659b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4H-51R1-JC8V-135P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 South China Morning Post Ltd.

The chief executive of global liquor giant Diageo, whose favourite tipple is incidentally Johnnie Walker black label with ice and soda, would send tremors through his industry, which has spent 15 years promoting responsible consumption.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is not likely to happen. Menezes comes across as a moderate drinker whose mantra is that his Guinness-to-Gordon's empire can prosper if consumers drink better, not more. That means trading up to premium brands rather than bulk buying own-label vodka.</p><p>Yet the Apple supremo Tim Cook did something similar at his developer conference in California in June. After tracking data of his mobile phone usage, Cook admitted he was spending more time than he should on his handset.</p><p>It was a watershed moment. For the first time, the technology industry that within a decade has transformed the way we live was suggesting less screen time may be a good thing. Consumers are loathe to admit it, but the dopamine hits of social media - every ping and flash that make us pick up our phone dozens of times an hour - have the addictive hallmarks of nicotine. Imagine how long it has taken Silicon Valley to get to grips with that reality.</p><p>This was not quite Apple's Gerald Ratner moment. Cook was not declaiming his iPhone as \"total crap\", merely that usage should be controlled somehow, with the aid of new time-limit settings for some apps and hidden notifications. So seductive is reaching for the modern smartphone, it is no surprise that its Nokia antecedent was known for its \"candy-bar\" shape.</p><p>It is a moment of clarity that comes for many consumer industries, egged on by public pressure and regulatory threat. Soft-drinks makers chose to reduce sugar instead of facing lower sales that a tax might bring.</p><p>A couple of years ago the boss of Philip Morris International explained to me his hope that the Marlboro giant would stop selling cigarettes in his lifetime. In its place, he is marketing supposedly safer heat-not-burn gadgets. The tobacco industry has left it late to go down the responsible route. It is more than two decades since firms conceded that smoking causes lung cancer and emphysema and spent billions settling legal claims. With shares in Big Tobacco down sharply this year, investors are betting that future growth will be stubbed out.</p><p>The technology sector is a long way from the threat of extinction. One reason is it is still remarkably young and finding its way. Consider it against the motor industry. In the transition from horse-drawn to horse-powered, speed limits were abolished completely. The 70 miles per hour upper limit for motorway drivers was made permanent in 1967 and, amazing to think now, wearing rear seat belts only became compulsory in 1991.</p><p>Metering or monitoring web access sounds like a throwback to the dial-up connections of the 1990s. Consumers have grown accustomed to all-you-can-eat, always-on technology. The tech giants say they are a liberal force for good. Yet there are obvious dangers.</p><p>Technology investor Saul Klein, whose LocalGlobe fund has backed start-ups including Transferwise and Improbable, likens giving a child a smartphone to throwing the car keys to someone who has not taken driving lessons. Efforts to regulate Big Tech can be clunky and slow.</p><p>However, the European Union's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has not been deterred, as her recent $5 billion fine for Google owner Alphabet for abuse of the dominance of its Android mobile operating system shows.</p><p>The Silicon Valley giants are programmed to seek forgiveness, not permission. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has learnt to say sorry in many different ways. Sometimes he even sounds convincing.</p><p>Apple's move is a qualified one. Activist investors called on it to help parents restrict their children's iPhone access and look into the effects of heavy screen usage. And Cook believes it is not his devices that are addictive, but maybe the apps they carry.</p><p>All the same, something changes in September when these new controls are meant to become widely available. It is the sign of a powerful industry growing up and showing humility. It is something that eventually comes to all wildly successful corporations: with giant revenues comes giant responsibility.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTONL-46227618</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T04-5361-JCJY-G447-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"718\"/><timeReceived>12:13 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>standard.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"27119\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 7, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

This is Barry Ritholtz and this week I am thrilled to have sat down with Jim Chanos, hedge fund manager at Kynikos Associates for a very interesting and in-depth conversation; after we were done recording the radio portion, Jim sat around and we kept the tape running.  And there's a ton of podcast extras.  So after the show is done, be sure and listen to the rest of it.   I think it's about 14 hours.  And it's really -- anytime you get the chance to sit at the knee of somebody like Jim Chanos and ask questions and see where they go, you don't want to stop the tape running.  He spoke for a long time and it was absolutely fascinating.  </p><p>      I don't know how many of you who are listening to this know Jim Chanos or are familiar with his work.  But really it's a fascinating legacy.  This is a guy who was an early short seller, who was an early critic of some of the worst excesses of Wall Street, whether it was misbehavior of analysts or accounting fraud or things that companies were doing, that were defrauding and misleading investors.  </p><p>      Jim has the combination of a accountant's ability to dive into the numbers and detective's ability to sniff out nonsense.  And he has done it throughout his whole career.  He's identified a number of tremendous frauds and scams, whether it was Baldwin Piano, which ran an insurance scam on the side, EnronWorldCom, go down the whole list. He has really been crucial to investors in ferreting out fraud and using his skill set to make money for his investors by basically identifying short selling opportunities where there's some bad behavior, fraud, whatever it is.  </p><p>      So this is a wide-ranging and fascinating conversation that I was thrilled to have.  Be sure and check out the podcast extras afterwards.  And on with the show.  </p><p>      (MUSIC PLAYING)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ANNOUNCER</emphasis>:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Today I am thrilled to bring you someone who you may not know who he is, but you actually should.  His name is Jim Chanos. He is the manager of -- let me see if I'm pronouncing this correctly -- Kynikos Associates.  That's Greek for \"cynic.\"  And Jim has built a reputation over 30 years as a spotter of wrongdoing and fraud, a short seller, somebody who's identified a lot of problems with various companies in the market.  </p><p>      Jim, welcome to the show.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JAMES CHANOS, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES</emphasis>:  Thanks, Barry.  Glad to be here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So I've wanted to have you on for a long time because most of the people we speak to are long-term, mostly long only investors, who are looking at here's what you need to do to save money for retirement, or if you're a pension fund or an endowment, here's what you do -- need to do to make sure you stay ahead of inflation.  </p><p>      But your approach as a short seller is completely different.  </p><p>      Why don't you describe that so people have an idea of what you actually do in Kynikos Associates?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, one way to describe it, Barry, is that we are a long-term potential purchasers of equities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  I like that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  The whole idea of fundamental short selling really is select a portfolio of securities, mostly stocks, that are fundamentally overvalued no matter what the market does. that these are companies that, through the normal ebbs and flows of capitalism, are on the downside of their cycle.  </p><p>      And our clients, primarily, are institutions who use us as a hedge to their core equity portfolio.  And so therefore it allows them to be a little bit more aggressive in their equity exposures, knowing that they have part of the portfolio in a small group of companies that will go down over time -- we hope and we think --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You expect.  So the people who are listening to this, who are in the industry, certainly know who you are.  But regular investors, radio listeners may not know who you are.  </p><p>      So let me discuss your curriculum vitae for a second.  You first came into the public eye as an analyst at -- was it Gilford (ph) Securities way back when?  </p><p>      And you had identified one of Wall Street's favorite stocks, which at the time was an insurance company called Baldwin and you had essentially figured out that it was a sham.  It was a giant insurance scam that was cooking their books -- this is a theme we'll come to again and again -- and people mocked the call, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a pretty aggressive articulate that pretty much trashed your analysis and ultimately you had the last laugh, because it's almost quaint to say at the time, when Baldwin went bankrupt, at $9 billion, it was the largest bankruptcy in history, although we know, oh, $9 billion, that's adorable compared to what we've seen since then.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, back then it wasn't so adorable.  </p><p>      Well, Baldwin was -- Baldwin United was the old Baldwin Piano Company, which had morphed under very charismatic CEO into an aggressive seller of insurance products, particularly annuities, through Wall Street.  </p><p>      And therefore it became a Wall Street darling in the early '80s on the back of not only the rapid earnings growth, but also because Wall Street was being paid by Baldwin.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Five percent commission on a policy --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- that buys a lot of goodwill on the street --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, it does.  And particularly when you're offering yields on these insurance products that were as high as 14 percent. The problem was Baldwin wasn't earning anything close to that in its insurance portfolios.  So they ultimately had to begin doing acquisitions and getting insurance department approval to fund those acquisitions with insurance company money, which is highly, highly unusual.  </p><p>      And that was the beginning of the end for them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So you were a kid then.  </p><p>      How old were you when you made that call?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I wrote -- my sense of timing was impeccable.  I put out my first solo recommendation on the company on the absolute bottom of the market, the day that Henry Kaufman (ph) said buys stocks in August of 1982.  I think it was August 17th of 1982.  </p><p>      I said sell the -- or sell this thing short.  And --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  About 25 bucks, is that about right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I think it was about $25.  It went briefly to $20 and then straight to $55.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Doubled.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, it was a good -- it was a good initiation into fundamental short selling.  But the interesting thing about that story was we -- first report when we did a follow-up report was that a lot of the radioactive aspect of Baldwin was hiding in plain sight.  It was -- it was -- you could see it if you looked at the publicly available documents the SEC filings and their insurance company statements, which were public.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So here's the question you're going to hear me ask you repeatedly this afternoon.  </p><p>      How is it that this was in plain view, a $9 billion fraud, and nobody else could spot it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, it wasn't in a lot of people's interest to spot it because the analysts who were covering the company most closely and had buy ratings on this thing were also working for the firms that sold the annuities.  So it was also a good introduction to the whole concept of conflict of interest. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  To say the least.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Exactly.  </p><p>      And number two, you had to do a little bit of digging.  And I think in many ways, not being insurance analysts, just being a young analyst who was learning about insurance, I just simply kept asking questions of things that didn't seem to make sense to me.  And most of the answers had -- were logical but every once in a while, it would come back with something that was just simply nonsensical.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That sounds very familiar.  That reminds me a little bit of what took place so in the future with Enron.  </p><p>      So this was '82.  Most people probably this never entered their radar.  </p><p>      But Enron, on the other hand, entered a lot of people's radar and in fact that's probably how anyone who's a member of the public or the investing community who knows you probably found you through Enron, which is a remarkably similar story.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It was.  And in what would seem even more interesting about it was that not only were the facts at Enron hiding in plain sight -- there's been a lot written about that -- but Enron, using their mark-to-model accounting, where they pulled forward future profit estimates, Baldwin was doing the same exact thing with its annuities.  They were estimating a spread of income -- which they weren't earning, of course --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Which may or may not have existed, depending on future --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- and then they -- and then they estimate how long the policies would stay on the books and they took the present value and they sold the policy.  And so --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right, not accounting for the fact that interest rates fluctuate and other factors --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- they were writing this down as if it was money good.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right, exactly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Coming up, we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, manager of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  </p><p>      (MUSIC PLAYING)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  And today I'm speaking to famed short seller Jim Chanos.  </p><p>      We were talking a little bit about how Enron was so similar to Baldwin.  And you had mentioned, you read the 10(k), you read the annual report, you read the quarterly report three times.  You still have no idea what they hell they do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  The other -- the other interesting similarity was they both had charismatic leaders, who were very bright; Baldwin had a guy by the name of Morley Thompson (ph) and -- who went from literally peddling pianos door-to-door.  (INAUDIBLE) good salesmen to sell pianos door-to-door.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  And strong (INAUDIBLE) --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And morphing into financial services and of course Enron had Jeff Skilling (ph) and to a lesser extent Ken Lay.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  And so when we first started looking at Enron, Enron decided to make a market in everything from energy trading to you name it, they were going to take everything, turn it into a tradable commodity, whether or not it should be is a whole different discussion.  </p><p>      What was the first warning sign that you saw with Enron?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, it's actually -- it was a column written by John Wilde (ph).  He wrote a piece in the Texas \"Wall Street Journal\" in the fall of 2000, where he pointed out that energy merchant banks had just gotten a favorable ruling from the SEC on this mark-to-model accounting.  So much for the Baldwin type stuff.  </p><p>      And a friend of mine running a hedge fund in Dallas, Texas, called it to my attention.  And of course email was rudimentary; he faxed it to me.  And I read the piece and immediately --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  '97, '98 --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- this was in 2000 --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- far along.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- and immediate cracked the 1999 10(k) and March and June 10(q)s of Enron and immediately began to see all kinds of odd things.  In addition we noticed right away that not only was there a lot of insider selling throughout 2000 in Enron stock, but there were a number of key high-level executive departures.  And that's -- those two -- those two in conjunction, often there will be insider selling to start.  </p><p>      But when you see insider selling across the executive suite as well as executive departures, there's usually something wrong.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  That's quite fascinating.  And so you start digging in and what's the - -you begin working with Bethany McLean, then of -- still of \"Fortune.\"  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- ultimately end up writing the book, \"Smartest Guys in the Room,\" and what were the next couple of things that you uncovered in digging into Enron?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, the -- I had to -- two -- my partner at the time, Doug Millett (ph) and an analyst who's now my current partner, Chuck Hobbs (ph), we -- the three of us dug into the financials.  And one of the first things Doug pointed out was this is nothing more than a leveraged hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline, which I think was the -- still the best apt description of Enron.  </p><p>      But as we dug into the numbers, there were a few odd things right away.  We noticed that even with their sort of odd accounting, the company was only earning 6 percent pretax on its capital.  And --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  In a period when everybody's just making --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  And in which people are -- were paying five times book for this -- the stock.  So --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  For a 6 percent ROI on --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- five times NAV for a hedge fund that was earning 6 percent?  No, you wouldn't.  </p><p>      So that was the first thing.  </p><p>      Number two, I noticed immediately they weren't matching their -- in that -- there's an accounting principle called matching similar gains and losses.  And they had a merchant banking arm that did things like sell energy barges or construct utility plants.  </p><p>      And when they had a gain, they would put it through the merchant banking operating income line.  But it appeared to me that when they looked like they were going to lose money on something, they held it as a discontinued asset, held for sale for a year, and then put it below the operating income line so people disregarded it as an extraordinary event.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So they buried what should have been an ordinary --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- should have matched everything as net, net profit. Instead they basically showed their winners and tried you to disregard the losers.  That was another flag.  </p><p>      The third one is -- were these odd footnotes that said there was a group of entities set up by an executive of Enron to trade with Enron or an executive -- senior executive of the company was the general partner of the entities.  And, I mean, that was an immediate red flag to, well, what were these entities and why is a --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Well, how can you be a counterparty with himself?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- this person conflicted.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And we now know those were the famous raptors and LJMs and these off-balance sheet entities --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right, side pockets and -- I believe it was McKenzie (ph) who came up with some of the concepts for that, if not those exact ones, but that philosophical structure came from --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- came from --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- from McKenzie, that's right.  </p><p>      So quite fascinating.  </p><p>      And now let's fast forward.  So ultimately Enron collapses after having a huge run-up.  it takes a year to fall from about 89 bucks, 83 bucks, if memory serves, down to zero.  It was -- it was glacial; if you're short, you must be champing at the bit.  That's something I want to talk to you about a little later.  </p><p>      The mindset of how do you stay short a position fundamentally when it's running up against you and even when it starts -- I remember Lehman Brothers, when we were short, Lehman, when we watched it collapse, every time it fell and looked like it was about to just freefall, there would be this squeeze.  There would be this move back up.  </p><p>      In '07, '08, you were short most of that whole area.  We're talking about investment banks, builders, commercial banks.  What else were you short in the credit sector before the collapse?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, we have a rule that we don't -- we don't short anybody we do business with.  And since we did agency business most of the brokers, we were not short Lehman or Bear.  We actually were prime broker, a client of Bear.  But there certainly -- in the credit area, there was a lot of -- a lot of things to do.  </p><p>      I mean, the Florida homebuilders, West Coast homebuilders, building supply companies, the credit rating agencies, a number of banks that were pretty aggressive --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Bond insurance companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- bond insurance companies, yes, yes.  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And (INAUDIBLE) around the same time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  NBIA.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  NBIA was the other one.  They all freefell down to single digits.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And the -- you're exactly right.  I mean, typically, stocks that are fundamentally flawed, where the equity is worthless, you will have a number of vicious rallies, often 50-60 percent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Unbelievable.  And you look at that and you say, who the hell is buying this junk?  This is a stock cut in half that should be going to zero and yet you end up with the floor underneath these freefalling stocks and those squeezes are incredibly painful to live through, if -- especially if you're counting your money before you close that position.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, we never do that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's always a bad thing to do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But I would point out that one of the ways that you alleviate that a little bit is that people tend to think about the short side very discretely.  And often because a lot of money managers who actually do short stocks may only be short a handful of stocks versus quite a few longs.  </p><p>      And in our -- in our case, it's a whole portfolio.  I mean, in the U.S., typically historically over 30 years, we've averaged about 50 names in the portfolio at any given time.  </p><p>      So no one position is an unusually large amount --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  3-4-5 percent, is that --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, 5 percent would be the top.  But I mean, typically average is 2 percent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Coming up, we delve into the mind of the short seller as we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, chairman of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  </p><p>      (MUSIC PLAYING)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  I am privileged to be speaking to a master of the short side, Jim Chanos.  </p><p>      Earlier we were talking about the short in Baldwin and Enron, as well as all the financials heading into '08.  I recall reading a fabulous profile of you in \"New York\" magazine, the end of 2008, and I don't know if they were talking about a specific fund or generally but they were saying you were up 50 percent for the year in '08.  I know you may not be able to comment on numbers.  We all work with compliance and lawyers and what have you.  </p><p>      But '08 turned out to be a pretty good year for you. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, but the way we gauge ourself (sic), Barry, is actually versus the market and, in fact, although we have partnerships and offshore funds that you can invest in that are -- appear short and the numbers are what they are, the bulk of our business is our managed account business, where we're a large pension fund or endowment or sovereign wealth fund, gives us assets to manage short.  </p><p>      And in those cases, we're benchmarked versus the market inversely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So if the market goes up 10 percent, your benchmark is -10 percent?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Exactly.  And so to the extent -- for example, if the market goes up 20 percent and we're flat for that account, you know, it's as if we were up 20 percent.  And we're compensated in performance view on that.  </p><p>      Conversely, if the market goes down 40 percent and we're up 40 percent, we make no performance --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's flat.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Exactly.  So it's a crude alpha measure.  And that's really the way the firm has survived in a market that's up 2,000 percent, as you point out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  Since 1985, since you launched the firm, and this is the fascinating thing about running a short firm when, by the way, a lot of your colleagues who are in that space haven't survived as long as you have.  </p><p>      So since you launched in '85, the S&amp;P 500 is up over 2,000 percent and yet you've managed to thrive as a short seller.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  We're up -- on a stand-alone basis, our flagship fund, which goes back to '85 -- I think is up a couple percent compounded.  But when you factor that into the fact that -- offset it on the long side and rebalance monthly, the alpha is somewhere in the mid-teens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's fantastic.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And that's actually what -- that's how we get paid and that's how people evaluate us.  And so --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You exist to create a hedge to institutions, pension funds, endowments, who, by definition, are, for the most part, long only.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, the -- another way to think of it is we're an insurance policy that actually pays like premiums --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  As opposed to the not --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- being upset when you --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  Exactly.  And so I think that's -- I've quipped that Kynikos is, in effect, an insurance business.  And it's not -- it's not, I think, an unreasonable analogy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So let's talk.  We have a few minutes left in the segment.  </p><p>      Let's talk about what it's like to be upside down in a position that's running against you.  </p><p>      Baldwin is a perfect example.  You put this out at 25, drops to 20.  You feel like a genius for five points.  Next thing you know, it more than doubles, it almost triples from there.  </p><p>      How do you have the constitution -- like I know a lot of guys who can compartmentalize.  I think I can compartmentalize.  But the vast majority of investors, you know, the old joke is how did you sleep with the -- all your positions going against you?  Like a baby.  I woke up every two hours, cried for Mommy and wet myself.  </p><p>      A lot of people don't have that constitution to -- so how do you sleep at night with positions running against you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, I think the -- it is -- it is personality based.  I think -- I used to think when I started the business that shorting stocks fundamentally was just simply the mirror image of going long.  And I've said publicly many times, I don't think that's the case anymore.  I think a lot of it's rooted in behavioral finance. I think we're all by and large, we're listeners to this show and others are the product of positive reinforcement cycles.  </p><p>      And most people's rational decision-making studies have shown breaks down in an environment negative reinforcement.  And if you're --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- in other words when positions going against you, their discipline goes away when they need it --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- well, and the ultimate example, which will be something like an interrogation.  And so the ability to withhold information.  So if you're long in the market, you're constantly -- when I come in every day, we have 50 stocks in the U.S., another 40 globally, you know, I can pretty much be sure that 20 percent of my names will have a research note out, a buy recommendation, earnings estimates raised.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Something's moving.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  The CEO and Bloomberg, whatever the case might be.  And most of that is noise.  But it's the noise that most people in the market are used to.  And I call it the Muzak of the investment business. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  I'm going to pull a quote I was saving for before, because it's so dead-on.  </p><p>      You called it \"the cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And so most people -- as I say, they're used to that. But if you're a short seller or you're a negative -- on a situation, you're being told constantly you're wrong.  And here's why.  And you know, 50-page research report to follow.  </p><p>      And I think that not everyone has the ability to simply drown that out and say, OK.  That's all well and good.  But that's in the price of the stock.  Do we know that?  And the facts that I have are very important and the market doesn't really know that or appreciate how important they are.  </p><p>      So I'm not sure.  I think the research is the same.  And I think that good research can be taught both on long and short side and should be the same.  I think the ability to deal with the noise, the swing factors, the volatility, I think that's a different attribute.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  We continue our conversation with famed short seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates.  And we'll discuss the role of the short seller in modern markets.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  </p><p>      (MUSIC PLAYING)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  I'm thrilled to be speaking with Jim Chanos -- am I pronouncing Kynikos -- is that -- correctly?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Oh, you're ready to go to Greece --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Kynikos associates, Kynikos, which translates as \"cynic.\"  And you have spent a couple of cynical but lucrative decades on Wall Street, calling out the nonsense that passes for ordinary Wall Street noise.  </p><p>      Let's talk a little bit about the role of the short seller in markets.  And here it is.  It's five years past the financial crisis. People forget it wasn't the banks overleveraged and writing all this junk CDS and AIG writing the $3 trillion worth of derivatives with exactly $0 reserved for it.  It was you short sellers that caused the crisis.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, sure was.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  How do you defend yourself for bringing the world to the edge of the abyss?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, you never --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And by the way, that was at the highest levels of -- we heard that from the ECB, we heard that crap from Treasury.  We heard that from everywhere.  And it was just despite Enron and WorldCom and a whole slew of fraud uncovered by short sellers, including Lehman Brothers.   </p><p>      How does anybody actually say that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, you remember, Barry, right after Bear Stearns collapsed, a group of bankers who shall go nameless from New York, went down to Washington and sat with senators from New York and elsewhere and with Treasury Secretary Paulson, whatever.  And they asked for two things.  They didn't ask for forgiveness for their crazy lending and leveraging, they didn't ask for forbearance on capital levels, which they were going to need.   </p><p>      Instead they asked for a relaxation of the accounting rules, a mark-to-market.  And they asked for a ban or curbs on short selling of their shares.  And that, to us, was very telling, because it told you where their mindset was.  It wasn't about what actually they had done on their balance sheets and they way they had accounted for them.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Repo 103?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Oh, and all kinds of --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- fine, moving stuff off balance sheet each quarter, what harm --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- 105 was the least of it.  But I mean, just saying they were more worried about it being uncovered and/or having to mark things profitably or -- excuse me, properly.  In fact, I mean, a year earlier than that, at a G7 meeting, I was asked, along with Paul Singer -- and this is public information --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  This is the spring of '07?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes and --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- before anything --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- in April of '07, we actually briefed the G7 at their Washington meetings on -- we were asked to give a talk about hedge funds and the risks of hedge funds.  And Paul and I gave a presentation on the looming credit crisis. He did it on the structure of structured finance and how unstable it was.  And I did it on bank balance sheets and how loaded to the gills international banks were with the stuff Paul had just talked about.  </p><p>      And it was met with, you know, some would say, at best polite applause or, at most, a stifled yawn.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Now did these guys actually get it?  Or were you talking way over their -- ?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  No, no, they got it.  I mean, there were -- there were people from the Fed there.  There were people, you know, Gordon Brown, the future U.K. prime minister was in the room.  You know, a future Treasury Secretary was in the room, future ECB central banker was in the room.  I mean, these were serious people and I think that --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Well, which future Treasury Secretary or serious people, I think, an argument can be made that that Venn diagram has very little lovelife.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, we'll leave it -- let you make that statement. But I'm just saying that that again -- I mean, for people to say that nobody warned or could see this coming, and Gillian Tett, in her book, \"Fool's Gold,\" has a chapter on that meeting, which I think is worth the read.  But --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And she was one of the people in the \"FT,\" pounding away about this long before Lehman and AIG collapsed.  And it was -- you had to willfully look away if you didn't want to see --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Willful blindness, which is a concept I teach in my financial fraud history class, willful blindness is a very, very strong argument.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- up in New Haven, if memory --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, I teach at Yale SOM.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And that's great.  That sounds like it must be a fascinating -- how do you find the kids these days?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I think they're -- well, mine aren't kids, because they're mostly students in their late 20s, but --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Those are kids.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I -- it's a great class and I get as much out of it as I hope they do.  It's a good group and we basically look at some models, historically, of fraud, academic models and then do case-by-case, going back to the 1690s.  And it's remarkable as to how these cycles actually keep repeating with many of the same methods, just right up to date.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So who's uncovered more fraud?  Various regulatory agencies?  Or hedge funds and others who short?  How do you -- what's that scorecard look like?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I'd like to say that virtually all major frauds over the past 20-30 years have really been uncovered by either internal whistleblowers, journalists and/or short sellers.  Very, very few have been uncovered by regulatory agencies or law enforcement, very few.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And yet the first thing that happens in the crisis is -- first things we do, blame all the short sellers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  Well, that's -- a friend of mine named Bob Sloan wrote a great book about that, a history, called \"Blame the Shorts.\" And it has a long, long storied history also going back to the 1600s where people really will point fingers to those who have profited when -- when they've lost money.  And -- and that's human nature, I think.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So now let's sidestep a little bit or -- or just change a little bit.  We've been talking about accounting fraud.  We haven't even gotten to the role of the accountants, but clearly, the -- the big four, big five -- I don't even know how many are left -- are major enablers of what takes place with -- with many of these, uh, shorts, but now let's -- let's focus on the C-suite and corporate management.  </p><p>      You recently put out a commentary about buy-backs as little more than financial engineering and speculation in the market by the CEOs of America, whose track record in dabbling in market timing is especially awful.  </p><p>      What -- what don't you like about buy-backs?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, in -- in aggregate, every CEO, of course, always thinks their stock is undervalued.  We -- we -- we know that.  </p><p>      But what...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Except when they're selling.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- what worries -- well, well, we'll get to that in a second.  </p><p>      But what worries me is that corporate America, in aggregate, has pre-tax returns on capital in the mid to high teens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  The long-term expected rate of the equity markets is roughly half that.  And when corporations are embarked on massive buy- backs across all industries and all companies, in effect, these CEOs are buying the stock market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right?  </p><p>      So what they're telling you then is -- is unequivocally that they think that either they're happy to earn the stock market rate of return or maybe something hopefully better...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Which -- which is half what you would expect...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- or...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- their rate of return... </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- or...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE)?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- their rate of return on the margin of any new capital product is much, much lower -- in fact, half or less, of what -- of what is stated.  And that does not bode well for the -- the future of profits or for the quality of earnings reported as current profits.  </p><p>      There's one additional problem with this whole thing, and that is, number one, the CEOs making this decision typically have a very short tenure at companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  They're not thinking long-term.  </p><p>      And number two, we're seeing an increase in insider selling concurrent with the increase in buy-backs.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So out of one side of the mouth...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Exactly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  They're saying the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  They...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- the companies should be buying stock...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But maybe I should be lightening up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- but I'm going to -- right.  That's -- that's it. You know, my...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- my favorite data point on stock buy-backs is that Dell, now a private company, spent more money on buy-backs than they earned over their entire...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- lifetime.  That -- that's just an astonishing figure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And I think that -- well, I think you see that in companies like sears, as well.  But -- but the -- for a lot of companies, the other problem with this, of course, is is that CEOs are terrible market timers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  They're always buying back stu -- the previous peak in corporate buy-back activity was the second quarter of 2007.  </p><p>      And -- and where was the low?  </p><p>      The second quarter 2009.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You see the same thing with acquisitions and mergers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  They love to do...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  With inflated stock -- to buy inflated stock...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Corporate activity...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE) stuff is cheap...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- follows the market -- basically follows or is coincident with the market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It's not a leading indicator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So we have buy-backs as financial engineering.  </p><p>      What about dividends?  </p><p>      A little more credible than?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, a little bit more credible and -- and I think certainly where -- any time you see the actual cash go out the door, um, the other interesting observation we've -- we've made in looking at corporate financial transactions is that increasingly, we're seeing acquisitions which are not taken out of most analysts' free cash flow numbers, acquisitions are replacing CAPEX, corporal -- capital spending or R&amp;D.  So companies are buying their -- their R&amp;D or their -- their -- their capital.  And that should probably be properly deducted from the free cash flow, because, in aggregate, corporate America is not growing.  </p><p>      So they're -- by buying each other, you know, and buying divisions of each other, in effect, they're -- they're capitalizing their R&amp;D.  Um, and, I think that that's an interesting obser -- and that particularly applies for big tech...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- which are perceived as very cheap companies.  If you actually look at them, the only reason their revenues aren't declining at a -- at a reasonable rate is because they're -- they're buying other companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  We sort of stated these in the pharmaceutical area...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  They quote a bunch of genomics, molecular, go down the list, as opposed to plowing money into their own R&amp;D...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- OK, let's go out and buy these new...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And, again...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- and rather than expensing the R&amp;D, they're capitalizing by purchasing.  They can set it up as goodwill.  And so it's overstating their earnings.  And that -- that's a key point that we were trying to hone in on, that -- that companies that grow this way by acquisition are most likely overstating their earnings meaningfully.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And we've seen a ton of acquisitions, maybe not as much as at other peaks, but the M&amp;A activity, along with the IPO activity has certainly picked up fairly appreciably in the past couple of quarters.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, and the M&amp;A activity gives rise, we worry -- we're -- we think and worry, on a really drop in the quality of earnings. And -- and that, I think, drives a lot of M&amp;A activity, the ability to write down inventories, write down receivables, write up liabilities and basically give yourself, in effect, what -- what Herb Greenberg has called a cookie jar going forward to help manage your earnings.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  I've been speaking with James Chanos, chairman of Kynikos Associates.  You can listen to more of our conversation with Jim in our podcast extra, which is available on Bloomberg View, on SoundCloud and at Apple iTunes, as well as the Bloomberg Radio Plus App.  </p><p>      Coming up next week, we sit down with former FDIC Chairperson Sheila Bair, which is a really fascinating conversation.  </p><p>      Be sure and check out my daily column on bloombergview.com or follow me on Twitter @ritholtz.  At my blog, I posted a whole bunch of unrelated but interesting items.  That's ritholtz.com.  </p><p>      I'm Barry Ritholtz.  </p><p>      You're listening to Masters In Business on Bloomberg Radio.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE</emphasis>:   This concludes the broadcast portion of our interview.  </p><p>      Coming up with our guest, the radio podcast extra.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Today, I've been speaking with James Chanos of Kynikos Associates.  </p><p>      And we've been talking generally about short-selling and what it's like to run short funds.  </p><p>      What I love to do in these segments, when we finish broadcasting on the air and go to the podcast, is talk a little bit about you.  </p><p>      You started in this business as an analyst.  We talked about Baldwin and eventually Enron.  But when you were an up-and-comer, when you were the age of the kids you're teaching at Yale, who were your influences?  </p><p>      Who -- who are formative to the Jim Chanos approach to investment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Um, you know, it's -- it's hard to find lots of people that you can point to who -- who did what I did.  I mean I -- I was blessed when I was a young analyst at -- at Gilford Securities doing Baldwin that, um, we had a number of -- of well-known hedge fund managers who actually were our clients, people like Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, um, and I got to meet shortly after that when I moved to New York in '83, Julian Robertson.  One of the people that probably had the most influence on me just passed away, uh, and that was -- it was sort of the legendary Bob Wilson...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- who was a -- was a -- not only a great investor, but a -- but an amazing philanthropist.  And, uh, I used to have -- I used to have dinner with him or lunch with him from time to time.  And he was a -- he had -- he was written up by John Train in \"The Money Masters.\" But he was of the legendary Resorts International short squeeze.  </p><p>      But he was a tremendous investor on the long side.  And, um, he introduced me to people like Dick Gilder here in New York and -- all of whom early, 30 years ago, you know, I learned from another fellow, Stephen Peck, who was an amazing investor, a client of mine, a good friend, of Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Oh, sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And all these people were just sort of, you know, as I was getting going in New York, not only were they helpful in terms of their wisdom and their experience and what not to do and -- but also introduced me to lots of other people.  </p><p>      And -- and I think that that, you know, I'm indebted to all of them and -- and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few people.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So you mentioned George Soros, clients early on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And Julian Robertson, another legendary hedge fund manager.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And Mike -- Mike Steinhardt. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Steinhardt.  Again, another guy, called by some the greatest trader on Wall Street ever.  I don't know if that's an exaggeration, but people have said that about him.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, I mean they -- it -- I had the -- the pleasure of running money for all three of those men.  And -- and they all were different and a different temperament and -- and -- and I would categorize them completely different people, but all -- all amazing investors.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Hmmm.  Interesting.  </p><p>      So you began as an analyst.  You worked with some of the most storied names.  Obviously, the industry has changed a lot since '83.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  A little bit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  To think that a relatively unknown analyst at the time and a relatively small firm could get an audience with a Robertson or a Soros, that's not the sort of universe that we exist these days.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I think it would be a lot harder, I mean but -- but, first of all, people -- there weren't people putting out short-side research in -- in '80, even in '82 and '83 and -- and, uh, so, you know, I think the -- the Baldwin piece, a number of them were -- were short.  A few of the people I just mentioned were short that.  So it got me an audience with them early on, which I think was helpful.  </p><p>      But, um, I think it would be a lot tougher today.  I mean I started my -- my own fund when I was 27.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Really?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And -- yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And that's 30 -- 30 plus years...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  1985, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And so that's almost exactly 30 years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And that -- that was just you and a partner and -- and how big is Kynikos today?  </p><p>      How many employees...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I mean we have, I think, 33 employees in -- in New York and London.  And, uh, and obviously a little bit more sophisticated.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER) </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It was just three of us, uh, at first and the two partners and a secretary.  And my partner, a wonderful partner at the time who I brought with me from Deutsche Bank a year into it came to me and said, you know, I just don't think I -- I can do shorting stocks.  And...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  And -- and -- and sold his half back to me, um, for a -- for a nominal amount of money.  Uh, and, you know, just walked out the door and prospered, by the way, mightily since doing his own thing.  </p><p>      So it -- it -- even when you think you can do it, sometimes you can't.  And...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So -- so you mentioned Deutsche Bank in -- in passing. If memory serves, they kind of showed you the door, didn't they?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  Yes.  In the summer of -- of '85, um, there was a full page -- a front page...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  \"Journal.\"..  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- monster article talking about these evil short sellers and -- and how they were disrupting these great businesses. Um, and in the middle of the article was -- was sort of -- was me. And a...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- and a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And this is even after Baldwin...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- had collapsed and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And after a number of other calls we had made as well. And it, um, and so my -- my bosses in Frankfurt woke up that morning to see that, you know, Satan was working in their New York office. And I...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- I was told a -- I was told, by the end of the day, my contract, which was coming up, would not be renewed.  I mean they didn't fire me, but they just simply said, you know, time for you to do something else.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks, uh, here's your hat.  Watch (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  And then the postscript was I think nine of the 10 companies that were mentioned in that piece ultimately either went bankrupt or were prosecuted for fraud.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And any mea culpa from the right...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- you know, obviously, you know someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes with that journalist and sends them down the wrong path.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, I mean we were -- we were -- we were famously short a -- a lot of companies being run by a very aggressive investment bank out of Beverly Hills at the time.  And I suspect that -- that that may or may not have had something to do with it.  </p><p>      Having said all that, (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Are we -- are we talking about Drexel or are we talking about somebody else?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  No, we're talking about Drexel.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And a -- but -- but a -- one of the -- the, you know, serendipitous aspects was I had a client who had wanted me to run money for them as -- as a money manager, but because I was at a bank and it was...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You couldn't do it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE) -- I couldn't do it.  And so when I told them, yes, I was going to be looking for work, they said, well, why don't we set you up in business?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Oh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  So that's -- that's how -- that's how Kynikos Associates got started.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's unbelievable.  I love stories like that.  </p><p>      You know, Ray Dalio has a similar story.  You talk to a number of people, Jeff Gundlach, there are a lot of people who start in this business in one direction and, for whatever reason, end up making a turn and it's enormously successful.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I've often taught not only the -- the people who work for me, but my students that -- that's one of the things about business that you have to appreciate is that when good fortune, or bad fortune, comes your way, you have to know how to deal with it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And the bad fortune, you have to -- you have to rebound, you have to pick yourself up.  But when good fortune comes, you have to grab it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And -- and take advantage of it, because it will happen a number of times in your career just out of chance.  And if you don't take advantage of it, you miss that chance to move your career ahead on -- in a quantum leap...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- and I think that I was fortunate, at the time, in that I was young, I was not quite married yet.  I was about to get married, but I didn't have kids.  And often I tell people the time to take risks, actually, is not after you're established in your career, when you have a wife and kids and a mortgage...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Too much to lose.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- and -- and it's when you're younger and you're given an opportunity.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Because if it...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  What...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- works, it's great.  If it doesn't, no one is going to hold it against you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And you have the ability...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You -- you lose a year or two.  You can (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  You have an ability to get back up.  And in -- particularly in America, which is an aspirational society, I think people, in many cases, even if it doesn't work, will admire that you tried.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  When -- when we speak to people from overseas, when we speak to people in Europe especially, one of the things we hear time and again, that they admire the most about America is failure isn't a fatal...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- scarlet letter here.  You know, henry Ford had five failed companies...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- before Ford Motor Company.  And the stories at Edison are legendary.  He had hundreds of failed inventions before that light bulb finally... </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  As long as your work ethic...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- is good and -- and you're honest, people will value your ideas.  And -- and -- and that is one of the great things about our society, that -- that I think sets us apart from almost any other developed economy.  You fail in most other developed economies, you're done.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  That's it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  No second -- no second chapters elsewhere.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And that's not the case here at all.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So we talked about when you first launched.  It was two guys and a secretary.  Today, obviously, a much more sophisticated multinational entity.  Take us through a -- a day in the life of Jim Chanos.  </p><p>      What time do you start work?  </p><p>      What -- what is your work flow like?  </p><p>      What do you do throughout the day?  </p><p>      I get the sense that you're not chained to Bloomberg all day watching every tick.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  No, I'm not.  I mean I have a trading desk that does that.  But our -- our portfolio only turns over about once a year, so -- which is glacial by hedge funds.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  We're really investors.  So I mean time spent looking at every tick is not time well spent for me.  Looking at companies is more important for me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  By -- by the way, that's a theme that's been pretty consistent.  I can't begin to tell you how many investors we've spoken to who all pretty much say, if you -- if you have a good idea and a high degree of confidence, the day to day noise, that cacophony you mentioned...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- those fluctuations, it's meaningless noise and you have to have the con -- courage of your conviction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, I mean you need -- you need to have an intelligence post, as we do -- and I have a good one -- to -- to -- to point it all out to you.  But you also need filters and you need to understand. </p><p>      And one of the big differences, Barry, in the business now from when we started was back then, getting the information gave you a leg up.  </p><p>      So if you read the 10-Q because you got it a day or two before the rest of the Street and you saw something buried in -- in management's discussion, you had a piece of information that was, A, public, and, B, material.  And it might move the stock and -- and there were lots of instances of that.  </p><p>      Um, nowadays, the information comes at you with a fire hose.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I mean it truly does.  And -- and the key is having, A, the right filters and the right staff and the right ability to -- to pull out what is the real information from just the absolute, you know, torrent of water coming at you.  And -- and so that has changed a lot.  </p><p>      So I mean I -- I'll get up, you know, obviously, the older I get -- and you might appreciate this, you know, I might get a few -- up a few times at night anyway, but I'll get up, you know, early in the morning and check the markets and if nothing earth-shaking is happening in Asia or Europe and we have a desk that's 24-7, you know, I'll go back to sleep.  </p><p>      And then typically, you know, up -- up again early in the morning and then it's going through morning news, filings, research that comes in internally overnight, research that's come in externally overnight, um, you know, and -- and then the day may, depending on -- on my schedule, whatever.  </p><p>      But unfortunately, it's -- it's 24-7, you know, in a way that you know in that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  I get the sense you read a lot throughout your day.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I read an awful lot whether I'm on the move or whatever, so, unfortunately, you know, you -- you have to stay connected.  I'm trying to get to the point now where I am able to do it for Saturdays, but I'm trying to make Sundays a non-e-mail, non-electric -- non- electronic day, um, to just disconnect one day out of the week.  I think that is becoming a little bit more important and a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's just a recharge day, just a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, it's just a recharge day...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE) it up a little bit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And in the spring for eight weeks on -- in the afternoons on Monday, I teach.  And that's been, actually, a -- a wonderful, wonderful adjunct to what I'm doing for all kinds of good reasons.  And -- and -- and I think that's been a -- been -- been a wonderful plus.  And my clients and partners have been very supportive of that -- of that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  It -- it's just a change in the routine and it allows you to mix it up a little bit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  And it -- and it's great to interreact and go back to history, whether it's my history or history from 300 years ago, though sometimes it feels like I've lived 300 years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Um, and -- and, impart, some of the stuff back to a -- back to students.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So -- so you're teaching at Yale School of Management.  </p><p>      Am I recalling correctly, did you go undergrad to Yale?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I did.  I did.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You did.  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I did, years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So you're back -- back in the dorms, effectively?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, well...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- not quite, but I -- I have two -- two sons who went, as well, and when I told them I was going back to teach and that maybe we could...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  They were horrified.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- live together in -- in like in a con...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- in a condo like back to school...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  They wouldn't even...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- they looked to me horrified until I told them I was kidding.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's hilarious.  </p><p>      Um, they're at a -- I'm assuming they're out of school or?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  One is.  One is still there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And, um, that's pretty funny.  </p><p>      So every -- you've been doing this how many years now over the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- in the springs?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- I got on the -- I'm on my fourth year of teaching.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Oh, that's great.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  And a -- and a -- it's a lot, as I say, a lot of fun and it's one afternoon for two months in -- in the spring.  And Yale has got a brand new business school, so I'll give a plug for that.  And an amazing new dean and a -- Yale SOM is on the way up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  We have Bob Shiller coming in in a few weeks...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, he's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- he's one of my favorite...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- he's one of my -- he's certainly a tenured -- a tenured and Nobel Prize winner.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  He's at a different level.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  He -- he's really fascinating...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I'm the low man on the totem pole in the (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You -- you talk about -- but you talk about the psychology of investing in behavioral economics...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- and how (INAUDIBLE).  Here's a guy teaching in the same place you're teaching who's been one of the key drivers of that philosophy for a good couple of decades.  </p><p>      You -- you mentioned the far -- the fund launched in '85.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's 30 years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Almost.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  How has the hedge fund industry changed in that ensuing period?  </p><p>      What -- what do you see as big differences? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I mean the growth, first of all.  I mean it -- we had a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Enormous.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  We had a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Over $2 trillion now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  We started with $16 million in '85 and by -- by 19 -- the end of 19 -- early '91, we were over $600 million in assets.  And that put us in the top 10 globally of hedge funds...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Wow!  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- of (INAUDIBLE).  And -- and so that -- that tells you just how small the industry was back then.  Um, the dramatic growth was -- was in the late '90s and early millennium.  </p><p>      But it was truly a small handful of people.  Everybody kind of knew each other in the '80s.  There were...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  A hundred hedge funds, 200 hedge funds?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, maybe no more than 100...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Now it's 10,000...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- maybe...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- something like that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Maybe more than 100 and probably practically, 20 or 30.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And -- and -- and everybody knew everybody.  I mean truly.  And there weren't a lot of -- a lot of real different strategies.  I mean everybody was pretty much in the equity markets, give or take.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Long, short?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Long, short, maybe...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- and that was kind of it.  And then -- and, you know, you had guys like -- like -- like Mike Steinhardt spec -- and Soros speculating in bonds and currencies, um, but -- but it was, by and large, an equity driven model.  And a -- and everybody was, at that point, was fairly adept, both on the long and short side.  </p><p>      Um, getting institutional investors was a big deal back then. That he didn't really started until the '90s.  </p><p>      So...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So in the '80s, your clients were essentially just high net worth individuals...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  High net worth or foreign families because the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So family offices but no sovereign wealth funds yet?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Typically not.  You would -- typically not U.S. fun -- families and no sovereign wealth funds.  No endowments.  By and large, no pension funds.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's amazing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And everything has completely changed.  Now it's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Completely changed.  All of it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- dominated by big institutions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Ten thousand hedge funds, although, if you look at the -- the Bell Curve, that is -- that is not a normal Gaussian distribution.  It's effectively those 100 hedge funds capturing 80 percent of the alpha and then a long tail of underperformance.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  That's probably -- that's probably right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  The -- the numbers are pretty -- when you look at the Tremont data and you look at some of the other hedge fund data that's out there, the funds that are earning their keep are few and far between.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I mean true alpha is -- is hard to come by, as we all know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  For -- for sure.  Well, the -- you know, it's like expansion in -- in professional sports teams, you go from 22 to 26 teams and suddenly there's that much talent -- less talent on any one team.  It's spread around.  And there's sort of a uniform mediocrity.  </p><p>      But a handful of all stars, you know, there's 100 funds out there that are just...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- stealing it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- the only difference is you can't start your own NBA team.  You can start your own hedge fund.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Very easily.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  That makes it worse.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  All -- all you have to do is talk someone into giving you X dollars...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Exactly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And it's not even -- there's not even a $100 million minimum.  You could -- you know, the SEC regulates RIAs and others. If you have 100 plus, you don't have to do state by state.  It's one regulatory scheme.  So that's a bogey for a lot of -- you don't even have that on the hedge fund side.  Anyone with a couple of million dollars can launch a hedge fund.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  Although it is harder.  I mean to -- in -- in -- the cost of doing business, of getting a real prime broker, I mean...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE) now that I think have -- have, I think, taken that true start-up out of the -- the industry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE), in fact, you sort of do need a -- a critical mass to be considered a -- a, you know, a -- at least viable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So, obviously the industry has changed dramatically over the past couple of years.  Let me -- let me throw some of my favorite quotes, um, of yours -- of yours back at you and see what your...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- reaction is.  Let -- let's talk about timing.  \"In investing, you could be really right but temporarily quite wrong.\" I love that line, because I started in the business as a trader and I -- it was always drilled into my head, hey, either you're right or wrong.  </p><p>      If -- if you think you're right and the market is going against you, you're wrong.  But when you're doing fundamental shorting, you're basically -- our friend Doug Kass calls it variant perception.  You're identifying what people aren't seeing, or seeing incorrectly...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- and you're going to be wrong for a long time, almost by identifying that variant perception.  You're wrong for a while by definition...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, and there's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- before people catch on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- there's -- there's a big difference.  If you're trading a position, you know, sort of because of a fundamental view and your time frame has shortened enough, price tells you everything, almost.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And in a fundamental short position, not only are you analyzing the company or -- or the -- whatever it is you're analyzing, but in many cases, you have a management team interposed that's actively working to -- to -- to prove you're wrong through activities that aren't necessarily kosher.  </p><p>      And so there's an added level here of -- of sort of three- dimensional chess when you're on the fundamental short side because the market won't necessarily immediately see what you see.  And, in fact, often doesn't.  And -- and that's why most fundamental short sellers will tell you, they're -- they're often early.  </p><p>      One additional problem, you have to borrow the shares.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And so the ability to effect a short position in reasonable size for a firm like ours, once everything is clear, may not be given to you.  And so there -- there are additional hurdles that don't exist in traditional investing that exist on the short side.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Well, we mentioned -- I mentioned Doug Kass earlier. One of the things he taught me early on, which I would have wish I had known when I was shorting Lehman, was that you could be short the stock and you're going to get squeezed.  But if you really want to make a run for it, you marry a put to that and if you close the short position, you could let the put run.  It's never going to get called for you.  You're never going to get squeezed.  You could -- you're paying up for the option, but it's a way to get, um, that juiced return, because the -- on the short side, the most you can make is 100 percent.  With options...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, that's actually not true.  But go ahead with it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Well, what -- well, let's discuss that, because that's a standard line against short-selling.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, that's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Look, you're shorting at 50, you can only go to zero, that's 100 percent.  </p><p>      Why is that wrong?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, because...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Because of leverage and?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, because the ability of -- of -- if you start with a short position at 100 and -- and with no other cash in your account and you short the stock and it goes down to 50, OK, you can, without adding any more cash -- capital to the account, short additional shares.  And if it keeps going your way, you -- you can compound your return.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  But then you're running the risk of -- of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- a margin call, a squeeze...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, that's fine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But I just want to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I want to get the statement (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So you can...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  That you can't make more than 100 percent on initial capital.  That's not true.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So you can -- with -- if you're actually using the gain in, um, value, falling stock creates, if you're short, you're then pyramiding that on top and -- and shorting that with that additional effort.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, you're shorting on -- on -- you're compounding your profit, in effect.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  So number two, I've also (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  By the way, I've heard that 100,000 times.  You're the first person who's corrected that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  So -- so the -- the -- the other problem, of course, is is that, you know, I've seen a lot more stocks go to zero than -- than infamy -- invidimy (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  That -- and that's the -- that's the (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But the -- the key point for your listener, of course, is is that for what we do, and -- and theoretically, don't try this at home, kids, we have a portfolio.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And a portfolio changes the volatility nature, like any portfolio will.  There's going to be things that are always working and things that aren't working.  And so, you know, I -- I think that a -- that really tells you that -- that a -- that doing this as a professional with a portfolio approach and watching your country risk, your industry risk and all those things makes much more sense.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So this leads -- you mentioned something earlier and I want to address that.  You mentioned you have management actively working against you in a number of ways.  </p><p>      One of the things that you were very much in the forefront of was working with investigative journalists, working with the media to help uncover fraud.  </p><p>      How did that first come about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I'm a -- you know, clear up a misconception here. I mean we don't call up or e-mail reporters and say, hey, you ought to be looking at Enron.  And in the case of Enron, Bethany McLean was talking to my partner at the time and he said -- and she said, you know, what do you -- what's interesting?  </p><p>      And -- and -- and Douglas Millett, do you ever really talk to Jim about Enron?  </p><p>      And he -- we -- we're real excited about it.  And we -- we really think there's something there.  </p><p>      So I mean that -- that often reporters find a way to fundamental short sellers to -- to ask them, hey, what do you -- what do you think of this or are you working on something?  </p><p>      And -- and I think that I'll -- I think there are ways to do that and -- and not compromise anybody.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  On the other hand, I think there are ways not to do that.  And I think you have to be mindful of -- of that.  And I think there's approaches.  </p><p>      Having said all that, I -- I'm a firm believer in the \"U.S. Constitution\" and -- and anybody has the right to their opinions of interest.  But you're -- you do not have the right to your own facts.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And I think that that's an important point.  But if you're a publicly traded company, you have to understand that the marketplace is going to be a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of opinions, of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  We've -- we've seen some litigation against short sellers.  We've seen some litigation against analysts.  </p><p>      What do you think of that sort of stuff?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, as I say, no one has the right to -- to trade on or -- or induce others to trade on information they know to be false.  And that's kind of the -- the bright line that -- that -- that certainly most -- that all investors need to understand about securities fraud.  </p><p>      But -- but an awful lot of companies seem to, you know, be upset when people don't have the approved opinion about that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And, you know, that -- that is not actionable in our court system.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  One...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  A...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- one would hope.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  One would hope.  One would hope.  But...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So -- so one of the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  The federal courts, by the way, have a pretty strong view on that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  And they've been on the right side of this, for the most part...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Usually it's people that bring these cases are in state courts of -- of, you know, varying venues or questionable venues to try to get state, you know, put this before a jury in a state.  </p><p>      Federal judges, by and large, look at these things and, for the most part, toss them out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's the right way to do it.  </p><p>      So you mentioned earlier about long versus short.  There's a -- a longer quote I really like, which is, \"I used to think that good short sellers could be trained like long focused...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- value investors.  It's the same skill set.  You're tearing into the numbers.  You're valuing businesses.  You're assigning a consolidated value and hopefully you see something the market doesn't.\"  </p><p>      But you've since learned, quote, \"There's a big difference between a long-focused value investor and a good short seller.  And you mentioned the differences -- psychology and behavioral finance.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  And it... </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's a great -- that's a fabulous quote.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And -- and I think that -- and I think that -- that -- as I said, I've run money for a lot of great investors who have farmed out the short side to me.  And I've seen that, actually, some of the best value investors who I've had the pleasure of doing business with are not particularly good short sellers.  And -- and shouldn't be selling short for that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  The wrong constitution.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  They're just -- just the -- they'll obsess over very tiny positions that have gone against them, you know, that...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- you know, that -- that fear of the stock going to infinity that we discussed.  And...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  By the way, that's the other false statement.  You -- we've talked about a stock can only lose 100 percent.  I've heard that well when you're short, your losses are theoretically infinite.  </p><p>      Well, not if you have a stop loss.  Not if you have a line in the sand...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, there's in you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- that you cover...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- there's an even better little argument...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  There -- there's no lock limit up when it comes to equities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  There's an even better little limit that no one talks about.  If you're in a partnership and you're a limited partner, you can only lose what you put up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's right.  That -- that's your limitation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Which is an argument for investing with short sellers that way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Typically a hedge fund as opposed to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  You know, or...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- hiding... </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- or buying shares in an offshore corporation.  And -- and -- and that's something, you know, we point out to people, too, that -- that, actually, you can, in effect, get the same limited -- limited down side by doing it in that structure.  And the general partner takes the risk, but the prime broker will sell you out long before that ever happens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  So, again, these are -- these are -- these are...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Myths.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- examples of thinking -- well, they're not myths. They're -- they're accurate on the face, but in practicality, they're inaccurate...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- because -- because, again, you structure things to -- to not let that happen, A, and -- and, B, you can actually get protection through the structure of -- of the investment vehicle or whatever, to obviate the -- obviate the -- those risks.  </p><p>      But having said all that, they do play into behavioral finance. And -- and I remember very famously, a well-known investor who's an incredibly -- he's got an incredible track record.  I was running some money for him.  And it was in the midst of our disastrous short on America Online in the -- in the late '90s.  And I had...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  A little early.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- I had -- I had a small short portfolio I was running for him.  And -- and AOL was never more than half of 1 percent or 1 percent of our portfolio, because it was so volatile.  But it just kept doubling and doubling and doubling.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And we thought it was an accounting fraud, which it turned out to be.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And this investor called me repeatedly losing sleep at night and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Over a half a percent (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- and this one -- and this -- this position was not moving the needle on his performance at all.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But he was -- he was -- I think, to the detriment of him working on other ideas.  And a -- and it -- and -- and that was a real concrete example, to me, of just why it is that -- that certain people shouldn't do this, um, because it was bothering him.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  They just lack the constitution.  They can't...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  It...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- they can't compartmentalize.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:   They didn't -- they didn't need to because he -- he was such a good investor doing what he did well.  And so for that person, you know, they shouldn't be doing it.  And -- and I think that it gets back to exactly what you -- you've -- you've emphasized here, the psychological is completely different.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So let's -- let's talk about noise, since we -- we've touched on psychological, this is related to it.  \"I listen to the noise to make sure there's no new information.  I need to know.  But I don't worry about most of it.\"  </p><p>      And I -- I thought that was an interesting con -- concept, when -- when you discussed, relevant to this, analysts' reports, news, rumor mills, that's where the phrase, \"For a short seller, this is a cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  I -- I love that quote.  </p><p>      So how do you deal with that noise?  </p><p>      Do you filter all of it or do you have a staff that says, hey, out of these 1,000 things, these four or five you should...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, we...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- hear?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- I mean first of all, if we're getting a piece of new material or information from a research report, my staff is not doing their job.  Um, and -- because certainly, I want them reading the company filings and company press releases going to conferences, you know, and -- and I -- I hope they -- you know, our team is very good -- that -- that I'm reading it in an internal memo before I'm reading it in a -- in a Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch research piece a week later.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And that's usually the case 99 percent of the time.  </p><p>      Having said all that, you have to be mindful of what the Street is saying.  You have to be mindful of what you're going up against. And I -- and I think that that's important.  And one of the things we do is we do talk to the Street.  We have them into our offices.  If we have an unusual thesis or hypothesis on a company, we'll have the sell side in and to lay it out...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  They're pitching you the other side of the equation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, well, we know what they're pitching.  I mean you know, it's not -- and one of the good asymmetries of the short side -- and there aren't that many of them, one of the good ones is is that if you're fundamentally a short seller, you have no problem finding out what the bull case is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It's easy to find out.  </p><p>      But if you long that stock, you might have to really kind of dig to find out what the real bear case is on it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And -- and a -- and so it's another one of these influential asymmetries that I think works for the fundamental short seller.  There are a few others.  We don't have to disclose our positions.  I think that's a very important one, actually.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You know, there was a -- a movement afoot not too long ago to force short sellers to disclose their positions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And -- and the Europeans have it in terms of -- of certain thresholds, for example.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Now the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  But you're never short 10 percent of the outstanding stock?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  No, although we've -- we've...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE) company...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- we've crossed the European thresholds a few times, because the thresholds are very...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  But that's a fairly low.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- they're very -- they're very low.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Two percent, 3 percent, something like that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Oh, I think it's a -- no, it's .5 percent or (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Is it that low?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  It's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  I had no idea.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- it's really low.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- on some of them yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Wow!  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It's quite low on some of them.  Well, the reason is is that, first of all, the IRS doesn't look at short positions as positions.  It looks at -- it looks at it as in a commercial transaction, where you're borrowing money, interestingly enough.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  It -- it's a margin trade, it's a loan (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, because you don't own anything.  You don't -- you -- you have a promise to -- to -- to pay something back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  To repay...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Shares.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And so it's considered...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- instituted indebtedness.  Yes.  And so -- and which is why the short sellers have no -- no standing at the bar, the securities bar.  We don't own anything.  And -- and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- now I would argue even further, I'm a little surprised that my brethren in the hedge fund world have not actually challenged the 13 F, G and H regime.  I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Sections of the SEC code?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Code -- mandating disclosure over $100 million of your long positions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Because, I mean I understand why the 13D need for change in corporate control.  I think any reasonable person...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- would understand that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But why is it that -- that all these great investors, every 90 days, should give the public a free look at what they're doing? </p><p>      They're pay -- their clients pay for that.  And if you don't trade a lot, say you're a value investor, um, well, if you don't trade a lot, that portfolio doesn't trade a lot.  And there are people out there basically with services now to replicate your portfolio for nothing, or very little, that you have people paying good money for.  </p><p>      And I've always said, you know, Coca-Cola doesn't have to put its, you know, formula on -- on -- on the Web and Microsoft doesn't have to issue its source code, why should managers, either hedge fund or otherwise, have to tell the public what -- what -- what's the public's interests?  </p><p>      I understand the SEC and law enforcement should have every right to see it at any time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  In other words, 13D filings go to the SEC and it stops there, they don't get put on the Web?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, 13D filings, I think, change in corporate control, that's fine.  I mean people publicly should know that.  </p><p>      But why is it that a passive money manager should tell the public...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Six percent of -- more than 5 percent position, why...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- why disclose that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  You know, their -- all their positions, all of their positions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  OK, so let's clarify that.  I'm under the impression they do a filing at 5 percent?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, a 13D.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  OK.  So let's say they have a 2 percent position.  </p><p>      They have to disclose that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  What happens if they're offshore?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Of -- if you're a U.S. money manager, you've got to disclose your positions of $100 million.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Huh, that's interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, so -- so -- so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Is it a fund above $100 million or a fund...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  A position... </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- a position above $100 million?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  A fund $100 -- of $100 million.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Really?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  Again, I don't understand why the money management industry hasn't gone and said this is, in effect, a, you know, possibly a takings clause in \"The Constitution.\"  </p><p>      Why is it that the public gets to see what I'm doing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You're -- you're...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- forcing me to turn over my intellectual property with no compensation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And if you don't short a lot of stocks, then if you're just a long lonely manager, you're giving away your entire business plan every 90 days.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's really interesting.  And I hadn't thought of that in a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- in that context.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So the accusation is that Wall Street owns Congress and they can get DC to do whatever they want.  And it's not all that far from the truth.  </p><p>      Why is this so difficult to change?  </p><p>      You would think, hey, any major change in ownership, anything over -- pick a percent.  It doesn't even have to be 5 percent.  If you owe more than 3 percent, you need to at least disclose it when you cross that line.  </p><p>      Um, but after that, why does it have to be completely...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I'm a little...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- disclosed?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- you know, well, first of all, hedge funds don't have the clout that -- that -- when -- when you say Wall Street does...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- we're talking about major -- major banks and -- and investment banks.  They're the ones with the clout.  Hedge funds don't -- still don't have that much clout in Washington.  </p><p>      So I think that's number one.  </p><p>      But, again -- and -- and mutual funds, of course, like it because it actually helps their marketing.  </p><p>      You know, here's our portfolio.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I just -- but I -- I've always wondered at why a -- why hedge funds have just sort of rolled over on this and said well, you know, well, I guess, you know, we've got to do it.  And you do have to do it.  But...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Well, I'll tell you what the answer is.  The answer is merely knowing what Jim Chanos' long or short isn't the same as having Jim Chanos manage that position for you.  And the same is true for any hedge fund that's out there.  If it was the case, everybody would be generating alpha by imitating the Dalio's, Tepper's, obviously Renaissance Technology doesn't hold onto anything long enough for a filing to go through.  </p><p>      But still, if it was that easy just to say let me see what Chanos owns, great, I'll own that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, one would argue that that's actually why the alphas may have dropped and a -- and so, I'm not so sure.  It will...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Because everybody was...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- clearly for trading...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- (INAUDIBLE) to it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- clearly for trading shops, it -- it's superfluous. And for shops that do a lot of fundamental shorting, it's -- it's meaningless, because, for example, you use...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You want that out there anyway?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  When you see my longs, I file them in my Opportunity Fund, which is our long short.  And if you look at my longs, you'll scratch your head and go why is Chanos long in that thing, that looks crazy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And not understanding there's two shorts against it that are even crazier.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right, and that happens to be the best system -- systematic hedge for that position.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Um, so it can be -- it can be very misleading to people. And that's the other reason then, why do it?  </p><p>      If it's misleading because you're both long and short, you're not doing anybody a service.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  If it's not misleading because the guy is just simply a long only person, why does the public have the right to that information for free?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Those are the (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  There's a lot of arguments against this that -- and -- and the argument for it typically is well, it's for more -- don't we want more transparency?  </p><p>      And I would argue, no, not necessarily.  Um, but I particularly if -- if you're basing a business on -- on intellectual capital and you're charging people for that, I don't see what the public interest is in putting out possibly misleading information.  </p><p>      One of the problems, when you have the limits where people have to disclose where they go through limits and up and down, you actually -- people can game that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- knowing themselves they've gone through the limits.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And so I've explained that to the European regulators, that -- that these short threshold limits themselves can be disruptive just because they exist.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So let's veer into a dangerous territory.  Let's talk a little bit about politics, Washington, DC, the regulatory environment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You're known as a guy who's a pretty active, uh, participant in politics.  You've made the comment that you've been -- I'm paraphrasing -- you've been fortunate enough in your career to have accumulated a sum of money and you feel obligated to respond, to give back, to participate in democracy.  </p><p>      What -- what attracted you to that given how dysfunctional DC has been? </p><p>      Is it something you're still interested in?  </p><p>      Talk a little bit about that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I mean I'm certainly not interested in politics personally.  I -- I'm interested in the process.  I always have been. I -- and first of all, let me say, I think the system is broken.  I think the whole system of campaign finance is broken.  And I would love a law that says I can't write any checks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  Well, the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- Supreme Court has basically...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Has gone towy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- you could write, Jim Chanos...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It's free speech.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- who wants more than a couple of bucks, write...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- write all the money you want (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  I think -- and I think that that -- that while that may be a constitutional freedom, it's one we ought to reexamine, because it raises agency risks and lots of issues of inequality.  But -- but we're not here to discuss that.  </p><p>      The problem is is that if that's -- if that's the legality of the game and -- and you feel strongly about -- about things politically, um, and you want to support them, fine.  Uh, you know, I -- we pick our spots.  </p><p>      On the other hand, um, I think that -- that a -- that the country, you know, actually needs people to be involved in politics.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And I think that -- that it's not about access or influence, it's about, in our case, because we never asked for anything...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Well, stop a second.  When you say you never ask for something, you want to influence the process a little bit, then you -- you derailed the question I was about to ask you, because you said you never ask for something, which was what would you like to see changed?  </p><p>      What area...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- of policy...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, for example...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- could you move on the needle on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- well, for example, I -- I've publicly said I -- I think that carried interest should be raised.  The tax on carried interest should be raised.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So this -- this is the advantage that private equity and hedge fund managers have...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  On long-term cap -- gain allocations and performance fees being treated as long-term capital gains.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So they're -- they're taxed at -- it used to be 15 percent, now it's 23...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, whatever.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- or so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  But it sure as hell ain't for -- the joke that Warren Buffett says as he pays a lower tax rate...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- than his secretary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  And I -- and I think a lot of these -- so -- so I would, you know, you would argue...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So why hasn't that been changed?  </p><p>      You would think that's the -- the most egregious stroke of the pen thing to change?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, you'll have to ask the people that don't want to change it.  I don't know.  The -- the -- there are a lot of issues that are out there like that that I think you would be kind of surprised as a Wall Streeter that I support, but I -- that are counterintuitive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Give me -- give me another one.  Let's -- let's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You're -- you're one of these -- I can just hear Bill O'Reilly saying...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- you're one of these limbers -- limer -- limousine liberals who really feels guilty about having money. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  You know, I don't feel guilty at all about having money. I -- trust me.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I -- I feel blessed and -- and I know I'm fortunate. And -- and not at all.  And the -- but I do think the level of discourse in this country needs to be reopened.  And I think we -- we've -- we've put both parties in this -- this sort of truly bipolar area there where no one wants to meet in the middle anymore.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  A lot due to campaign finance reasons and -- and the primaries.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's the underlying problem that, you know, the old joke is that Reagan and Tip O'Neill would argue all day, they'd go out at night, have a beer and the next morning there would be legislation signed.  That sort of cross-pollination...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, look, apparently that story was a bit apocryphal. Apparent, there wasn't -- it wasn't that simple with those two.  </p><p>      But -- but I know what you mean...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  But they did get -- they did get...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I know what you mean.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- they did get -- meet in the middle.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  Well, what...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  They did get things accomplished.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- well, what's changed is the Senate, really, if you know Washington, in that -- that the House has always been pretty -- a pretty bipartisan place and -- and it's always been pretty raucous in terms of hardened attitudes and -- and -- and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Well, that's -- do you mean a partisan there's that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It's much more partisan.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- the Senasin -- the Senate is bipartisan and the House was partisan.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, the Senate -- the Senate, until about 20 or 30 years ago, was a place in which people crossed party lines all the time and voted their conscience and voted the way they really felt on the issues and weren't penalized for it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And -- and -- and so senators really were that -- that upper house that said, OK, we -- we're a little bit older, a little bit more experienced, we're -- we -- we -- more confident of our reelection or our tenure and if -- if I want to vote on civil rights even though I'm -- I'm a hard -- I'm in the Republican Party, I -- I do.  And that happened.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Um-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But now the Senate is just as fractious as the House. And -- and senators worry about reelection or getting very liberal or very conservative challengers.  Again, part of it's the campaign finance issue, part of it's the -- the redistricting of -- for the representatives.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Gerrymandering, as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And so -- so the -- the whole idea that there was an upper house that was sort of, you know...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  The adult supervision.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  The adults, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  The adults that were getting policy done is -- is changed, as well.  And so it's added to the acrimony.  It's added to the gridlock.  And -- and I think it's just added -- it's -- it's not put us in a good place.  And I think that that's -- and I've supported Republican candidates that I think are moderates, as well, so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  How -- how do we fix this?  </p><p>      How do we repair...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I think you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- campaign finance?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- I think you have to start, you know, with some sort of reform.  And I think, you know, unfortunately, a family member who is -- who has been in politics also pointed this out correctly, you also have to do something about term limits, because other -- if you do have campaign finance limits, term limit -- anybody with an incumbency becomes more important.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And so you have a do I -- you have an advantage being an incumbent...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Ninety-nine percent or 98 percent reelection rate...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  So...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- in the House. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- so I mean we -- that -- that -- it's -- it's a tricky issue.  But just throwing more and more unlimited amounts of money, I think, doesn't help the issue.  It makes -- I think it makes it worse.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And what do you do -- so, in other words, you have a system that's broken, nobody from either party is going to -- willing to work with the other party...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But nobody can turn the money down (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And at the same time the Supreme Court...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It's an arms race.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- is -- has -- has basically lit that fuse and said go for it then...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And it's an arms race.  So therefore, I mean you can't -- if you don't spend, you're not going to have an equal chance -- seat at the table.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And so it's just...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You have no choice, you have to.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- it's just this vicious cycle.  And...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So how do you break that?  </p><p>      How do you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, as I say, I'd leave it up to the politicians and the legal scholars, but at some point, you're going to need a piece of legislation or a constitutional amendment or something that -- that's going to have to change this system.  And I -- I don't know -- I don't know any other way around it.  If you have a Supreme Court that keeps saying this is an a -- the legislation is unconstitutional, then you're going to have to change the \"Constitution.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  And -- and that's a challenge.  That's quite a challenge...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It's a big challenge.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- to get that done.  It probably has to get a lot worse before it gets better.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  You know, that's a scary thought.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Let -- let me tack policy to one other place, because we spent this whole afternoon chatting and China has never come up.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Exactly.  Where's that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And you, very famously, um, identified, I want to say four years ago, is that -- is that right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, it was the end of '09, early 2010.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Basically said China is a -- a big house of cards, building these ghost cities, they're spending all this policy money, they're not that good at it.  Their economy has been so robust that it's covered up a lot of these credit errors.  </p><p>      What do you think is going on with China today?  </p><p>      By the way, China's stock market today at a four or a six week high, but it's shellacked over that period.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  It's down 40 percent.  China, while the rest of the world has rallied substantially, has gone the exact opposite way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Almost cut in half.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, people have always ask -- still ask us, well, what do you think, you know, when are you going to be right?  </p><p>      You've been early.  And I keep saying if you look at the Chinese market...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  It's got -- China has gotten crushed over the past few years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It's the -- it was the best place to be short in the last four years.  </p><p>      Um, look, everything that we saw in China, at -- at the end of '09 and 2010 is basically now twice as bad.  That's kind of the way I put it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  It hasn't gotten better.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It -- it's gotten worse.  The -- the debt to GDP has gone from over 100 percent of GDP to over 200 percent.  Back in -- in '09, there was 5.6 billion square meters of high rises under development and (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  5.6 billion?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- 6 billion square meters.  That's 60...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Uh-huh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- billion square feet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Wow!  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Now, the number is twice that.  It's 10.6 billion square -- square meters under development at the end of 2013.  </p><p>      So everything that we saw then that was bad, and I think it -- it was bad, is, in effect, twice as bad now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Don't they have...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  When we...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- hundreds of millions of people to move off the farm?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, the problem is, is the hundreds of millions of people can't afford the stuff that they're -- that's being built. They're building high end condos, uh, shopping malls, high speed rail. It's only the -- the top 5 percent of people in China that can afford that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And that's the -- that's the -- the sort of paradox here.  I'll give you just an idea of -- of what's changed in four years.  When we started looking at China, the Chinese GDP in dollar terms was about $7 trillion US.  And the total...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Not too shabby.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Not -- and the to -- total amount of bank -- assets in the banking system in China was $9 trillion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  So it was a little bit over 100 percent.  </p><p>      Now, the GDP is about $9 trillion and the total assets in the Chinese banking system are about $24 trillion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Wow!  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, a meaningful difference.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And that's a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  So they've had to employ...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- that's a lot of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- they've had to employ more and more debt to get the growth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  I was going to say, this isn't capital, this is...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  This is the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- credit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- total assets, total assets.  It's just basically a proxy for -- for credit outstanding.  And so increasingly, they've had to employ more and more debt to -- to drive their growth.  And -- and -- and that's because the model is based on 50 percent investment to GDP.  </p><p>      So if you think about that, that means that -- that if they -- if it takes them two years to finish a project, that means that one quarter of your GDP every year rolls off and has to be replaced with a -- digging a new hole in the ground somewhere.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Well -- well, that's while they were at 12 percent GDP growth four years ago and -- and the most recent data is closer to 6.5, 7 percent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Seven, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  It is, because it -- and -- and so the soft...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And by the way, we would kill for 7 percent GDP.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, well, the 7 percent is a little misleading, too, though, because, again, 7 percent, the consumer is still declining per GDP.  So the 7 percent is only really coming from -- from the fact that they're still building stuff.  And -- and now, it's beyond a shadow of a doubt, even -- even Chinese officials or died in the wool bulls will tell you, they've got to change that, they've got to reform this.  And they've got to get away from this investment-driven model.  </p><p>      The question is, how?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  How and what do they replace it with?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Exactly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You know, the -- the key -- the fascinating thing about China, or let me flip that around, the interesting thing about U.S. manufacturing, we started seeing signs of this about five years ago, be fracking blew up, before natural gas was everywhere.  But natural gas prices had dropped and we were hearing about companies relocating in the U.S., setting up a natural gas electrical generator. One of the big complaints you hear about China is a lack of consistent electrical availability.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Not only 24-7, but a consistent amperage and wattage...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, peak -- peak usage.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- and it fluctuates and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- and you have to set up a series of electronics just to get a steady whatever it is, 120 and 60.  So in the U.S., you run a natural gas pipeline near a factory, you set up an electrical code generation plant, you're effectively getting unlimited, very low cost energy and you don't have to take three weeks to ship your product to the States.  </p><p>      And that's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- started as a -- as labor prices started to go up...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And Chinese wages have gone up, too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- what happens when wages go from $1 a day to -- to $25 a day?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, that's -- that's what's happened.  In fact, net -- net exports in China, when I first started looking at China, net exports were 12 percent of GDP, exports minus imports.  Now, it's almost down to 0.  Now, it's a couple percent.  </p><p>      And so -- so the impact that China, as an exporting engine, is already diminished on their GDP.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's amazing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And they've offset it now -- they've offset it with more and more investment.  So the story in China is not export anymore, the story in China is this giant building project, the property building.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Can -- can you grow a middle class in a -- a country that size and use that the way the U.S. post-World War II -- you know, we had a 50 year run after World War II, where the middle class boomed like never before.  And it was a period of tremendous economic growth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  But we...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Can China do that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, we were already past the middle income trap at that point, though.  We -- we passed that in the -- the late 19th, early 20th century.  </p><p>      I mean China is still facing that.  And -- and how do you get people from the sort of $5,000 to $7,000 per capita...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- income level to -- to $30,000 or plus?  </p><p>      And -- and that's always the tricky point in -- in economic development is -- is the, you know, basically, there's four phases of economic development, Barry.  You've got, basically, you educate the population from illiteracy to secondary school education.  </p><p>      Second, you move people from rural areas to urban.  </p><p>      Third, you employ capital where it never -- capital has never been employed.  That's where we are in China right now.  </p><p>      And the fourth and the way that South Korea and Japan and post- war Germany, post-war is you finally begin to innovate and make products that the rest of the world wants and be more productive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And that's the tricky part.  And that's where most countries can't surmount.  They get to the third point, but they can't get to the fourth point, where they become truly innovative and -- and -- and it -- the Asian tigers all fell by the wayside, for example, in the mid-'90s...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- with the exception of South Korea and -- and Singapore.  The rest all -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, basically...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Vietnam...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- stalled out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Um, that's where we are with China right now.  </p><p>      The three countries post-World War II were Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union.  They all were pretty much destroyed by the war.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Uh-huh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  They had to rebuild.  They had to start from scratch. You know, they already had educated workforces.  They already had urban centers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But they had to basically put capital to work again, which they did.  And Germany, in the '60s and Japan in the '70s began to innovate and produce world-class products that everybody wanted.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  For sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  The Soviet Union didn't.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  And China, the question is, will China ever be able to do -- be more than just a -- a high end...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  A manufacturing base.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- that's it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And -- and the -- and/or employ capital in a non- impressive way to build empty buildings and condos and things like that.  And that's what they're doing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So the quote you had about China, I'll -- I'm curious if you still think this is true.  \"The Chinese banking system is built on quicksand.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  It's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Is it still true?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- I just think it's -- it's more true than ever, um, in -- in that there's just -- the bad loans are there.  There's legacy bad loans they didn't address from even 10 years ago.  Um, they are telling you with a straight face that non-performing loans are, you know, less than 1 percent.  Um, and -- and yet, you just see the madness of some of these projects and the fact that defaults are starting now left, right and center and they'll look at you with a straight face and say, oh, no, no, our non-performing loans are not a problem.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So I can sit here and continue speaking to you for a couple more hours.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  But I know your assistant will kill me if I keep you here past 4:00.  So I -- I just wanted to end on one last question. And before I forget, I want to thank you  for being so generous with your time.  I know people are going to find this a fascinating conversation.  </p><p>      The -- the last question I want to ask you is really general and open-ended.  Um, the industry of Wall Street, finance, investment banking, investing has changed dramatically over the past 30 years and especially over the past five years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  What do you see happening in this industry going forward?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, I -- I kind of would like to think we're seeing our limits on it, because -- and it's always -- it's always a little bit hypocritical to talk -- talk, you know, negatively about what you do for a living, but I think that -- that the nature of finance, in and of itself, as a profit center or a big part of the economy is sort of self-defeating.  </p><p>      And -- and I think that we've gotten kind of to the limits, I suspect, of where finance can go to push the U.S. economy.  I mean I think it hit its peak in '06-'07, uh, in terms of finance as a percent of corporate profits and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  The argument is -- that I've made is the bailouts prevented that process of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  You know, clearing...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- converting back to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- of clearing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- the market clearing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes, and I would agree with you on that.  And I read, you know, I remember at the time you were writing that and you were right.  And I agree with it.  And I think that -- that unfortunately, finance becoming a big part of the economy in terms of taking deposits, making loans, all of that stuff, puts it in this too big to fail category broadly speaking, where -- where ironically enough, it cannot be subject to the -- the -- the whims of capitalism itself, creative destruction, because it would just be systemic.  </p><p>      And so we -- we build this monstrous Rube Goldberg like contraption that is completely ludicrous and then say we can't let it fall apart...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- because it will impact everything else.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- so too big to fail, too much leverage, too little capital...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- and yet not subject to the laws of capital.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Well, let's leave it at this.  If we look at those -- those dark days of '08 and '09, the one industry that actually went through bankruptcy was the auto industry.  And I always chide my friends in White -- at the White House and -- who say, oh, well, the auto bailout was smart.  </p><p>      And I keep saying, you know, no, it wasn't an auto bailout.  I was short the -- the auto stocks.  Shareholders were wiped out...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- the boards were -- were dismissed.  The executives were fired.  They brought in new teams, they recapitalized the companies, the government put in debtor in possession financing...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- which was post-bankruptcy.  Now, we can argue about the unions' role in that, that employees were given seniority.  But in many bankruptcies, in...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's typical.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- employees are...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  That's not atypical.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- given preference.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And -- and, in fact, we did exactly what capitalism should have said we did, we recapped the industry and we made it more viable going forward.  </p><p>      The people who took risks in the past, you know, paid the price.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  That's exactly right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But it worked.  It actually worked better, I think, than what we've had in finance coming out of this, which was...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Well, we had -- we had a Treasury secretary that was from finance.  And so industry gets bankruptcy, finance gets bailouts. If it was reversed, if you had the head of a railroad or a head of a manufacturing plant, I can't guarantee you that GM and Chrysler would have been put through bankruptcy, but I can guarantee you that Citi and Bank of America and Merrill and Morgan would have been treated the way financiers treated manufacturers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  But then we might not have had this beautiful new Bloomberg headquarters.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Uh, I think this predates it.  This was up long before that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  I know it was.  I'm just kidding.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  So -- so listen, you know, the counter-argument, and this -- this is me talking literally in my book, the counter-argument is if you take -- my example is Bank America...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- Merrill Lynch, Countrywide, that giant...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- horrific blasphemy of a company...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- if you would have put them into bankruptcy, you spin out Merrill as a free-standing, clean balance sheet investment firm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- you spin out Bank America as a clean balance...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- money center bank.  You spin out Countrywide as a mortgage underwriter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You take all the bad paper -- I -- I'm fond of saying no such thing as toxic assets, only toxic prices.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  You sell all that crap that's dragging down their balance sheet all these years...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- at 15, 20 cents on the dollar...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- someone's a buyer of that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Of course.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- and you also end up clearing all those home prices instead of having private equity come in and try and flip them, these home prices plummet and first time home buyers are buying houses at a reasonable price.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  If you had wiped out the equity of these institutions, what, you know, to the -- 80 percent...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- subordinated that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Sixty percent on the mezzanine debt, 50 percent on other debt and the depositors were whole...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- I think not only would that have helped the whole process, it would have -- it would have meant that people learned the lessons going forward.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  The -- the moral hazard gets avoided and we, in our economic recovery in 2014 would be...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  -- years ahead of where we are (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And the depositors understood that they -- the ones taking no risk were protected by the government...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  -- as they should be.  But the more risk you took, the more at risk you were at, I undoubtedly think the system would be far healthier today than it is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  It's -- it's called risk for a reason.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  And I've got it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  Jim, thank you so much for your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  Barry, thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RITHOLTZ</emphasis>:  This has been absolutely fascinating.  </p><p>      You've been listening to Master of Finance series.  </p><p>      I'm Barry Ritholtz.  </p><p>      This is Bloomberg Radio and we've been speaking to Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates.  </p><p>      Thanks so much for coming in, Jim.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANOS</emphasis>:  My pleasure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ANNOUNCER</emphasis>:  You're listening to Masters In Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.    </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Well, you could say pretty much the same thing of the Great Pensions Revolution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It has promised so much for pensioners - and so far is proving a big fat disappointment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dickens wrote those words in A Tale Of Two Cities in 1859, coincidentally at the same time as many of our biggest life insurers first came into existence.</p><p>Publishing has progressed a long way since then. Insurance, not so much, it would seem.</p><p>Because at the heart of the failure of the new reforms is the antiquated way many insurers still run their business. I think my barber has got more sophisticated record-keeping and computer systems than some of these giant life and pensions firms.</p><p>Add to this lawmakers who still haven't figured out how to regulate this new world of pension freedom - and you've got your very own financial disaster movie.</p><p>We've known for decades that life insurers were terrible at admin and dealing with their customers. It never really mattered before, because they never had to deal with the people who actually bought their products.</p><p>They were all sold through financial advisers and banks. But since the pensions revolution began, they've been bombarded with all kinds of questions from customers who suddenly are very interested in what they've bought. Many just can't cope.</p><p>When we pass a complaint to a bank, solving it is usually as simple as typing a reference number into a computer and all your details will then pop up.</p><p>At an insurer, even if we send off all your paperwork, the specifics of your policy often can't be found. Instead, frequently someone has to scurry away into the depths of a massive warehouse and pull your contract from a dusty old box. It may have been languishing there for decades.</p><p>There are thousands of different pensions policies and the way they were drawn up - and the guarantees and clauses they have built in to them - vary hugely. So when you've got thousands of savers each making individual demands from contracts that are practically unique, the system grinds to a standstill.</p><p>Then, you've got to add in the fear factor.</p><p>Insurers are terrified of being accused of mis-selling. They're being asked to hand over huge sums of cash by people who have taken no financial advice.</p><p>As few as one in ten have even consulted the Government's free pension guidance service. These firms are convinced that if you run out of money and are left impoverished for your remaining years, you'll accuse them of negligence. So in many cases they won't give you your cash.</p><p>This may be a failure of regulation - but don't forget this is about insurers looking out for their own interests.</p><p>If they really wanted to make the freedoms available to you, they could.</p><p>We've currently got the incredible situation where the Government wants you to take responsibility for your savings, but the insurers won't let you. And, for that reason, the sweeping reforms are proving a frustration for many who thought they'd have the chance to spend their nest eggs as they want.</p><p>Pensions Revolution? Pah. The only thing that is revolting in pensions is the treatment of loyal savers by the insurers and policymakers.</p><p>My victory!</p><p>A minor miracle has occurred. I have transferred son number one's child trust fund into a Junior Isa! It took about six weeks, and it was remarkably straightforward.</p><p>I filled in a form with the company I was moving his savings to - Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p>Then over the following weeks I received a number of letters updating me on the progress (including one sent because I had misunderstood one of the instructions and needed to sign another bit of paperwork).</p><p>At one point I received a letter telling me that, as the switch was taking longer than expected, they had contacted the child trust fund provider, F&amp;C, to find out what the delay was. But then, a week later, the money arrived.</p><p>In normal circumstances I'd say that a six-week delay was unacceptable.</p><p>But having fought for three years to get the Government to change the rules to allow families to move their money out of child trust funds, the patience was worth it.</p><p>I hope other families follow my lead and move from these duff, high-cost investments into Junior Isas. I'd love to hear about your experiences.</p><p>Bad Apple</p><p>The unveiling of the new Apple Pay service has underlined one thing I'm always waffling on about: how the tech wonks who design and market these new products just don't understand ordinary human beings.</p><p>They work in swanky offices, with all the latest gadgets and high-speed internet connections. Their smartphones and iPads are essentially extra limbs.</p><p>They may live their life in a tech bubble - but the majority of us don't.</p><p>When Apple Pay was revealed on Monday, all the banks were forced to use the same excruciating sentence: 'A unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorised with a one-time unique dynamic security code, instead of using the security code on the back of your card.'</p><p>Apparently, that was what Apple thought would explain how this new payment technology will work. It doesn't inspire confidence, does it?</p><p>If these big tech firms want us to be able to use their new gadgets, then they've got to learn to speak in a way us normal folk understand.</p><p>Jargon and technical gobbledygook is designed to make you feel excluded. And that's no way to inspire confidence among your customers.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-20839270</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G61-8VT1-JCJY-G3YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"913\"/><timeReceived>9:27 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The then Prime Minister had finished speaking, I'd pulled together a few of the columnists and leader writers to discuss the line for the next day's paper. The conversation was meandering. And, so I asked rather earnestly, what do we think the speech was about. What was it really about? There was an awkward pause, then a colleague turned and said he thought it was about...an hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, I hope to be about 45 minutes. And, in case as it meanders, and you find yourself wondering what it's about, it's about the damage technology is doing to democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">***</p><p>In 1960, John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon took part in the first televised presidential debate. It was, as Theodore H. White famously reported in The Making of the President, a revolution in politics. A revolution \"born of the ceaseless American genius in technology; its sole agent and organizer had been the common American television set.\"</p><p>TV promised a new age of accountability. It brought the world into our homes. But it's also delivered more than was originally advertised. Polarisation, the soundbite, negative advertising, the 24-hour news cycle, the industrialisation of spin and personality driven politics have all accelerated with the television age. Indeed, it was TV that gave us The Apprentice - the Making of This President.</p><p>Much like television, the internet promised to empower the individual and enhance the democratic process. But it's also distorting it. The new media is remaking our politics in ways we didn't expect, nor fully understand. Technology is disrupting democracy. Whether it destroys it is up to us.</p><p> This may seem like exactly the kind of hysterical, catastrophic prediction that gives us journalists a bad name. After all, democracy has seen off fascism. It's seen off communism. It's pretty much seen off the Liberal Democrats. More to the point, Trump, Brexit, the Italian elections are, in one sense, evidence of democracy in rude health: it's the system's greatest strength that, when things aren't working, you can vote the rulers out and get a new lot in. It's the safety valve in action. Nor am I one for sniffing at populism. There is the whiff of tyranny when politicians claim that they, exceptionally, speak for the people and so the rules of law, honesty and decency don't apply to them. But populism is such a baggy and ambiguous term - and, anyway, what would you rather have: unpopulism?</p><p> Nor am I a technogrump. Technology is a force for love. It's no accident that it's easier to love who you want than at any time in human history. Technology's a force for laughter. It's a force for justice. Black Lives Matter. Me Too. I Paid A Bribe. The internet has given each and every one of us the ability to speak truth to power. And it's a force for progress.</p><p>As the chronicler of our contemporary enlightenment Steven Pinker will tell you, the last 30 years have been the most successful period in the history of our species. In our own business, technology is empowering - as a means of innovating in story-telling, fact-checking and doing journalism not just for people, but with them.</p><p>And I also recognise the media's tendency to attribute too much importance to itself. Whatever's happening to democracy, the media's only part of it. The driving forces in the politics of the past decade are the facts on the ground: the financial crisis, immigration, the Iraq war, inequality, stagnating living standards.  But I set out this evening to consider whether technology is destroying democracy because, it seems to me, we are in danger of being complacent. While we're busy reporting the news every day, we may be missing the story.</p><p>***</p><p>Around the world, democracy is in retreat. Authoritarianism - drawing self-confidence from the political circuses in the West - is on the rise. Press freedom is widely curtailed; propaganda is increasingly commonplace. In the West, belief in democratic institutions, particularly among young people, is on the slide. Politicians are less trusted - and less trustworthy. The norms of our politics have taken a turn for the worse. We shouldn't be surprised that technology is disrupting democracy. It's disrupting everything else. </p><p>Marc Andreessen famously remarked that software is eating the world. But in taking a bite out of democracy, it threatens to devour the political culture that has so nurtured it. Mark Zuckerberg's instruction to \"move fast and break things\" was cool once; less so, when it's democracy. What's worse - and so staggeringly self-serving - is that the technology companies have wrapped themselves in the democratic flag, the flag of freedom of expression, to justify their inaction. Despite what they say, technology is not neutral. It's engineered by people and produced by companies: if they enable, either through indifference or incompetence, the poisoning of politics, the destruction of trust and the erosion of freedoms, then that's a choice. What's at stake is a system we can too easily take for granted. When Amartya Sen was asked what was the most important thing that happened in the 20th century, he says he had no difficulty answering: \"the rise of democracy\". And, characteristically, he's precise in what he means by it: \"We must not identify democracy with majority rule. Democracy has complex demands, which certainly include voting and respect for election results, but it also requires the protection of liberties and freedoms, respect for legal entitlements, and the guaranteeing of free discussion and uncensored distribution of news and fair comment.\"</p><p> So, let's consider the evidence in the first chapter of the 21st century: Xi Jinping has just removed term limits on the Chinese presidency, approved by a laughable 99.8 per cent of the so-called parliament, the National People's Congress. (I don't fancy the prospects on the Politburo for the 0.2 per cent.) In what must have been a real nailbiter for him, Vladimir Putin has just won another term as Russian President with 75 per cent of the vote, 60-odd percentage points clear of his nearest rival. Around the world, command and control is supplanting freedom and choice. In Turkey and Egypt, Hungary and Poland, the Philippines and Venezuela, we are witnessing pseudo-democracies taking hold. Meanwhile, democracies that once inspired - South Africa, Brazil - are now marred by depressing stories of corruption. For the 12th consecutive year, Freedom House released its annual survey of democracy being pushed back: between 2000 and 2015, democracy broke down in 27 countries; 71 countries suffered \"net declines in civil and political liberties\".</p><p> History is back. In 1989, Francis Fukuyama wrote his famous essay - the End of History and the Last Man - declaring that the collapse of communism resolved the great argument between communism and capitalism, proving the triumph of democracy and its inevitable spread as the universal system of government. The sequel - the Return of History - is now showing: one party rule vs free and fair democracy is the contest of our times. And, currently, the momentum is with the autocrats. In the West, too, democracy is having a hard time of it. On the evening of November 8th 2016, I was in Times Square - where the BBC holds its US presidential election night broadcast. By two or three in the morning, the shape of the night was clear - much like the Brexit referendum result - and I'd left the studios to get a little air and see what people were making of it down on the street. When I got there, my phone went and a fabled journalist was on the line: \"Just remember,\" she said, \"the American people are always right\". They had a choice, she explained, between watching their TVs over the next four years and seeing the Return of the Clintons or Life with the Trumps. \"It's going to be the Kardashian Camelot,\" she said, \"it'll be amazing TV.\" And, indeed, it's proved so good that the President himself can't resist it. The White House has a phrase for the time Mr Trump sets aside to sit upstairs and watching the talk shows talk about him - it's described as \"Executive Time\"; we'd probably just call it Presidential Gogglebox.</p><p>Whether you believe in Trump's rejuvenating mission to Make America Great Again or see him as a disgrace to America's values and standing in the world, we can agree that a new set of norms is taking hold in public life. Politics is more emotional, less factual, than before.</p><p>Stephen Colbert's term \"truthiness\" - what simply feels right - is often more pertinent and persuasive than the truth. What Mr Trump once called \"truthful hyperbole\" is part and parcel of the debate. Likewise, it's commonplace for politicians to say things that they'd like to be true, but can't possibly be sure they will be. If you want to be entertainingly, succinctly, intelligently disillusioned, read Matt D'Ancona's smart little book: Post-Truth. </p><p>***</p><p>What is driving this? When I once asked Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's formidable press secretary, he answered casually: we are living in \"an information war\". And, I'd argue that in that war, technology is squarely on the hook for the weaponisation of the news. In particular, technology is responsible for post-truth in four ways: First, the battle for attention. By definition, the more information that's created, the less attention we have to give it. The internet may have given us the tools for a more rigorous interrogation of policy; but it's also given us a lot more noise and, to cut through it, politicians have become less substantive, more shrill and showy. The battle for attention rewards those politicians who can grab it - even if that means being sentimental, simplistic and loose with the truth. Second, filter bubbles. Algorithms, it turns out, are not impartial. Networks of friends, families and followers tell us the things we'd like to - and we're likely to - hear. They don't naturally point us to different experiences, opposing opinions or a balanced point of view.</p><p> Nor do they push us towards moderate, measured arguments: instead, they drive us to extreme content, further into our communities and, ironically, out of touch with the other. The filter bubble fuels hyper-partisanship.</p><p>Third, the exploitation of data. The patient, determined journalism of The Observer, The New York Times and Channel 4 over the past few days has made this point better than I ever can. Cambridge Analytica looks like a case study in the abuse of data for political ends. And, perhaps what's just as breath-taking, is what you can do legally and uncontroversially: Facebook boasted of its help \"triggering a landslide\" for the SNP in the 2015 elections; at the same time, the Tories are said to have issued 2,000 versions of their campaign messaging, tailored for different profiles gleaned from personal data acquired from social media.</p><p>Bob Mueller's investigation into the 2016 may or not tell us something conclusive about Russian collusion: it certainly tells us something undeniable about the vulnerability of Western democracy to anyone with a few million dollars, a bot factory and a sense of mischief. We need to know more about possible foreign meddling in the UK's recent series of votes. We also need to understand better how political campaigns purchase and use our personal information - and how technology platforms market the data. For this is not a loophole; it's a business. This data doesn't come cheap. So, it means campaigns getting more expensive, more money in politics, a greater voice for the wealthy and lesser one for the poor. It means that politics on the internet doesn't reinforce common ground, but subdivides it, shaping messages to suit you, fostering identity politics. And it means that we are witnessing the privatisation of personal data for use in politics - in other words, the tech companies, aided and abetted by the political parties, are exploiting privacy and the privilege of being private sector businesses to remake the public square.</p><p> And, fourth, virality - aka clickbait. Connectivity currently rewards crap and punishes quality. In the digital world, an hysterical message is likely to carry further than a considered one - a fact that's being gamed. Antonio Garcia Martinez, the author of Chaos Monkeys and a former employee of Facebook, has sparked an extraordinary row with an article in Wired. He demonstrates how the Trump campaign exploited the Facebook algorithm to get more media for less money than the Clinton campaign: it posted provocative content that created buzz, drove likes and shares, that went viral.</p><p>As you'll have noticed, I haven't put fake news in my list of four. There are many different varieties of untruth: propaganda, spin, partial reporting. I remember walking across the newsroom floor in The Times a few years back and hearing Ruth Gledhill, our extraordinary religion correspondent, getting increasingly worked up. \"You told me you'd gone to Jerusalem. You told me you were there,\" she was saying, \"But then I discover you weren't. You lied to me. And you're...a bishop.\" It's not just politicians, fishermen and people on dating websites who struggle with the truth. And it's not new. Fake news, as originally defined, is an overstated problem. When the term was coined, it meant the deliberate creation of misleading information to attract eyeballs for commercial gain or political advantage. The Pope endorses Donald Trump is a classic of its kind. If the tech companies put their minds - not to mention their engineering might - to it, they could detect and deter such behaviour online easily. Fake news should be like spam in the early days of the internet - a nuisance but fixable.</p><p>But, of course, Fake news has come to mean much more than that. It's been appropriated by everyone to cover news they don't like. It's become an excuse for politicians to rubbish journalism. And for readers and audiences it speaks to a genuine feeling, a weary sense that it's harder than ever to get a grip on reality.  Politics feels like a confidence trick. And, as with all confidence tricks, the result is that, in the end, you lose confidence in it. Yascha Mounk, the Harvard academic and political scientist of the moment, looked at people's views on democracy in Europe and the US. The results were startling. In the United States, over two-thirds of older Americans believed that it was absolutely essential to live in a democracy; among millennials, less than one-third did. Twenty years ago, one in 16 Americans thought that \"army rule\" was a good system of government. A few years ago, one in six did. The charge sheet against Big Tech runs to more than damaging democracy. It includes:</p><p>facilitating hate speech and terrorism, enabling child pornography and paedophile rings, shielding criminality and corruption by defending encryption, plundering privacy by gathering personal information, screen addiction, anxiety, inadequacy, online bullying and chronic mental health problems; giving jobs to robots and taking them away from humans; avoiding billions in tax, thereby not paying to help fix the huge public policy problems they're creating; concentrating fortunes in the hands of the few and dominating the internet space; investing in unfettered and unregulated AI that may, eventually, run all or part of our lives. And that's the short list.</p><p>For a couple of years now, I have argued that the argument of our times is between the Valley and the Hill - Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill, a shorthand for technology and politics globally. It seems clear now that 2018 is seeing that battle come to life. A techlash has begun. My friend Benji Vaughan's prediction at the start of the year that we've hit Peak Platform looks like one to watch.</p><p>In determining what happens next, all of us as citizens have a part to play. And, in particular, there are questions for three players: tech companies, politicians and journalists. The tech companies face a stark, but obvious choice. Either they are going to set new standards by which they operate - or their future will be decided for them. They should delete or demote dangerous information online; they should be transparent about what they're doing with our data, particularly in politics; they should take responsibility for public outcomes, not just take an interest in individual engagement. They have done precious little to halt the destruction of the business model for journalism; there's plenty they could do to help rebuild it. Unlike many others, I'm at least faintly optimistic that they will. No business is perfect. But companies change and improve: Google has. I suspect Facebook will. How much, how soon is up to them. Judging by the gathering political storm, it's unlikely to be soon enough. Politicians have, until now, been flimsy and partial in their willingness to take on tech. But they are now limbering up to set the rules by which these companies operate - or break them up. Of course, this is risky. Regulators will often fix a problem of the past at the expense of the possibilities of the future.</p><p>But this debate about regulation is well overdue. For too long, we've laboured under some myths. One is that you can't regulate the internet age because it's international, abundant and fiendishly complex. Another is that the politicians will be out-foxed by the geeks. And a third is that the genie is out of the bottle, that Silicon Valley is too rich and powerful to be tamed. This laissez-faire fatalism flies in the face of what we're seeing in China, Turkey, Russia. Let's not underestimate the power of the state. If it wants to require companies to behave in the public interest and sustain our system of democracy, it can.</p><p>***</p><p>The disruption of democracy represents a specific challenge to the institutions of journalism - and us as journalists. So, what should we do about it? The answer is...I don't know. Too rarely, we journalists say we don't know. We live in an age where there's a tendency to overclaim - so my starting point these days is to be honest and say this is a difficult problem and it will take some work. My instinct is that the right response for us it to be more democratic.</p><p>This means, first and foremost, getting after the story. We are not powerless to fix this. In fact, covering technology's impact on society is one of the essential tasks of journalism in the 21st century. If you go and see The Post or Spotlight or All the President's Men - or, indeed, the character of Hugh Cudlipp in Ink - and think nostalgically, ah, those were the days, then go back and watch them again. Those days are now. The powerful exist in many more guises than just the government. More than ever, we need journalists to reveal what's being done to us and, often, in our name.</p><p> Practically speaking, getting after the story means we need fewer people in Westminster and more on the West Coast - one of my regrets at the BBC and The Times is that, in both, we've had great people covering technology, but too few of them. And, when we talk about diversity in our newsrooms, as well we should, we must change the mix of mindsets: we need more engineers and scientists if we are going to have a chance to report effectively on  algorithms and AI. </p><p>In choosing sides - in being more democratic - we must do more to stand in solidarity with fellow journalists being persecuted for doing their jobs. What's happening in Turkey is shocking and, whether it's the trial of the 18 Cumhuriyet newspaper or other journalists incarcerated by the state, we need to keep it in the headlines. We need to focus on the fate of the editors, reporters and bloggers in Russia, Congo and Chad held in detention in connection with the reporting. There's the obscene incarceration of two Reuters journalists reporting murders in Rakhine in Myanmar. And, closer to home, the persistent harassment by the Iranian government of friends and family of the exceptional journalists working for the BBC's Persian service. </p><p>Being more democratic also means defending the institutions that enable good citizenship. To my mind, this means we should stand up for Sky News when people suggest it should be shut down to smooth the way for a merger. It's an important part of the range of views, the plurality of TV news in the UK. It means we should stand up for the independence of the BBC. It is - and must be seen to be - independent of the government. So, while I'm a firm  believer in the licence fee, the manner by which it's set - basically on the say so of the Chancellor - should, I think, be reconsidered come the next Charter. Likewise, I favour an independent commission to organise future TV debates, similar to the US Commission on Presidential Debates. As it happens, I think the best form for testing the mettle of our future leaders is Question Time. But the fact is that politicians can and do game the media in the run-up to the elections; camera-shy politicians, typically incumbents, can duck debates and bend them out of shape; broadcasters can say little about this chicanery at the time without imperilling their impartiality; all in all, the public loses out. </p><p>Strengthening our institutions also means backing the BBC. I realise I am addressing the great and the good of Fleet Street this evening - not, I suspect, the most receptive audience for the case to increase the funding of the BBC. All the more reason, I think, to make it. The idea of the BBC having \"imperial ambitions\" online looks increasingly absurd - and self-defeating. The BBC's dwarfed by the giants of Silicon Valley, not just in technology and size of audience, but, now, in content spend, too. In the 24/7 news business, the likes of CCTV, RT and the other shiny propagandists vastly outgun the BBC's resources. For the voices of British journalism and, by that I include British newspaper journalism, to be heard around the world, the BBC needs to be expanding what it's doing globally in English. I would argue for an increase in Government funding for the BBC's World News TV service to complement what it's done for BBC World Service language services. In a Brexit world, it speaks volumes for who we are and what we stand for.</p><p> And, in the UK, rather than trimming what the BBC is doing online and on social media, we should be investing and expanding it. We need to strengthen the public square in the digital space. We need to create common ground and room for civilised disagreement. We need to ensure young people can easily get the information they need to be active citizens. We need safe environments to inform and entertain on the internet. Heaven knows, I know how annoying the BBC can be. No-one shouts at the radio as much as the people who work - or have worked - there. But if the BBC hadn't been created in 1922 to ensure the enormous power of radio was used to give the best of everything to everyone, today you'd create the BDC - the British Digital Corporation - to serve, just the same, the public good in the internet age. If we want to strengthen the system of freedom and choice, both in our country and around the world, we should strengthen the BBC.</p><p>Finally, being more democratic requires us, the news media, to listen. If we consider the criticisms that are made of us, they go something like this: you missed Madoff and Volkswagen, you missed the financial crisis and the fiction of WMD, you missed Grenfell, you missed Brexit and Trump. You bombard us, mostly depress us, with news, but offer little context for understanding or constructive solutions for the future. You pile in on politicians, but your newsrooms are as bound up in the arcane processes and outdated thinking as they are. You're samey: your products, people, business models are all so similar. You're cosy with the powerful; you're out of touch with the people. Even now, we tell you that Brexit is done and we're bored of the process and, still, you give us reams of Brexit. You've never made the off button look quite so appealing. And let's allow for the fact that some of this criticism may be overdone. Some of it, sure enough, comes with the grinding of axes. But, if we listen, we must hear that the public is demanding a renewal of journalism. Like the politicians, we journalists are being asked to do things differently.</p><p>For more than two decades, every newsroom I've worked in has produced more. It's clear, this is a fool's errand. The business of making more doesn't work. The advertising model doesn't support it. The customer doesn't value it. If we want to do valuable journalism, we need to do less, better.</p><p>To my mind, this also means doing more, slowly. I recognise the imperative of speed in news - being first, breaking the news. But so much of the work that has really counted has, in my experience, taken time. When I was at The Times, whether it was investigating child sex grooming in Rotherham or Rochdale, reporting on the family courts, campaigning on adoption, pushing for cities fit for cycling or exposing tax scams, it all took time - and it was worth it. Likewise at the BBC, getting inside prisons, immigration centres and juvenile detention, examining the police's conduct of Operation Midland, tracing the stories of migrants into and, then, across Europe, deciphering the Panama and the Paradise Papers, investigating sex abuse in football, they all took time - and they were worth it. From the New York Times on Harvey Weinstein to the FT on the President's Club, The Times on Oxfam to The Sunday Times on Fifa, the journalism that stands the test of time takes some time.</p><p> Slow news - original investigations, thorough analysis, informed opinion - is, I like to think, what more and more people want. But my enthusiasm for it opens me up to parody. My leaving video from the BBC had a lovely clip of slow news in action: Kathy Clugston languorously mouthing the words to the morning bulletin, while John Humphrys sat back, feet on desk and leafed through a copy of Heat magazine. The strange thing is that the longer I've been a journalist, the more idealistic I've become. I believe our job is to empower the individual, expose injustice and examine the ideas that improve our society. That means that we journalists - and our newsrooms - need to step away from party politics and lean further into the problems we face and the answers we can generate. I'm more interested in technology, the 100 year life, business, culture and the planet - the five things that touch us all every day - than I am drawn by the goings on in our political parties. Increasingly, our current politics looks old - reheating isms of the 19th and 20th centuries; socialism and nationalism on the left and right, liberalism in the centre. It's increasingly unclear that any of these hold the answer to the problems we face in the decades ahead. Again, I think this is a spur to renew journalism. It falls to us to do the work. To ensure our newsrooms identify the information and examine the ideas that will fix the 21st century. We can and should recommit to that purpose.</p><p>When I took over as Editor of The Times, I went to see the great William Rees-Mogg and we had a conversation, like two children in a playground, about which is your favourite page in the paper. William loved the Letters Page, carrying, as it does, all the expertise, enthusiasms and eccentricities of Times readers. I loved the Leader page, as it was the experience of Leader conference every day that forced me to recognise what we knew and what we didn't, to come to a clear point of view that became the lens through which we saw everything else. Since leaving the BBC, I've been rather fixated on how you might combine both, the openness of Letters and the discipline of Leaders. I want to see if we can develop a format and a set of products that, in effect, offers people a seat at the news table - a system of organised listening.</p><p>***</p><p>Tonight, you have done more than your fair share of listening. Thank you. If you find yourself wondering, what was that about? The argument, in 140 characters or less, goes like this: We're in a democratic recession. Technology is rewarding bad behaviour in politics. Let's do something about it.</p><p>For just 10 years after Kennedy debated Nixon, as many people struggled to make sense of what the US said it was doing in Vietnam, Hannah Arendt, the political philosopher, assured herself that the facts would win out: \"Under normal circumstances,\" she wrote \"the liar is defeated by reality, for which there is no substitute; no matter how large the tissue of falsehood that an experienced liar has to offer, it will never be large enough, even if he enlists the help of computers, to cover the immensity of factuality.\"</p><p>The \"help of computers\" is greater now than she could have possibly imagined. But, still, it is up to us journalists to ensure that those \"normal circumstances\" prevail, that the liar is defeated by reality. Democracy is getting disrupted. What we make of that disruption falls, unusually heavily, on the world of journalism. It couldn't be a more rewarding or exciting time to be a journalist - or a more consequential one. Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42504964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXR-0TD1-JCJY-G0HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4893\"/><timeReceived>1:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

For the best part of a decade asset prices have been buoyed by the benign current of low to negative real interest rates and driven by the tail wind of quantitative easing (QE). The macro environment has undoubtedly been highly favourable, but even in fair weather excessive fees act as a drag on performance and investors are asking: is it time to lose the weight of unnecessary expenses and throw active managers overboard? There are two strands to active portfolio management: asset allocation and security selection. To stick with the nautical analogy, once you've chosen your destination, tactical asset allocation tion is like managing the route - there will be times when there is a tail wind behind equity markets or a prevailing current favouring bonds and you modify course accordingly. Our focus here, however, is on more granular decisions - the choice of funds and, for self-directed investors, stockpicking. </p><p>Whether investors crew their own portfolio, or decide they like the cut of various fund managers' jibs, the central question remains: Is it possible to beat the market? effective, The QE years have seen investors achieve outstanding returns from equities simply by buying the market. Thanks to the mass proliferation of cheap exchange traded funds (ETFs), this tactic has become more accessible and cost-effective, casting doubt over the worth of stockpicking and especially active managers. Why pay someone to underperform or take fees out of returns the market was offering anyway? The past decade, however, has been exceptional and, as monetary policy is slowly normalised, the effect of QE in obfuscating the relative merits of active and passive offering effect investing will subside.</p><p>The argument for coasting on the wind and the tide financial Long before the US Federal Reserve was pumping liquidity into the financial system with its QE programme (2008-14), there was plenty of research doubting the ability of American stockpickers to consistently beat the market. The efficient market hypothesis posits that in properly functioning markets, efficient 'Once fees are considered, if investors can only pick winners slightly more than half the time, trackers will deliver superior net performance over the long term' information is rapidly reflected in prices, so individual investors cannot maintain an advantage. In other words, mean reversion is incredibly powerful in stock returns. The famous assertion made by Burton K Malkiel in 1973 was that monkeys throwing darts at the financial pages of the Wall Street Journal wouldn't underperform the experts. In a gimmick by that paper in the 1980s, fund managers did beat the monkeys (although Malkiel argued that their picks benefited from publicity), but only 51 per cent of stock picks beat the market. Advocates of passive investing seized on this, pointing out that once fees are considered, if investors can only pick winners slightly more than half the time, trackers will deliver superior net perforon performance over the long term.</p><p>returns and years of opaque and, in some Charges undoubtedly can have a major drag on cases unscrupulous, fee structures have come home to roost for the asset management industry. The enforcement of Mifid II (the second iteration of the European markets in financial instruments directive) is a game-changer and the emphasis on fee transparency brings the question of value-added sharply into focus. The ease of creating multi-asset portfolios with ETFs has enabled a new breed of so-called robo-advisers to emerge. Producing risk-banded model portfolios with minimal fund charges, these companies can make a decent margin on solutions that are still cheaper for retail clients than those offered by traditional asset managers.</p><p>offered The marketing of passive portfolio solutions justifiably) suffering and a regulatory zeitgeist that (justifiably) is focused on costs and transparency has contributed to the narrative that active investment isn't good value for money. Coupled with the adverse publicity generated by famous fund managers such as Neil Woodford suffering bad recent years, investors have been encouraged to move from active to passive funds. Growth has been spectacular, with ETFGI Consulting reporting that assets invested in ETFs and exchange traded products (ETPs) globally breached the $5 trillion mark at the end of May 2018, the 52nd consecutive month of net inflows.</p><p>inflows.</p><p>Making the case for active In a sustained bull market, it is easy to focus just on cost and total returns - when benchmarks are going up and it's cheap and easy to invest in them, where's the incentive to pay higher fees and add the risk of a manager's more concentrated approach? The information ratio is a tool for assessing how the deviation managers make from benchmarks, or 'tracking error', adds value. The higher the information ratio, the better the manager has performed, and past exercises ranking UK mutual funds on this measure have shown that targeting most geographies, the best active funds - even in the recent years of exceptional monetary policy - have generated excess returns versus benchmarks.</p><p>In a March 2017 presentation to delegates from the Chartered Institute of Securities and Investment (CISI), Jonathan Gumpel of Brooks MacDonald showed empirical evidence in support of active fund management. Using information ratio figures extracted from FE Analytics, Mr Gumpel found it was only among funds focused on North American equities where active funds struggled to outperform trackers over one-, three-and five-year periods. For UK, Japanese, European and emerging market equity funds, a significant number of active funds had positive information ratios, especially over three and five years.</p><p>Repeating the investigation of FE Analytics data for mutual funds in June 2018, of 260 mutual funds targeting the UK stock market in the IA UK All Companies TR list, 135 active funds had positive information ratios. Passive funds should in most instances have little tracking error to their benchmark, but after costs 16 out of 27 passive funds had negative information ratios. This doesn't mean passives aren't good value for money - they have to charge something and the costs are generally lower - but it does show that there are many active managers who do add value after fees.</p><p>Active adds value Mutual Total active funds Total Passive funds with positive passive MF with Period surveyed Information ratio MF negative IR 1 year 260 135 27 16 3 year 248 89 29 27 5 year 238 114 27 26 This brief survey highlights important facts about both passive and active mutual funds. Firstly, if most active managers have positive information ratios, the worst must have done very badly. Sometimes this can be explained, especially over just one year, by the cyclical nature of a manager's investing style. That said, glancing up and down the list, there seems to be no discernible pattern between funds labelled 'growth', 'dynamic' or 'value' outperforming. This suggests a combination of misleading marketing of funds and a lack of style discipline by managers. The obvious conclusion is that there are simply good and bad managers.</p><p>Neither are passive funds created equal, with variation in their information ratios. As these results were based on performance net of fees, differences in cost is a factor. Also, the size and liquidity of the index tracked and the type of replication - whether the fund bought all the stocks in the index or selected a sample - would have a bearing on tracking error and returns.</p><p>The one thing that cannot be said, both from our quick glance at UK equity funds and Mr Gumpel's more comprehensive study a year ago, is that all active funds have been poor value for money. Such accusations clearly rankle with Mr. Gumpel, he says: \"Extraordinary, isn't it, that pretty much everything people have been told/understood of the active versus passive/tracker debate is wrong and that the US-led tracker industry/lobby has managed to pull the wool over so many people's eyes and so many industry thinkers and journalists have just accepted it?\" Where passive is best Low charges don't necessarily mean better net performance by passive funds, but cost is clearly a factor. For example, the Vanguard FTSE 100 unit trust tracks the index with an ongoing charge of just six basis points (six basis points is six hundredths of 1 per cent). The fund has only been live since 2016 but looking at recent FE data, as of June 2018, it has performed well over one year. The data we looked at was focused on mutual funds but, given FTSE 100 ETFs charge similar low fees (iShares FTSE 100 UCITS ETF, ISF, charges seven basis points and has tracking error of just 1 per cent), the best ETFs would have aboveaverage information ratios where the index they track has done well.</p><p>Low fees and minimal tracking error are strong arguments for using ETFs and they are a cost-effective option for gaining exposure to whole markets. The 2017 research carried out by Mr Gumpel concedes this would have been a good way to invest in North American equities over five, three and one year horizons. Most of the research in support of the efficient market hypothesis has been focused on the US and the weight of empirical evidence suggests trackers deliver good returns more consistently from the world's largest stock market.</p><p>This has certainly been the case in the QE years, when US mega caps have attracted vast inflows of capital. The Federal Reserve's $4.5 trillion asset buying programme and rock-bottom interest rates saw US Treasury yields fall to record lows. This in turn lowered the forward rate of return needed to imply an attractive risk premium for equities. Investors were therefore prepared to pay higher multiples for solid income stocks (especially as new bond issues offered ever smaller coupons) and for quality growth stocks without generous dividends, such as tech giants Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN) and the holding company created for Google, Alphabet (US:GOOG). The combined weighting of 'big tech' and some of America's biggest defensive stalwarts such as Walmart (US:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (US:JNJ) and Pfizer (US:PFE) has made it very difficult for active managers investing in S&amp;P 500 stocks to beat the index, when these behemoths' stock prices have risen.</p><p>Since the Fed ended QE, some money from overseas investors, buoyed by other central banks' asset purchase programmes, has found its way into US equities. Low (albeit now rising) interest rates and a recovery in American corporate profits have also helped maintain the bull market. Growth investing has continued to outperform value as a style since the financial crisis and, in the US, it is the least volatile of large stocks that have done best. Analysis by London Business School (LBS) trio Dimson, Marsh and Staunton in the Credit Suisse Global Investment Yearbook 2018, calculates the average annualised return premium for low volatility US stocks between 2008 and 2017 as 6.2 per cent. Value investing by contrast has, on average, lost 2.9 per cent per year.</p><p>Value has also done badly in the UK, losing on average 2.6 per cent a year from 2008-17, but the reasons why an investor might choose a passive core holding here differ. The most effective return factor in the UK over the period has been momentum - whereby shares that have risen most in price continue to do well in the subsequent period. The LBS team estimates momentum returns (2008-17) at 13.5 per cent a year for the UK stock market.</p><p>Momentum stockpicking strategies are near impossible to follow thanks to the level of turnover and the faith and discipline required to persevere with the system. Some smart beta momentum ETFs now exist but these are relatively expensive thanks to high trading costs, and will seriously underperform when momentum periodically fails, so aren't suitable as a core holding.</p><p>Active managers will, of course, hold some stocks with positive momentum but slowness to change their opinion quickly (anchoring bias) and staying disciplined to their style can cost upside. Another piece of analysis by Dimson, Marsh and Staunton in the Yearbook shows that the difference between momentum winners and losers among the largest 100 UK shares is worth the equivalent of 10.3 per cent, on average, per year looking at long-run data between 1900 and 2017. The study weighted companies by market capitalisation Lovely beta...</p><p>One of the most influential studies is Eugene Fama and Kenneth French's multi-factor model. They posited returns of US stocks could be attributed to three factors: correlation with the overall movements of the market, or beta; the value premium earned for investing in unfashionable companies that have been overlooked; and the size premium for buying smaller companies with volatile stock prices. Later Mark Carhart added a fourth factor, momentum, which is the tendency of the fastest rising stocks to continue outperforming as more market participants catch on to a good news story and pile in.</p><p>Beta is also used as the umbrella term for the portion of investors' returns that can be attributable to market-weighted exposure to these factors. Returns due to the skill of an investor in picking stocks and deciding portfolio weightings are known as alpha. In a twist of marketing, the term 'smart beta' has been used to describe strategies where alternative index weightings or automated and systematic stock selection mechanisms are utilised to capture higher proportions of different betas; be that value, size, momentum or other premiums product creators have deemed viable and sellable, such as quality, minimum volatility or dividend stocks.</p><p>The long-term effectiveness of investing factors or styles is well attested to. Research by MSCI indices, splicing their own-built index data with the Barr indices that go back to the mid-1970s, highlights how different global style weightings have beaten the MSCI World equity index. There is, however, an important caveat. Different styles can also go through periods of serious underperformance.</p><p>With smart beta ETFs available to directly target factor returns, it is also possible to question whether it might be better for investors to rotate between styles using these passive products, rather than pay a manager. The danger is that we haven't seen how passive smart beta will behave in a major sell-off. Active funds may be more discerning in terms of the liquidity and weighting of holdings, meaning that managers might be better able to act nimbly in a bear market.</p><p>Using smart beta products still requires market timing so, even if the products are passive, at the portfolio level decisions are very much active. In a serious sell-off, the risk is that smart beta turns out simply to be dumb alpha.</p><p>and the effect would be even greater if the index was equal weighted. Momentum may be the most ephemeral of factors but holding a tracker is insurance against losing out entirely when a manager doesn't hold the latest big winners.</p><p>Recent work by Victoria Dabrynskaya (2014 and 2017) has suggested fund managers are reticent about buying on momentum because they are worried stocks with expanding valuation multiples will have a lower forward rate of return and do worse than the benchmark. This gives rise to the paradox of managers missing out on a powerful return factor and some may even underperform their benchmark, precisely out of the fear of doing so.</p><p>Rising dispersion is good for active managers Thanks to cheap costs and their ability to partially capture factor returns that sometimes completely elude fund managers, market-cap weighted ETFs make a good core holding. Fund data research shows, however, that - even amid favourable conditions for passive funds - the very best performers are overwhelmingly active managers.</p><p>As central banks begin to retreat from loose monetary policy, conditions will be ripe for active managers to outperform benchmarks. Dispersion in stock markets can refer to volatility, which is the standard deviation of returns, or the range of betas (a measure of an individual stock price's co-movement with the direction of the market, showing its sensitivity to market risk) of stocks in the market. The greater the level of dispersion, the more opportunity there is to pick individual stocks that will beat their benchmark.</p><p>With monetary stimulus being scaled back or reversed, depending on which region you look at, there will be less liquidity in financial markets than there has been over the past few years. As capital becomes scarcer, patterns in its allocation change. Fundamental factors such as companies' exposure to GDP growth, ability to generate cash from operations, working capital cycles and the strength of balance sheets will be considered more carefully and have greater effect in determining share price performance. The UK is traditionally a stockpickers' market and with GDP growth slowing but not yet stalling, there could be attractive opportunities.</p><p>Lower levels of dispersion in the recent past has suited passive investing as it meant that, in an environment when the market has been positive about taking risk, there was a free ride of beta gains to be captured. One argument that has frequently been made, especially in relation to the US market, is that passive investing creates its own momentum. Large inflows via passive vehicles are allocated to the market and companies with the highest market capitalisation weights receive the highest inflows and therefore the biggest just get bigger.</p><p>While this may be true in terms of expanding market capitalisation, there is no distorting effect on index weightings. What it does mean, though, is that lower dispersion between companies and sectors has been perpetuated as 'buying the market' and means there is less judgement being made as to the changing merits of companies. What could be very interesting for managers of US equity funds is if several companies in a huge sector such as tech were to start disappointing on earnings. If this encouraged selling of market trackers, then share prices of smaller companies would be affected, too. If these businesses were performing well then value opportunities may return, which would increase dispersion and favour active fund management. Up until now, though, generally impressive earnings growth and an overall pattern of forecast beats by some of the big US tech companies has prevented such an outbreak of nerves.</p><p>In other asset classes Balanced portfolios don't just include equities and there are several instances where paying for an active manager represents value for money. In fixed income, for example, accessing lower-risk short duration quality government bonds might as well be done using an ETF. For more complex investments, such as higher duration (more sensitive to interest rate changes) bonds, high-yield bonds or emerging markets bonds, then the skill of an active manager in managing risks relating to credit, reinvestment, liquidity and duration is worth the fees.</p><p>For an asset such as property, which is illiquid and has such a myriad of potential variables affecting returns, it almost never makes sense to invest passively, unless the purpose is pure speculation on the direction of real estate prices. Conversely, for an asset such as commodity prices, where the investment is almost certain to be price speculation, then passive vehicles make the most sense.</p><p>In short, there really shouldn't be an active versus passive debate - the best choice is to be agnostic. Passive vehicles have democratised access to a plethora of investment opportunities, but asset managers whose business model depends on passive products are being disingenuous in failing to recognise the breadth of quality active managers who demonstrably add value for investors. Charges will of course be a part of any decision - competition and scrutiny is beneficial in keeping fees fair - but active funds are often better value for money than they are given credit for.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The combined weighting of 'big tech' and some of America's biggest defensive stalwarts has made it very difficult for active managers investing in S&amp;P 500 stocks to beat the indexAs central banks such as the Federal Reserve in the US start to retreat from loose monetary policy, conditions will be ripe for active managers to outperform benchmarks</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-138826994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM8-PB01-JBVM-Y0S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3348\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 22, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

TALF, short for Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, was last used during the 2008 crisis. It accepts only some kinds of debt assets \u2014 chiefly securitized bundles of credit card, auto loans or small business loans \u2014 that carry the highest possible credit ratings.</p><p> The Fed should accept more types of assets, Mr. Rowan says, including other kinds of mortgages, certificates of deposit and short-term business loans known as commercial paper, across the investment-grade spectrum.</p><p>Mr. Rowan\u2019s argument: Lending markets are more troubled than they appear, so a broader program is needed to support a wider range of players. AAA-rated borrowers will mostly stockpile funds they receive from aid programs.</p><p>Apollo says its concerns are shared by other nonbank organizations, like fellow investment firm TPG as well as insurers and retirement plans. A bipartisan group of Congress members also sent a letter to the Fed chairman, Jay Powell, last week urging him to expand TALF\u2019s eligible assets.</p><p> It isn\u2019t clear how much Apollo itself stands to benefit from a change in the Fed\u2019s program: Many of its investments wouldn\u2019t qualify because of their credit ratings, but some of its other businesses would. Mr. Rowan argues in his presentation that he\u2019s looking out for the economy as a whole, and that failure to act would lead to a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs.</p><p>That said, investment firms are eyeing opportunities amid the panic.

Kayla Tausche is in Washington and is joined by JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, along with American University President Sylvia Mathews Burwell for more. Hi, Kayla. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Hi, Kelly. Thanks so much for having us and thanks to our esteemed guests today. In addition to that survey, they are also announcing a partnership, efforts under way between 15 companies, 13 universities to try to develop the 21st century curriculum for students and eventual workers for companies. So, our thanks to both of you for being here to discuss that and many other issues. Jamie, first the backdrop economically. We've heard from lots of CEOs, whether it's FedEx, UBS, about jitters. Potentially a global slowdown. And then the Business Roundtable Survey today showed a little bit of declining optimism. Is there a slowdown afoot? JAMIE DIMON: What I would call a 'slowdown' - there are always jitters. I've never been in business where there weren't jitters. And it's a little bit of a slowdown. But, you know, the Business Roundtable is very optimistic about the future. America, in particular, had less of a slowdown[6] than the rest of the world. But one of the things we try to focus on is: how do you make things better? So, this initiative today is a great example how business, government and this town can get together, create jobs for kids, you know, earning $50,000, $80,000 a year and so, the BRT is proud to be leading this effort. And these guys did an unbelievable thing in Washington building this. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Sylvia, 93% of American graduates are in a job six months after graduation. So, what needs to change about the degree if it's working so well already? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: So, at American University, we're very fortunate. As you said, 93% of our graduates[7] are within six months in jobs or graduate school. For many, making sure we are staying connected to the needs of the business community. And that's what this partnership is about, is making sure we know what those needs are from our students, we're giving them the curriculum and tools they need. And the way the partnership works is once our students complete the curriculum and have the credential, then they receive preferential treatment, both in terms of internships and jobs. So, they have preference when they do these credentials. So, it's keeping that tie healthy and good so we know what's needed in the economy and we're working to provide it. KAYLA TAUSCHE: The first step is getting into college, which now, I know, some applicants might worry with recent news that college admissions slots are for sale. How do you put those worries to rest? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: You know, what I would just say, the incidents of the last weeks are very disturbing to any of us in higher education. What they've done to the image trust, I think we have to all realize that it is an important thing. But I think for the vast majority of universities and the vast majority of applicants, I think they know that that is not what is happening. All of us, I'm sure, are taking steps to make sure we look at our processes, make sure if there are any things we can do to prevent that thing. There are so many great students out there. We're in the middle of the process\u2014as a matter of fact, our letters are going out today at American University and it is a great thing to see all these young people interested in coming. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie, as a parent, did it shock you? You raised three kids in hypercompetitive New York City. Was there ever pressure to tip the scales? JAMIE DIMON: What I read about was shocking. I mean, obviously, people want to help their kids and people get benefits just from having tutors and things like that. But that kind of stuff was shocking. And I'll leave that - we have enough problems ourselves, I'll leave it to higher education to deal with. KAYLA TAUSCHE: I know you gave $100,000 to Duke where two of your daughters went. $50,000 to Barnard. Is that a slippery slope though? JAMIE DIMON: I don't know if that was before or after, or something like that. We tend to support everything we've ever been associated with. And so, I think they got in on their own rights. KAYLA TAUSCHE: I want to ask you about the Fed, too. Of course, we are the pregame for Jay Powell's decision in just a little bit. Jamie, the Fed has said it will be patient. How long do you believe the Fed will be patient? JAMIE DIMON: The Fed should -- I mean, I find it amazing people are shocked when the Fed says they're data dependent. Of course, they are data dependent. Can you imagine the Fed saying they're not data dependent? I mean, when they say they're being patience, they're saying looking at current events, it looks like it may be awhile before they have to make a major decision about changing interest rates. And I have faith they'll do the right thing based on the data they have at the time. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Do you believe the Fed is between a rock[8] and a hard place, though? You raise rates too quickly, growth contracts. You stand pat for now, the economy overheats. JAMIE DIMON: I think that's always been true. I don't think they're between a rock and a hard place. I think they're trying to navigate what goes on today. You know, what's going on in the U.S. economy is pretty strong. This isn't like a bad thing. And I remind people rates go up because the economy is strong -- that's not necessarily a bad thing. A strong economy is far more important than a 25-basis point effect on the economy and jobs. KAYLA TAUSCHE: You've said the trade war, if it escalates, could tip the U.S. Into a recession. The President just said a few minutes ago that even if we get a deal with China where he says talks are going well, that tariffs could stay in place for a substantial period of time. How much of an overhang is that? JAMIE DIMON: Well, look, I didn't hear that. And I don't respond to minute-by-minute news like you guys do because I don't think it matters at all, to tell you the truth. So -- we've heard from the administration that they're working on very serious issues and made serious progress with China. We'd all like to see a deal done. And to the extent it's not done, and to the extent it's uncertainty, it's not good for the global economy. I'm not sure I'd say tip into a recession but it's certainly not good and you see that reflect in the market. Every time trade is going well, it goes up. Every time it's going badly, it goes down. And I have faith they're trying going to get an intelligent deal done, and it may take a little bit of time. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Are you worried that the President is saber rattling with Europe[9] now, too? JAMIE DIMON: Again, what I have been told is that they're making progress in Europe. And, you know, the President has his methods and I wouldn't go about them but it's hard for me to say to say some of these methods didn't get people to the table. I think both are true. We like to see to the table to conclusion. And we think that's the best thing for the American economy, the global economy and the whole - you know, the rest of the world. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Sylvia, we'd like to ask you to put on your hat as a former budget and health official here. The Fed Chair has also said that the U.S. cannot spend as if deficits do not matter, but the conversation in the democratic field right now is that college should potentially be free and that health care should potentially be free. Do you think those two things should happen? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: So, I think when we talk about the issues of deficits, I'm still of the school that deficits do matter. And they matter for the markets, they matter for the economy, and they matter for policy investments that we make as a nation. And I think we have to consider\u2014 you were just discussing the issue of the question of a potential recession-- when we have the kind of debt to GDP ratios that are continuing to increase, is that a problem for our own resiliency as a nation if we go into those things? So I'm of that school. Do I think there are issues in health care? I think in health care, the most pressing issue that we can work on, or what everyone agrees on across party lines and that is access, affordability and quality. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Do you support the six candidates who say that Medicare For All is the direction the country should go in? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: You know, what I think we should do on all of these issues is focus on the substance of those three issues. And that's what I've said when I was Secretary and what I say now. Focus on access, affordability and quality and I believe there are steps we can take right now to make progress actually on all three of those. And whether that's in the pharmaceutical space or that's in the space of changing the way we pay for health care, not in terms of transactions, but pay for the outcomes. And those are the kinds of steps we as a nation can work on right now. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie, you said this week that America can afford anything. Can we afford $22 trillion in debt, a deficit that's nearing a trillion dollars this year, the proposals the democratic field is putting forward and potential a recession at somepoint? JAMIE DIMON: Let me just say -- a couple of points. First of all, slogans are not policy and we all agree we need a lot to do on health care, on infrastructure, on skills and education. Thoughtful, proper policy that needs to be executed by thoughtful, bright politicians who have to lead the population we have. The debt to GDP for the world is 80% of GDP in America. So, it's like net debt is like $17 billion or $18 billion of the GDP. It's 250% in Japan. So, it's not what I call - I totally agree with her, it's important to have fiscal discipline. It's not an immediate issue. It's not going to put the economy into a recession tomorrow. But as that curve goes like this, which it does, you know, mostly because of burgeoning health care costs, we should fix the problem before it becomes a problem. It will fix itself at one point. I also think policymakers should separate we need proper business taxation, we need proper infrastructure, we need proper skills, and then how we afford to pay for it. We should not spend all our time to do this but not that, because you'll slow down growth. I mean, there should be -- both Democrats and Republicans need a growth agenda that we can afford to pay for if we're intelligent. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Is it a growth agenda to regulate the big technology giants? Do you think that should happen? JAMIE DIMON: Well, no, but again, that's a very -- people say that we made binary arguments. It's not binary. If someone has a reason where competition is unfair, then maybe you need regulation. And that's true for all of our businesses. And so, to me if people have legitimate complaints, people should look at where should there be fair competition? We all deal with. We all have to deal with antitrust and competition and things like that. So, you know, I'm not an expert in tech policy, but you know, to the extent they should do the same thing, they should look at it. KAYLA TAUSCHE: But you are an expert in managing a company under fire and frankly, the approach to tech feels a lot like the approach to banks after the financial crisis - executives hauled before Congress, multibillion dollar fines and proposals to break up these massive companies. Do you sympathize with them? JAMIE DIMON: They haven't had the benefit of the full monty yet. And if I was them, I might be getting prepared for it. KAYLA TAUSCHE: What advice would you offer to Mark Zuckerberg? JAMIE DIMON: Really get prepared for it. And which, look, it seems to me like they're doing a lot of work in privacy, and you know, robots, and democracy and who can advertise on their platforms, but it's a lot of work. And you know, my experience has always been when you get attacked by someone, you get one group, it could be every country, every AG, every regulator all at the same time. So, any company that's under attack like that or a threat, they should really gear up and look at it as a very broad-based, extensive type of thing they have to deal with, and listen carefully to the complaints on the other side. There are sometimes legitimate complaints you should be very, very reactive to. KAYLA TAUSCHE: But you're in the business of underwriting and advising these companies. How long are you telling them to be prepared for the onslaught? And are you putting forth models that show what the sum of the parts would be if you break them up? JAMIE DIMON: Well I think that's a whole different issue. I think, you know, we would offer help to any client of ours that asked for help. And you know, how they run their company and what they split up, that's a whole different issue. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Sylvia, one company -- one big tech giant in this area that is getting a pat on the back, at least here in Washington, is Amazon for the investment it's making. When you talk to students, what's the appetite of students to go work for Amazon in Crystal City or in National Landing and do you think they will be able to deliver 25,000 good paying jobs? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: Well, you know, I think the effort we're talking about today with the Greater Washington Partnership is about bringing together the needs of our community, our economy, in this Greater Washington area with what universities provide. And I think our students at American University are quite excited about that. Because at American University, 91% of our students are doing experiential learning. That means internships. And they're excited about that. The numbers you stated in our We Know Success website, where we tell people: After you finish your degree at American University, within six months, you're either in Graduate School or you have a job. Those numbers are 93%. Having a place like Amazon here is, I think, a great thing for our students and they're excited about it. I think they're also excited about having an innovation and technology sense to the community that they might be staying in, once they come here. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie\u2014 JAMIE DIMON: Can I just add this? It's really important. One of the reasons companies that come here is because they have great universities that they can draw really attractive kids. But the 25,000 jobs, what people don't understand, it's going to be another 75,000 outside of that. Because when you have a company move here, they need people who prepare meals and clean floors to engineers to marketing people to lawyers to accountants to service that whole ecosystem. So, actually you can lift up the whole community and affordable housing, so you lift up - you don't over gentrify and stuff like that. So, these are huge benefits. And it's because the place is hospitable to business and wants to create jobs for kids and the health of the university system. University systems are often, the ecosystem around them is a huge success. You can look at Boston, you can look at Silicon Valley, can look at parts of New York, and you can look at look at Washington, D.C. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Did New York make a mistake in pushing Amazon away and how much more are you investing here because of the expectation that they will grow more here? JAMIE DIMON: Of course they made a mistake. There would have been 100,000 jobs in total there. Which, like I said, would have been jobs across the whole spectrum. And, people -- the mistake people make about New York, the tax benefits, New York has the highest real estate rates, the highest individual rates, the highest corporate rates[10]. Those are effectively a reduction of the rates for a time period. So you know, I think it would have been hugely beneficial for New York. But if they for New York doesn't want them, so be it. They could go elsewhere. KAYLA TAUSCHE: A lot of this sounding -- JAMIE DIMON: And it's not so bad for us because they would have competed for the same people I want. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie, your dexterous in your political speak. You had a dinner a Salon dinner off the record with some reporters last night. And -- JAMIE DIMON: Way off the record, huh? KAYLA TAUSCHE: Well, the fact of the dinner was reported, but a funny blog on Dealbreaker on Monday said that your workforce announcement was one flag lapel pin short of a campaign event. Is this you testing the waters? JAMIE DIMON: No, I am a patriot at heart. It's far more important than JPMorgan. And we are making a full effort to help anywhere we can help our country and work skills[11]. We announced the 350 million program around the world. Trying to do exactly what they're doing here. And it's a local -- it's got to work locally. It does not work anywhere else. So we're going out with RFPs to local universities, community schools, mayors and see if we can create the same kind of ecosystem that's working here to lift up those communities. KAYLA TAUSCHE: What do you hope President Trump tells the Business Roundtable when he meets with you guys tomorrow? JAMIE DIMON: My experience with President Trump is that he says whatever he wants to say. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie Dimon, Sylvia Burwell, we appreciate both of your time today. Thank you so much. SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: Thank you. The post Jamie Dimon On How JPMorgan Is Making The Planet A Great Place [Full CNBC Interview][12] appeared first on ValueWalk[13].

The Business Roundtable has published its Quarterly CEO Economic Outlook Survey and executives are less bullish than a year ago. Kayla Tausche is in Washington and is joined by JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, along with American University President Sylvia Mathews Burwell for more. Hi, Kayla. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Hi, Kelly. Thanks so much for having us and thanks to our esteemed guests today. In addition to that survey, they are also announcing a partnership, efforts under way between 15 companies, 13 universities to try to develop the 21st century curriculum for students and eventual workers for companies. So, our thanks to both of you for being here to discuss that and many other issues. Jamie, first the backdrop economically. We've heard from lots of CEOs, whether it's FedEx, UBS, about jitters. Potentially a global slowdown. And then the Business Roundtable Survey today showed a little bit of declining optimism. Is there a slowdown afoot? JAMIE DIMON: What I would call a 'slowdown' - there are always jitters. I've never been in business where there weren't jitters. And it's a little bit of a slowdown. But, you know, the Business Roundtable is very optimistic about the future. America, in particular, had less of a slowdown[7] than the rest of the world. But one of the things we try to focus on is: how do you make things better? So, this initiative today is a great example how business, government and this town can get together, create jobs for kids, you know, earning $50,000, $80,000 a year and so, the BRT is proud to be leading this effort. And these guys did an unbelievable thing in Washington building this. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Sylvia, 93% of American graduates are in a job six months after graduation. So, what needs to change about the degree if it's working so well already? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: So, at American University, we're very fortunate. As you said, 93% of our graduates[8] are within six months in jobs or graduate school. For many, making sure we are staying connected to the needs of the business community. And that's what this partnership is about, is making sure we know what those needs are from our students, we're giving them the curriculum and tools they need. And the way the partnership works is once our students complete the curriculum and have the credential, then they receive preferential treatment, both in terms of internships and jobs. So, they have preference when they do these credentials. So, it's keeping that tie healthy and good so we know what's needed in the economy and we're working to provide it. KAYLA TAUSCHE: The first step is getting into college, which now, I know, some applicants might worry with recent news that college admissions slots are for sale. How do you put those worries to rest? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: You know, what I would just say, the incidents of the last weeks are very disturbing to any of us in higher education. What they've done to the image trust, I think we have to all realize that it is an important thing. But I think for the vast majority of universities and the vast majority of applicants, I think they know that that is not what is happening. All of us, I'm sure, are taking steps to make sure we look at our processes, make sure if there are any things we can do to prevent that thing. There are so many great students out there. We're in the middle of the process\u2014as a matter of fact, our letters are going out today at American University and it is a great thing to see all these young people interested in coming. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie, as a parent, did it shock you? You raised three kids in hypercompetitive New York City. Was there ever pressure to tip the scales? JAMIE DIMON: What I read about was shocking. I mean, obviously, people want to help their kids and people get benefits just from having tutors and things like that. But that kind of stuff was shocking. And I'll leave that - we have enough problems ourselves, I'll leave it to higher education to deal with. KAYLA TAUSCHE: I know you gave $100,000 to Duke where two of your daughters went. $50,000 to Barnard. Is that a slippery slope though? JAMIE DIMON: I don't know if that was before or after, or something like that. We tend to support everything we've ever been associated with. And so, I think they got in on their own rights. KAYLA TAUSCHE: I want to ask you about the Fed, too. Of course, we are the pregame for Jay Powell's decision in just a little bit. Jamie, the Fed has said it will be patient. How long do you believe the Fed will be patient? JAMIE DIMON: The Fed should \u2014 I mean, I find it amazing people are shocked when the Fed says they're data dependent. Of course, they are data dependent. Can you imagine the Fed saying they're not data dependent? I mean, when they say they're being patience, they're saying looking at current events, it looks like it may be awhile before they have to make a major decision about changing interest rates. And I have faith they'll do the right thing based on the data they have at the time. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Do you believe the Fed is between a rock[9] and a hard place, though? You raise rates too quickly, growth contracts. You stand pat for now, the economy overheats. JAMIE DIMON: I think that's always been true. I don't think they're between a rock and a hard place. I think they're trying to navigate what goes on today. You know, what's going on in the U.S. economy is pretty strong. This isn't like a bad thing. And I remind people rates go up because the economy is strong \u2014 that's not necessarily a bad thing. A strong economy is far more important than a 25-basis point effect on the economy and jobs. KAYLA TAUSCHE: You've said the trade war, if it escalates, could tip the U.S. Into a recession. The President just said a few minutes ago that even if we get a deal with China where he says talks are going well, that tariffs could stay in place for a substantial period of time. How much of an overhang is that? JAMIE DIMON: Well, look, I didn't hear that. And I don't respond to minute-by-minute news like you guys do because I don't think it matters at all, to tell you the truth. So \u2014 we've heard from the administration that they're working on very serious issues and made serious progress with China. We'd all like to see a deal done. And to the extent it's not done, and to the extent it's uncertainty, it's not good for the global economy. I'm not sure I'd say tip into a recession but it's certainly not good and you see that reflect in the market. Every time trade is going well, it goes up. Every time it's going badly, it goes down. And I have faith they're trying going to get an intelligent deal done, and it may take a little bit of time. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Are you worried that the President is saber rattling with Europe[10] now, too? JAMIE DIMON: Again, what I have been told is that they're making progress in Europe. And, you know, the President has his methods and I wouldn't go about them but it's hard for me to say to say some of these methods didn't get people to the table. I think both are true. We like to see to the table to conclusion. And we think that's the best thing for the American economy, the global economy and the whole - you know, the rest of the world. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Sylvia, we'd like to ask you to put on your hat as a former budget and health official here. The Fed Chair has also said that the U.S. cannot spend as if deficits do not matter, but the conversation in the democratic field right now is that college should potentially be free and that health care should potentially be free. Do you think those two things should happen? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: So, I think when we talk about the issues of deficits, I'm still of the school that deficits do matter. And they matter for the markets, they matter for the economy, and they matter for policy investments that we make as a nation. And I think we have to consider\u2014 you were just discussing the issue of the question of a potential recession-- when we have the kind of debt to GDP ratios that are continuing to increase, is that a problem for our own resiliency as a nation if we go into those things? So I'm of that school. Do I think there are issues in health care? I think in health care, the most pressing issue that we can work on, or what everyone agrees on across party lines and that is access, affordability and quality. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Do you support the six candidates who say that Medicare For All is the direction the country should go in? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: You know, what I think we should do on all of these issues is focus on the substance of those three issues. And that's what I've said when I was Secretary and what I say now. Focus on access, affordability and quality and I believe there are steps we can take right now to make progress actually on all three of those. And whether that's in the pharmaceutical space or that's in the space of changing the way we pay for health care, not in terms of transactions, but pay for the outcomes. And those are the kinds of steps we as a nation can work on right now. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie, you said this week that America can afford anything. Can we afford $22 trillion in debt, a deficit that's nearing a trillion dollars this year, the proposals the democratic field is putting forward and potential a recession at somepoint? JAMIE DIMON: Let me just say \u2014 a couple of points. First of all, slogans are not policy and we all agree we need a lot to do on health care, on infrastructure, on skills and education. Thoughtful, proper policy that needs to be executed by thoughtful, bright politicians who have to lead the population we have. The debt to GDP for the world is 80% of GDP in America. So, it's like net debt is like $17 billion or $18 billion of the GDP. It's 250% in Japan. So, it's not what I call - I totally agree with her, it's important to have fiscal discipline. It's not an immediate issue. It's not going to put the economy into a recession tomorrow. But as that curve goes like this, which it does, you know, mostly because of burgeoning health care costs, we should fix the problem before it becomes a problem. It will fix itself at one point. I also think policymakers should separate we need proper business taxation, we need proper infrastructure, we need proper skills, and then how we afford to pay for it. We should not spend all our time to do this but not that, because you'll slow down growth. I mean, there should be \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans need a growth agenda that we can afford to pay for if we're intelligent. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Is it a growth agenda to regulate the big technology giants? Do you think that should happen? JAMIE DIMON: Well, no, but again, that's a very \u2014 people say that we made binary arguments. It's not binary. If someone has a reason where competition is unfair, then maybe you need regulation. And that's true for all of our businesses. And so, to me if people have legitimate complaints, people should look at where should there be fair competition? We all deal with. We all have to deal with antitrust and competition and things like that. So, you know, I'm not an expert in tech policy, but you know, to the extent they should do the same thing, they should look at it. KAYLA TAUSCHE: But you are an expert in managing a company under fire and frankly, the approach to tech feels a lot like the approach to banks after the financial crisis - executives hauled before Congress, multibillion dollar fines and proposals to break up these massive companies. Do you sympathize with them? JAMIE DIMON: They haven't had the benefit of the full monty yet. And if I was them, I might be getting prepared for it. KAYLA TAUSCHE: What advice would you offer to Mark Zuckerberg? JAMIE DIMON: Really get prepared for it. And which, look, it seems to me like they're doing a lot of work in privacy, and you know, robots, and democracy and who can advertise on their platforms, but it's a lot of work. And you know, my experience has always been when you get attacked by someone, you get one group, it could be every country, every AG, every regulator all at the same time. So, any company that's under attack like that or a threat, they should really gear up and look at it as a very broad-based, extensive type of thing they have to deal with, and listen carefully to the complaints on the other side. There are sometimes legitimate complaints you should be very, very reactive to. KAYLA TAUSCHE: But you're in the business of underwriting and advising these companies. How long are you telling them to be prepared for the onslaught? And are you putting forth models that show what the sum of the parts would be if you break them up? JAMIE DIMON: Well I think that's a whole different issue. I think, you know, we would offer help to any client of ours that asked for help. And you know, how they run their company and what they split up, that's a whole different issue. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Sylvia, one company \u2014 one big tech giant in this area that is getting a pat on the back, at least here in Washington, is Amazon for the investment it's making. When you talk to students, what's the appetite of students to go work for Amazon in Crystal City or in National Landing and do you think they will be able to deliver 25,000 good paying jobs? SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: Well, you know, I think the effort we're talking about today with the Greater Washington Partnership is about bringing together the needs of our community, our economy, in this Greater Washington area with what universities provide. And I think our students at American University are quite excited about that. Because at American University, 91% of our students are doing experiential learning. That means internships. And they're excited about that. The numbers you stated in our We Know Success website, where we tell people: After you finish your degree at American University, within six months, you're either in Graduate School or you have a job. Those numbers are 93%. Having a place like Amazon here is, I think, a great thing for our students and they're excited about it. I think they're also excited about having an innovation and technology sense to the community that they might be staying in, once they come here. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie\u2014 JAMIE DIMON: Can I just add this? It's really important. One of the reasons companies that come here is because they have great universities that they can draw really attractive kids. But the 25,000 jobs, what people don't understand, it's going to be another 75,000 outside of that. Because when you have a company move here, they need people who prepare meals and clean floors to engineers to marketing people to lawyers to accountants to service that whole ecosystem. So, actually you can lift up the whole community and affordable housing, so you lift up - you don't over gentrify and stuff like that. So, these are huge benefits. And it's because the place is hospitable to business and wants to create jobs for kids and the health of the university system. University systems are often, the ecosystem around them is a huge success. You can look at Boston, you can look at Silicon Valley, can look at parts of New York, and you can look at look at Washington, D.C. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Did New York make a mistake in pushing Amazon away and how much more are you investing here because of the expectation that they will grow more here? JAMIE DIMON: Of course they made a mistake. There would have been 100,000 jobs in total there. Which, like I said, would have been jobs across the whole spectrum. And, people \u2014 the mistake people make about New York, the tax benefits, New York has the highest real estate rates, the highest individual rates, the highest corporate rates[11]. Those are effectively a reduction of the rates for a time period. So you know, I think it would have been hugely beneficial for New York. But if they for New York doesn't want them, so be it. They could go elsewhere. KAYLA TAUSCHE: A lot of this sounding -- JAMIE DIMON: And it's not so bad for us because they would have competed for the same people I want. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie, your dexterous in your political speak. You had a dinner a Salon dinner off the record with some reporters last night. And -- JAMIE DIMON: Way off the record, huh? KAYLA TAUSCHE: Well, the fact of the dinner was reported, but a funny blog on Dealbreaker on Monday said that your workforce announcement was one flag lapel pin short of a campaign event. Is this you testing the waters? JAMIE DIMON: No, I am a patriot at heart. It's far more important than JPMorgan. And we are making a full effort to help anywhere we can help our country and work skills[12]. We announced the 350 million program around the world. Trying to do exactly what they're doing here. And it's a local \u2014 it's got to work locally. It does not work anywhere else. So we're going out with RFPs to local universities, community schools, mayors and see if we can create the same kind of ecosystem that's working here to lift up those communities. KAYLA TAUSCHE: What do you hope President Trump tells the Business Roundtable when he meets with you guys tomorrow? JAMIE DIMON: My experience with President Trump is that he says whatever he wants to say. KAYLA TAUSCHE: Jamie Dimon, Sylvia Burwell, we appreciate both of your time today. Thank you so much.

The flagship $35.2 billion Janus Fund, a large-cap growth fund, has lost 22.4 percent over the past 12 months, according to fund tracker Morningstar.</p><p>The overall value of Janus' stock holdings fell to $127.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $172.4 billion at the end of 2000, according to the data.</p><p>The filing does not reveal which of Janus' funds altered their positions. A Janus spokeswoman declined comment about the portfolio changes.</p><p>Janus, a unit of Stilwell Financial, eliminated No. 1 telecommunications-equipment supplier Nortel Networks and optical networker Sycamore Networks from its portfolio, while doubling its stake in Sycamore rival Ciena, according to the filing.</p><p>The quarterly portfolio shifts do not suggest any widespread change in Janus' strategy, but likely reflect the company's need to sell some stock to raise cash to meet shareholder withdrawals from some of its funds, said Bradley Sweeney, an analyst at Morningstar.</p><p>\"It was kind of tough to draw themes out of the changes -- I didn't see any large thematic shifts,\" he said. \"It is more of a stock-by-stock story, which is kind of what you'd expect from a shop like Janus -- it's not a shop that makes top-down sector, or industry, calls.\"</p><p>Janus unloaded about 76 million shares of Cisco during the first quarter, lowering its stake in the Internet equipment firm to 107 million shares, from nearly 183 million shares at the end of 2000, according to the filing.</p><p>Janus cut its large stake in mobile phone maker Nokia to 236.2 million shares, down from 266.2 million at the end of 2000.</p><p>Janus's stake in Texas Instruments fell to 33.4 million shares from 83.7 million at the end of last year.</p><p>Janus also lowered its stakes in Sun Microsystems, EMC, JDS Uniphase and Corning.</p><p>But Janus boosted its stake in Ciena as well as Applied Materials, Oracle and Intel.</p><p>Janus raised its holdings in big drug makers such as Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb as well as financial stocks Merrill Lynch and Citigroup. On the flip side, though, it lowered its stake in American Express.</p><p>Janus also scaled back its holdings in consumer products makers Colgate-Palmolive and Procter &amp; Gamble and retailer Gap.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-0105190085</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">San Jose Mercur KRDi</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44K1-BD70-018X-W0DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"462\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 San Jose Mercury News\u00a0 All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>May 17, 2001 Thursday MORNING FINAL EDITION</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>JANUS CAPITAL GROUP INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0NORTEL NETWORKS CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><className>\u00a0CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0CITIGROUP INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0PFIZER INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0INTEL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0MERRILL LYNCH &amp;

Semiconductor companies and tech hardware and equipment manufacturers face growing trade bar...</p><p>Key takeaways   Many major tech companies face their own unique regulatory challenges, with anti-competitive behaviour and content moderation at the top of the list.   Semiconductor companies and tech hardware and equipment manufacturers face growing trade barriers that may compel them to consider factors other than economics when making commercial and strategic decisions.   While these challenges are real and should be factored into the sector\u2019s future earnings, Denny believes they, alone, are not sufficient to materially dent the secular themes driving tech\u2019s strong growth.   Driven by what has been often characterised as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the technology sector has led global equity markets in recent years as the powerful applications of cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are deployed across an increasingly digital economy. This digital transition has accelerated during the era of COVID-19, as businesses and households have leveraged communications technologies and online commerce to sustain their daily activities.   So far, little has seemed capable of impeding the tech sector\u2019s strong run. That is why investors have taken notice of large tech companies recently getting hauled before Congress in the US, the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric about Chinese divestiture of US tech companies and still-simmering trade tensions. Would greater regulatory oversight and changes in trade policy be the impediments that finally cool tech\u2019s hot streak?   While these developments merit attention, we believe that on their own, they will not dramatically alter the sector\u2019s trajectory. Tech\u2019s secular drivers remain intact and we expect that the sector can harvest a greater share of earnings as their products and services add value across an ever-expanding customer base. Still, investors must be mindful of the regulatory landscape. As with any threat, one must ask what is the likelihood a business model would be altered and, should that occur, to what degree would future earnings growth be affected?   With the CEOs of several leading tech companies appearing before Congress, one may get the impression that these entities are confronted with similar regulatory challenges. That is not the case. There is a range of behaviours that legislatures likely believe require scrutiny.   Not playing nicely   Among these is purported anti-competitive behaviour. This is an activity that has invited past regulatory action. Perhaps the highest-profile example was Microsoft\u2019s years-long battle over having bundled its products like Internet Explorer with its operating system.   Presently, Amazon\u2019s relationship with vendors on its third-party marketplace platform has come into question. Concerns have emerged that third-party vendor data have been leveraged to benefit Amazon\u2019s private label offerings. Given the profitability of this business line, any forced changes would have to be factored into Amazon\u2019s future earnings profile. Yet, third-party vendors \u2013 it can be argued \u2013 gain tremendous value in their relationship with Amazon due to the latter\u2019s marketing, fulfilment and logistics capabilities.   Similar concerns have emerged over Alphabet, the parent company of Google. And here, too, there are two sides for regulators to consider. As the company\u2019s search business has slowed, it has relied upon mobile screens to generate a greater share of earnings. New services meant to achieve this often compete with companies that have historically been advertisers on the search platform. The question regulators are interested in is whether Alphabet has altered its algorithms to benefit its own services. Furthermore, authorities may want to review whether the company forced mobile device makers using the Android operating system to load a host of Google apps. Given the regulators\u2019 stance on Microsoft\u2019s bundling practices, the company is likely going to field a wide range of questions from multiple jurisdictions.   Business as usual or playing favourites?   Legislators\u2019 interest in Apple stems from its relationship with so-called super apps \u2013 subscription services that tend to dominate all other apps in the Apple ecosystem. As these services for music, gaming, etc, have grown, so has their bargaining power as they seek favourable terms in the hefty fees Apple extracts for access to its platform. While some may question whether terms based on volume put smaller competitors at a disadvantage, others would argue such arrangements are standard business practice across most sectors. Perhaps a greater risk for Apple is lawmakers delving into whether the company structures its technologies to favour its own services versus direct competitors.   A matter of liability   Perhaps the highest-profile subject of regulatory enquiry has been Facebook and the power it wields by dominating social media. Facebook first came under scrutiny for its stewardship of personal data. Since 2018, however, most indications are that the company has improved security, transparency and the ability for users to control their own personal information.   Of greater relevance is Facebook\u2019s role as a content moderator. In the US, under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, internet platforms were classified as distributors of content, not creators, and thus exempted from the liabilities publishers face for disseminated illegal content. This exemption has led many to complain that social media companies do too little to police their platforms for inappropriate content.   In recent years, politicians in the US and abroad have come to suspect that social media can exert tremendous power in influencing user behaviour by allowing or blocking certain content based on their terms of service. Up for debate is whether those terms should remain narrowly defined \u2013 largely aligning with the \u201cillicit activity\u201d standard \u2013 or should they be expanded in a manner that compels platforms to act as arbiters of truth. Given the large role social media plays in hosting political discourse, it is easy to see why policy makers would want to revisit the issue of content moderation.   In all of these cases, we believe authorities will have to take a balanced approach. A long-held threshold for greater regulation has been whether consumers have been harmed. That would be hard to argue given the breadth of largely free and convenient value-added services available on these platforms. Furthermore, the sector is a major source of well-paying jobs, and legislators, especially in the US, may view these tech leaders as \u2018national champions\u2019 to be supported.   More than economics   As with other sectors, tech appears caught in the lurch away from globalisation. Often this is guided by policy initiative such as tariffs. Over the past two decades, manufacturing has flowed toward countries with lower-cost labour. Now, either to evade tariffs, prohibitions or to diversify supply chains, costs are no longer the lone factor in choosing manufacturing bases. While this could impact profitability, the transition will take years to play out.   Of special note is the semiconductor industry. China desperately wants to build out its design and software capabilities to complement its manufacturing prowess. This has proven harder than expected. Now, the US has become more proactive in creating hurdles for Chinese companies to access complex technologies. This has ramifications not only for commercial relationships, but also potential merger and acquisition activity, thus possibly taking sources of future economic gains off the table.   Another geopolitical tussle in which authorities may have their say is Chinese ownership of Western tech companies and Western communications firms being pressured to not use Chinese vendors in building out their 5G networks. At present countries are having to balance security and economic concerns as well as their relationship with the US.   Each of these instances indicate that the more complex geopolitical and regulatory landscape means that economics will not be the only factors at play as tech companies face future business decisions.

At the same time, William Bales will become the sole manager of the Venture fund, while former co-manager Jonathan Coleman becomes an assistant portfolio manager of the Janus fund, according to Thursday filings with regulators. All three funds are in the red for the year and are closed to new investors.\u00a0</p><p>Also, Sharon Pichler will drop the Janus Money Market fund's reins to replace Darrell Watters at the helm of the Janus Federal Tax-Exempt fund, which is open to new investors. J. Eric Thorderson, manager of the Janus Government Money Market fund, will take over the Money Market fund. Watters will shift into a role analyzing high-yield bonds, according to Janus spokeswoman Jane Ingalls.\u00a0</p><p>Watters had run the municipal bond fund since 1996, and it trailed its peers over the past one- and three-year periods, according to Morningstar.\u00a0</p><p>Of the three changes, the Venture fund's adjustment might raise eyebrows due to the fund's recent struggles. Bales and Coleman have worked on the fund since 1997, but until late last year, former Chief Investment Officer Jim Craig held the reins, too. After riding a big tech stake to a 141% return last year, the fund has crashed harder than Janus' other tech-heavy growth funds. Since Jan. 1 the fund, closed to new investors since 1991, is down 50% and trails 98% of its peers, according to Morningstar.\u00a0</p><p>The firm says the move is not performance-related, but rather an effort to bolster the research team on Blaine Rollins' Janus fund, with former Janus fund co-manager John Schreiber set to run the new Janus 2 fund next year.\u00a0</p><p>\"It has more to do with the fact that Jon Schreiber is now going to manage Janus 2. So, Blaine was interested in having more depth to his bench,\" says Ingalls. \"Jonathan was willing to do that. He thought it was a good next step to take.\"\u00a0</p><p>The Overseas and Worldwide funds are down 20.2% and 19.2%, respectively. Both funds retain solid long-term returns and neither's losses this year rank in their category's cellars, like the Venture fund. Lynn currently works with Hayes and Chang on the funds, and joined Janus nine years ago as a research analyst, according to biographical information on the firm's Web site.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) is developing rules to make digital companies pay tax where they do business, rather than where they register subsidiaries - a move that was broadly endorsed by finance leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) major economies on Sunday. Yet the OECD efforts were stalled late last year by last-minute changes demanded by Washington, including a proposed \"safe harbor\" regime which critics say would let multinationals choose whether to abide by the new set of rules or stick to existing regulations. </p><p>\"I told my counterparts that Japan is very concerned about the 'safe harbor' proposal,\" Aso told reporters after attending the G20 gathering. \"It would extremely diminish the regulatory effect of what we're trying to do. That is a view expressed by various countries,\" he said, joining a chorus of criticism by France and other nations over the U.S. proposal. Many G20 officials view the United States as reluctant to deal with a potentially tricky political matter before the presidential election later this year. It is rare for Japan to openly criticize the United States on economic policy, given the two countries' close defense ties. The taxing of global digital firms such as Amazon, Google and Apple - and the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy - have figured prominently at the weekend gathering of G20 finance leaders in Riyadh. In a communique issued after the meeting, finance leaders said they encouraged further progress in narrowing remaining differences towards reaching a consensus on the tax issue by end of 2020. The OECD says the measure could boost national tax revenues by a total of US$100 billion a year. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12462762</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8M-K3Y1-JCDN-11W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"316\"/><timeReceived>4:55 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

It is Monday, August 17. Your top stories at 7 AM Eastern. The race for the White House. The Democratic National Convention kicking off today virtually and President Trump heading to Wisconsin for a campaign blitz.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What new polls are showing in battleground states and the postal service is in focus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi forcing lawmakers back to Washington, to address what she calls sabotage of mail-in voting. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise joins me next hour to discuss when and if a compromise could be reached.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">American cities in crisis. Seattle declaring a riot overnight after Portland and Chicago were slammed by violence, this weekend. The markets are looking to start the week to the upside. Features edging higher. You can see the DOW indicated higher by 59. The NASDAQ 68 and the S&amp;P 500 by 10. This after markets finished with little change on Friday but the S&amp;P 500 still within striking distance of its record closing high.</p><p>And later this hour, an exclusive interview with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. He's got a major announcement tied to China. You don't want to miss that. Retail of course in focus this week. Earnings expected from heavy hitters including Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe's and Target.</p><p>And the state of travel. Airports now bracing for a whole new world of changes at check in. What you need to know before you head to the airport and mortgage rates still at an all-time low. Could they finally reaches zero percent? We're going to take a look at that. Mornings with Maria is live right now.</p><p>Good morning everyone. European markets looking a little bit higher this morning. The Footsie higher by 40. The CAC Quarante by 3. The DAX index higher by 36 points. This as investors are keeping their focus on travel restrictions, trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well.</p><p>In Asia overnight, it was a little bit of a mixed bag. The Shanghai was the best performing index. The KOSPI closed for a holiday. The Japanese economy in focus contracting a record rate of 27.8 percent between April and June. This was brought on by weak spending and also trade issues.</p><p>Joining the conversation all morning Lee Carter, Jonathan Madison and Mitch Roschelle. Great to see you guys. Meantime some of the top stories that we're watching this morning include the Democratic National Convention kicking off tonight. It's virtual for the first time ever. Cheryl Casone has more.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That's right Jackie and this is a historic week that begins tonight. Democrats say that are going to focus not one, on the three major crises they say face the nation, the pandemic, the economy and racial injustice. Now if virtual speeches from Senator Bernie Sanders, former Ohio Governor John Kasich, 2016 Republican we should say who ran for president and he had been critical of President Trump.</p><p>He's going to be speaking. The keynote speaker is going to be former First Lady Michelle Obama. A new national poll is showing Joe Biden is holding only a one percent lead over President Trump right now in 15 key battleground states.</p><p>Well, violence overnight in Seattle, chaos in the downtown area. Rioters took to the streets for an anti-police rally. Several officers were injured in the melee. At least 18 people were arrested there.</p><p>And coronavirus deaths in the United States now surpassing 170,000. New York City's Tribute of Lights 9/11 Memorial is going to happen by the way after all. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says the state will provide the support needed to set up the night time display.</p><p>Last month officials had canceled the event over coronavirus concerns but an uproar seems to have changed their minds. Well, lightning and heat behind the cause of several new fires in southern California. Five are currently burning including the lake fire which is still only 12 percent contained.</p><p>High temperature is not helping the situation there and in Death Valley over the weekend, the mercury reached 130 degrees. That is the hottest temperature believed on earth in more than 100 years and there's your headlines, Jackie.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Thanks so much Cheryl. Meantime, it's time for the word on Wall Street. A look at what top market experts are watching this morning as we kick off the week. Joining me now ER Shares CEO, Joel Shulman and Bulltick Capital Market's head of research Kathryn Rooney Vera.</p><p>Kathryn, let's go ahead and start with you because Cheryl highlighted the key speakers at the DNC kicking off today. A lot of star power there if you will, I'm wondering what you think the markets are going to think about the conventions kicking off virtually, how different it's going to be, you've got a Biden-Harris ticket right now.</p><p>The Wall Street journal is saying you know traders are bracing for a lot of volatility as we head into this election period.</p><p>KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS: Well, the market now is more than a quarter attached to five stocks so those five stocks which are principally technology stocks, I think are where the market is going to have its laser-like focus, Jackie and that is with regard to the potential for anti-trust yet onerous regulatory burden that could come up and that could be in the fore under a Biden-Harris administration.</p><p>One of the things I'm looking for is who will be Treasury Secretary and my bet is it would be Elizabeth Warren. If that's the case, the markets will not like that and especially the banking sector as well as in the healthcare sector so these are things that I think the market is keenly interested, especially with regard to tax in position.</p><p>So the stocks that have moved the S&amp;P to these lofty levels are vulnerable under the next administration.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Kathryn, now that Harris is officially on the ticket, you look at these markets, not really reacting much, kind of continuing on with the recovery after you know as we're dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, not really reacting to the choice there.</p><p>And I'm wondering if you think that you know how long it takes before the markets start to look at some of the policies coming from the democratic ticket saying this can really have an impact here because these numbers are not reflecting that.</p><p>ROONEY VERA: The markets are remarkably resilient, Jackie and one thing I'll tell you as a as a strategist, as a market economist myself is that you have to deal with the combination of both what fundamentals tell you and what the scene can change over the course of the next year and a massive backstop by a price insensitive buyer which is the Federal Reserve.</p><p>So if we get a drop in the market, that's a big if, under the next administration once we get these policy moves and the market's internalization of how detrimental they can effectively be for small businesses and big businesses alike, we have to deal with the Fed so at what point does the Fed then decide that too much is too much of a selloff?</p><p>It is already engaged in the purchase of high yield bond, what's to deter the Fed from moving from high yield bonds into U.S. equities?</p><p>DEANGELIS: Well, it's a good point but I also want to sort of focus in and look at the features this morning because we've got a slight gain on our hands as we're getting ready for the trading session. Investors are eyeing retail earnings set for this week. We've got Walmart, we've got Home Depot, Target, other big names, all reporting their results.</p><p>This is coming after July retail spending numbers showed that American shopping rose higher than pre-pandemic levels so Joel, I'm wondering what you think you know, the bar was lowered for these retail companies, the numbers aren't necessarily going to be great but the good news is that the consumer is back out there and that's really what is going to drive this recovery, going forward.</p><p>JOEL SHULMAN, CEO, ER SHARES: Right, well as your viewers know, I mean we're at record levels across the board. The S&amp;P is still - hasn't broken through but we're seeing a lot of movement not only the U. S. markets in small cap, they went up about 10.5 percent last month but we're seeing a lot of money moving off shore now $2.9 billion moved last week.</p><p>That follows $2 billion the prior week and $2 billion the week before that so we're seeing a big movement to offshore, 2.5 percent or 2.47 percent up last month. Last week in the non U.S. markets and even in the non-U.S. small caps were especially bullish on those. They were off almost 9 percent last month, just a little bit behind the U.S. small caps.</p><p>So we believe U.S. small caps and we believe non-U.S. particularly non U.S. small caps can particularly be strong and we see news continuing to push through to probably till number.</p><p>DEANGELIS: So if you had new capital to put to work and you're looking at this market and you know technology has been on fire, you know is that necessarily where you'd go? The non U.S. stocks, the small cap stocks, the journal writing that the cyclicals are starting to take off and that shows sort of the breadth of the rally taking place here which is important when you really think of a recovery in the scheme of things.</p><p>SHULMAN: Right, we've seen this before by the way. We've seen cyclicals, you'll have a run, people thought it was going to go from growth to value. It lasted for about a week and then went right back so we think and we realize that last week was a strong week for the circles but we've seen this before.</p><p>I believe some of the tech long term are still in good place for investors and we really see - and we're seeing flows in a big way going offshore and am particularly non-U.S. small cap. That's what we will put on, small cap U.S. and non U.S., particularly non- U.S. small cap offshore.</p><p>DEANGELIS: All right, well, it is those small cap, it is the industrials. We saw them surging so far this August. The Wall Street journal saying that the investors are seeing this as the breadth that I mentioned, that the range is widening after months of dominance by those big tech companies, Amazon, Google, Facebook, the like.</p><p>Joining us is Washington Crossing Advisors, Market Strategist and Portfolio Manager Kevin Caron. Kevin, great to see you. I want to get your take on the markets as investors are sort of setting up for this Monday, so much going on. We're watching a coronavirus, the recovery, vaccines, we're watching the DNC kicking off tonight. What's the most important thing and where would you be allocating capital?</p><p>KEVIN CARON, MARKET STRATEGIST, WASHINGTON CROSSING ADVISORS: The most important thing is that market sentiment and the good feeling that the market has been enjoying the last couple of months, continues and begins to spill over into real economic data.</p><p>So since March, we've seen a tremendous inpouring of stimulus money into the economy, just about exactly offsetting the decline in nominal GDP that we've seen in the private sector but then beyond that, we've also seen tremendous support by central banks and we're getting additional support globally by Bank of China for example.</p><p>So this has been very nice. It's been good to see investors holding there with reasonably decent levels of confidence, funded by cheap money but this now has to accelerate to the broader economy where we would expect to see leadership brought now away from groups like technology and really some safe assets like gold and long term treasury bonds for example have simultaneously rallied along with technology, which is kind of an interesting trait.</p><p>But that trade has to break one way or the other. Either things truly get better or those insurance assets like gold and treasuries are going to become more - more desirable for market participants.</p><p>DEANGELIS: All right, Joel Shulman, Kathryn Rooney Vera, Kevin Caron, thank you so much guys. Coming up New York Congressman Tom Reed on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's calling lawmakers back to Washington over the Postal service. Plus a Fox Business exclusive with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross with the latest on how the United States is taking on China. Covid-19 of course changing air travel, airports bracing for new safety measures.</p><p>Then in the 8:00 hour, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise on the House battle over the Postal service. Former Connecticut Senator and vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman previewing in the Democratic National Convention which is kicking off tonight.</p><p>Trump 2020 presidential campaign National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley on a President Trump's campaign blitz as he heads to Wisconsin which is a key battleground state and how low can they go? How extremely low mortgage rates are affecting the housing market. You are watching Mornings with Maria, live on Fox Business.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Return from recess. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling lawmakers back to Washington to address U.S. Postal service cuts, ahead of the November election, including removing mailboxes and sorting machines around the country. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows signaling yesterday that President Trump would be willing to sign a bill supporting the USPS, as long as stimulus checks and PPP funding are included as well.</p><p>Joining me now New York Congressman and House problem-solvers caucus co- chair Tom Reed, good morning, great to see you.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R-NY): Good to be with you. Thanks for having me on.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Let's go ahead and start first with the postal service and Nancy Pelosi calling everybody back to make sure the service could be funded. The Democrats making a real push here to see if mail-in ballots can go off without a hitch for this election while you've got the president, he's got a 100 different fires that he's dealing with on his plate right now and stimulus is first and foremost.</p><p>They're saying that he's purposely trying to sabotage the Post Office. Your thoughts.</p><p>REED: That's ridiculous. This isn't about sabotaging the Post Office. This is about recognizing what universal mail-in, that's different than absentee ballot and they're trying to mix the two together. When you talk about universal ballot, that means everybody - they're going to make everyone get a ballot in America regardless if they request for it or not. That is just logistically almost next to impossible given the nature of how many ballots we're talking about.</p><p>So there's a real problem there and so when we go back this weekend, I hope we don't just focus on the Post Office. The American people are suffering and it's about time to put the American people's interest first and get a deal done for them.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Well, you bring up a great point, right? Sort of a stimulus stalemate right now as this Post Office conversation goes on. Bipartisan House lawmakers are speaking with the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows over the weekend, discussing moving forward with coronavirus aid and the talks with it.</p><p>Despite some of the setbacks that we've seen, a potential deal could be weeks away. You were on that call with Meadows, your reaction to this as Nancy Pelosi is saying, let's get the House back to vote on the Post Office but we're not worried and that election by the way, is 2.5 months away.</p><p>We're not worried about the Americans that are suffering right now that need those stimulus checks.</p><p>REED: That's what's so disappointing. When you don't put the American people's interest first and you worry about politics as your priority, that's what's happened and that's why I'm proud of the problem-solver caucus members that organically reached out when this deal broke down and said, we're not going to accept this.</p><p>And so we work behind the scenes and we reached out and the White House reached out to us when they heard that we were talking in a bipartisan fashion and we were able to set up communications with the White House. Those communications continue to today and I'll just tell you, we're going to continue to use our relationships based on trust, exchanging substantive information and get a deal done for the American people because that's who we work for.</p><p>We don't work to win elections, we work for the American people.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Lee, jump in.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Yes, I think it's really important because whichever party ends up being the party that is considered to be on the side of the American people getting the economy going, I think is ultimately going to win this election. Some of the most important issues are economic safety right now. People going back to work.</p><p>On the other hand I know there are a lot of people who are concerned about how they're going to vote in November. Voter enthusiasm is at an all-time high and many people are afraid to go to the polls so how do you address that and how do you respond to them because I think it is important issue that we can't just -</p><p>REED: That's why I've always been supportive of the Post Office in recognizing that Covid-19 requires us to recognize that people have a fear and rightfully so of the virus and so they have to have access to the ability to vote, not only in person but also by mail and other - other tools that are available to people in the individual states.</p><p>And so making sure the Post Office has the necessary resources and that's why talking to Mark Meadows and other folks and you've already over the weekend, a commentary about making sure the Post Office has the resources that handle those folks that want to use absentee ballots and those tools, have access to them.</p><p>That's an appropriate conversation but this idea that we're going to run our entire election, regardless if you request a ballot or not, that you get a ballot delivered to you, regardless if you ask for one or not, that's what universal mail-in balloting is all about and that is where the potential fraud is used and as the American people figure that out and get educated on it, they will have that same concern that we have about making sure that if you're going to abuse the system and use those ballots that are floating around unrecorded, that you go to jail if you if you bring our election loss and that that is the counterbalance to.</p><p>Some and use those ballots are floating around on recorded that you go to jail if you break our election laws and that is the counterbalance to where this needs to go.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Congressman Tom Reed, we're going to have to leave it there. Thank you so much for your time this morning.</p><p>REED: Thanks for having me on. We'll get through this.</p><p>DEANGELIS: We will. We will get through this as a country. Thank you. Coming up, Steve Bannon next on what President Trump needs to do to win in November. Plus coronavirus is changing air travel so those airports bracing for new safety measures. You are watching Mornings with Maria out live on Fox Business.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Countdown to November. Maria Bartiromo speaking with former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon on Sunday Morning Futures, yesterday. Asking him about the Biden-Harris ticket and what their economic priorities look like. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: One of those policies is higher taxes. The Wall Street Journal writes, under Biden's tax cut - tax increases, a married couple filing jointly shows $78,000 of ordinary income, their current marginal rate is 12 percent when Trumps tax cut expires, their marginal rate under Biden would double to 25 percent.</p><p>This is just a couple filing $78,000 in ordinary income. What are your thoughts on Biden's choice of Kamala Harris and real quick, isn't that interesting that John Kasich is one of the speakers on Monday night. He's kicking off the DNC. John Kasich.</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FMR WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Well, this shows you that never-Trump crowd, how they're triggered by President Trump. John Kasich is one. He's a quisling, OK? Everything he's ever stood for his entire life, everything his supporters gave him, he's going to stand up there on Monday night and basically throw it all away. OK, because these policies are so radical.</p><p>The globalization projects are so radical by these Democrats, now with undergirding of this culture of Marxism so no, I think Biden picked the perfect candidate for him because I think it's so juxtaposed to what President Trump stands for. I think Senator Harris is the perfect running mate for him because now you can show the globalization.</p><p>Remember and with Biden, you don't have a Manchurian candidate, you have a Beijing candidate, the victory right here for President Trump is very specific. It goes right through Beijing. You hold him accountable for the pandemic, you hold him accountable for the economic carnage for all the deaths, you start to confront the Chinese Communist Party everywhere, in technology, in economics and what they're doing is start to bring back the supply chain.</p><p>You start to bring back high value added manufacturing jobs. That is the path to victory. Joe Biden is in cahoots. He's compromised by Beijing, he's compromised by the Chinese Communist Party. Senator Harris is basically a cipher on this so they're not going to be able to combat that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEANGELIS: A lot to unpack there. Jonathan, I want to go straight to you and start with the tax portion of it. You know we're not talking about a huge salary as Maria was talking about there. Yet we're talking about a doubling in taxes. Do people really understand what the Biden-Harris ticket's economic policies would look like and how it's going to impact them you know in their pocketbook?</p><p>JONATHAN MADISON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: No, I don't think they understand but it's only a matter of time and from what I've been reading, you're getting tremendous amounts of pressure from the Left for Biden to adopt policies like Medicare for all and the New Green Deal which would increase taxes substantially.</p><p>We're talking corporate taxes, capital gains taxes, payroll taxes and strategically, I think all the president needs to do to win is to stress the economy and remind people about the 2017 legendary tax cuts he made for all working Americans.</p><p>We're talking about Americans at the lower end of the socio economic spectrum as well so I think in all situation here, it's going to come down to the President reminding people that in contrast to the far left's plan for the economy, even the current policies that Biden has in mind right now in contrast to his, that the president a 3.5 percent unemployment rate in September 2019, lowest in 50 years.</p><p>I think if you contrast that, the American people will wake up and start to understand.</p><p>DEANGELIS: And Lee, the messaging on the Left with the DNC, Bannon pointed out is going to be sort of a message of globalization whereas the Trump administration is going to focus on its economic policies which pre- pandemic were doing pretty well and we do have a what looks to be like a V- shaped recovery on our hands now and there's still time leading into the election. It seems like with respect to economic matters, the president is very well positioned.</p><p>CARTER: There's no question about it. It is the one area that he polls the best and I think that when you look at polling right now and there's a lot of your debate on how accurate polling is but one thing we do know for sure is only 30 percent of Americans feel like they really know Joe Biden and what he's going to for America.</p><p>His polling is entirely based on two-third saying the reason that they support Joe Biden is because he is against Donald Trump. So what has to happen now is Joe Biden needs to make the case on what does Joe Biden's America look like.</p><p>Is it about globalization? Is it about just being better than Trump? I don't think being better than Trump is enough to win and if Trump is able to make the case that his economy - he's the one who is going to fight for the America people, if he's the one actually that's been on relief for the American people in this moment, he's going to be the one that's going to win in November and I think it's going to be a big surprise to the Democrats.</p><p>Because I think many of them can't imagine that Trump would win again. I also think that we're going to have to look at the convention as we can see how much time spent reacting to Donald Trump because that will tell you who's winning by the one who is acting, not reacting.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Guys, thank you. We're going to have to leave it there for the moment but coming up on the show, a Fox Business exclusive with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross with the latest on how the U.S. is taking on China.</p><p>Plus Ford is rolling on. The auto maker weathering the Covid-19 pandemic. We are taking a look at what's new there. You're watching Mornings with Maria, live on Fox Business.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. I'm Jackie DeAngelis, in for Maria Bartiromo today.</p><p>It is Monday, August 17th.</p><p>A look at the markets at 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>We're seeing the Dow indicated higher. The futures are edging higher there by 73 points. The Nasdaq by 73 as well. And the S&amp;P 500 by 11.</p><p>Now this after markets were little changed on Friday. The S&amp;P 500, though, still less than half of one percent away from its all-time record high.</p><p>European markets are higher across the board as well. The FTSE higher by 37 points. The CAC quarante up by 6. The DAX up by 32. And investors are keeping their focus on travel restrictions and also U.S./China trade tensions.</p><p>In Asia overnight it was a bit of a mixed story. The Shanghai was the best performing index. The Kospi was closed for a holiday. And the focus has been also on the Japanese economy contracting a record rate of 27.8 percent between April and June. This was spurred by weak spending and, of course, trade issues also.</p><p>But a dip in travel is prompting a new round of job cuts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details on that.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jackie.</p><p>Rolls-Royce is going to close its aircraft parts factory in Prince Georgia County, Virginia, by the middle of next year. At least 280 people are going to be out of a job there. This comes amid a slowdown in global travel due to the coronavirus pandemic. The factory produces jet engine disks and other parts for the British company.</p><p>Well, AutoZone is hiring 20,000 workers nationwide as it tries to keep up with demand from retail and commercial customers.

Both stocks are slightly higher, Jackie.</p><p>And those are your headlines.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Cheryl Casone, thank you.</p><p>And we are focusing on the Huawei debate, taking it on specifically in a \"Fox Business Exclusive\" this morning. The Commerce Department is announcing that further restricting Chinese telecom giants from access to U.S. technology. It's adding 38 non-U.S. Huawei affiliates to the entity list and imposing license requirements on any export transaction that falls under the Commerce Department's jurisdiction.</p><p>Joining me now in a \"Fox Business Exclusive,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.</p><p>Secretary, good morning.</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY: Good morning, Jackie.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Let's talk a little bit first about this new announcement and -- and how it's sort of helping us protect national security by being tougher on Huawei.</p><p>ROSS: Well, on May 20th, we issued an order that prevented American technology from being used in Huawei designed chips. That led them to do some evasive measures. They were going through third parties. They were doing things like having people incorporated into other products.</p><p>The new rule makes it clear that any use of American software or American fabrication equipment to produce things through Huawei is banned and requires a license. So it's really a question of closing loopholes to prevent a bad actor from access to U.S. technology, even as they try to do it in a very indirect, very tricky manner.</p><p>DEANGELIS: And president and the administration, including yourself, have made no bones about taking a very tough stance on China. This was as we were negotiating that phase one trade deal.</p><p>But there are trade talks that are pausing at the moment. U.S. and Chinese officials postponing a meeting to discuss progress on that phase one trade deal. Reports on a delay site scheduling conflict, as well as allowing some more time for Chinese purchase of U.S. exports. Reports last week indicate that Chinese officials aim to address the administration's movement on tech companies, like TikTok and WeChat as well.</p><p>Secretary, is there a date on the books for another meeting soon or have these talks, you know, stalled amid all the issues that we're dealing with, with China right now?</p><p>ROSS: Well, there's a lot of conversation at various levels all of the time. So it is correct that the Chinese have lately been buying a very large amount of agriculture. That's a very good thing. We're very eager to have that continue.</p><p>So the -- what action we're taking on Huawei is a trade enforcement, an export control enforcement action. It's not really directly related to the trade talks.</p><p>DEANGELIS: The president, of course, taking more action against Chinese tech giants. President Trump indicating on Saturday that he would be willing to put pressure on more Chinese companies, including e-commerce giant Alibaba, after he's made these moves to ban TikTok and WeChat from the United States.</p><p>Secretary, I'm wondering, does the Commerce Department have any plans to further restrict Alibaba at this time?</p><p>ROSS: Well, right now we are operating under the president's executive order which gives us another few weeks to figure out exactly what it is that TikTok will be banned from doing in the event that they don't sell the company to Microsoft or another American producer. So we're very busy with that.</p><p>There's been no formal proceeding of this moment against Alibaba, so there's really nothing we can comment on that score.</p><p>DEANGELIS: I want to bring the conversation back to some of these restrictions on Huawei and also, you know, the president's taking on China and general and really addressing the issue that we have with 5G and their developments, you know, saying that the United States should be making more progress in this area, that it's about bandwidth and possibly even freeing up some of that bandwidth, you know, when it comes to military operations to make that possible, to pave that way.</p><p>How do you think that that's going to look as we head into the end of the year?</p><p>ROSS: Well, it is the case that U.S. has devoted more bandwidth already to 5G than any other country. And there's some further auctions (ph) planned (ph) by the Federal Communications Commission. So we will definitely not be short of bandwidth.</p><p>Some parts of the band are very good for rapid transmission of limited amounts of data. Others are good for a little bit slower transmission of vast amount. So bandwidth is not an undifferentiated mask. There are different parts of it that are particularly good at particularly different segments of 5G. But 5G is the target of the new rules that we have put into effect, and those rules will level the playing field so that there's no disadvantage for American software or equipment people relative to the foreigners. Everybody will be on a level playing field. Everybody will be restricted.</p><p>DEANGELIS: And that's the -- the key here, right, symmetry in the rules so that everybody is playing by the same rulebook. And -- and that's the problem that we've had with China for so long. And this is the first president to say, I'm going actually do something about it. And he is, Secretary.</p><p>ROSS: Well, that's right. The Chinese have been spoiled for decades by American administration that really took no action. Everyone knew what was going on. Everybody talked about doing something. Only President Trump has acted decisively.</p><p>And that's true not just with Huawei. It's true with trade in general. Trade both with China, trade with other parties. It's true with a relationship of European countries to NATO. The president is curing lots and lots of leftover problems that really should have been dealt with in earlier times. And it would have been easier to deal with them earlier.</p><p>Once a country's been allowed to run amuck for years and years and years, it's a lot harder for us to fix it now. But we've been doing it very systemically, one piece by one piece, and we will continue to do so.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Secretary Wilbur Ross, thank you so much and thank you for your service. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>ROSS: Thank you, Jackie. Good to be on with you.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Coming up on the program, Ford is rolling on. The carmaker weathering the Covid-19 crisis. We're going take a look at that next.</p><p>Plus, coronavirus changing air travel. Airports bracing for new safety measures.</p><p>You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Welcome back.</p><p>Ford not hitting the brakes. The automaker unveiling two new products in the last 30 days, including an updated version of the most popular car on the road, the F-150, as well as that iconic Ford Bronco.</p><p>Joining us now from outside the New York Stocks Exchange in a \"First on Fox\" interview, Ford Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone.</p><p>Tim, wonderful to have you with us this morning. Good morning.</p><p>TIM STONE, CIO, FORD: Good morning.</p><p>DEANGELIS: I'm wondering how important these two new releases are to the Ford brand and the vision going forward.</p><p>STONE: Well, they're very important.</p><p>And thanks for having me this morning.</p><p>Before I get started, I just want to say that we are appropriately socially distanced here as we've taken off our masks. And one of the things I'm really proud of, for the team, over the past several months, is how we've navigated this crisis and done so safely, bringing our plants back online and taking care of our communities.</p><p>We're well positioned to deliver for customers, as you said, for the upcoming launches that we have of our F-150, as well as a new Mustang Mach- E, all electric vehicle, as well as the Bronco family, the Bronco Sport, a two door and a four-door. And these are fantastic new vehicles. We look forward to introducing to customers.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Tim, I'm wondering what kind of demand you're not seeing just for the new Bronco but for your vehicles in general because you had the pandemic slow sales down, right? People were say staying home, not traveling, didn't know what was going to happen. But now, as the country starts to reopen, you've also got people saying, I'm scared to ride public transportation. I don't necessarily want to do it. I want to drive. And so I'm wondering if that translates into car sales.</p><p>STONE: Well, I think you're starting to see that. There have been some pent-up demand and we're, you know, cautious optimistic. There's still a lot of uncertainty ahead. We are cautiously optimistic. And we have great value for customers as they think about not only buying new vehicle or coming back to their own single car ownership. And I think there could be an opportunity for us ahead. We're well positioned for it not only with the new F-150, the Bronco and the Mustang Mach-E, our entire portfolio. We've been investing in our product portfolio for customers and resigning how we deliver our vehicles with human center design and we're really excited for what we have to offer our customer as they come back to their vehicles.</p><p>DEANGELIS: All right, well it's being described as the most capable SUV ever and you've got three versions of it, right, to launch in spring of 2021. The first would be the Bronco Sport. Then you've got a two door and a four door. And that mid-version is just $1,000 more than the Jeep Wrangler, which I think is very interesting because it was always looked at as a very moderately priced vehicle. So you are really competing in that space with something special.</p><p>STONE: We are. We're providing great value for customers. We also have best in class ground clearance. We have a safari-style roof experience which we think customers are going to find very compelling. And as I said, it's a great value. And we're launching the Bronco Sport this year, the end of the fourth quarter. And then the two door and four door come out in the spring.</p><p>Thus far we've already had over 165,000 reservations from customers. In fact, it surpassed our most optimistic expectations. And as a result, we're now working with our supply base and our manufacturing teams to try to build more -- find more capacity to deliver even more vehicles for customers. It's being really well received.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Tim Stone, good luck with it all. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. Great to see you.</p><p>STONE: Thank you very much.</p><p>DEANGELIS: We'll talk to use soon.</p><p>Coming up on the show, coronavirus changing air travel. Airports are bracing for new safety measures.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Flying safe. Airports putting new screening practices in place to lure travelers back amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Kristina Partsinevelos at Newark International Airport with more on the details of what people will face when they're trying to check in.</p><p>Kristina, good morning.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Jackie.</p><p>A tech revolution was already in play in the aviation space before the pandemic. But now airports are desperate to get travelers back here.</p><p>Take a look at this international airport. It's completely empty. There is not one booth open at the moment. And Covid-19 has brought urgency to the race to make air travel safer. So we've got completely contactless check- in, medical screenings that all could become the new norm.</p><p>But Hong Kong International Airport is taking it up a notch with full body disinfecting stalls. You step into the booth, you get sprayed with an antimicrobial spray, all done in 40 seconds so you can be on your way.</p><p>And then you've got Dubai International Airport, they have biometric cameras everywhere, thermal cameras, but they also have just invested in K- 9s, those are dogs that are being used to detect the coronavirus according to the airport. They've done already 400 tests and the accuracy rate of the dogs is about 91 percent.</p><p>So whether it's robot cleaning floors in Pittsburgh, or PPE vending machines in LAX, you've got -- I spoke to actually the chairman of the Port Authority who says that we're not going back to pre-pandemic travel.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN O'TOOLE, CHAIRMAN, PORT AUTHORITY: And so there's little contact going forward, regardless whether the Covid vaccine is out there or not. This is -- the new reform are here to stay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Jackie, we were already -- we know that we were -- airports were already testing and using a lot of contactless options here, like this kiosk, for example. But taking it up a not, what we can expect in the future is biometric to be used so that you come here and you don't even have to touch a screen, you'd be scanning your face, your face would become your passport. You wouldn't have to touch bag drop off. You just leave your bag there. You don't talk to anyone. The same thing with gates. And so there's one pro out of all of this, less lines. Fingers crossed for that.</p><p>Back to you, Jackie.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Wow. Kristina, amazing stuff there.</p><p>Lee, I'm curious to get your reaction here because even before the pandemic we saw less bodies in the airport helping us do things. It wasn't for germ purposes per say, it was for streamlining costs. And now we're seeing this. I mean facial recognition to check in or stepping in Hong Kong into that sanitization booth, it's really remarkable.</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: It's amazing. When use think about that innovation that has happened since the pandemic, we've accelerated change and a pace that is unprecedented and it is extraordinary.</p><p>I think these measures are going to be very, very important symbolically for travelers to start to get comfortable going back. And so the extent that in every -- and so many of my clients are working on how to get people comfortable to come back to work, get comfortable to come back to restaurants, get comfortable to go back and do what they did before. These kinds of measures where you're talking about less interactions, you're talking about measures to keep you safe, you're talking about antimicrobial spraying, you're thinking about taking people's temperatures, all of those things go a long way to make people feel like they're going to be safer in the moment and it's going to be very, very important that the airlines together get behind this and moving forward.</p><p>And I think, you know, the Port Authority guys was right, it is absolutely no question about it that we are not going to go back to the way things were.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Real quick, Mitch, in the last 30 seconds, I'm wondering if you think that people are going say, you know what, they're making it safer. It's OK now. I'm going to go get on a plane. I'm not there yet.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Well, first of all, I think people do want to travel. People definitely need a vacation. But one thing I'll tell you about air travelers, they've very resilient. I've traveled my entire career and I remember when we used to show up at an airport ten minutes before the flight was going to leaven and then those rule have changed and we -- we responded to it.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So I think travelers will put up with it. I think they will.</p><p>DEANGELIS: All right, still ahead, guys, weighing yourself before you eat. Chinese restaurants taking some heat for shaming patrons next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020081702cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M5-N641-DXH2-60M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6987\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002J45</classCode><className>FORD MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

He also said he's looking forward to spending Thanksgiving with family in Colorado.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CP: Your education transition operation has been in the news this week. How much risk are you willing to take when it comes to disruption and innovation in the way government operates, especially when it comes to education? How do you bring folks along when you're doing things that are designed to make them uncomfortable?</p><p> Polis: People didn't elect me to keep doing the same darn thing. They elected me to look for innovation and bold new solutions, and that's part of my mandate. So across every area, whether it's agriculture or higher education or K-12, we're going to push the envelope to make sure the future works for Coloradans.</p><p> CP: Would you be OK with your administration keeping economic incentive packages under wraps like those that were prepared bidding for Amazon's HQ2?</p><p> Polis: I'm skeptical of corporate tax giveaways but not categorically against them in every case. I think it is likely we'll use less of them so we can return more money to taxpayers through lower taxes.</p><p> CP: How effective do you think those incentives are?</p><p> Polis: Effective in the short term, not effective in the medium or long term.</p><p> CP: How do you and Marlon approach technology as parents, considering what a key role it's played in your life?</p><p> Polis: Our kids use iPads both for education and recreation. In many ways, our kids use iPads instead of television; I don't think either of them really ever watch TV. So, as a result, they have maybe two hours of iPad time during weekends and an hour a day during the week, in addition to anything that they're doing that's academic that would be allowed above and beyond that.</p><p> CP: Do you think children are being exposed to too much tech too early?</p><p> Polis: Children have to be savvy and have to grow up to be savvy in the use of technology. Every parent has their own style. I don't think that keeping technology away from kids helps them to develop the skills they will need to navigate technology they will inevitably encounter as they get older.</p><p> CP: Does Colorado need to regulate big tech, like Facebook?</p><p> Polis: No. We need to do what we can to keep a free and open internet by protecting the neutrality of the internet. We look forward to pursuing an agenda that, in the absence of federal protection, will make sure that all content and all service have access to an open internet through net neutrality.</p><p> CP: Your position on events like the Olympics seems to be a departure from Gov. Hickenlooper, who always seemed to be looking for ways to put Colorado on the national stage. How do you plan to showcase Colorado?</p><p> Polis: Certainly it's the role of the governor to promote our state; it's one I relish. I look forward to attracting businesses to our state, both doing international trade missions as well as working to attract conferences to our state.</p><p> CP: You didn't support either Propositions 109 or 110, and neither did voters. Where are we going to get the revenue for transportation?</p><p> Polis: The voters have clearly spoken, so therefore, there are two things we know we can rule out. Those two things are a sales tax and bonding with no new revenue, respectively. The voters have said no, decisively, to those. We're willing to have a conversation about anything else with Republicans and Democrats and the business community and reading the tea leaves of what the voters have said.</p><p> CP: How urgent is it to come up with a solution by the end of the upcoming legislative session?</p><p> Polis: I've always stressed openness to using some General Fund money for transportation, but what we do in a given year is never going to even the gap in the need to build out 21st century infrastructure.</p><p> CP: You've said that you don't want to take away Coloradans' right to vote on tax increases. Do you think there are parts of TABOR that need changing?</p><p> Polis: What I ran on, and what I intend to do, is to be a convener, which means of the education community, transportation community, Republicans and Democrats, and different geographic interests across our state. We plan on beginning those discussions soon with getting everybody on board with how we can make our state more governable with better language in our state constitution.</p><p> CP: Is campaign finance reform something Colorado should try to tackle?</p><p> Polis: I hope so. I think a lot of legislators have ideas that I am fully supportive of around increased transparency. Would be happy to have that discussion. I've long been a supporter of campaign finance reform to reduce the influence that special interests have on politics. If there's bills that go in that direction, then (I'm) likely to sign them.</p><p> CP: You've said you want to bring oil and gas, local communities and environmentalists together to solve what you've referred to as underlying issues that give rise to surface conflicts. What might a solution look like?</p><p> Polis: We want to formalize the role that local communities, cities and counties, have in the siting process for oil and gas and address the concerns that neighbors have with regard to where drilling occurs near where people live or work or go to school.</p><p> CP: There's a sense that Democrats are considering the balance between having full control of state government and being able to do whatever the party decides, versus what's sometimes referred to as \"overreach,\" like the legislative agenda that prompted the recalls in 2013. What approach do you take to that?</p><p> Polis: What I would encourage everyone to do \u2013 Republicans and Democrats \u2013 is be true to what they ran on and deliver for the people. If you ran on improving the roads, then work on that. I ran on delivering full-day kindergarten and making sure that we can achieve 100 percent renewable energy by 2040 or sooner, and so we plan on fulfilling the mandate the voters gave me, working with the legislature as well as administratively through my appointments, to get it done.</p><p> CP: Do you have a mandate to pursue universal health care?</p><p> Polis: To cover more people, absolutely, rather than less people. In the campaign this came up a number of times, where some of the policies on the other side would jeopardize people's insurance that they had today. Our mandate is to save people money on health care, pass those savings along to people who get their insurance on their own or through the employer, and expand coverage to more people.</p><p> CP: What does your family traditionally do for Thanksgiving?</p><p> Polis: We sit around the table and have a turkey with the grandparents and the cousins and have a family dinner. We're thankful for the blessing of living in Colorado and our health and our family.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ar 181119727</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCO-984370574b358339ff20f4e6c803cf8cd1893</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898CC30BD3377 NWBKCO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TS3-9051-JBCN-44BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1204\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Durango Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

What might a solution look like?</p><p> We want to formalize the role that local communities, cities and counties, have in the siting process for oil and gas and address the concerns that neighbors have with regard to where drilling occurs near where people live or work or go to school.</p><p> There's a sense that Democrats are considering the balance between having full control of state government and being able to do whatever the party decides, versus what's sometimes referred to as \"overreach,\" like the legislative agenda that prompted the recalls in 2013. What approach do you take to that?</p><p> What I would encourage everyone to do \u2013 Republicans and Democrats \u2013 is be true to what they ran on and deliver for the people. If you ran on improving the roads, then work on that. I ran on delivering full-day kindergarten and making sure that we can achieve 100 percent renewable energy by 2040 or sooner, and so we plan on fulfilling the mandate the voters gave me, working with the Legislature as well as administratively through my appointments, to get it done.</p><p> Do you have a mandate to pursue universal health care?</p><p> To cover more people, absolutely, rather than less people. In the campaign this came up a number of times, where some of the policies on the other side would jeopardize people's insurance that they had today. Our mandate is to save people money on health care, pass those savings along to people who get their insurance on their own or through the employer, and expand coverage to more people.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Colorado Gov.-elect Jared Polis told Colorado Politics in an interview Friday he would rather cut taxes for state residents and business than offer incentive packages for large companies to move to Colorado.

Over 21 chapters and three appendices, Jaron Lanier, a tech pioneer, puts forward 52 definitions. Some are geeky: \"a media technology for which measurement is more important than display\". Others are poetic: \"the technology of noticing experience itself\". And a few are terrifying: \"a training simulator for information-age warfare\". VR is all of these things and more besides. Yet at a time when the malign influence of social media is grabbing headlines, it is the last of these that seems most urgent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Lanier is a Silicon Valley grandee. In 1984 he started the first VR firm, VPL Research, which sold early headsets and accessories, and is widely credited with popularising the term \"virtual reality\". He has seen the tech industry go from being a bunch of start-ups run by counterculture idealists to global companies. He now works at Microsoft. </p><p>Mr Lanier is also a critic of his industry. His first book, \"You Are Not a Gadget\" (2010), argued that the web was creating \"digital serfs\"\u2014users who gave up their data and privacy for no monetary reward or say in the system. \"Who Owns the Future\" (2013) railed against the monopolistic power of big tech firms. His new book is a memoir about virtual reality and a history of how the utopian thinking of Silicon Valley has brought dysfunction and division. It will be essential reading, not just for VR-watchers but for anyone interested in how society came to be how it is, and what it might yet become. </p><p>Many books about the early days of Silicon Valley play up the hippie-meets-techie culture that shaped it. Few define that better than the dreadlocked Mr Lanier, who was raised in El Paso and educated across the border in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. After his mother died, Mr Lanier and his father moved to New Mexico and lived in tents for over two years before moving into a DIY geodesic dome. Mr Lanier skipped the end of high school and went straight to university, but did not graduate. After drifting in semi-poverty and trying various careers, he found himself in Silicon Valley. </p><p>This was not an uncommon trajectory in the Bay Area in the 1980s. Mr Lanier describes one associate as a \"hippie physicist musician\", another as a Wyoming rancher and rock lyricist. In those days techie culture was a subset of hippie culture. The first advice Mr Lanier was given when he moved there was: \"Don't trust the suits.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley believed everything would improve once coders were in charge. \"We better find a way to constrain people more or the world will never get more efficient,\" he remembers being told.  \"We're creating a kind of power that is much more important than money.\" Software, like air or sex, was meant to be \"free\". </p><p>Today the world's three most valuable companies are tech firms. The web is less wild and more structured. But the shortcomings of techie ideology have been exposed. The obsession with \"free\" nearly destroyed the music industry and continues to wreak havoc on the media. Tech firms still believe that they do not need to follow the rules\u2014witness Uber's bruising battles with municipal authorities around the world. And the biggest, most influential firms resist any regulation that would make them responsible for the content on their platforms. Web platforms care more about the amount of time their users spend on their sites than the quality of the experience or what they consume. </p><p>Mr Lanier remains optimistic that things can be fixed, perhaps by instituting a system of small payments to users for their data or by ensuring that artists and writers are recognised and paid for their work. Human beings, not algorithms, should be at the centre of the internet economy, he says. These ideas will be familiar to anyone who has read his previous books. The business models of big tech firms are, however, too successful and too lucrative to change, so Mr Lanier's views are unlikely to prevail. </p><p>What does this mean for VR? Virtual reality will never be as widespread as the smartphone, but it will be influential. Its promise is to make experiences in computer-generated environments feel as visceral as those in the real world. It has philanthropic potential and may improve medicine and aid education. But it can also be dangerous if virtual worlds are designed to manipulate users. Mr Lanier worries that VR may go down the same route as social networks, becoming, as in another of his definitions, \"the ultimate way to capture someone inside an advertisement\". </p><p>But that is not a given. Although VR has flourished of late, and headsets are now available for a few hundred dollars, the industry is still in its infancy. VR is unlikely to be widely adopted for some time. Meanwhile, Western democracies are debating the merits and dangers of tech, and the need for big companies to police their platforms better. When VR goes mainstream, that debate will have intensified\u2014and perhaps ended well. </p><p>By the time VR matures, it will be used by people who have grown up with smartphones and social media. They, Mr Lanier argues, will be more sophisticated than today's internet users, for whom it was a new technology. The next generation will see through the manipulation. It is not much of a hope to cling to, but it is something. </p><p>Perhaps the most fitting of Mr Lanier's 52 definitions of VR is that it is \"a preview of what reality might be like when technology gets better\". Technology is improving. Whether reality does too depends on the technologists in charge and the power of society to shape their vision. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Dawn of the New Everything.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-HA6MCM9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PYW-6K91-JBKN-B0GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

The recent hearing, sixth in a series of bipartisan hearings launched last year by the Antitrust Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline, D-R.I., and then-Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., was the first time Congress has heard from the CEOs of the largest tech companies in the country: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. While many representatives grilled the executives on controversial and disconcerting activities that their companies engage in, U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., emerged as a champion of independent and high-quality news journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For far too long, the dominant online platforms have held news publishers in their grips, forcing them to accept imbalanced and vague terms while capturing the vast majority of user data and digital ad revenues and making it harder for publishers to deepen relationships with their readers. While the big tech companies have prospered - Google's revenues were $162 billion in 2019 and Facebook raked in $70.7 billion - news publishers are struggling to stay afloat. According to a recent UNC study, between 2005 and 2020, more than one-fourth of the country's newspapers disappeared, leaving too many communities as news deserts, and even more are at risk.</p><p>We are thankful, then, that congressional champions, such as Jayapal, are taking the anticompetitive behavior of these online platforms and the blight of journalism seriously. During the July 29 hearing, Jayapal engaged in a fiery exchange with Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet and Google. Noting the \"deep urgency to protect independent journalism,\" Jayapal drew attention to Google's control of the digital-ad ecosystem, where Google is running the marketplace and dominates both the buy and the sell side.</p><p>As Jayapal stated, the situation allows Google to set the rates low when buying ad space from newspapers while selling high to small businesses who rely on advertising on Google's platform. This hurts both advertisers and newspapers who rely on digital ad revenues in order to keep their communities informed. This is a clear conflict of interest that should not be allowed in any marketplace. Jayapal correctly noted that the situation resembles the stock market except without regulations that would prohibit insider trading. The lack of accountability and transparency exacerbates the situation and makes it more difficult to evaluate its market-distorting effect.</p><p>In response to Jayapal's excellent questioning, Google could only offer vague platitudes. Pichai tried to highlight the $14 billion Google has reportedly paid to publishers and the company's \"deep commitment\" to journalism, while noting that news is a \"low margin business\" for Google. All of these explanations ring hollow. If Google was serious about supporting journalism, it would take news publishers' feedback and concerns seriously, engage in meaningful negotiations, and be more transparent about its pricing, policies and data.</p><p>There are multiple ways to improve the situation. The Antitrust Subcommittee's investigation is a major step forward, especially when considered together with other investigations conducted by other authorities in the United States and around the world. But these investigations and their recommendations take time to complete and implement, all the while local newspapers are fighting for their survival. And while Google and the other big tech companies could step up and take meaningful action, they are unlikely to do so. We need more imminent fixes.</p><p>The tide is turning against the dominant online platforms. No longer do they have free rein to do as they please, strengthening their control of the online marketplace, while suffocating news publishers who invest every day in providing reliable and trustworthy news to keep their communities informed. It is lawmakers like Jayapal who take the issue seriously and acknowledge the need for Congress to take decisive action who give us hope about the sustainability of high-quality journalism in America.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-13007093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K1-JPW1-JBR8-5000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><timeReceived>02:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Seattle Times Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He'll focus primarily on Amazon, as it presses into almost every arena of commerce, and Microsoft, which has made a remarkable comeback from years of legal and regulatory challenges to emerge as a leader in cloud computing. And he'll cover the consequences of the prosperity bombs big tech companies have set off in the region.</p><p>Jay has worked as a journalist in Seattle for 21 years, the last three at The Wall Street Journal, where he covered Microsoft and the cloud-computing businesses at Amazon and Google. He spent 10 years as the Seattle bureau chief for BusinessWeek magazine and has covered Amazon and Microsoft for The Seattle Times. He also worked as an investigative reporter for the tech news site CNET.</p><p>Jay has chronicled Amazon's growth strategy that often pits it against partners. He has covered the legal and cultural challenges it faced as it expanded in Europe. And he has reported on the new generation of Microsoft executives who have revitalized the company by chasing emerging markets rather than feeding off its legacy businesses.</p><p>Jay was awarded a McGraw Fellowship for Business Journalism from City University of New York, Graduate School of Journalism. And he wrote                 Design Is How It Works             , a book on design and innovation. Jay has a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University and a bachelor's degree in English from Macalester College.</p><p>An avid skier and cyclist, Jay takes advantage as often as he can of the natural bounty the Pacific Northwest offers.

They have three children and three grandchildren. Hometown:Seattle, Washington Political party:Democratic Previous jobs:Member of the US House of Representatives 1993-1995 and 1999-2012, regional coordinator for theDepartment of Health and Human Services, member of the Washington House of Representatives 1989-1993, lawyer and prosecutor. Who is Jay Inslee's direct competition for the nomination?</p><p>Based on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Jay Inslee's lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party. Even after weeks of polling, we're really not near the sample size of Jay Inslee name recognition where we'd be confident interpreting his performance and drawing conclusions about his candidacy. Only about 100 of the 2,850 voters who said they'd likely participate in the Democratic primary process both knew of and would be satisfied with Inslee as nominee. INSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate's constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump. Read more about how we're polling this here.[1]What are Jay Inslee's policy positions?Onhealthcare:In 2019, Inslee announced he would be introducing a public option[2] for healthcare in Washington that would allow people to buy into government-subsidized healthcare. He also recently introduced a new private-public initiative to improve children's health outcomes, including reducing child obesity.[3] Onimmigration:Last year, Washington led a group of states in successfully suing the Trump administration[4] over their ban on people from certain Muslim-majority nations entering the US. Inslee supports DACA, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children and has enabled undocumented students in Washington to receive financial aid. Onclimate change:Inslee is running as \"the climate candidate,\"[5] with a progressive campaign rooted in environmental issues. He's been raising the alarm about climate change for decades, and has taken steps to expand clean energy infrastructure and cut down on fossil fuel reliance in Washington. As president, he would aim to bring the United States to be powered by 100% clean energy[6] with net-zero carbon emissions, and invest in green infrastructure to innovate new technologies and create jobs. Inslee also wants to advance environmental justice by reducing the disparate impacts of climate change on low-income communities and communities of color, and end government subsidies to fossil fuel companies. Oncampaign finance/election reform:Inslee has enacted a number of election reforms[7] in Washington, including automatic voter registration, allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote, and same-day registration. Inslee has been criticized for not distancing himself[8] from a Super PAC created to support him. Onabortion:Inslee is strongly pro-choice. Last year, he signed legislation requiring private insurance companies who cover pre-natal and maternity care in Washington state to also cover abortion procedures.[9] He's also spoken out against the Trump administration's new revisions to the Title X program[10] which seek to ban any clinics that provide abortion services or referrals from receiving federal funding for family planning care. OnLGBTQ rights:Inslee signed legislation banning gay conversion therapy[11] for minors in Washington in 2018. In 2016, he also created a \"Safe Place\" initiative to promote inclusion[12] and awareness of LGBT rights in state government. Oneducation:Inslee has opposed diverting public school funding towards privately-owned charter schools.[13] As Washington's governor, he's pushed for tax increases[14] to expand early childhood education and increase teacher pay. Onguns:A few days after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida, Inslee personally confronted Trump [15]on gun safety issues at the White House. In response to the idea of preventing school shootings by arming teachers, Inslee said that educators should \"not be foisted upon this responsibility of packing heat in first-grade classes.\" Back in 1994, Inslee took a political risk by voting for the federal assault weapons ban[16], which some say contributed to him losing his congressional seat in rural eastern Washington. As Governor, Inslee has implemented ballot initiatives raising the minimum age[17] to purchase a semi-automatic weapon from 18 to 21, and a \"red flag\" law[18] which allows law enforcement to temporarily remove guns from people who could pose a public safety risk.  Oncriminal justice reform:Inslee oversaw the legalization and regulation of recreational marijuana in Washington state, and retroactively pardoned[19] 3,500 Washingtonians with misdemeanor marijuana convictions. He also suspended Washington's use of the death penalty in 2014, and fully eliminated it last year.[20] Inslee signed a package of juvenile justice reforms[21] into law in 2018 that removed the requirements for certain minor defendants to be tried as adults and increased funding for diversion programs. Ontrade:Inslee, who helped President Bill Clinton design the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in the early 1990s, supports free trade and is opposed to the Trump administration's tariffs. In a 2018 op-ed for CNBC[22], Inslee slammed Trump's \"erratic and unilateral moves\" in waging a trade war with China, who he cited as one of Washington state's most crucial trading partners. \"About two-thirds of all Washington agricultural exports are destined for Asia ... any punitive tariffs to Asian markets are felt deeply in the Evergreen State,\" he wrote. Onforeign policy:As the governor of a border state, Inslee has held frequent meetings and summits with Canadian leaders from the nearby province of British Columbia and with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2017.[23] Inslee voted against the Iraq War back in 2002. \"I had the judgment, the foresight, the understanding to stand foursquare against it early and forcefully,\" he said of his decision.[24]Ontaxes:Inslee recently proposed introducing new taxes[25] on capital gains income and service-provider corporations in Washington state. He has also attempted to introduce a carbon tax[26] in Washington state on multiple occasions but has not yet prevailed. Onjobs and the economy:Inslee has signed legislation that will raise Washington's minimum wage to $13.50 an hour by 2020. He also recently enacted an expansive new family leave plan[27] which guarantees 12 weeks of paid leave for new parents in Washington. In 2017, Inslee introduced the Career Connect Washington initiative[28], which helps high school students pursue technical and vocational apprenticeships that feed into stable careers as an alternative to four-year college. On technology:Inslee is leading an effort to expand rural broadband internet access[29] throughout Washington. After the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) eliminated net neutrality nationwide, Inslee worked with legislators to implement net neutrality-style regulations within[30] Washington. This legislative session, Inslee is also working on new Internet privacy regulations[31] that said he hopes will be \"consistent with innovation and also consistent with fundamental rights of privacy.\"What are Jay Inslee's biggest political successes?Inslee has led the charge on climate issues for years. After the United States pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords, Inslee helped create and lead the US Climate Alliance[32], a group of 17 governors seeking to achieve the Paris Accords' goals within their own states. Under Inslee's time as governor, Washington's economy has been ranked first or second in the nation.[33] As chairman of the National Democratic Governors' Association, Inslee helped flip seven governorships[34] across the country from Republican to Democratic control in the 2018 cycle.How much money has Jay Inslee raised?The Inslee campaign reported raising $1 million in the first few days [35]after he formally announced his campaign on March 1.Could Jay Inslee beat Trump?Referring back to INSIDER's recurring poll, Jay Inslee is not getting anywhere near enough name recognition to get the needed sample size to draw conclusions about how he'd perform in a general election against Donald Trump. Generally, that is not a good sign. Read more of our stories on Jay Inslee:Washington's governor, Jay Inslee, announces 2020 presidential bid[36].

The 38-page Evergreen Economy Plan promises at least 8 million jobs over 10 years, and offers the most detailed policy vision yet for mobilizing the entire United States economy to stave off catastrophic global warming and prepare for already inevitable temperature rise. The proposal lays out a five-pronged strategy to launch an unprecedented deployment of renewable energy, fortify the nation's infrastructure to cope with climate change, spur a clean-tech manufacturing boom, increase federal research funding fivefold and level income inequality by repealing anti-union laws and enacting new rules to close the racial and gender pay gaps. By spending $300 billion per year, the plan projects another $600 billion in annual economic activity generated by its mandates. </p><p>'The thing that can really cost is the path of inaction, the path of letting Paradise, California, keep burning down, the path of letting Davenport, Iowa, keep flooding, the path of letting Miami be inundated,' Inslee told HuffPost by phone on Wednesday. 'It's too expensive, besides being too deadly.' The breadth is stunning, with few problems left untouched. The plan includes specifics on everything from national parks to drinking water, 'ultra-high-speed' rail to electric scooters, climate literacy education to a new Climate Conservation Corps. The proposal spells out exactly how an Inslee administration would expand collective bargaining rights and bolster wage growth in ways unseen since the threat of communist revolution loomed large in the minds of America's elites a lifetime ago.Socialism it is not. Like President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom Inslee cites in the introduction to the nearly 15,000-word economic manifesto, the governor, in the face of surging inequality and ecological disaster, toes the line between heavy-handed central planning with pro-worker protections and embrace of private enterprise.At a moment when Joe Biden, the ostensible frontrunner for the Democratic nomination and by any measure an economically conservative Democrat, is taking heat[2] for teasing a 'middle ground' climate policy that allows for more fossil fuel use, Inslee's plan seems to offer a scientifically sound middle ground between an increasingly alluring[3] Marxist approach to climate change and the Obama-era neoliberal regulatory regime scientists say[4] dooms humanity to cataclysmic warming.It's a formidable document, and an audacious rebuke of skeptics who say policy to cut emissions is at odds with economic prosperity. The proposal stakes out positions on labor and rural development as bold as those on the environment. It also cements Inslee's place alongside Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as a presidential contender whose unabashedly progressive values and wonkish policy chops merit serious consideration in an increasingly crowded race.'Half measures just will not cut it here,' Inslee said. 'We didn't win half of World War II, we had to win all of it.'Inslee, 68, shies away from the Green New Deal slogan that emerged six months ago as the first framework to match the scope of the climate crisis. But, in practice, the blandly-named Evergreen Economy Plan is the closest thing yet to the World War II-style economic mobilization the Green New Deal promises. The second major proposal from the Inslee campaign, it builds on the the 100% clean energy blueprint released earlier this month, outlining a pathway to all but eliminate emissions from power plants, cars and new buildings by 2030. Clean Energy The plan covers the basics, with ramped-up tax incentives and loans for renewables, requirements for federal agencies to use 100% renewable electricity and zero-emissions vehicles by 2024. It opens with a call for a ReBuild America initiative that would set a national energy efficiency standards for utilities, offer refundable tax credits for building upgrades like HVAC systems and solar-powered water heaters and set up a program with labor unions to train 'green supers.' The initiative would provide financing for low-income households looking to invest in energy efficiency retrofits and directly fund upgrades to public institutions like schools and government buildings. It proposes spending $90 billion to found the Clean Energy Deployment Authority, a so-called green bank that would provide low-cost loans and loan guarantees to underinvested projects. The CEDA would be an independent, nonprofit institution designed to work directly with clean energy funds in states.Following decades of deindustrialization thathollowed out[5] rural communities, the proposal calls for the most comprehensive investment since the New Deal, largely by beefing up agencies and programs first established in the 1930s. It would increase the budget and lending power of the Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and regional development and electricity providers like the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Tennessee Valley Authority. It would also beef up agencies like the Rural Utilities Service to fund renewables projects and build more broadband infrastructure to expand high-speed internet access.It isn't a plea for entirely centrally planned energy production alone. The plan allots $150 billion over 10 years to invest in community-owned energy cooperatives, with the aim of generating 10% of the nation's power from them by 2040. The initiative, designated under the Energy Department, would set up Energy Districts modeled both on the New Deal-era Soil Conservation Districts and projects like the Winneshiek Energy District in Iowa. Infrastructure Inslee promises to more than double annual federal investment in public transit systems and invest in electrifying passenger and freight rail. The plan calls for billions in federal matching funds to states, tribes and local governments to deploy charging equipment for electric vehicles and buses, and committing to halting emissions from airplanes at 2020 levels. To improve electricity transmission, the plan proposes new federal matching dollars for states, utilities and local governments to build new grid infrastructure and expanding the list of equipment the Federal Emergency Management Agency is authorized to give, making it easier to erect clean-powered microgrids. Water is the centerpiece of the infrastructure section of the plan. The proposal devotes billions to rebuilding drinking water, wastewater and stormwater facilities, and ramping up federal funding to protect coastal property from sea-level rise, improve infrastructure along the Mississippi River and support 'chronically under-resourced programs like the U.S. Departments of Interior and Agriculture \u2015 in particular the Bureau of Reclamation and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.' The plan lays out incentives for sustainably built low-income housing and increased funding for public housing. It also promises funding and studies to reduce asthma triggers and lead exposure in public schools. It's a doozy. It's extremely thorough.Evan Weber, political director at Sunrise Movement Public lands are another key point. Inslee proposes ramping up funding for the Forest Service to deal with wildfires and woodland management and clearing the backlog of public lands projects. While it doesn't give specific dollar amounts, the plan expands the budgets for the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and gives the USDA 'a leading role' in overseeing ecosystem restoration. Manufacturing The core of Inslee's plan to bolster manufacturing would be through agency actions. It would establish a new, uncapped tax credit for advanced energy manufacturing, and propose legislation to Congress to provide 'massive investment' into domestic manufacturing of zero-emission vehicles and component parts to battery technologies. That would include tripling the loan budget under the Energy Department's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program and setting up a new 'clean cars for clunkers' program. It would order the Department of Commerce to conduct a Quadrennial Industrial Review 'to map strategic industries and identify sound industrial policies \u2014 including critical materials and rare-earth elements, global demands, and domestic production capacities.' The proposal also would enact a federal 'buy clean' program. The plan proposes new regulations on super-pollutant hydrofluorocarbons, known as HFCs, and methane. Inslee vowed to phase out HFCs through an executive action, enact new rules requiring oil and gas companies and utilities to find and halt methane leaks in pipelines and direct agencies to implement new standards for carbon intensity of domestic manufacturing. The manufacturing section touches on trade policy to increase exports of American-made clean technology and rework existing deals to curb climate pollution and pressure other countries to do the same. 'It will be a primary goal of the Inslee Administration to accelerate and feed those projects with American-made clean energy exports that displace fossil fuel infrastructure,' the plan states. R#38;D Inslee pledged to increase federal research and development of clean technologies by approximately $35 billion over the next decade. The plan calls for establishing new initiatives in transportation and climate science research and 'growing existing programs at the DOE, such as the Office of Energy Efficiency ...newable Energy, Office of Science, and Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), as well as National Labs.' The proposal includes launching 'ARPA-Ag,' an entirely new program to research soil-based carbon storage techniques and reducing emissions from farms. The plan goes beyond research to increase public school education on climate change and ramp up funding for science, technology, engineering and math programs at historically black colleges and universities. Labor The Evergreen Economy Plan's labor proposals are among the most likely aspects to garner popular support.The proposal calls for a $15 federal minimum wage by 2024 and national paid sick leave. It also proposes repealing the federal Taft-Hartley Act that permitted 27 states to pass right-to-work laws limiting workers' collective bargaining power. 'Eliminating these laws will ensure that everyone who benefits from union representation pays their fair share of that representation,' the proposal reads. The plan also promises to amend the National Labor Relations Act to make it easier to form a union by automatically recognizing a collective bargaining unit when a majority of workers vote or sign cards approving its creation. Inslee pledged to enact or push Congress to pass new rules making it easier to share pay and benefits information during collective bargaining, a move meant to increase pay equity for women and people of color. He also vowed to appoint pro-union members to the National Labor Relations Board.The plan outlines a 'G.I. Bill' for coal communities and workers impacted by the transition away from fossil fuels. Modeled on the program that provides assistance to veterans and their families, the bill would secure miners' pensions, provide health care to workers suffering with black lung, and offer training through unions to transition workers into new industries. It also establishes a 'Restoration Fund' that fossil fuel companies will be required to pay into to 'create new skilled union jobs in environmental reconstruction.'The plan sets new standards for apprenticeship programs and calls for the creation of a Climate Conservation Corps to carry out restoration work across the nation and train a new generation of workers with environmental regenerative skills. 'It's a doozy,' said Evan Weber, political director at Sunrise Movement, the grassroots group pushing for a Green New Deal. 'It's extremely thorough.'Republicans, who routinely smear the Green New Deal with false claims it'd ban cows and flights and even trigger genocide against white men, are likely to dismiss Inslee's plan as socialism. Yet the plan makes no calls to nationalize industries, as some in the climate movement are beginning to entertain[6], nor does it embrace the federal job guarantee proponents of the Green New Deal. Inslee, moreover, is quick to tout the leading role for private industry under his proposal, which is largely dependent on generous market incentives.'It's a combination of public investment, which succeeded when we went to the moon and defeated fascism, and it leverages and partners with private entrepreneurs and skilled workers,' Inslee said.If anything, Inslee's technocratic approach opens the plan to criticism from the left. Inslee has drawn criticism for defending[7] corporate giants headquartered in his state, including Amazon, Boeing and Microsoft, at a time when rivals like Warren are calling for increased antitrust enforcement to break up big tech companies.'We're seeing massive private companies leading this revolution today,' Inslee said. 'If you don't get that, you're just willfully ignorant.'So far, the only other 2020 contender to put out a comprehensive climate plan was Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman. O'Rourke's $5 trillion plan promises to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 \u2015 a problem, say advocates, because emissions from developing countries are surging, and an industrialized nation like the United States should aim instead for 2030. Warren on Wednesday put out a plan to make the U.S. military carbon neutral by 2030, and previously proposed a blueprint for halting all fossil fuel leasing on public lands and dramatically increasing the federal acreage available to renewables. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is embracing the Green New Deal fully, and is expected to introduce some kind of legislation in the coming months.Inslee is still far behind, polling[8] at less than 1%. In an April writeup of Inslee's CNN town hall, the environmental newswire E...ews[9] scoffed at the governor 'pleading' for more supporters in an attempt 'to save his candidacy.'Climate change is surging to the top of Democratic voters' concerns. A March Gallup poll[10] found 81% of self-described liberals, 77% of Democrats and 53% of independents reported feeling 'highly worried' about global warming. Monmouth University[11]'s poll of Iowa Democratic voters last month found the issue was second-most important after health care. In April, a CNN poll[12] pegged climate change as a top issue for 82% of registered Democrats planning to vote in the 2020 presidential primary. Inslee's lengthy record on climate change, including enacting a suite of new policies in Washington and writing a book on the issue over a decade ago, bolster his bona fides. So, too, does his dual experience as a former legislator and executive, something few others in a field crammed with senators can boast. But, while single-issue campaigns rarely go far in presidential races, Inslee's real advantage may be his laser focus on an issue of unprecedented scope and import. Last month, he began publicly urging his rivals to back his call for a climate-only Democratic debate. Now he said he wants his competitors to try to top his climate proposal. 'I hope others will follow my leadership,' Inslee said. 'So far, nobody's joined me, and I hope they will.'

Originally published at ValueWalk[1]. JDP Capital Management's annual letter to investors for the year ended December 31, 2019, discussing their portfolio holdings such as StoneCo, Teekay Offshore, Spotify and XPO Logistics. Dear JDP Partner, Two thousand and nineteen was a strong year of profitable growth for all of our portfolio companies. The Partnership was up 24.6% (net) for the year despite prices of our holdings not catching up with their business progress. </p><p>The S...as up 31.2% driven by attractive valuations at the start of the year and surging profitability of the largest companies in the index.   Q4 2019 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2] JDP's goal is to do better than the market in most years, but we are not an investment[3] in the broader market. Our portfolio is focused on a handful of companies that together we think is more attractive than the index itself. This approach will work against us in some years and benefit us in others. 'It is a great time to be a public company investor' This statement has been JDP's theme since launching in late 2011. At that time, public companies were trading at wide discount to private peers out of fear of a double-dip recession. The recession never happened and instead asset prices had to go way up to keep pace with phenomenal earnings growth. So how is it still a great time to be a public company investor? For families trying to compound wealth over reasonable periods of time, public markets will always have an advantage over almost anything else because the best companies and management teams in the world are publicly traded. Stock markets are home to the largest collection of the highest quality companies in the history of modern capitalism. Besides the $1+ trillion club at the top of the S...00, there are many smaller businesses that have embraced technology and changes in societal shifts to unlock new growth veins that did not exist a decade ago. On the other hand, there is a sea of over-hyped, overvalued growth stories that are cashing in on the current euphoria. There is also a sea of zombie-like companies of yesterday selling 'cheap' because they are overleveraged, can't grow, or are simply losing to new competitors. As a stock picker you get to choose where you focus. JDP uses the stock market to become a co-owner of one-of-a-kind businesses that are the life's work of the best entrepreneurs alive like Daniel Ek (Spotify) and Andre Street (StoneCo), and CEOs with incredible track records of creating enormous value against the odds like Andrew Anagnost (Autodesk), Brian Moynihan (Bank of America) and Brad Jacobs (XPO Logistics). Many of our past mistakes came from an opposite approach: buying average or below average businesses based on price and hoping someone else would pay more for no real reason. Public markets are a paradise for the business investor because nearly all of the economic value created over a lifetime of the most successful companies is done in the stock price. Here are a few well known examples: <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/JDP-Capital-Management-1.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/JDP-Capital-Management-1.png</url> Investors rarely use the market as a tool to own a company for 5, 10 or 20 years because the emotional challenge of tolerating market noise is more than they can bear (think Coronavirus today). Morgan Housel produced an excellent presentation on the topic of investor behavior titled What Other Industries Teach Us About Investing (link). The presentation is one of the better presentations on investing I have ever heard. The basis of Morgan's talk is that our background, upbringing and life experience more heavily influences our investment behavior than the actual risk of the investment itself.How JDP is invested todayThe bulk of our portfolio is invested in companies that are early in their 'compounder' journey. All of our companies have a cash flow stream that is funding an attractive growth runway, several are also sucking the heart out of old-economy competitors (JDP examples: Spotify, Autodesk, StoneCo, EchoStar, XPO). The adoption of technology-first thinking by traditional companies of all sizes has unleashed a race to make everything more efficient, profitable and scalable. The current get-rich-or-die-trying environment has attracted everyone to the party, including the winners that we hunt for. The 'quality spread' between good and incredible During market stampedes (up or down) investors often overlook when individual companies are transitioning from a good business to an incredible business because valuations do not stand out from lower quality sector peers and macro headlines are distracting. Warren Buffett is famous for taking advantage of this 'quality spread' with public companies Berkshire has taken private, like Burlington Northern Railways and Precision Castparts. Burlington Northern, now a wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway[4] subsidiary, is the largest and best-in-breed railroad system in North America. During the depths of the financial crisis Buffett paid $44 billion for the company from public owners or 20 times after-tax earnings\u2014a price that seemed 'full valued'. Shareholders quickly agreed to the deal while ignoring the surge in pricing power and earnings growth that would follow when the economy restarted again. The rail industry had been consolidating for years yet the benefits were just beginning to materialize. Burlington has since flourished along with the broader rail industry. For example, Burlington's much smaller public peer Canadian Pacific Railway is up 730% including dividends since Berkshire acquired Burlington on November 3, 20092. For the lucky few, the flip from good-to-incredible is the most financially powerful leap a company can make in its lifetime. Admittance to this club usually means the ability to survive and thrive throughout cycles and compound cash flow faster than in the past. Similar to Buffett's rationale for Burlington Northern, my favorite metric to identify a precompounder is when a temporarily financially-mediocre company is on the cusp of achieving scale or market position that will unlock pricing power or monetization of 'hidden' assets. This sweet spot means two things: (1) the ability to self-finance growth without diluting shareholders with new capital raises and (2) cash flow growth that leads to a re-rating of the company's financial profile (JDP examples: Autodesk, StoneCo, EchoStar). Good-to-excellent success stories are made possible by a founder or special CEO with the will to proactively and aggressively spend to invest in a direction they believe their industry is going. It takes strong leaders like Scott Grimes and Lynne Laube (Cardlytics) or Daniel Ek (Spotify) to ignore the market's pressure to demonstrate GAAP earnings until there is absolutely nothing more interesting to invest in. JDP's size and like-minded investor base allows us to own tomorrow's compounders while they are still small(ish) and undergoing a valuable transition in their business model.Special situation basketAround the fringes of our core portfolio is a basket of special-situation stocks (~7% AUM) with 5x to 10x upside potential where a favorable outcome is in our favor. Special situations come in all shapes and sizes and are linked to events that are specific to that company. Examples include: lawsuits and geopolitical-driven workouts, balance sheet restructurings, asset sales or spinouts. In order to avoid confusion about our strategy I no longer discuss JDP's special situations in public letters until after we sell. In the past we had more exposure to special situations, but experience taught us that the opportunity cost of not owning great companies acts as a hurdle which is very difficult to overcome as time passes. Last year our special situations group was a drag on fund performance and the reason we did not beat the S...There was no fundamental reason for our positions to rally with the market in 4Q based on the US-China trade deal news. The primary catalysts for unlocking these 'coiled springs' are set for 2020 and I expect this group to have a positive impact on our full-year performance.Survivors ...riversA Survivor ...river is a term Seth coined to describe the type of company that can outperform the market over 5, 10 and 20-year periods. The concept was a byproduct of a research project we started in 2016 called 'Peak to Peak' to study the commonalities of outlier companies that beat the market when purchased at peak market times in history and held continuously to the next market peak. Survivors ...rivers share four common traits that, in our view, summarizes what has to be in place to drive outsized value over ultra-long periods of time. The more a company trails behind in any one of these four traits, the worse the stock performs, regardless of price paid: (1) Business model that is adaptable and relevant in tomorrow's economy (2) Durable pricing power protected by a growing competitive advantage (3) Capital allocation and balance sheet strategy that supports the company's moat (4) Significant alignment of interest between management and equity owners Finding all four traits in one company is harder than it might seem. This is why most companies either just survive (for long periods of time) or just thrive (for short periods of time). JDP's Survivor ...river filter is how we look at new ideas and manage existing holdings. In fact, most of our time is spent monitoring the portfolio to ensure that our companies are firing 'on all four cylinders'. This approach does not ensure we always pick winners, but it does keep us fishing the right pond. In past letters I have discussed our Peak to Peak research; as time goes on and we update the screen, the commonalities shared among winners and losers become so clear and relevant to our goals that it is worth discussing again (with updated results).Peak to Peak: What role does really terrible timing play in beating the market?Imagine that you invested on the worst market day in modern history - October 8, 2007\u2014the 'peak' day of the US market before the Great Recession. You then held with a similar mindset towards a real estate[5] investment or a family business, for the next 12 years to the next 'peak'. Screen #1: October 8, 2007 to October 8, 20193 (full Peak to Peak screen results[6])       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/JDP-Capital-Management-2.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/JDP-Capital-Management-2.png</url> Takeaway: Focus on finding companies with all four Survivor and Thriver traits, ignore the rest. (a) The S...utperformed most asset classes (b) Simply avoiding the bottom 10% of the worst companies produced a total return of ~267% or 11.4% annualized which beat the S...y 2.3% annually. (c) Price cannot compensate for a lack of Survivor ...river traits as time passes. The worst performers would have screened statically cheap in late 2007, and cheaper 12 years later. (d) The top 25% returned ~630% or 18% annualized which beat the market by nearly double. The top quartile was not advantaged by a low valuation in 2007, or materially higher valuation twelve years later; stock prices just kept up with growth.When is it a good time to add capital to JDP?The most common questions I get from potential fund investors are around how to know when it is a good time add capital. Although it is natural to think in terms of buying low and selling high, Peak to Peak shows us that market timing is unrelated to an individual stock's ability to outperform (or underperform) the market over JDP's typical time horizon. The biggest mistakes investors make over their lifetime are mistakes of omission\u2014missing out on returns of individual companies because they think they can trade around market sentiment. Investment managers love to talk about volatility and 'downside protection' but the real damage is caused by self-inflicted lapses in time not owning companies that are far from their full potential. That said, it is a great time to add capital to JDP for three reasons: (1) I am reasonably confident that our portfolio's cash flow will grow by at least 25% in 2020 on a 'look through' basis but have no clue where stock prices will end up. (2) JDP's holdings are market leaders with flexible cost structures that are feasting on structural shifts occurring in their industries. This tailwind acts as margin of safety in a softer economy. (3) We are advantaged by understanding our holdings well enough to decipher between day-to-day noise and nuanced updates that matter to the investment thesis.Portfolio Commentary SpotifyJDP acquired Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) on a value basis between late 2018 and early 2019 for a price of roughly $110 per subscriber (FY 2019) and 2x 2020 revenue. Spotify also has a partnership with Tencent Music (China and Southeast Asia) through a 9% ownership stake that also looks attractive. We think Spotify is a Survivor ...river with a high probability of being worth much more than its current $25 billion market cap within 5 years. Spotify is led and protected by co-founder Daniel Ek, one of the best entrepreneur-CEOs alive today. Originally our Spotify thesis focused on the broader trend from radio to streaming and Spotify's global market position and loved product. We also said that SPOT should be able to increase subscription prices in low-margin markets over time and grow faster in the US than the market thought. Not to mention the ~$20 billion market for radio advertising that will divided between the big streamers someday. All true. But we are now most excited about the growing visibility into Spotify's Two-Sided-Marketplace platform and plans to monetize the treasure trove of subscriber data that is growing exponentially. The platform brings together consumers, artists, content owners, content producers and advertisers to cross-sell within an ecosystem where SPOT charges fees. The idea of Spotify as a marketing platform is not new, the company has consistently discussed its marketplace strategy since going public. Now with 248 million subscribers (4Q '19) the idea is starting to see traction and should have a small yet positive impact on gross margins in 2020. The Two-Sided-Marketplace is important because it means unlocking gross margin potential beyond the 26% today and moving the company beyond its original business model. Spotify's original music streaming model (now replicated in big tech bundles) is outdated and competition is growing. The model pays music content owners per song listened which is similar to pricing store rent as a percentage of sales. This cost structure only makes sense as part of bigger strategy because it is nearly impossible to gain operating leverage. SPOT breaks down the Two-Sided-Marketplace into three areas: (1) Spotify for Artists, (2) Sponsored Recommendations, and (3) audio creation tools (Soundtrap and Soundbetter). Spotify has not disclosed the specific product revenue opportunities by segment because many are still pre-beta. Some of the marketplace products that have been introduced or just discussed by management include: A) Enhanced marketing tools for record labels to influence the exposure of a specific undervalued song or artist. The tool would give the labels more control over targeted promotion for a fee. In the fourth quarter Spotify launched Sponsored Recommendations and mentioned 'Average click-through rates and average listener conversion have been at consistently high rates (+30% for each).' B) Direct marketing of concert tickets to fans based on proximity and interest. Spotify subscribers tend to be highly engaged with the app which offers the first opportunity to instantly offer access to a concert. High-margin ticketing and advertising revenue is up for grabs from old economy companies like LiveNation who cannot interact with fans on a daily basis. Spotify for Artists grew to 500,000 monthly active artists and creators in the fourth quarter (feeder for creator tool subscriptions). C) In 2019, Spotify entered the podcast industry in a big way with the acquisitions of Gimlet, Anchor, Parcast and The Ringer. The rising number of Spotify subscribers listening to podcasts (16%) is driving increased retention and reducing churn. Spotify will sell highly targeted advertising within its owned podcast titles, and eventually place ads on thirdparty content accessed on Spotify. Early data on the effectiveness of podcast advertising suggests that audiences tend to be more engaged and interested in the podcast topic than other formats. The podcast industry is on fire and the price of advertising within high value content will skyrocket off a low base today. Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries stated recently that the podcast industry has 90 million listeners in the US which is estimated to grow 45% by 2022. As of the 4Q 2019 Spotify had 700,000 podcast titles and consumption hours were up 200%. D) Other revenue sources for the Marketplace include audio production tools for small and large artists. Spotify noted in its 4Q investor letter that Soundtrap had doubled its paying subscribers in the period. Lastly, we like that Spotify continues to prioritize ARPU (average revenue per user) unit growth over revenue per user which is responsibly driving platform scale within cash flow. In 2019, ARPU was down 5% due to extended free premium trial period and geography mix. Despite a 37% increase in the stock last year the market remains distracted by recent subscriber growth of big-tech bundled offerings that includes streaming access to a basic music catalogue. Part of the industry's growth is driven by a rapid transition that is happening from radio to streaming as mobile data prices decline. It is also not difficult for big tech to offer a simple streaming audio library that is part of a bundling strategy. We believe the limited audio product features of big tech bundles will not keep up with Spotify's ecosystem of features and benefits to both listeners and the broader audio industry. By our estimates Spotify, Apple, Amazon and Tencent Music subscribers represent only 14% of worldwide smartphone users (3.5 billion) and 11% of total mobile phone users (4.6 billion). Competition that introduces people to streaming for the first time is hugely beneficial to Spotify as awareness of the different services becomes an opportunity to win subscribers. Spotify is a core JDP holding and we are excited about the company's future earning power that is currently under-appreciated by the market. We are also excited to add to the position as new capital is contributed.StoneCoJDP bought StoneCo (NYSE: STNE) in May 2019. The stock has gone up a lot since, but zooming out we see a much larger company in a few years. StoneCo is a Brazilian fintech company that provides card processing, business software and other banking services to small, medium, and starting in 2020\u2014micro-merchants. StoneCo is a core JDP holding but will be capped as a percentage of AUM because of Brazil-specific challenges that are difficult to handicap such as currency, sector regulatory change, political risk, etc. How we found StoneCo and a trip to Brazil We discovered Stone in a news clip that reported that Berkshire Hathaway owned 10% of the company pre-IPO. We put the stock on our watch list and started researching it after it went public. The company stood out as a profitable high growth company undergoing an upgrade in its business model from good to excellent, led by a world-class entrepreneur, and probably misunderstood by US and European investors. Between April and May 2018, the stock fell from $42 to $25 over concerns about competitor pricing. We felt that the concerns were way overblown, so we took a position at $27 per share. StoneCo was founded in 2012 by Brazilian fintech entrepreneur, Andre Street. Stone went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018 and is controlled by Andre Street, his financial partners 3G Capital, Berkshire Hathaway and the Walton family office. Since 2016 revenue has compounded at 78% per year and pre-tax income has gone from negative, to a positive 40% of revenue (big jump). StoneCo gushes free cash flow and, like Spotify, has the opportunity to reinvest all of it back into highly accretive product opportunities to grow its core business. In November I traveled to Brazil with Dutch fund manager Georg Krijgh to visit Stone, one of its competitors PagsSeguro, and an unaffiliated large payments company. Georg and I made the trip because we had a unique invitation by StoneCo to spend time at a company 'Hub' in Sao Paolo with about 20 ground-floor employees that included sales, customer service and a Green Angel IT team for the area. The experience was remarkable because we got to see under the hood, chat with people on the ground floor about their work and get a glimpse into the StoneCo culture-driven secret sauce. After spending the morning at the Hub, we traveled a half-hour by Uber to Stone's headquarters to meet a few senior members of the corporate team. Our hosts were very generous with their time and treated us as if we were major shareholders. The discussion was unusually open and relaxed for a company of Stone's size. We covered a wide range of topics including the super driven entrepreneurial company culture, business challenges, mistakes, and the hands-on support they get from the Walton's family office and 3G. We even talked about management's preferred footwear at work\u2014Swiss running shoes called On, also partly owned by 3G. By the end of our trip it was clear why StoneCo's is advantaged over its competitors and probably has many years of growth. StoneCo's business model and opportunity set is unique to Brazil, and maybe neighboring countries someday. It is difficult to understand StoneCo without going to Brazil and doing the work. As is usually the case\u2014the numbers do not tell the full story. StoneCo as a Survivor and Thriver (1) Business model that is adaptable and relevant in tomorrow's economy StoneCo is a large scale fintec platform for small and medium sized businesses (SMEs). SMEs make up about 20% of Brazil's GDP or $316 billion in 2019 and have historically been underserved, or not served at all, by the traditional banking system. StoneCo's first product for SMEs was a high-quality card terminal for processing credit cards and funding credit card receivables (Brazil's central bank requires a 30-day waiting period on credit card receivables to settle) for an interest rate-like fee. Small businesses were quick to jump to StoneCo's product because of a strong customer service culture in a sector where good service had been nonexistent for decades. StoneCo then rolled out 'free' business software for inventory management, accounting, payroll and financial planning to its subscribers. Stone's unique relationship with its SMEs allowed it to patiently educate first-time users and demonstrate efficiency savings. The SasS software package has become integrated into millions of Brazilian small businesses but gets cut off if the client leaves for a competitor. Transition to monetizing client data to underwrite loans. Now that Stone has access to the most intimate financial data for millions of SMEs it in a position to underwrite loans using daily sales and data linked to its software package. In 2020 StoneCo will begin underwriting small loans and employee credit lines backed by third-party investors for a fee (similar to Square's model). Stone also plans to expand into personal financial products and utility bill pay services now dominated by traditional banks. (2) Durable pricing power protected by a growing competitive advantage StoneCo has demonstrated the ability to preserve gross margins, and even raise prices in the face of competitor price wars. Competitors are far behind and in our view and lack the culture to compete with StoneCo. Bank-backed competitors like Cielo seem to have pricebased sales models, no business software, and average customer service. They offer a basic factoring product and a terminal linked to a specific bank where they act as an agent. Larger SMEs with their own software and less need for outside service are a better fit for competitors, but the margins are thin at the top and StoneCo doesn't compete there. (3) Capital allocation and balance sheet strategy that supports the company's moat StoneCo's growth plans are financeable with cash flow from operations. The company has no debt, plenty of cash and an opportunistic stock buyback program. Management has stated multiple times that it does not plan to use its own balance sheet to fund SME loans other than small pilot program tests. The ability to self-finance a long growth runway will allow for retained earnings and equity value to compound. A strong balance sheet with no debt ensures the company is able to make long-term capital allocation decisions without lender influence. (4) Significant alignment of interest between management and equity owners Founder Andre Street controls the company through a combination of common stock and super voting shares. Andre receives below average compensation and is clearly playing for 'team equity'. StoneCo is the pinnacle of Andre's career and he is surrounded by some of the greatest advisors and equity partners in the world. The alignment of interest between StoneCo management and minority equity holders is excellent, maybe the best among all JDP holdings. StoneCo is a smaller yet core JDP holding and we are excited about the company's future earning power.XPO LogisticsUpdate - JDP has owned XPO for nearly 3 years. During the market crash of December 2018, we tripled-down at just over $50 per share or approximately 7.7x 2020 free cash flow. XPO then bought back a third of stock for an incredible price. The leveraged buyback was a bossmove from CEO and controlling shareholder Brad Jacobs. XPO is a top 10 global logistics provider that acts as an outsourced supply chain manager for large companies. XPO is not in the parcel delivery business (UPS, FedEx, DHL, Amazon). XPO's global scale and fully integrated suite of owned logistical assets means the company can offer best-in-class service and efficiency for its customers that they could not achieve inhouse. The company also has a strong technology culture and is obsessed with maintaining its market lead though tech spend and innovation. XPO is far from an old-economy business and has spent more on tech bets around efficiency and cost savings than any other public logistics company we have seen. Strategic Alternatives announcement - January 15, 2020 In January XPO announced that it is exploring the sale of all the company's subsidiaries except its crown-jewel LTL business (less than truckload). Brad Jacobs discussed his rationale for the move on the 4Q 2019 earnings call saying that he believes the stock will always trade for a discount to its breakup value. Valuations of lower-quality logistics companies sell for 40% - 50% higher than XPO on a multiple of EBITDA basis. We were disappointed in the announcement to sell most of the company in order to close the current valuation discount versus playing the long game that we signed up for. As a result, we sold 2/3 of our XPO position for $95 per share until we have a clearer view of what a 'new XPO' would look like after one or more subsidiaries are sold, if at all. Despite macroeconomics fears, we like XPO and think the stock price massively undervalues both its private market value and long-term earning power. Here are a few selected points from XPO's January 2020 investor presentation (paraphrased by JDP) that highlight some of the reasons we still like the company: XPO has leading positions in the fastest growing areas of transportation and logistics. More than 60% of revenue comes from sectors that are growing at 2 to 4 times GDP XPO's combination of scale, density, expertise and technology is critically important in ecommerce and omnichannel supply chains globally XPO has less than 2% share of the total addressable market opportunity (complements opportunities for further consolidation) XPO's business model is optimized for free cash flow generation in all parts of the cycle: about 70% of revenue is asset-light and 77% of the cost-basis is variable. XPO serves customers in different verticals with diverse economic cycles. The vast majority of revenue is generated under long-term contracts (cash flow generation is more resilient in a downturn than it might seem). Maintenance capex is low, XPO can flex capex up or down and turn working capital into a source of cash in an economic downturn. LTL profit is expected to grow by $700 million to $1 billion by 2022Teekay Offshore PartnersTeekay Offshore (now re-named Altera Infrastructure) was the most difficult and disappointing investment JDP has ever made. Altera was a case where we got the business and valuation right but missed on the fourth Survivor and Thriver trait: an alignment of interest between the controlling unitholders\u2014Brookfield Business Partners (BBU), and minority investors. This summer JDP lead an investor group lawsuit against BBU for breach of fiduciary duty, material misstatements and misrepresentation (among other things). Essentially BBU abused their power as General Partner of the Teekay Offshore limited partnership to force minority holders to sell their stake well below going-concern value, or even liquidation value of the business. To recap the company\u2014Altera is an infrastructure business with long duration contracts to move oil between offshore platforms and the shore in the North Sea and Brazil for deep wells that cannot be turned off easily. Altera's shuttle tanker business is the largest in the world and operates within a duopoly protected by specific expertise in a small niche that keeps out larger infrastructure competitors. Altera's EBITDA does not move with oil prices and has remained consistent for many years. Altera's previous owner (Teekay Corporation) has a long history as a reckless operator and overleveraged the business to pay dividends that it could not afford. To avoid bankruptcy in 2016, BBU took control of Altera by injecting ~$1.5 billion to clean up the balance sheet, fulfill previously ordered shuttle tankers, and even order new ones. New vessels are attached to longterm contracts in the North Sea and Canada and partly financed with Green Bonds subsidized by the Norwegian government. JDP initially invested in Teekay Offshore after the Brookfield recapitalization because the balance sheet risk was removed. The initial Brookfield-Teekay Offshore investor pitch was attractive and described a long growth runway to invest in new assets when competitors were tapped out; Teekay Offshore was positioned as the 'last man standing' with plenty of capital in an attractive niche with pricing power. JDP's average price of roughly $2 per unit was less than Brookfield's $2.50 cost of per unit for control of the company. Brookfield also received an attractive warrant package with a $4 strike that we felt was a homerun. Teekay was earning ~$1 per unit in cash flow 'to the firm' that would slowly become available as BBU further de-leveraged the balance sheet. After two years in, the stock continued to collapse due to terrible investor relations, BBU placing its own high-interest debt at the HoldCo level to earn interest and fees, and a minority shareholders base that was growing increasingly leery of Brookfield's intentions. At the time we were optimistic that BBU was aligned with minority holders because of their 60% stake in the equity, and the 5 to 7-year time horizon of BBU's private equity investment. In the summer of 2019, Brookfield launched a hostile bid to buy out minority holders for $1.05 per share. JDP responded by leading a lawsuit with two other funds against Brookfield. Our effort resulted in BBU increasing the price by 47% to $1.55. But we strongly believed the company was worth well over $4 per share. Our initial lawsuit was combined with another group, amended and re-filed on January 27, 2020. The goal is either to settle with BBU on additional compensation for all former Teekay Offshore holders as of a specific date before the tender or proceed with a class action lawsuit. In summary, even the highest-quality assets bought at a great price can be a terrible investment if you cannot trust management to respect minority investors and not opportunistically profit at their expense.Closing commentsThe most financially successful families in the world became that way by having two things in common: (1) Concentration of their net worth in one or two businesses, or holding companies, often for decades (2) A forward looking, multi-generational outlook As an investor in JDP you are a co-owner in a handful of businesses that I would be comfortable owning much more of, as new capital is added. Our companies have some of best products, technology, teams, and earnings runway potential in their fields. You will only know the next market 'peak' with hindsight; it cannot be timed. When things do go crazy (up or down) it is how we behave that determines our success. As a result, markets will always be rich with opportunities for investors with a business owner mindset. Heading into 2020 we are off to a great start. I am excited about our holdings including two new small positions that could become more important as due diligence evolves. It is an exciting time to a public company investor and an exciting time to be alive. Sincerely, Jeremy Deal The post JDP Capital Management 2019 Annual Letter[7] appeared first on ValueWalk[8].

Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues Q4 2019 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[1] JDP's goal is to do better than the market in most years, but we are not an investment[2] in the broader market. Our portfolio is focused on a handful of companies that together we think is more attractive than the index itself. This approach will work against us in some years and benefit us in others. 'It is a great time to be a public company investor' This statement has been JDP's theme since launching in late 2011. At that time, public companies were trading at wide discount to private peers out of fear of a double-dip recession. The recession never happened and instead asset prices had to go way up to keep pace with phenomenal earnings growth. So how is it still a great time to be a public company investor? For families trying to compound wealth over reasonable periods of time, public markets will always have an advantage over almost anything else because the best companies and management teams in the world are publicly traded. Stock markets are home to the largest collection of the highest quality companies in the history of modern capitalism. Besides the $1+ trillion club at the top of the S...00, there are many smaller businesses that have embraced technology and changes in societal shifts to unlock new growth veins that did not exist a decade ago. On the other hand, there is a sea of over-hyped, overvalued growth stories that are cashing in on the current euphoria. There is also a sea of zombie-like companies of yesterday selling 'cheap' because they are overleveraged, can't grow, or are simply losing to new competitors. As a stock picker you get to choose where you focus. JDP uses the stock market to become a co-owner of one-of-a-kind businesses that are the life's work of the best entrepreneurs alive like Daniel Ek (Spotify) and Andre Street (StoneCo), and CEOs with incredible track records of creating enormous value against the odds like Andrew Anagnost (Autodesk), Brian Moynihan (Bank of America) and Brad Jacobs (XPO Logistics). Many of our past mistakes came from an opposite approach: buying average or below average businesses based on price and hoping someone else would pay more for no real reason. Public markets are a paradise for the business investor because nearly all of the economic value created over a lifetime of the most successful companies is done in the stock price. Here are a few well known examples: <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/JDP-Capital-Management-1.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/JDP-Capital-Management-1.png</url> Investors rarely use the market as a tool to own a company for 5, 10 or 20 years because the emotional challenge of tolerating market noise is more than they can bear (think Coronavirus today). Morgan Housel produced an excellent presentation on the topic of investor behavior titled What Other Industries Teach Us About Investing (link). The presentation is one of the better presentations on investing I have ever heard. The basis of Morgan's talk is that our background, upbringing and life experience more heavily influences our investment behavior than the actual risk of the investment itself.How JDP is invested todayThe bulk of our portfolio is invested in companies that are early in their 'compounder' journey. All of our companies have a cash flow stream that is funding an attractive growth runway, several are also sucking the heart out of old-economy competitors (JDP examples: Spotify, Autodesk, StoneCo, EchoStar, XPO). The adoption of technology-first thinking by traditional companies of all sizes has unleashed a race to make everything more efficient, profitable and scalable. The current get-rich-or-die-trying environment has attracted everyone to the party, including the winners that we hunt for. The 'quality spread' between good and incredible During market stampedes (up or down) investors often overlook when individual companies are transitioning from a good business to an incredible business because valuations do not stand out from lower quality sector peers and macro headlines are distracting. Warren Buffett is famous for taking advantage of this 'quality spread' with public companies Berkshire has taken private, like Burlington Northern Railways and Precision Castparts. Burlington Northern, now a wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway[3] subsidiary, is the largest and best-in-breed railroad system in North America. During the depths of the financial crisis Buffett paid $44 billion for the company from public owners or 20 times after-tax earnings\u2014a price that seemed 'full valued'. Shareholders quickly agreed to the deal while ignoring the surge in pricing power and earnings growth that would follow when the economy restarted again. The rail industry had been consolidating for years yet the benefits were just beginning to materialize. Burlington has since flourished along with the broader rail industry. For example, Burlington's much smaller public peer Canadian Pacific Railway is up 730% including dividends since Berkshire acquired Burlington on November 3, 20092. For the lucky few, the flip from good-to-incredible is the most financially powerful leap a company can make in its lifetime. Admittance to this club usually means the ability to survive and thrive throughout cycles and compound cash flow faster than in the past. Similar to Buffett's rationale for Burlington Northern, my favorite metric to identify a precompounder is when a temporarily financially-mediocre company is on the cusp of achieving scale or market position that will unlock pricing power or monetization of 'hidden' assets. This sweet spot means two things: (1) the ability to self-finance growth without diluting shareholders with new capital raises and (2) cash flow growth that leads to a re-rating of the company's financial profile (JDP examples: Autodesk, StoneCo, EchoStar). Good-to-excellent success stories are made possible by a founder or special CEO with the will to proactively and aggressively spend to invest in a direction they believe their industry is going. It takes strong leaders like Scott Grimes and Lynne Laube (Cardlytics) or Daniel Ek (Spotify) to ignore the market's pressure to demonstrate GAAP earnings until there is absolutely nothing more interesting to invest in. JDP's size and like-minded investor base allows us to own tomorrow's compounders while they are still small(ish) and undergoing a valuable transition in their business model.Special situation basketAround the fringes of our core portfolio is a basket of special-situation stocks (~7% AUM) with 5x to 10x upside potential where a favorable outcome is in our favor. Special situations come in all shapes and sizes and are linked to events that are specific to that company. Examples include: lawsuits and geopolitical-driven workouts, balance sheet restructurings, asset sales or spinouts. In order to avoid confusion about our strategy I no longer discuss JDP's special situations in public letters until after we sell. In the past we had more exposure to special situations, but experience taught us that the opportunity cost of not owning great companies acts as a hurdle which is very difficult to overcome as time passes. Last year our special situations group was a drag on fund performance and the reason we did not beat the S...There was no fundamental reason for our positions to rally with the market in 4Q based on the US-China trade deal news. The primary catalysts for unlocking these 'coiled springs' are set for 2020 and I expect this group to have a positive impact on our full-year performance.Survivors ...riversA Survivor ...river is a term Seth coined to describe the type of company that can outperform the market over 5, 10 and 20-year periods. The concept was a byproduct of a research project we started in 2016 called 'Peak to Peak' to study the commonalities of outlier companies that beat the market when purchased at peak market times in history and held continuously to the next market peak. Survivors ...rivers share four common traits that, in our view, summarizes what has to be in place to drive outsized value over ultra-long periods of time. The more a company trails behind in any one of these four traits, the worse the stock performs, regardless of price paid: (1) Business model that is adaptable and relevant in tomorrow's economy (2) Durable pricing power protected by a growing competitive advantage (3) Capital allocation and balance sheet strategy that supports the company's moat (4) Significant alignment of interest between management and equity owners Finding all four traits in one company is harder than it might seem. This is why most companies either just survive (for long periods of time) or just thrive (for short periods of time). JDP's Survivor ...river filter is how we look at new ideas and manage existing holdings. In fact, most of our time is spent monitoring the portfolio to ensure that our companies are firing 'on all four cylinders'. This approach does not ensure we always pick winners, but it does keep us fishing the right pond. In past letters I have discussed our Peak to Peak research; as time goes on and we update the screen, the commonalities shared among winners and losers become so clear and relevant to our goals that it is worth discussing again (with updated results).Peak to Peak: What role does really terrible timing play in beating the market?Imagine that you invested on the worst market day in modern history - October 8, 2007\u2014the 'peak' day of the US market before the Great Recession. You then held with a similar mindset towards a real estate[4] investment or a family business, for the next 12 years to the next 'peak'. Screen #1: October 8, 2007 to October 8, 20193 (full Peak to Peak screen results[5])       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/JDP-Capital-Management-2.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/JDP-Capital-Management-2.png</url> Takeaway: Focus on finding companies with all four Survivor and Thriver traits, ignore the rest. (a) The S...utperformed most asset classes (b) Simply avoiding the bottom 10% of the worst companies produced a total return of ~267% or 11.4% annualized which beat the S...y 2.3% annually. (c) Price cannot compensate for a lack of Survivor ...river traits as time passes. The worst performers would have screened statically cheap in late 2007, and cheaper 12 years later. (d) The top 25% returned ~630% or 18% annualized which beat the market by nearly double. The top quartile was not advantaged by a low valuation in 2007, or materially higher valuation twelve years later; stock prices just kept up with growth.When is it a good time to add capital to JDP?The most common questions I get from potential fund investors are around how to know when it is a good time add capital. Although it is natural to think in terms of buying low and selling high, Peak to Peak shows us that market timing is unrelated to an individual stock's ability to outperform (or underperform) the market over JDP's typical time horizon. The biggest mistakes investors make over their lifetime are mistakes of omission\u2014missing out on returns of individual companies because they think they can trade around market sentiment. Investment managers love to talk about volatility and 'downside protection' but the real damage is caused by self-inflicted lapses in time not owning companies that are far from their full potential. That said, it is a great time to add capital to JDP for three reasons: (1) I am reasonably confident that our portfolio's cash flow will grow by at least 25% in 2020 on a 'look through' basis but have no clue where stock prices will end up. (2) JDP's holdings are market leaders with flexible cost structures that are feasting on structural shifts occurring in their industries. This tailwind acts as margin of safety in a softer economy. (3) We are advantaged by understanding our holdings well enough to decipher between day-to-day noise and nuanced updates that matter to the investment thesis.Portfolio Commentary SpotifyJDP acquired Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) on a value basis between late 2018 and early 2019 for a price of roughly $110 per subscriber (FY 2019) and 2x 2020 revenue. Spotify also has a partnership with Tencent Music (China and Southeast Asia) through a 9% ownership stake that also looks attractive. We think Spotify is a Survivor ...river with a high probability of being worth much more than its current $25 billion market cap within 5 years. Spotify is led and protected by co-founder Daniel Ek, one of the best entrepreneur-CEOs alive today. Originally our Spotify thesis focused on the broader trend from radio to streaming and Spotify's global market position and loved product. We also said that SPOT should be able to increase subscription prices in low-margin markets over time and grow faster in the US than the market thought. Not to mention the ~$20 billion market for radio advertising that will divided between the big streamers someday. All true. But we are now most excited about the growing visibility into Spotify's Two-Sided-Marketplace platform and plans to monetize the treasure trove of subscriber data that is growing exponentially. The platform brings together consumers, artists, content owners, content producers and advertisers to cross-sell within an ecosystem where SPOT charges fees. The idea of Spotify as a marketing platform is not new, the company has consistently discussed its marketplace strategy since going public. Now with 248 million subscribers (4Q '19) the idea is starting to see traction and should have a small yet positive impact on gross margins in 2020. The Two-Sided-Marketplace is important because it means unlocking gross margin potential beyond the 26% today and moving the company beyond its original business model. Spotify's original music streaming model (now replicated in big tech bundles) is outdated and competition is growing. The model pays music content owners per song listened which is similar to pricing store rent as a percentage of sales. This cost structure only makes sense as part of bigger strategy because it is nearly impossible to gain operating leverage. SPOT breaks down the Two-Sided-Marketplace into three areas: (1) Spotify for Artists, (2) Sponsored Recommendations, and (3) audio creation tools (Soundtrap and Soundbetter). Spotify has not disclosed the specific product revenue opportunities by segment because many are still pre-beta. Some of the marketplace products that have been introduced or just discussed by management include: A) Enhanced marketing tools for record labels to influence the exposure of a specific undervalued song or artist. The tool would give the labels more control over targeted promotion for a fee. In the fourth quarter Spotify launched Sponsored Recommendations and mentioned 'Average click-through rates and average listener conversion have been at consistently high rates (+30% for each).' B) Direct marketing of concert tickets to fans based on proximity and interest. Spotify subscribers tend to be highly engaged with the app which offers the first opportunity to instantly offer access to a concert. High-margin ticketing and advertising revenue is up for grabs from old economy companies like LiveNation who cannot interact with fans on a daily basis. Spotify for Artists grew to 500,000 monthly active artists and creators in the fourth quarter (feeder for creator tool subscriptions). C) In 2019, Spotify entered the podcast industry in a big way with the acquisitions of Gimlet, Anchor, Parcast and The Ringer. The rising number of Spotify subscribers listening to podcasts (16%) is driving increased retention and reducing churn. Spotify will sell highly targeted advertising within its owned podcast titles, and eventually place ads on thirdparty content accessed on Spotify. Early data on the effectiveness of podcast advertising suggests that audiences tend to be more engaged and interested in the podcast topic than other formats. The podcast industry is on fire and the price of advertising within high value content will skyrocket off a low base today. Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries stated recently that the podcast industry has 90 million listeners in the US which is estimated to grow 45% by 2022. As of the 4Q 2019 Spotify had 700,000 podcast titles and consumption hours were up 200%. D) Other revenue sources for the Marketplace include audio production tools for small and large artists. Spotify noted in its 4Q investor letter that Soundtrap had doubled its paying subscribers in the period. Lastly, we like that Spotify continues to prioritize ARPU (average revenue per user) unit growth over revenue per user which is responsibly driving platform scale within cash flow. In 2019, ARPU was down 5% due to extended free premium trial period and geography mix. Despite a 37% increase in the stock last year the market remains distracted by recent subscriber growth of big-tech bundled offerings that includes streaming access to a basic music catalogue. Part of the industry's growth is driven by a rapid transition that is happening from radio to streaming as mobile data prices decline. It is also not difficult for big tech to offer a simple streaming audio library that is part of a bundling strategy. We believe the limited audio product features of big tech bundles will not keep up with Spotify's ecosystem of features and benefits to both listeners and the broader audio industry. By our estimates Spotify, Apple, Amazon and Tencent Music subscribers represent only 14% of worldwide smartphone users (3.5 billion) and 11% of total mobile phone users (4.6 billion). Competition that introduces people to streaming for the first time is hugely beneficial to Spotify as awareness of the different services becomes an opportunity to win subscribers. Spotify is a core JDP holding and we are excited about the company's future earning power that is currently under-appreciated by the market. We are also excited to add to the position as new capital is contributed.StoneCoJDP bought StoneCo (NYSE: STNE) in May 2019. The stock has gone up a lot since, but zooming out we see a much larger company in a few years. StoneCo is a Brazilian fintech company that provides card processing, business software and other banking services to small, medium, and starting in 2020\u2014micro-merchants. StoneCo is a core JDP holding but will be capped as a percentage of AUM because of Brazil-specific challenges that are difficult to handicap such as currency, sector regulatory change, political risk, etc. How we found StoneCo and a trip to Brazil We discovered Stone in a news clip that reported that Berkshire Hathaway owned 10% of the company pre-IPO. We put the stock on our watch list and started researching it after it went public. The company stood out as a profitable high growth company undergoing an upgrade in its business model from good to excellent, led by a world-class entrepreneur, and probably misunderstood by US and European investors. Between April and May 2018, the stock fell from $42 to $25 over concerns about competitor pricing. We felt that the concerns were way overblown, so we took a position at $27 per share. StoneCo was founded in 2012 by Brazilian fintech entrepreneur, Andre Street. Stone went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018 and is controlled by Andre Street, his financial partners 3G Capital, Berkshire Hathaway and the Walton family office. Since 2016 revenue has compounded at 78% per year and pre-tax income has gone from negative, to a positive 40% of revenue (big jump). StoneCo gushes free cash flow and, like Spotify, has the opportunity to reinvest all of it back into highly accretive product opportunities to grow its core business. In November I traveled to Brazil with Dutch fund manager Georg Krijgh to visit Stone, one of its competitors PagsSeguro, and an unaffiliated large payments company. Georg and I made the trip because we had a unique invitation by StoneCo to spend time at a company 'Hub' in Sao Paolo with about 20 ground-floor employees that included sales, customer service and a Green Angel IT team for the area. The experience was remarkable because we got to see under the hood, chat with people on the ground floor about their work and get a glimpse into the StoneCo culture-driven secret sauce. After spending the morning at the Hub, we traveled a half-hour by Uber to Stone's headquarters to meet a few senior members of the corporate team. Our hosts were very generous with their time and treated us as if we were major shareholders. The discussion was unusually open and relaxed for a company of Stone's size. We covered a wide range of topics including the super driven entrepreneurial company culture, business challenges, mistakes, and the hands-on support they get from the Walton's family office and 3G. We even talked about management's preferred footwear at work\u2014Swiss running shoes called On, also partly owned by 3G. By the end of our trip it was clear why StoneCo's is advantaged over its competitors and probably has many years of growth. StoneCo's business model and opportunity set is unique to Brazil, and maybe neighboring countries someday. It is difficult to understand StoneCo without going to Brazil and doing the work. As is usually the case\u2014the numbers do not tell the full story. StoneCo as a Survivor and Thriver (1) Business model that is adaptable and relevant in tomorrow's economy StoneCo is a large scale fintec platform for small and medium sized businesses (SMEs). SMEs make up about 20% of Brazil's GDP or $316 billion in 2019 and have historically been underserved, or not served at all, by the traditional banking system. StoneCo's first product for SMEs was a high-quality card terminal for processing credit cards and funding credit card receivables (Brazil's central bank requires a 30-day waiting period on credit card receivables to settle) for an interest rate-like fee. Small businesses were quick to jump to StoneCo's product because of a strong customer service culture in a sector where good service had been nonexistent for decades. StoneCo then rolled out 'free' business software for inventory management, accounting, payroll and financial planning to its subscribers. Stone's unique relationship with its SMEs allowed it to patiently educate first-time users and demonstrate efficiency savings. The SasS software package has become integrated into millions of Brazilian small businesses but gets cut off if the client leaves for a competitor. Transition to monetizing client data to underwrite loans. Now that Stone has access to the most intimate financial data for millions of SMEs it in a position to underwrite loans using daily sales and data linked to its software package. In 2020 StoneCo will begin underwriting small loans and employee credit lines backed by third-party investors for a fee (similar to Square's model). Stone also plans to expand into personal financial products and utility bill pay services now dominated by traditional banks. (2) Durable pricing power protected by a growing competitive advantage StoneCo has demonstrated the ability to preserve gross margins, and even raise prices in the face of competitor price wars. Competitors are far behind and in our view and lack the culture to compete with StoneCo. Bank-backed competitors like Cielo seem to have pricebased sales models, no business software, and average customer service. They offer a basic factoring product and a terminal linked to a specific bank where they act as an agent. Larger SMEs with their own software and less need for outside service are a better fit for competitors, but the margins are thin at the top and StoneCo doesn't compete there. (3) Capital allocation and balance sheet strategy that supports the company's moat StoneCo's growth plans are financeable with cash flow from operations. The company has no debt, plenty of cash and an opportunistic stock buyback program. Management has stated multiple times that it does not plan to use its own balance sheet to fund SME loans other than small pilot program tests. The ability to self-finance a long growth runway will allow for retained earnings and equity value to compound. A strong balance sheet with no debt ensures the company is able to make long-term capital allocation decisions without lender influence. (4) Significant alignment of interest between management and equity owners Founder Andre Street controls the company through a combination of common stock and super voting shares. Andre receives below average compensation and is clearly playing for 'team equity'. StoneCo is the pinnacle of Andre's career and he is surrounded by some of the greatest advisors and equity partners in the world. The alignment of interest between StoneCo management and minority equity holders is excellent, maybe the best among all JDP holdings. StoneCo is a smaller yet core JDP holding and we are excited about the company's future earning power.XPO LogisticsUpdate - JDP has owned XPO for nearly 3 years. During the market crash of December 2018, we tripled-down at just over $50 per share or approximately 7.7x 2020 free cash flow. XPO then bought back a third of stock for an incredible price. The leveraged buyback was a bossmove from CEO and controlling shareholder Brad Jacobs. XPO is a top 10 global logistics provider that acts as an outsourced supply chain manager for large companies. XPO is not in the parcel delivery business (UPS, FedEx, DHL, Amazon). XPO's global scale and fully integrated suite of owned logistical assets means the company can offer best-in-class service and efficiency for its customers that they could not achieve inhouse. The company also has a strong technology culture and is obsessed with maintaining its market lead though tech spend and innovation. XPO is far from an old-economy business and has spent more on tech bets around efficiency and cost savings than any other public logistics company we have seen. Strategic Alternatives announcement - January 15, 2020 In January XPO announced that it is exploring the sale of all the company's subsidiaries except its crown-jewel LTL business (less than truckload). Brad Jacobs discussed his rationale for the move on the 4Q 2019 earnings call saying that he believes the stock will always trade for a discount to its breakup value. Valuations of lower-quality logistics companies sell for 40% - 50% higher than XPO on a multiple of EBITDA basis. We were disappointed in the announcement to sell most of the company in order to close the current valuation discount versus playing the long game that we signed up for. As a result, we sold 2/3 of our XPO position for $95 per share until we have a clearer view of what a 'new XPO' would look like after one or more subsidiaries are sold, if at all. Despite macroeconomics fears, we like XPO and think the stock price massively undervalues both its private market value and long-term earning power. Here are a few selected points from XPO's January 2020 investor presentation (paraphrased by JDP) that highlight some of the reasons we still like the company: XPO has leading positions in the fastest growing areas of transportation and logistics. More than 60% of revenue comes from sectors that are growing at 2 to 4 times GDP XPO's combination of scale, density, expertise and technology is critically important in ecommerce and omnichannel supply chains globally XPO has less than 2% share of the total addressable market opportunity (complements opportunities for further consolidation) XPO's business model is optimized for free cash flow generation in all parts of the cycle: about 70% of revenue is asset-light and 77% of the cost-basis is variable. XPO serves customers in different verticals with diverse economic cycles. The vast majority of revenue is generated under long-term contracts (cash flow generation is more resilient in a downturn than it might seem). Maintenance capex is low, XPO can flex capex up or down and turn working capital into a source of cash in an economic downturn. LTL profit is expected to grow by $700 million to $1 billion by 2022Teekay Offshore PartnersTeekay Offshore (now re-named Altera Infrastructure) was the most difficult and disappointing investment JDP has ever made. Altera was a case where we got the business and valuation right but missed on the fourth Survivor and Thriver trait: an alignment of interest between the controlling unitholders\u2014Brookfield Business Partners (BBU), and minority investors. This summer JDP lead an investor group lawsuit against BBU for breach of fiduciary duty, material misstatements and misrepresentation (among other things). Essentially BBU abused their power as General Partner of the Teekay Offshore limited partnership to force minority holders to sell their stake well below going-concern value, or even liquidation value of the business. To recap the company\u2014Altera is an infrastructure business with long duration contracts to move oil between offshore platforms and the shore in the North Sea and Brazil for deep wells that cannot be turned off easily. Altera's shuttle tanker business is the largest in the world and operates within a duopoly protected by specific expertise in a small niche that keeps out larger infrastructure competitors. Altera's EBITDA does not move with oil prices and has remained consistent for many years. Altera's previous owner (Teekay Corporation) has a long history as a reckless operator and overleveraged the business to pay dividends that it could not afford. To avoid bankruptcy in 2016, BBU took control of Altera by injecting ~$1.5 billion to clean up the balance sheet, fulfill previously ordered shuttle tankers, and even order new ones. New vessels are attached to longterm contracts in the North Sea and Canada and partly financed with Green Bonds subsidized by the Norwegian government. JDP initially invested in Teekay Offshore after the Brookfield recapitalization because the balance sheet risk was removed. The initial Brookfield-Teekay Offshore investor pitch was attractive and described a long growth runway to invest in new assets when competitors were tapped out; Teekay Offshore was positioned as the 'last man standing' with plenty of capital in an attractive niche with pricing power. JDP's average price of roughly $2 per unit was less than Brookfield's $2.50 cost of per unit for control of the company. Brookfield also received an attractive warrant package with a $4 strike that we felt was a homerun. Teekay was earning ~$1 per unit in cash flow 'to the firm' that would slowly become available as BBU further de-leveraged the balance sheet. After two years in, the stock continued to collapse due to terrible investor relations, BBU placing its own high-interest debt at the HoldCo level to earn interest and fees, and a minority shareholders base that was growing increasingly leery of Brookfield's intentions. At the time we were optimistic that BBU was aligned with minority holders because of their 60% stake in the equity, and the 5 to 7-year time horizon of BBU's private equity investment. In the summer of 2019, Brookfield launched a hostile bid to buy out minority holders for $1.05 per share. JDP responded by leading a lawsuit with two other funds against Brookfield. Our effort resulted in BBU increasing the price by 47% to $1.55. But we strongly believed the company was worth well over $4 per share. Our initial lawsuit was combined with another group, amended and re-filed on January 27, 2020. The goal is either to settle with BBU on additional compensation for all former Teekay Offshore holders as of a specific date before the tender or proceed with a class action lawsuit. In summary, even the highest-quality assets bought at a great price can be a terrible investment if you cannot trust management to respect minority investors and not opportunistically profit at their expense.Closing commentsThe most financially successful families in the world became that way by having two things in common: (1) Concentration of their net worth in one or two businesses, or holding companies, often for decades (2) A forward looking, multi-generational outlook As an investor in JDP you are a co-owner in a handful of businesses that I would be comfortable owning much more of, as new capital is added. Our companies have some of best products, technology, teams, and earnings runway potential in their fields. You will only know the next market 'peak' with hindsight; it cannot be timed. When things do go crazy (up or down) it is how we behave that determines our success. As a result, markets will always be rich with opportunities for investors with a business owner mindset. Heading into 2020 we are off to a great start. I am excited about our holdings including two new small positions that could become more important as due diligence evolves. It is an exciting time to a public company investor and an exciting time to be alive.

MacKenzie is due to receive a 4% stake in Amazon, roughly equivalent to $38 billion, according to Bloomberg[3]. The cash injection will catapult her into being the third richest woman alive[4]. A judge in Washington is poised to rubber-stamp the agreement this week, while the moving of shares to MacKenzie will be confirmed by Amazon in a regulatory filing. Little detail is expected, said Bloomberg[5], but Peter Walzer, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, said it was the \"Godzilla of all divorces.\" Read more: Meet MacKenzie Bezos, who stands to become one of the world's richest women after her divorce, was one of the first Amazon employees, and has written 2 award-winning novels[6] Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos announced the terms of their settlement in April.

It did not go well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing, held by a House Judiciary Committee panel, featured almost five hours of sharp criticism by lawmakers of shockingly anti-competitive practices allegedly deployed by Amazon and three other dominant technology companies \u2014 Alphabet, Facebook and Apple. Although Republicans at the hearing seemed more concerned about instances of alleged bias against conservatives, members from both parties hammered Bezos and his counterparts for seeming to use their positions as gatekeepers of crucial platforms to advance their own interests, harm competitors and abuse the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The panel has been gathering information for more than a year about the companies\u2019 possible violations of U.S. antitrust law. The hearing gave the four leaders the chance to rebut evidence the panel collected from internal company documents and testimony from their competitors and customers. They were not persuasive.</p><p>The four companies\u2019 products and services overlap, but each has a near-chokehold over one or more multibillion-dollar markets. Amazon is responsible for about 40% of e-commerce in the United States and holds a similar lead in the market for hosting internet-based services. Alphabet\u2019s Google handles more then 90% of the world\u2019s internet searches, and its YouTube user-generated video platform is the most popular in the United States. Facebook is the world\u2019s largest social network and, along with Google, dominates online advertising. Apple doesn\u2019t corner the market on any products or services, but the only way to sell software and services to the roughly 1 billion iPhones and iPads in use worldwide is to pass through Apple\u2019s App Store.</p><p>The CEOs insisted that they face rigorous competition and are focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences for consumers. But lawmakers offered example after example of the companies appearing to use their market power to distort the competitive landscape, and the answers offered by the CEOs were singularly unsatisfying. Bezos, for instance, acknowledged that Amazon used data aggregated from other sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company\u2019s data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.</p><p>Apple\u2019s Tim Cook sought to defend the company\u2019s practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay. And Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg had to admit that yes, his company has a history of buying up companies that it perceived as threats to its business.</p><p>(Several Republicans on the panel honed in on complaints of anti-conservative bias, but bizarrely focused on Facebook\u2019s decision to remove a video that dangerously touted hydroxychloroquine as a \u201ccure\u201d for COVID-19 that removed the need for wearing a mask _ after it had garnered 20 million views. \u201cIf Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, \u201cthey\u2019re doing a terrible job at it.\u201d)</p><p>One potential hurdle for Big Tech\u2019s critics is that U.S. antitrust law is uniquely focused on preventing harm to consumers, not to competitors. And because many of the products and services that Big Tech companies offer are free to use, it isn\u2019t automatically clear how consumers are harmed when the companies compete unfairly. That\u2019s an issue for Congress to explore.</p><p>In the meantime, though, the panel is assembling a powerful case for regulators to pursue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have launched investigations into multiple Big Tech companies, as have many state attorneys general. If Wednesday\u2019s hearing is any guide, the companies have much to answer for.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELGAZ-5279339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELGAZ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GX-TKH1-JCBM-W0N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155406</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette, Inc.

The czars of Big Tech it seems have answers to the world's problems, thanks to their wealth. </p><p>Billionaires are flaunting their money for charitable and green causes, but that's okay, because politicians have corrupted governance, and plundered the earth's resources. The rich are being wooed to help turn the tide, literally. Shelling out large sums for the earth may have little impact on their revenues and profits. Corporate social responsibility is serious business with a whole industry built around it. People and governments often tend to make some subtle demands on these High Net Worth Individuals. Heads turn when they write out fat cheques for the planet, and for the meek and weak who walk the earth. Their wealth grabs more attention when the cause is greater, when the scale is grander - like climate change. How did we get here? The planet is in crisis because we are burning fuel and making it warm. This is causing floods, heat waves and extreme cold weather conditions. Livelihoods are under threat, food becomes scarce and people, the poor in particular, are being forced out of their homes. Governments didn't see it coming, and when they did, they find themselves short of funds, the will and resources to stem the tide. Hence they are happy outsourcing environment protection efforts to the superrich who drill it into us that climate change is indeed real, hoping that poor folks will listen. When the political class fails, bring in the technocrats, the rich and famous who believe they know a thing or two about how to get things back on track. That's the general idea. They want people to know they are doing something about it, like setting aside sums from their vast fortunes to prevent a climate catastrophe.</p><p>The world's richest man has thrown himself into the climate movement with a $10 billion fund. Amazon chief Jeff Bezos's cash is no small change in the race to save the planet. In fact, it's the biggest donation by any individual billionaire. Last year, Michael Bloomberg shelled out $500 million, a pittance when compared with what Bezos has pledged. The Amazon chief has timed it well after the bad publicity he received following his divorce and his flop Indian visit. Amazon is also facing the heat for allegedly crushing rivals as it expands aggressively. Regulators in the US and Europe are keeping a close watch on its rapid growth trajectory. The $10 billion could be a diversion, yet is welcome for the earth. There are complaints that global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few. Now the superrich are in charge of charity too. They are the gifts that keep on giving.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

Other indicators are positive too: The number of people filing for unemployment benefits remains historically low, as does the unemployment rate.</p><p>But economic growth in the United States is expected to slow in 2020 compared to last year, and that somewhat weaker forecast is starting to feed through into hiring expectations.</p><p>Just over half --- 51% --- of companies plan to hire new workers this year, according to a recent survey conducted by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, an outplacement firm. That's down from 55% that said at the end of 2018 they would be adding heads in 2019. </p><p>Although that's far from dreadful, it's a sign that companies are less optimistic about the economy this year. More than 18% of companies surveyed reported that economic fears and soft demand would hurt their ability to hire, up from 9% a year earlier.</p><p>\"We are seeing some indicators, such as slow-growing wages, an increase in job cuts, and an exodus of CEOs, that may portend rough waters ahead,\" said Andrew Challenger, the firm's vice president.</p><p>Economists remain bullish on the US economy, but weakness in American factories because of the trade war has proven detrimental to growth.</p><p>\"It is not a exaggeration to say this is the strongest labor market in history, however, economic growth continues to slow and let's not forget that manufacturing is in a recession,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. </p><p>Somewhere, Elizabeth Warren is smiling </p><p>Thursday was a good day for proponents of Wall Street reform.</p><p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon announced that the firm wouldn't take any companies public unless they had at least one woman on the board. By next year, Goldman will up its requirements to two women. Diversity is a good moral goal, but Solomon offered a business rationale for the decision: Companies with women on their boards have outperformed companies with all-male boards, he said.</p><p>Later Thursday, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined eight former Wells Fargo executives a total of nearly $60 million in connection with the banks accounts and sales scandals. Former CEO John Stumpf agreed to a lifetime ban from the banking industry and a $17.5 million fine for his role in the misconduct.</p><p>Advocates for bank reform, most notably Democratic presidential candidate and US Senator Elizabeth Warren, have long sought punishment for Wells Fargo executives and for bank leadership to be more inclusive. On Thursday, they got a double win.</p><p>Up next</p><p>American Express and Ericsson report earnings before US markets open.</p><p>Also today: US Purchasing Managers' Index data arrives for January, providing fresh evidence on the health of the US manufacturing and services sectors.</p><p>Coming next week: The Federal Reserve is expected to stay on hold, but the Bank of England could cut interest rates ahead of the UK's departure from the European Union.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

I'm Alexei Oreskovic, Business Insider's West Coast Bureau Chief and Global Tech Editor. If you want to get Trending in your email inbox every Wednesday,just click here.[1] This week: Welcome to the tech Twilight Zone Has everything about tech gotten a couple notches stranger lately?A scan of recent headlines certainly gives that impression: If you haven't read about the eBay execs charged in a bizarre cyberstalking scheme involving allegations of live cockroaches, a pig fetus and porn, stop what you're doing and go read that story right now.[2]Also, someone tried to burn down Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick's \"ghost kitchen\" startup.[3]And Boston Dynamics, the maker of those dystopian robot videos, is now looking for people to adopt its lifelike robo-dogs.[4] The price: $75,000 per dog, maximum, two per customer. </p><p>Strange days indeed.Silicon Valley has always had a weird streak and a renegade spirit. Steve Jobs' Apple famously flew a pirate flag over its Cupertino, California, offices in the early 1980s[5], and the early days of video game pioneer Atari in the 1970s have been described as never-ending parties and \"pot-churned hazes.\"[6]But the tech industry is now the corporate world's dominant industry, representing the most valuable companies and employing tens of millions of people. There's a lot at stake for these businesses, and we've grown accustomed to watching them act with the caution and bureaucracy of all big businesses, even as they preach disruption.Maybe it's because the entire world is experiencing so much disruption in this moment that tech appears to be going through a shakeup of its own. The employee protests over diversity, facial recognition[7] technology, and worker rights [8]are upending the status quo.These changes aren't being driven by the tech companies. The tech companies are the ones being disrupted, from within and without. Revered founders like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos are being openly called out, their famous leadership principles challenged[9], by their own stock-optioned workers. That probably wasn't part of any company's five-year plan. Some of the responses have been surprising... The return of Mark Zuckerberg's former product general, Chris Cox, was something nobody saw coming[10]. After all, Cox parted with Zuck just last year over \"artistic differences\" involving the product direction. As Rob Price writes, the million-dollar question now is whether his return means he's put those differences aside and is ready to carry out Zuckerberg's vision, or whether Zuckerberg relented?[11]And Jeff Bezos has indicated he's willing to come to Washington DC to answer lawmakers' questions about Amazon and antitrust.[12] Unlike other Big Tech CEOs, Bezos has never testified before Congress, which is a remarkable feat for such a powerful company, and one that's been around for more than a quarter century.Amazon has come out of the coronavirus crisis stronger than ever, even if its reputation took a bit of hit. And given how extensive Amazon's empire is, from cloud computing to Whole Foods, there's likely to be a lot of ground to cover.The Bezos show on Capitol Hill is happening sometime this summer. Who knows what other surprises 2020 has in store for us. Elon Musk: The coloring book[13] Just in time for Fathers' Day, the Elon Musk coloring book is here. The 52-page book features original illustrations based on some of the best tweets Musk has composed over the years.The \"Illuminated tweets of Elon Musk\" is the work of Colorado-based artist Salina Gomez,[14] who told Business Insider she started the book as a way to honor Musk's most inspiring traits and to help people dream bigger.Some of Musk's 11,000-plus tweets, of course, have landed the entrepreneur in hot water[15] \u2014 his characterization of a British cave diver he was feuding with as \"pedo guy,\"[16] and his comments about securing funding[17] to privatize Tesla come to mind \u2014 but the coloring book sticks to Musk's admirable side. Readers will find tweets about environmentalism, space exploration, and scientific progress alongside intriguing, surreal illustrations (the one above is Gomez' interpretation of the Musk tweet \"Sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots\").Whether you're Musk fan, a colorer of books, or a collector of tech memorabilia, \"Illuminated tweets,\" which is being offered on Kickstarter[18] to anyone who pays $30, is sure to please. Sound bite of the week:[19]\"Suddenly you're talking to a robot - not a device, not a computer screen, or a cylinder that's sitting on your desk. You're talking to something that looks like a human being, and that's where the magic happens.\" \u2014 Matt McMullen, CEO of Realbotix, a Southern California company that makes sex robots empowered with artificial intelligence.[20] Sales of the cyborgs, which have roughly the same level of conversational ability found in Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, are apparently up 50% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommended Readings: 100 days that changed Microsoft: How Satya Nadella led the $1.4 trillion tech giant through the coronavirus pandemic[21]Students say that Holberton School, a coding bootcamp where students don't pay until they get a job, is more like 'Lord of the Flies' than the inclusive educational experience they were promised[22]The moment might be right for the venture capital industry to finally address its lack of racial diversity \u2014 but only if it learns the right lessons from the #MeToo movement, advocates say[23]These 12 artificial intelligence startups are poised for success, particularly in a post-COVID world, according to experts[24]How Uber's personal computer 'benefit' and $1,000 payment to laid-off workers exposed Silicon Valley's two-class divide[25] Not necessarily in tech: Adidas fired its head of US retail over a 'violation of company policy' amid social-justice protests at the brand[26]Well, that's going to do it for this week.

Bezos has not engaged in philanthropy to the same extent as many other billionaires, and he is the only American in Bloomberg's ranking of the world's top five richest people to not join the Giving Pledge. In June 2017, Bezos asked his Twitter followers for input on choosing a short-term philanthropic strategy. Last month, Bezos tweeted that he has chosen two philanthropic areas to focus on and intends to make an announcement by the end of the summer.Jeff Bezoswas named[1] the richest man in modern history on Monday when his fortune hit the $150 billion mark. </p><p>But he has not engaged in philanthropy (at least publicly) to the same extent as many other billionaires. Several billionaires have taken up philanthropic causes while serving in executive roles, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Netflix Inc. CEO Reed Hastings. Both of these CEOs have signed[2] the Giving Pledge, committing to donate a majority of their fortune to charity during their lifetime or in their will. Bezos isthe only American in Bloomberg's ranking of the world's top five richest people to not join[3] the pledge. In June 2017, however, herequested[4] input from his Twitter followers for creating a short-term philanthropy strategy. \"I'm thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now \u2014 short term \u2014 at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,\" Bezos wrote. He cited the example of Mary's Place in Seattle, which provides[5] shelter and employment training to people who are homeless. Amazon partnered[6] with Mary's Place in 2016, turning an old hotel into a shelter for more than 200 family members. That space was later demolished to make room for two new Amazon office towers, but the company committed to giving Mary's Place a permanent home. Bezos himself has donated[7] $1 million to the nonprofit. Last month, a few days before the one-year anniversary of his Twitter request, Bezos tweeted[8] that people's responses were \"inspiring, thoughtful, helpful, and appreciated.\" Bezos said he has chosen two areas to focus on and intends to make an announcement by the end of this summer.  In a letter to Bezos published[9] in Forbes, philanthropy adviser Jake Hayman criticized the billionaire's focus on short-term solutions and his decision to seek suggestions on Twitter. \"The answer is not to provide shelter and employment services to homeless families everywhere but instead to fix the systems that have consistently and repeatedly failed people to the point at which they rely on charity,\" Hayman wrote.  Mathias D\u00f6pfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, sat down with Bezos in April for aninterview[10] that revealed more details about the billionaire's thought process for future philanthropy. During the interview, Bezos said he is interested in addressing transient homelessness and helping people without family or a support system. \"You only have to help them for six to nine months,\" Bezos said. \"You get them trained. You get them a job. They are perfectly productive members of society.\" Bezos did not announce any large donations immediately after his Twitter request, but in January, he and his wifesaid[11] they had given $33 million to the nonprofit TheDream.US, which provides support to children who came to the United States as undocumented immigrants.The money is being used to finance college scholarships for 1,000 high school graduates who were granted stay in the US under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The co-founder of TheDream.US is Don Graham, who was the publisher of The Washington Post when Bezos bought[12] the newspaper in 2013. In the donation announcement, Bezos said the gift was made in honor of his father, who came to the US from Cuba in the 1960s as one of thousands of unaccompanied children. Although billionaires like Musk and Hastings have engaged in philanthropy to a greater extent than Bezos, somenotably charitable billionaires didn't get as involved while running their companies. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, for example, did not create the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has more than $40 billion in its endowment, until after stepping down as CEO of his company. Gates ranks second in theBloomberg Billionaires Index[13], trailing Bezos by roughly $55 billion. When adjusted for inflation, Bezos is still worth more than Gates was at the peak of the dot-com boom.NOW WATCH: We interviewed Pepper - the humanoid robot[14]See Also: Amazon won a major battle in

Few notice the building opposite the station. With its dull beige walls and green windows, it's no King's College Chapel, but this is where the hi-tech innovations that are changing our lives in once-unimaginable ways are being dreamt up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the secret labs on the top floor, with windows frosted to protect from prying eyes, Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled electronic \"assistant\", learns how to respond to our questions and commands. Alexa is the device that has kick-started the latest arms race in tech: voice-controlled and -operated smart devices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Look higher still and you will soon see drones flying over the roof of the Amazon Cambridge Development Centre, to give the building its proper name. These aircraft, which will deliver a six-pack of beer direct to your garden in half an hour or less when the barbecue is running dry, are being designed and tested here by British scientists.</p><p>\"We're right out at the edge of what you can do with technology,\" David Hardcastle, the centre's director, says, although the test drone he has just plonked on his desk makes his point rather better. So what's next, I ask. He just smiles and fiddles with his cuff links, which will probably soon be Alexa-enabled.</p><p>Second-guessing Amazon is a mug's game. No one will spill the magic beans. But there is one thing that we can predict. Amazon, already nicknamed \"the everything store\", is fast becoming the \"everything, everywhere, every time\" store. It's growing so fast that it's now the world's third-largest tech company by revenue, on course to generate sales of $200bn this year. That's $547m a day. Analysts expect sales to reach $350bn by the end of 2020 and to surpass the $500bn mark by 2023.</p><p>Its shares are soaring at such a clip - up more than 50% this year - that it is expected to pip Apple to become the world's first trillion - million million - dollar listed company. Last week it became only the second company, after Apple, to pass the $900bn market-value milestone. That made the firm's founder, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sunday-times-rich-list-2018-jeff-bezos-net-worth-richest-man-world-lbwblbrr5\">Jeff Bezos, 54, the wealthiest man in modern history</url>, worth $150bn, according to Bloomberg. That's enough to cover Britain's budget deficit. More than twice.</p><p>As it grows online - and makes the odd foray into the physical world, notably its recent \u00a311bn acquisition of the US and UK supermarket chain Whole Foods - it will have an even bigger effect on the way we behave, on our towns and cities, and our jobs than it has already wrought - for good or bad.</p><p>Make that BAD!, as far as Donald Trump is concerned. The world's most powerful critic is waging a Twitter war on Amazon, accusing it of avoiding tax, bankrupting high-street retailers and destroying the fabric of towns and cities. \"Amazon is doing great damage to tax-paying retailers. Towns, cities and states are being hurt - many jobs being lost!\" he says.</p><p>It's not hard to see why Trump, and many on this side of the Atlantic, are furious, especially those who work at struggling bricks-and-mortar retailers. Amazon's global digital shop is fast replacing the high street. It's already on our desktops, iPads and mobile phones, and now, thanks to Alexa, in our homes and even our cars, with manufacturers such as Toyota, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover installing \"her\".</p><p>Whatever device we use to shop, there's always more to buy. The firm's recent $1bn acquisition of PillPack, an online pharmacy start-up, takes it into healthcare, threatening Boots in the same way that the first product it sold, books, threatened Waterstones. Banks are in the firing line. Amazon wants to offer current accounts. Ocado is under attack, too, after Amazon's decision to partner with Morrisons to offer Amazon Fresh home food delivery.</p><p>And shopping is just the start. Amazon is fast becoming a media giant. Amazon Music is already the world's third-largest digital music service by subscribers, behind Spotify and Apple Music. Television shows like Jeremy Clarkson's The Grand Tour have helped to make Amazon's Prime Video the fastest-growing new entertainment service in Britain last year, overtaking Netflix. Subscribers increased 41% to 4.3m households last year, says Barb, the ratings body. Subscriber figures will rise sharply once it starts screening sports. It has bought the rights to the US Open tennis and will livestream 20 Premier League football matches per season from 2019-2020.</p><p>What makes a simple shop so irresistible that even those of us who agree with Trump's criticism still use it to buy most of the stuff we need, read novels on Kindle, watch TV and now wake up with Alexa? Can it continue to escape the scrutiny and public disgust hammering the other tech giants, notably Facebook? Amazon has grown so big, so fast and been largely ignored by regulators because it is different. Not necessarily better than its west coast US rivals, but different. To find out how, you have to go to 2117-2127, 7th Avenue, Seattle.</p><p>The first distinction is as clear as the summer sky around the company's head office the day I arrive. Amazon is not, like its biggest tech competitors, in Silicon Valley. Nor does it look like anything in \"the Valley\". Its 45,000 Seattle-based staff do not work in a perfectly formed bubble, unencumbered by the awkward intrusion of reality. Amazon's $4bn mothership is spread over 10m sq ft in more than 40 buildings downtown. That helps Amazon never to lose sight of its customers. \"It inspires us to invent for them every day,\" says Sam Kennedy, from Nashville, the first Amazonian I meet.</p><p>Customers never lose sight of Amazon, either. The entrance to Amageddon is marked by glass domes. The Spheres - to Amazon, or \"<person><nameText>Jeff Bezos's </nameText></person>balls\" to everyone else - are 90ft high and 130ft wide, and filled with 40,000 plants. Modelled on the greenhouses at Kew Gardens, they are a place for employees \"to feel differently, to think differently\", Amazon says. (Not for too long, though. Bezos monitors the time his employees spend there). Their main role is to demonstrate transparency. They practically scream: \"Look inside. We've nothing to hide. We're not Facebook!\"</p><p>All the tech behemoths like to think they are take-no-prisoners innovators, but Bezos raises the bar. He reminds his human drones to push harder every day by calling the main 37-storey tower of his HQ Day 1 because \"every day is day one at Amazon\". If they forget the firm's scrappy start-up culture, what will follow is \"painful decline. Followed by death.\" The company's values, pasted on walls everywhere, increase the pressure. \"Have Backbone! Bias for action!\", the signs scream.</p><p>It's tough all right, but also a refreshing change from the platitudes beloved of most west coast US firms - \"Don't be evil\" (Google) or \"Connect the world\" (Facebook). But do the people who work at a firm that is almost 25 years old and set to become the most valuable in the history of modern capitalism really buy such motivational woo-woo?</p><p>They do. Really. \"I love waking up every day worried about my customers,\" Prentis Wilson, who heads up Amazon's business services, tells me - with one of his trademark awkward corporate smiles that seems to mimic Amazon's logo. Stephenie Landry, who pioneered the Prime Now service that offers delivery in cities in a couple of hours, may dress like a hippie but she describes gleefully how \"ruthless prototypation\" and long, long days enabled her to set up Prime Now in New York in just 111 days. That's not moving fast and breaking things. That's being on tech crack.</p><p>Perhaps that's why Amazonians don't mind doing without the perks enjoyed by staff at Google and Facebook. Another of Amazon's core values posted on every noticeboard is \"Frugality!\" There's no free food and staff travel economy class - all except Bezos, who has a private jet and a spaceship, New Shepard, in case he can't find anywhere on earth he wants to fly to.</p><p>Bezos may be tough, but he likes to be challenged himself. Amazon HQ staff are encouraged to write their own messages on the walls alongside company values. Not all criticism is wiped clean by the thought police. On my visit, Amazonians ridiculed Bezos's decision to sell limited-edition 355ml bottles of Amazon-branded Coca-Cola at $10, five times the price of a regular bottle. Over a large poster advertising the drink, one wrote \"$10 fan coke is wrong\". Another drew a face crying with laughter.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest difference between Amazon and its Silicon Valley peers is its attitude to making money. Most big tech outfits like to charge a lot for the gadgets they create and rack up vast profits. Amazon, by contrast, does not seek to make much money at all from its devices. \"We break even,\" says David Limp, head of devices, whose haircut is so neat and whose clothes are so crisp he looks rather like a device himself. He's not kidding. A Kindle ereader starts at \u00a360, compared to \u00a3400 for an Apple iPad Mini, and an Alexa \"Echo\" Dot can be yours for \u00a350, six times less than Apple's rival HomePod.</p><p>Amazon can do this because it subsidises devices and its retail arm with the vast profit its makes from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud-computing arm. AWS sells pay-as-you-go computing power, data storage and content delivery to everyone from the smallest start-up to the CIA, raking in $20bn a year. It's the little-known power behind Bezos's empire and even if you want to escape it, you can't. Like Netflix? You're swelling Amazon's coffers. The streaming giant depends on AWS.</p><p>Amazon does, of course, work very hard to hook us on using its devices once we've bought them - and then charge us even more for premium subscriptions, such as Prime, which offers almost unlimited fast delivery and TV. It does this because the more we shop, watch and download, the more data it gathers that it can use to offer us new products. Even then, it uses low prices to lure us, which means lower margins. It made just $3bn profit on $178bn revenues last year. Huge investment in research and development also eats into profits. Amazon sunk $23bn into R&amp;D last year, a record for any company.</p><p>Amazon has enjoyed a stellar run by any measure, but nothing lasts for ever. The company is coming under scrutiny as concerns about privacy and the monopoly power the big tech firms enjoy increase. Trump, riled as much by criticism in The Washington Post, which Bezos owns, as by Amazon's growth, accuses the firm of everything from tax avoidance to bankrupting the US post office by not paying its fair share of delivery costs.</p><p>Rival retailers are lobbying Trump to break up Amazon. Bill Simon, former boss of Walmart, the largest big box retailer in the world, argues Amazon abuses its dominant position in ecommerce to undercut and drive competitors out of business. He has a point. A cursory web search reveals story after story of vendors who complain that Amazon has forced them to sell their goods on its platform on lousy terms. Some smaller companies even claim Amazon has tried to bankrupt them by copying their hit products and then selling them at a lower price, sometimes below cost. One small San Francisco-based company, Rain Design, sold a $43 aluminium laptop stand that garnered almost universally positive reviews, making it the bestseller in its category. Then last year Amazon came out with an eerily similar stand for $20. Sales of the Rain Design original slipped. \"We don't feel good about it,\" says Harvey Tai, Rain's general manager, with crashing understatement. Amazon has not commented on claims it \"copied\" the stand.</p><p>Although the Rain Design stand is still selling decently on Amazon, it's cases like this that prompt critics to say Bezos is mounting a cut-price land grab to secure market domination. Then, once he has achieved it, he will push up prices and we will have no choice but to pay. From his office in New York, Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University and an outspoken critic of big tech, tells me: \"Dictators always start benign, but power corrupts.\" Many consumers are already complaining that despite signing up to \"all you can eat\" packages, such as Prime, they are charged extra to watch movies and listen to music.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the fearsome EU competition chief, is also on Amazon's case. She's fed up with being given the runaround by companies, including Amazon, that - legally - try to avoid tax by shifting profits from high-tax countries, such as Britain, to low-tax ones such as Luxembourg and Ireland, or simply structure their businesses so that they make little profit to avoid tax. Amazon paid \u00a37.4m in tax in Britain in 2016, despite generating more than \u00a37bn in revenues here. Amazon points out it has restructured its tax arrangements, so that it now pays more tax. But it still has a big cost advantage over its bricks-and-mortar rivals. Paula Nickolds, the new boss of John Lewis, points out that, unlike her company, Amazon does not have to pay rent or business rates here on branded stores because it does not have any.</p><p>It's certainly tempting to paint Bezos as a 21st-century version of the robber barons of the oil or railways age. Amazon will control nearly half of the ecommerce market in the US by the end of this year, a new report from eMarketer says. It is set to become No 1 in US clothing and footwear later this year, with 38% of those markets. In western Europe it accounts for 22% of the ecommerce market and controls more than 80% of the ebook market.</p><p>It's also hard to disagree that Amazon and other online retailers are hollowing out town and city centres and malls. One lunchtime in Seattle I walk the few blocks from Amazon's HQ to Macy's department store on Pine Street. It's so quiet inside that shopping is like intruding on private grief. Or it would be, if there were anything to buy: the shelves are a jumble of outdated styles. Last year was a record year for store closures in America, with nearly 8,000 shutting and only 3,000 opening. Here, House of Fraser, Maplin, Toys R Us and Comet have all fallen victim to the rise of online retail. Some 5,855 shops closed across Britain last year, according to the accountancy firm PWC, more than in any year since 2010. The number of new shops opening also continued to fall, with a net loss of 1,700.</p><p>But Amazon thinks it has a trump card. By delivering ever lower prices, it argues it is the opposite of a greedy monopolist. \"I wake up every day thinking customers are better off than they were 10 years ago,\" says Greg Greeley, former head of Amazon Prime, when I pose the question everyone always wants to ask Amazon: do you wake up worrying about putting yet another bricks-and-mortar store out of business? Amazon executives add that while it may dominate certain markets, notably online books, when you take into account the total retail market, it is only a small fraction - 2% in the UK and 4% in the US. As for pressuring smaller rivals, they point out that 2m small- and medium-sized businesses around the world rely on Amazon to fulfil their orders. Last year, for the first time, independent companies' orders fulfilled by Amazon exceeded sales by Amazon itself.</p><p>But what about all the jobs that are disappearing from the high street? Surely Russ Grandinetti, a man-mountain of a hometown boy who runs Amazon's international business, feels a little guilty about what his firm has wrought? \"The building we're in now didn't exist three years ago. I see a building going up over there that we are constructing. What we've done for this town, for the country, for the world is productive,\" he insists as he gestures out of his many office windows. \"We create lots of jobs not only in the company - 100,000 in the US last year alone, 5,000 in Britain - but also in the suppliers we serve.\" He adds that the firm is set to open a new $5bn campus in North America, creating up to 50,000 jobs.</p><p>Grandinetti does concede that there are losers in the ecommerce revolution and helping them is \"important\". But \"where that nets out I don't really think is ours to tally. Companies have often invented technologies that have then required us to figure out how to reinvest the productivity improvements in new jobs and new ways. That's an important societal thing to do, an important governmental thing to do. I don't think it's our job to do anything but try to be really good at what we do.\" Shareholders will cheer his relentless focus on the bottom line. Critics will respond that he is turning a blind eye to the disruption Amazon causes.</p><p>If Amazon has an Achilles heel, it is in its comically named fulfilment centres - its giant warehouses. They are anything but fulfilling for the people who work there. Scarcely a month goes by without a newspaper sending an undercover reporter to record how staff work crippling shifts. To meet performance targets, insiders say pickers must collect as many as 1,000 items and walk up to 15 miles in a single shift. Timers count the seconds needed to retrieve each item, with penalties for those who are too sluggish. Pressure to hit targets means there is scant time for lavatory breaks or lunch, workers claim. James Bloodworth, who got a job at Amazon's warehouse in Rugeley in Staffordshire, revealed in a recent book that workers who have a day off sick - even with a doctor's note - get a disciplinary point against their name. Amazon has since ended this practice. Wages, however, remain low. Amazon disclosed in April its workers' median annual salary is $28,446, which means a typical employee would have to work more than 5m years to rack up Bezos's current net worth. Thousands of workers at Amazon's warehouses in Germany went on strike earlier this month to demand better working conditions, joining colleagues in Spain and Poland. Germany's Verdi services union accused the company of getting rich by \"saving money on the health of its workers\".</p><p>Grandinetti concedes that \"specific anecdotes\" are \"not as we would like\", but points out that Amazon staff get company pensions, health insurance and shares. Fulfilment centres \"are and have been good places to work. Absolutely.\"</p><p>Can anything stop the world's biggest data-driven instant-gratification company? On my final afternoon in Seattle, I ask Gur Kimchi, the Israel-born scientist, who oversees Amazon's tech centre in Cambridge and has already test-flown the first local delivery - a bag of popcorn. We debate the rights and wrongs of big tech but he's heard it all before and it has turned his hair salt'n'pepper. He wants to move on. \"Let me leave you with a parting thought,\" he says. \"If you think drones are exciting, think about the other 50 projects - bonkers, crazy projects - we can't tell you about.\" Alexa-enabled spectacles? Not weird enough. An Alexa implant so she can tell us what to do, not the other way around?</p><p>Like Hardcastle, Kimchi is not giving anything away, but his parting message is clear: Trump or no Trump, the online mega mall that sells soap powder and makes soap operas, online marketplace, music box, online advertiser, cloud-computer services provider, bank, audible-books player, supermarket chain, food-delivery service, ereader manufacturer, always-on home help, CIA's little helper, online car dashboard, drone squadron, pharmacy chain, creator of warehouses where Dickens meets robots and much, much else - is only just getting started.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-45993185</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SX4-X971-JCJY-G2RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3241\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 29, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000186</classCode><className>BIOTECHNOLOGY &amp;

If Jeff Bezos' personal fortune keeps growing at its current rate, he could become the world's first trillionaire by 2026 at the age of 62, according to an analysis from software review site Comparisun[7].Bezos' wealth has been increasing at an average yearly rate of 34% over the past five years, according to Comparisun, and that's despite turning over Amazon shares worth an estimated $38 billion[8] to his ex-wife, MacKenzie Bezos, as part of their recent divorce settlement.Comparisun looked at 25 of the world's richest individuals and found that only 11 had a realistic shot at becoming trillionaires during their lifetime. </p><p>Bezos will likely get there first, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be the youngest, with his current growth rate on pace to put him in the four-comma club by 2036, when he would be 51. Bezos is on track to become the world's first trillionaire by 2026.  Comparisun Comparisun used Forbes' Billionaire List[9] to determine Bezos' personal wealth, but it pulled data from September 2019, meaning its analysis also doesn't account for gains Bezos has seen during the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused Amazon's stock to skyrocket as more people turn to online shopping.Bezos is currently worth around $138 billion and has seen his fortune grow by $28.3 billion so far in 2020, according to Bloomberg[10].Bezos isn't alone there. While the coronavirus has ravaged the economy, forcing 36 million Americans[11] to file for unemployment over the past two months, US billionaires quickly saw their collective wealth rebound by $282 billion, roughly 9.5%, between March 18 (close to when the stock market hit its low point) and April 10, according to a report from the Institute for Policy Studies[12].At the same time Amazon's success continues to boost Bezos' personal fortune, the company is facing growing criticism of its treatment of workers during the pandemic, including its recent move to drop a $2 per hour pay raise[13] for warehouse employees. Workers have staged multiple protests[14] over working conditions[15] in recent weeks as the number of COVID-19 cases potentially surpassing 400[16] (Amazon has refused to share official numbers).Lawmakers and regulators are also turning a closer eye on the company. Officials in New York City[17] and the National Labor Relations Board[18] are both looking into Amazon's firing of whistleblowers, while Democratic lawmakers recently called for a federal investigation[19] into warehouse conditions.   <url

While the Seahawks aren't currently up for sale, it's possible the team may be looking for new ownership after the death of Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen in 2018. The purchase would be a feasible one for the richest man in the world: NFL teams can cost as much as $2.3 billion, but Bezos is worth an estimated $110 billion. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[5] Jeff Bezos may be eyeing his next big purchase, and it's right in Amazon's backyard. The CEO is interested in buying the Seattle Seahawks, according to \"a person familiar with the NFL's thinking\" who spoke to The Washington Post[6]. Amazon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the report. CBS Sports reported[7] earlier this week that Bezos was considering buying an NFL team[8], though it didn't clarify which one. </p><p>While the Seahawks aren't currently up for sale, it's possible the team may be looking for new ownership: Paul Allen, the cofounder of Microsoft, bought the team in 1997 and died last year after complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[9] The purchase would be feasible for the world's richest man, who is worth an estimated $110 billion[10]. Two of the most recent sales in the NFL were the Carolina Panthers and the Buffalo Bills, which sold for $2.3 billion[11]and $1.4 billion[12] respectively. And Bezos does appear to be a sports fan. He attended the men's Wimbledon finals[13] in July, and was spotted at the Super Bowl in February. While the Seahawks weren't playing, he did pose for a picture[14] with his brother, Mark, and the Griffin brothers \u2014 Shaquem and Shaquille \u2014 both of whom play for Seattle. The photo racked up over 2,000 likes and dozens of comments, including one that said: \"Please tell me this is a sign @jeffbezos[15]is buying@seahawks[16] .\" If Bezos goes through with the purchase, the Post notes that he would join a long line of tech executives who own sports teams: Mark Cuban owns the Dallas Mavericks; Ted Leonsis, a former AOL executive, owns the Washington Wizards, Mystics, and Capitals; and Steve Ballmer, another former Microsoft executive, owns the Los Angeles Clippers. Additionally, Allen's family owns the Portland Trail Blazers and is a minority owner of the Seattle Sounders soccer team. And up until 2016, Nintendo had a stake in the Seattle Mariners,[17] the city's Major League Baseball team. Howard Lincoln, Nintendo of America's former chairman, served as the team's chairman and CEO for 17 years.NOW WATCH: Most maps of Louisiana aren't entirely right.

Up until now, Amazon has resisted making Bezos available to testify.Lawmakers have threatened to subpoena Bezos, forcing him to appear before the committee. Unlike most of his peers \u2014 including Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, and Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 Bezos has not testified before Congress.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is willing to testify before Congress as part of its antitrust investigation into big tech companies, according to a report from The New York Times' David McCabe[3].The Times reviewed a letter to lawmakers from Covington &amp;#38; Burling, the law firm representing Amazon, which said the company would \"make the appropriate executive available to testify,\" which includes Bezos. </p><p>The letter specifically noted that Bezos would be willing to testify at a hearing \"with the other CEOs this summer,\" The Times reports.Bezos' involvement would also depend on clearing up questions about the timing and format of the hearing. The letter noted there were outstanding questions about the lawmakers' request for Amazon's internal documents, The Times reports.Amazon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.Amazon has previously rebuffed calls to make Bezos available to testify[4], telling lawmakers in a letter that it would send an executive to testify but never mentioning Bezos specifically. Lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee have threatened to subpoena Bezos[5] if he refuses to voluntarily appear before the committee.The House Judiciary Committee has been looking into tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook for several months, probing whether any of tech's major players acted anti-competitively[6]. When it comes to Amazon, the committee is likely questioning the company's practices when it comes to third-party sellers on its platform, as well as how its size and scope impacts small businesses, according to The Times[7].Bezos has never testified in front of Congress before, although many of his peers have \u2014 Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey, Google's Sundar Pichai, and Apple's Tim Cook have all appeared in front of Congress in the past, although not to specifically address antitrust concerns.

According to a letter obtained byThe New York Times[1]andseveral other publications,a lawyer for Amazon told the House Judiciary Committee Bezos will be available to take part in the panel's antitrust investigation into big tech[2]. The hearing, which is slated to start in July, is likely to involve the CEOs of Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon.\"[Amazon is] committed to cooperating with your inquiry and will make the appropriate executive available to testify,\" the letter said. \"This includes making Jeff Bezos available to testify at a hearing with the other CEOs this summer.\" </p><p>The House Judiciary Committee is likely to question Amazon about its use of third-party seller data. In April, theWall Street Journalpublished a report[3] in which more than 20 former Amazon employees said the company had used proprietary seller data to help design and price some of itsin-house products[4].TheWall Street Journal'sreporting appears to contradict statements the company gave in the past. Last July, one of Amazon's lawyers told lawmakers, \"we do not use any seller data to compete with [third-party sellers].\"If Bezos ends up testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, it will be his first appearance before Congress. In May, it appeared Amazon was unwilling to make Bezos available to the House Judiciary Committee. At the time, the company said it wouldsend \"the appropriate executive\"[5]to answer questions. In this latest letter, the law firm representing Amazon tried to make the case that other executives were better suited to testify before Congress. However, Amazon may have had little choice but to comply; the committee had threatened to subpoena Bezos if he didn't voluntarily agree to a hearing.The July hearing with other big tech companies could be just the start of a high-pressure summer for Amazon. Last week, The Wall Street Journal said the European Commission plans to announce antitrust charges[6] against Amazon sometime in the next week or two.

It may have been his largest sell-off in Amazon's history. Bezos nor Amazon has provided a reason for the stock sales, but it comes as Amazon among other tech companies are under increased scrutiny about their size and influence. It's also possible that Bezos might use some of the money toward his space exploration company Blue Origin or his charity, the Bezos Day One fund. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos just sold $1.8 billion[4] worth of the company's shares in what may have been his largest stock sale in the internet company's history. Bezos cashed in more than 960,000 shares valued at about $1,900 per share in the last three days of July, as company filings with the Security and Exchange Commission show. That represented 1.6% of Bezos' total stake in the company, and it could be the largest sale of Amazon stock that Bezos has ever made since he started the company more than 20 years ago, according to Forbes. [5] Bezos also transferred 19.7 million shares to ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos[6], making her the company's second-largest individual shareholder as Bloomberg[7] notes. Her 4% holding in the company is worth $37 billion. It's unclear why Bezos decided to sell off his shares at this time. To be sure, the sales were part of a so-called 10b5-1 trading plan, in which shares are automatically sold at pre-determined dates to avoid any perception of trading on insider knowledge. Still, an executive cashing out big chunks of stock is often considered a negative sign, since it suggests the person may not be as bullish about the stock's potential as in the past. As the owner of several other companies, including a space exploration company and the Washington Post newspaper, Bezos has a lot going on. There are plenty of personal reasons why Bezos might have sold his shares that have nothing to do with Amazon. Here are our best guesses at where the money from his stock sales might be going, as well as some of the big issues clouding Amazon's future that coincide with the moves. Amazon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for more details about the sale. The recently announced Department of Justice's probe into large tech companies wiped billions off the market cap of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple. David Becker/Getty Images; Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images; Mark Wilson/Getty Images; Saurabh Das/AP Photo; Justin Sullivan/Getty Images; Skye Gould/Business InsiderThe Department of Justice said on July 23 that was launching a broad investigation into market-leading online platforms[8] in search, social media, and e-commerce to determine whether such firms are hampering competition. While it did not specifically name the companies it's investigating, the DOJ made its announcement after a report from The Wall Street Journal[9] indicated that the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission had split jurisdiction over probing Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple.  Shares for Amazon, Apple, Google parent Alphabet, and Facebook were tumbling in after hours trading on July 23, wiping away $33 billion[10] between the four companies. Amazon was down 1% following the news on July 23, a $9.8 billion hit to its market capitalization. Read more: Amazon reportedly has an ambitious plan to change the way we grocery shop \u2014 here's what we know about it so far[11] Amazon, along with Google, Facebook, and Apple, have been at the center of the debate about whether tech firms hold too much power and therefore stifle competition. Amazon; Apple; Facebook; Google; Samantha Lee/Business InsiderExecutives from these companies testified before a Congressional antitrust subcommittee in July to answer questions about their business practices and whether they make it more difficult for smaller companies to compete. Democratic senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warrencalled for regulation[12] of big tech firms like Amazon earlier this year. Under her plan, large firms with annual global revenue of $25 billion or more would be classified as \"platform utilities,\" and certain past acquisitions could even be reversed. The scrutiny has prompted tech firms to defend their business practices more vocally than ever. In his annual letter to shareholders[13] in April, Bezos didn't directly address the discussion around tech regulation. But he did stress the success that small and medium sized companies have had on his platform and referred to Amazon has a \"small player\" in the worldwide retail space. It's possible that Bezos could be using some of that money to fund Blue Origin, his private space exploration company. Axel Springer/Blue Origin/ Business InsiderBezos liquidates $1 billion worth of Amazon stock per year to fund Blue Origin, he said[14] when speaking at an event hosted by Business Insider parent company Axel Springer last April. \"The only way I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel,\" Bezos said at the time. \"Blue Origin is expensive enough to be able to use that fortune.\"See the rest of the story at Business Insider[15] See Also: The buzzy fintech startup Arcus has raised over $19 million.

In December, he walked the red carpet at a screening of \u201cThe Post\u201d in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, made public their $33 million donation to a non-profit that provides college scholarships to \u201cDreamers\u201d, young immigrants brought to the US illegally as children. In October, he received an award for a donation to a marriage equality campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jennifer Cast, an Amazon executive who solicited the donation from him, said at the event that they could have donated anonymously to the campaign. \u201cBut just as critical as the money was Jeff\u2019s offer to let us publicly acknowledge their gifts,\u201d she said. \u201cBy allowing us to take their donation public,\u201d she added, \u201cthe world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.\u201d</p><p>The appearances and actions are a new look for Bezos. As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon\u2019s growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.</p><p>But while Bezos \u2014 who at 53 is the world\u2019s richest person, with a net worth of more than $100 billion \u2014 can afford virtually any luxury, obscurity is no longer among them. Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of \u201cbig tech\u201d, along with Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook.</p><p>These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for President Donald Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter. \u201cPeople are starting to get scared of Amazon,\u201d said Steve Case, a co-founder of America Online, who recently started an investment fund focused on start-ups in underserved areas, with Bezos among its contributors.</p><p>\u201cIf Jeff continues to hang out in Seattle, he\u2019s going to get a lot more incoming. Even for just defence reasons, he has to now play offence.\u201d</p><p>Bezos\u2019 portfolio of other ventures has thrust him further into the spotlight. Four years ago, he bought \u201cThe Washington Post\u201d for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city\u2019s most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city\u2019s political class.</p><p>Nearby neighbours include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Bezos\u2019 space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.</p><p>In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, \u201cJeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.\u201d</p><p>But interviews with more than 30 people who know Bezos, most of whom declined to be identified to protect their relationships with him, revealed his awareness of the growing opposition to Amazon and his growing comfort with being in the public eye. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon.</p><p>The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test. Investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Bezos\u2019 mind.</p><p>Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get a lot of scrutiny if you\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d Buffett said. Some of the people who know Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency.</p><p>Others believe it is a result of personal growth. But they all said it was clear that Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.</p><p>A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.</p><p>But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country\u2019s most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence. For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were.</p><p>And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities. Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble. It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.</p><p>By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticised by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.</p><p>A turning point came for Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with US state governments. At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax.</p><p>But Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon\u2019s image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said. Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.</p><p>As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs. Suddenly, a company that once refused to confirm how many employees it had at its Seattle headquarters could not stop talking about how many jobs it was creating.</p><p>It now has 542,000 employees.</p><p>As Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counter-narrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully. Waves of store closings by bricks-and-mortar retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble and Macy\u2019s increased the volume. \u201cAmazon Must Be Stopped\u201d, read a 2014 \u201cNew Republic\u201d article about the company\u2019s growing market power.</p><p>That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon\u2019s reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher\u2019s titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order. After the matter was resolved, Bezos told an interviewer that Amazon was simply negotiating hard on behalf of its customers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,\u201d he said, referring to book publishers.</p><p>By late 2015, a few months after Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post. \u201cThe @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon!\u201d he tweeted in December that year. \u201cBig tax shelter.\u201d</p><p>Bezos responded by offering to launch the future president of the US into space on a Blue Origin rocket.</p><p>The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power. \u201cThe purchase of Whole Foods was a moment when people looked up and recognised this company as a force in the economy,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, a co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance</p><p>Bezos\u2019 more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.</p><p>\u2014 New York Times News Service</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-108007094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFF-GS81-JDJN-64TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

He cites third party profits and setting standards in labour practices as the positive results of Amazon's policies. Parts of the the letter are also seen as a response to US Senator Elizabeth Warren's post on the need to \"break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook\".</p><p><br/><br/>Amazon's success and market health<br/><br/>Bezos extolled the fortunes of third-party sellers on the platform, citing a 50% growth rate of non-Amazon products sold through the platform over the past two decades. This beats the growth of the company's own products on its platform, cited at about 25%. Bezos uses this to argue that the company's services do more to create value for third parties than it does to further their own success. To put it bluntly, he writes:<br/><br/>\"Third-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly.\"<br/><br/>The letter is seen as a response to calls by American Senator Elizabeth Warren to introduce more effective regulatory mechanisms to ensure that Amazon's growth does not stifle other market entrants from providing competition. She argues that the control that the companies posses over the way consumers use the online services compromise the interests of users:<br/><br/>\"Venture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new startups to compete with these big tech companies because it's so easy for the big companies to either snap up growing competitors or drive them out of business. The number of tech startups has slumped, there are fewer high-growth young firms typical of the tech industry, and first financing rounds for tech startups have declined 22% since 2012.\"<br/><br/>On Size: How big is too big?<br/><br/>Bezos: Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.<br/><br/>\"Nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. More than 70% of all Internet traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook.\"<br/><br/>Bezos makes a case for the justification of Amazon's size: that the quality and range of services have won out in the market over time, despite significant competition. The size, it follows, is the market's reward for providing the best services over an extended period of time.<br/><br/>\"Why did independent sellers do so much better selling on Amazon than they did on eBay? And why were independent sellers able to grow so much faster than Amazon's own highly organized first-party sales organization? There isn't one answer, but we do know one extremely important part of the answer: We helped independent sellers compete against our first-party business by investing in and offering them the very best selling tools we could imagine and build.\"<br/><br/>Competing on labour rights and privacy<br/><br/>Warren uses the market statistics she cites earlier to argue that with the level of competition currently in the market, competitiveness compromised. Greater competition would lead to benefits for users in key areas - such as privacy:<br/><br/>\"With fewer competitors entering the market, the big tech companies do not have to compete as aggressively in key areas like protecting our privacy. And some of these companies have grown so powerful that they can act - in the words of Mark Zuckerberg - \"more like a government than a traditional company.\"<br/><br/>Bezos argues that its success is what allows Amazon to take the kinds of risks and plans it does, on the scale that it does. He highlights the diverging fortunes of two contemporaries - the Fire phone and the Echo - to make this point, and highlights how they are able to set an example for the market on an issue like wages.<br/><br/>\"Today I challenge our top retail competitors (you know who you are!) to match our employee benefits and our $15 minimum wage. Do it! Better yet, go to $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us. It's a kind of competition that will benefit everyone.\"<br/><br/>Platform utilities<br/><br/>Warren introduces the concept of platform utilities as one prong of her proposal. The concept is similar to common carriage, a common law principle where a carriers of goods (in this case data) advertises to the public of performing that function and is thereby deemed a 'common carrier'. Providing this essential function places them in a powerful position, and brings with it responsibilities of treating all users equally and without arbitrary discrimination. Warren explains how this can apply to large tech platforms:</p><p>\"Companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as 'platform utilities.' smaller companies (those with annual global revenue of between $90 million and $25 billion), their platform utilities would be required to meet the same standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users, but would not be required to structurally separate from any participant on the platform.<br/><br/>Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business. Google couldn't smother competitors by demoting their products on Google Search. Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy. Tech entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against the tech giants.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0047166150</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWW-K8C1-DXMP-K2PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
