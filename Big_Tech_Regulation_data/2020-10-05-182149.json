The results may be overshadowed by the array of political and policy issues over privacy, data protection, liability and the dominant role of these companies in the economy.    Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Big Tech has offered a lifeline to consumers to stay connected and get needed goods and services.    Tech firms \u201chave built up some goodwill and people are thankful for these services\u201d, said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.    Big tech firms \u201cwere the only institutions that didn\u2019t seem to fail\u201d during the pandemic, said Chris Meserole, deputy director of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative.    A Brunswick Group survey of consumers in seven countries in May found 70% of Americans and 65% of Europeans agree that \u201ctechnology companies have used their size and influence for good in the fight against Covid-19\u201d.    But at the same time, three in four of those surveyed said governments \u201cshould be more active in regulating technology companies\u201d. This is up 14 points in the US since 2018, and largely unchanged among Europeans.    Big Tech has helped lift stock values, with the Nasdaq hitting several record highs; Amazon shares have nearly doubled from March lows while Apple and Alphabet have gains some 50 percent.    Economist Ed Yardeni noted that six leading tech firms \u2013 Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix \u2013 had a collective market value of US$6.5tril (RM27.63tril) in early July, or a record 25% of the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 largest companies.    Profiting from crisis?    These Big Tech firms \u201care among the biggest beneficiaries of the economic upheaval caused by the (pandemic) and are likely to continue to benefit from its aftershocks well after the crisis is over\u201d, Yardeni said in a research note.    \u201cThat\u2019s because their businesses are Internet-based, so the more that people\u2019s work, education, and entertainment are home-based, the more these businesses thrive.\u201d    Quarterly results this week from Microsoft and next week from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook will offer more clues on how the sector is faring in the pandemic.    Amid a struggling economy, Amazon appears to have boosted its position in e-commerce while expanding cloud computing while Apple has been growing its range of services.    Other tech giants appear to be largely weathering the crisis, and growing in some cases, even if Facebook is the target of a growing advertiser boycott seeking more aggressive action on hateful content.    Focus on US Congress    The spotlight is likely to be on an unprecedented antitrust hearing Monday in Congress featuring the top executives of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.    Also looming are the outcomes of federal and state antitrust investigations into major tech platforms which could mean fresh legal battles.    Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities sees \u201ca potentially rocky road ahead\u201d and that \u201cthe overhang of regulatory scrutiny remains a lingering worry\u201d for Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook.    \u201cMomentum is building in the Beltway on this hot button antitrust issue,\u201d Ives said in a note to clients.    More battles    Tech firms face additional pressure including the Trump administration\u2019s effort to enable law enforcement access to encrypted content and devices.    Officials say better access is needed to fight crime and exploitation, but the companies argue that proposed measures could weaken online security for everyone.    Trump and his allies have argued the big social platforms are biased against conservatives, despite his large following. At the same time activists have pressed the companies to be more aggressive in removing incendiary content and misinformation, including from Trump, and 1,000 advertisers have joined a \u201cStop Hate for Profit\u201d boycott of Facebook.    Meserole said that because of its failure to take action on hateful content, \u201call the goodwill Facebook had built up in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic went out the window.\u201d    He said firms such as Apple and Google have remained \u201cgood corporate citizens\u201d during the crisis, noting efforts to improve technology for contact tracing.    Lawmakers from both parties have called for changes to a law known as Section 230 which shields online services from liability from content posted by others \u2013 which some analysts say could have a devastating impact.    O\u2019Donnell said recent events have shown the power and influence of the Big Tech firms and that \u201cthere\u2019s clearly going to be more scrutiny, and deservedly so\u201d.    But Meserole said that despite the noise on antitrust, breakups are unlikely without legislative changes which could take time.    \u201cWithout that shift in regulatory approach, all that\u2019s likely to happen are a series of large fines, rather than a breakup of Big Tech,\u201d he said. \u2013 AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42655239467</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DK-PDJ1-JCSC-J4JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheStar.com.my</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

The results may be overshadowed by the array of political and policy issues over privacy, data protection, liability and the dominant role of these companies in the economy.   Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Big Tech has offered a lifeline to consumers to stay connected and get needed goods and services.   Tech firms \"have built up some goodwill and people are thankful for these services,\" said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.   Big tech firms \"were the only institutions that didn't seem to fail\" during the pandemic, said Chris Meserole, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative.   A Brunswick Group survey of consumers in seven countries in May found 70 percent of Americans and 65 percent of Europeans agree that \"technology companies have used their size and influence for good in the fight against COVID-19.\"         But at the same time, three in four of those surveyed said governments \"should be more active in regulating technology companies.\"  This is up 14 points in the US since 2018, and largely unchanged among Europeans.   Big Tech has helped lift stock values, with the Nasdaq hitting several record highs;  Amazon shares have nearly doubled from March lows while Apple and Alphabet have gains some 50 percent.   Economist Ed Yardeni noted that six leading tech firms -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix -- had a collective market value of $6.5 trillion in early July, or a record 25 percent of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 largest companies.         These Big Tech firms \"are among the biggest beneficiaries of the economic upheaval caused by the (pandemic) and are likely to continue to benefit from its aftershocks well after the crisis is over,\" Yardeni said in a research note.   \"That's because their businesses are internet-based, so the more that people's work, education, and entertainment are home-based, the more these businesses thrive.\"   Quarterly results this week from Microsoft and next week from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook will offer more clues on how the sector is faring in the pandemic.    Amid a struggling economy, Amazon appears to have boosted its position in e-commerce while expanding cloud computing while Apple has been growing its range of services.   Other tech giants appear to be largely weathering the crisis, and growing in some cases, even if Facebook is the target of a growing advertiser boycott seeking more aggressive action on hateful content.   - Focus on Congress -   The spotlight is likely to be on an unprecedented antitrust hearing Monday in Congress featuring the top executives of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.   Also looming are the outcomes of federal and state antitrust investigations into major tech platforms which could mean fresh legal battles.   Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities sees \"a potentially rocky road ahead\" and that \"the overhang of regulatory scrutiny remains a lingering worry\" for Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook.   \"Momentum is building in the Beltway on this hot button antitrust issue,\" Ives said in a note to clients.   - More battles -   Tech firms face additional pressure including the Trump administration's effort to enable law enforcement access to encrypted content and devices.    Officials say better access is needed to fight crime and exploitation, but the companies argue that proposed measures could weaken online security for everyone.   Trump and his allies have argued the big social platforms are biased against conservatives, despite his large following. At the same time activists have pressed the companies to be more aggressive in removing incendiary content and misinformation, including from Trump, and 1,000 advertisers have joined a \"Stop Hate for Profit\" boycott of Facebook.   Meserole said that because of its failure to take action on hateful content, \"all the goodwill Facebook had built up in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic went out the window.\"   He said firms such as Apple and Google have remained \"good corporate citizens\" during the crisis, noting efforts to improve technology for contact tracing.   Lawmakers from both parties have called for changes to a law known as Section 230 which shields online services from liability from content posted by others -- which some analysts say could have a devastating impact.   O'Donnell said recent events have shown the power and influence of the Big Tech firms and that \"there's clearly going to be more scrutiny, and deservedly so.\"   But Meserole said that despite the noise on antitrust, breakups are unlikely without legislative changes which could take time.   \"Without that shift in regulatory approach, all that's likely to happen are a series of large fines, rather than a breakup of Big Tech,\" he said.   rl/jm</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42654520258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DJ-BM81-F07F-82HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"886\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>MSN South Africa</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

The results may be overshadowed by the array of political and policy issues over privacy, data protection, liability and the dominant role of these companies in the economy.  Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Big Tech has offered a lifeline to consumers to stay connected and get needed goods and services.  Tech firms \"have built up some goodwill and people are thankful for these services,\" said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.  Big tech firms \"were the only institutions that didn't seem to fail\" during the pandemic, said Chris Meserole, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative.  A Brunswick Group survey of consumers in seven countries in May found 70 percent of Americans and 65 percent of Europeans agree that \"technology companies have used their size and influence for good in the fight against COVID-19.\"  But at the same time, three in four of those surveyed said governments \"should be more active in regulating technology companies.\"  This is up 14 points in the US since 2018, and largely unchanged among Europeans.  Big Tech has helped lift stock values, with the Nasdaq hitting several record highs;  Amazon shares have nearly doubled from March lows while Apple and Alphabet have gains some 50 percent.  Economist Ed Yardeni noted that six leading tech firms -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix -- had a collective market value of $6.5 trillion in early July, or a record 25 percent of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 largest companies.  - Profiting from crisis? -  These Big Tech firms \"are among the biggest beneficiaries of the economic upheaval caused by the (pandemic) and are likely to continue to benefit from its aftershocks well after the crisis is over,\" Yardeni said in a research note.  \"That's because their businesses are internet-based, so the more that people's work, education, and entertainment are home-based, the more these businesses thrive.\"  Quarterly results this week from Microsoft and next week from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook will offer more clues on how the sector is faring in the pandemic.  Amid a struggling economy, Amazon appears to have boosted its position in e-commerce while expanding cloud computing while Apple has been growing its range of services.  Other tech giants appear to be largely weathering the crisis, and growing in some cases, even if Facebook is the target of a growing advertiser boycott seeking more aggressive action on hateful content.  - Focus on Congress -  The spotlight is likely to be on an unprecedented antitrust hearing Monday in Congress featuring the top executives of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.  Also looming are the outcomes of federal and state antitrust investigations into major tech platforms which could mean fresh legal battles.  Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities sees \"a potentially rocky road ahead\" and that \"the overhang of regulatory scrutiny remains a lingering worry\" for Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook.  \"Momentum is building in the Beltway on this hot button antitrust issue,\" Ives said in a note to clients.  - More battles -  Tech firms face additional pressure including the Trump administration's effort to enable law enforcement access to encrypted content and devices.  Officials say better access is needed to fight crime and exploitation, but the companies argue that proposed measures could weaken online security for everyone.  Trump and his allies have argued the big social platforms are biased against conservatives, despite his large following. At the same time activists have pressed the companies to be more aggressive in removing incendiary content and misinformation, including from Trump, and 1,000 advertisers have joined a \"Stop Hate for Profit\" boycott of Facebook.  Meserole said that because of its failure to take action on hateful content, \"all the goodwill Facebook had built up in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic went out the window.\"  He said firms such as Apple and Google have remained \"good corporate citizens\" during the crisis, noting efforts to improve technology for contact tracing.  Lawmakers from both parties have called for changes to a law known as Section 230 which shields online services from liability from content posted by others -- which some analysts say could have a devastating impact.  O'Donnell said recent events have shown the power and influence of the Big Tech firms and that \"there's clearly going to be more scrutiny, and deservedly so.\"  But Meserole said that despite the noise on antitrust, breakups are unlikely without legislative changes which could take time.  \"Without that shift in regulatory approach, all that's likely to happen are a series of large fines, rather than a breakup of Big Tech,\" he said.

The results may be overshadowed by the array of political and policy issues over privacy, data protection, liability and the dominant role of these companies in the economy.  Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Big Tech has offered a lifeline to consumers to stay connected and get needed goods and services.  Tech firms \"have built up some goodwill and people are thankful for these services,\" said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.  Big tech firms \"were the only institutions that didn't seem to fail\" during the pandemic, said Chris Meserole, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative.  A Brunswick Group survey of consumers in seven countries in May found 70 per cent of Americans and 65 per cent of Europeans agree that \"technology companies have used their size and influence for good in the fight against Covid-19.\"  But at the same time, three in four of those surveyed said governments \"should be more active in regulating technology companies.\" This is up 14 points in the US since 2018, and largely unchanged among Europeans.  Big Tech has helped lift stock values, with the Nasdaq hitting several record highs; Amazon shares have nearly doubled from March lows while Apple and Alphabet have gains some 50 per cent.  Economist Ed Yardeni noted that six leading tech firms -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix -- had a collective market value of $6.5 trillion in early July, or a record 25 per cent of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 largest companies.  These Big Tech firms \"are among the biggest beneficiaries of the economic upheaval caused by the (pandemic) and are likely to continue to benefit from its aftershocks well after the crisis is over,\" Yardeni said in a research note.  \"That's because their businesses are internet-based, so the more that people's work, education, and entertainment are home-based, the more these businesses thrive.\"  Quarterly results this week from Microsoft and next week from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook will offer more clues on how the sector is faring in the pandemic.  Amid a struggling economy, Amazon appears to have boosted its position in e-commerce while expanding cloud computing while Apple has been growing its range of services.  Other tech giants appear to be largely weathering the crisis, and growing in some cases, even if Facebook is the target of a growing advertiser boycott seeking more aggressive action on hateful content.  The spotlight is likely to be on an unprecedented antitrust hearing Monday in Congress featuring the top executives of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.  Also looming are the outcomes of federal and state antitrust investigations into major tech platforms which could mean fresh legal battles.  Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities sees \"a potentially rocky road ahead\" and that \"the overhang of regulatory scrutiny remains a lingering worry\" for Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook.  \"Momentum is building in the Beltway on this hot button antitrust issue,\" Ives said in a note to clients.  Tech firms face additional pressure including the Trump administration's effort to enable law enforcement access to encrypted content and devices.  Officials say better access is needed to fight crime and exploitation, but the companies argue that proposed measures could weaken online security for everyone.  Trump and his allies have argued the big social platforms are biased against conservatives, despite his large following. At the same time activists have pressed the companies to be more aggressive in removing incendiary content and misinformation, including from Trump, and 1,000 advertisers have joined a \"Stop Hate for Profit\" boycott of Facebook.  Meserole said that because of its failure to take action on hateful content, \"all the goodwill Facebook had built up in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic went out the window.\"  He said firms such as Apple and Google have remained \"good corporate citizens\" during the crisis, noting efforts to improve technology for contact tracing.  Lawmakers from both parties have called for changes to a law known as Section 230 which shields online services from liability from content posted by others -- which some analysts say could have a devastating impact.  O'Donnell said recent events have shown the power and influence of the Big Tech firms and that \"there's clearly going to be more scrutiny, and deservedly so.\"  But Meserole said that despite the noise on antitrust, breakups are unlikely without legislative changes which could take time.  \"Without that shift in regulatory approach, all that's likely to happen are a series of large fines, rather than a breakup of Big Tech,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42655297929</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DK-PDG1-JCSC-J51X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"871\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Deccan Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Latortue[1], Associate, Litigation[2] Shortly after being sworn in as the new governor of California, Gavin Newsom proposed extending California's current six-week paid family leave (PFL) to six months. PFL, which became state law 17 years ago, currently provides up to six weeks of partial wage replacement to employees who take time off work to, among other things, care for a new child entering the family through birth, adoption or foster care placement. Other states - such as New York, Massachusetts and Washington - have followed, and have even surpassed, California's PFL, providing more paid time off to parents. The proposal may seem like good news to some, but not to all. </p><p>On the one hand, the proposal will boost the amount of time employees can take off work to bond with a new child. And spending more time at home with a new child could decrease the cost of child care to parents. On the other hand, questions abound regarding how to fund the increase. PFL is funded 100% by employees through payroll taxes. One option for funding the proposal is to increase payroll taxes, i.e., to increase deductions from employees' paychecks. The proposal does not call for six months for each employee, however - just six months for each child. Thus, the six months could be divided between two adults in the household taking care of a new child - such as one parent taking two months and the other taking four months. Other funding options include property and sales taxes, or even requiring employers to contribute toward PFL. Governor Newsom has suggested that the PFL proposal may become part of a larger tax reform initiative in the state. Why it matters: The proposal is far from becoming new law, with Governor Newsom yet to release an estimate of the cost of the proposed increase. While many may agree with the idea of parents spending more time with their new child, resolving the issue of how to fund that increased time will be a central focus of many debates. Regardless, more and more private employers in California (and other states) are electing to provide more than the mandatory paid time off for parents to bond with their new children.By Christine M. Reilly[3], Leader, TCPA Compliance and Class Action Defense[4] | Kristin E. Haule[5], Associate, Litigation[6] Text messages confirming a plaintiff's hotel reservations\u2014that also encouraged the recipient to download the defendant's app\u2014were not advertising or marketing under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), a California federal court has ruled. On four separate occasions after booking travel on Agoda Company's website, plaintiff An Phan received a text message reading: 'Good news! Your Agoda booking [number] is confirmed. Manage your booking with our free app [link].' Phan filed a putative class action alleging the texts violated the TCPA. Agoda moved for summary judgment. The Singapore-based international travel service provider explained that Phan provided the required level of consent under the statute because the text messages he received did not contain advertising and were not telemarketing. Each time a customer books a reservation using the Agoda site, he or she agrees to certain terms and conditions, the defendant told the court, including 'to receive confirmation messages (email and/or SMS),' defined by the terms as 'transactional' and 'not part of the newsletters or marketing mails[] from which [users] can unsubscribe.' The messages received by Phan were merely transactional because they served two purposes, Agoda argued: to confirm that Phan's bookings were reserved with the third-party hotel and to direct him to the app, where he could locate and modify the booking prior to his stay. The business transaction between Agoda and Phan did not conclude until Phan completed his stay at the hotels he booked through Agoda, the defendant said. Phan countered that the business transaction was completed at the time of booking, rendering the app download link superfluous. The text messages were actually advertising, the plaintiff argued, and sent specifically to encourage use of the app, which allows users to undertake transactions having nothing to do with the original reservation. After reviewing relevant case law from the U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman determined that the text messages at issue were neither advertising nor telemarketing. 'Both the context and the content of the messages dictate this result,' the court said. 'As to the context, these messages were sent as part of an ongoing business transaction between Agoda and Phan. Phan used Agoda's services to book a travel itinerary online. Up until the time he finished his travel, he could cancel that booking or otherwise modify it through Agoda. As such, his transactional relationship with Agoda as to each booking continued through the time when he completed his travel.' This scenario 'is directly comparable' to that of Mackinnon v. Hof's Hut Restaurants, Inc.[7], the court said, where a plaintiff filed a TCPA suit against a restaurant. After Mackinnon made a dinner reservation, the restaurant sent a confirmation text message that included a link to the evening's dinner specials. The Mackinnon court concluded that the text was not advertising or marketing because although the reservation was booked, it was not completed until the plaintiff ate dinner at the restaurant. 'Even assuming Phan paid for his booking on Agoda's website at the time of booking (as opposed to at the time of travel), this fact does not change the Court's conclusion,' Judge Freeman added. 'Phan contracted with Agoda for the provision of travel accommodations; Agoda's obligations were only completed by its successfully providing those accommodations to Phan at the time of Phan's travel.' The content of the messages only reinforced the court's decision. 'The plain language of the text messages is limited to (1) confirming the booking (a purpose no court cited by Phan has found constitutes advertising or telemarketing); and (2) encouraging Phan to 'manage [his] booking' via the app,' the court said. 'These two purposes directly related to Phan's transaction with Agoda.' For support, the court cited Aderhold v. Car2go[8], Wick v. Twilio[9] and Daniel v. Five Stars Loyalty, Inc.[10], each of which focused on whether the text messages at issue were directly germane to the transaction. 'Here, the context and the content of the messages demonstrate that the purpose of the messages was not to advertise or telemarket, but instead was directly cabined to facilitating and completing an existing transaction,' Judge Freeman wrote. The inclusion of the link did not alter this analysis. Although the app may fairly be considered a product or service of Agoda, the messages 'simply cannot be said to advertise the commercial availability of this product or service under the law,' the court said. Instead, the app is readily analogized to Agoda's website, as the two platforms have substantially similar processes for booking travel and most (if not all) of the same functions, the court said. Even though the app contains certain promotions, it was included to facilitate, complete or confirm a commercial transaction, making the link to it fully germane to the transaction, the court said. 'Put simply, Agoda was not advertising the app's commercial availability,' Judge Freeman wrote. 'To hold otherwise would run headlong into the decisions in this Circuit and others holding that inclusion of the link to a defendant's website, without more, does not render a message advertising or telemarketing.' As the messages were not advertising or telemarketing, Agoda needed only Phan's express consent prior to sending the texts. With no dispute that Agoda obtained such consent because Phan voluntarily provided his phone number and agreed to the defendant's terms of use for its website, which made clear that such messages would be sent, the court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. To read the order in Phan v. Agoda Company Pte. Ltd., click here[11]. Why it matters: In another common sense decision, and relying heavily on precedent, the California court found that the text messages were sent as part of an ongoing business transaction between the parties and therefore, did not constitute advertising or telemarketing. The mere inclusion of a link to the defendant's app - which itself contained some promotional materials - did not impact the outcome. Critically, the text messages and inclusion of the linked app were made contemporaneously with and directly related to the ongoing transaction. Although not every jurisdiction agrees that a link to an app is not advertising or marketing, this decision is consistent with prior Ninth Circuit precedent that mere inclusion of a link, without more, is insufficient itself to transform an otherwise transactional text message into a marketing message. This decision is a helpful benchmark for those businesses in the Ninth Circuit who want to offer their customers the option of managing their transactions online or through an app.By Richard P. Lawson[12], Partner, Consumer Protection[13] The nation's capital joined the growing number of states regulating automatic renewal contracts when Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the new law into effect last month. Pursuant to the Structured Settlements and Automatic Renewal Protections Act of 2018, businesses using auto-renewal contracts are required to 'clearly and conspicuously' disclose both the auto-renewal provision and the cancellation procedure in the contract. If the contract has an initial term of 12 months or more that will automatically renew for a term of one month or more unless the consumer cancels the contract, the business must notify the consumer of the first automatic renewal and thereafter annually by first-class mail or email. If the consumer provides specific authorization to use another form of communication\u2014such as text message or app\u2014then notice can be provided that way. The notice itself must be sent to the consumer no fewer than 30 days and no more than 60 days before the cancellation deadline for the first automatic renewal. It also must clearly and conspicuously include several disclosures: the fact that unless the consumer cancels the contract, it will automatically renew; the cost of the goods or services for the term of the renewal; the deadline by which the consumer must cancel the contract to prevent automatic renewal; and the methods by which the consumer may obtain details of the automatic renewal provision and cancellation procedures. Active weblinks must be included if the notice is provided via email. Free trials with an automatically renewing contract attached are also covered by the new law. Notice of the auto-renewal must be given to consumers between one and seven days before the expiration of the free trial period, and the business must obtain the consumer's affirmative consent to the auto-renewal before charging the consumer, notwithstanding the consumer's consent to the free trial. A violation of the new law will render the automatic-renewal provision void, will terminate the contract at the end of the term in which the violation occurred, and will constitute a violation of the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act unless the business can demonstrate that it established and implemented written procedures to comply with the law, that its failure to comply was the result of a good faith mistake, and that the consumer received a credit for all amounts billed or a refund for all amounts paid due to the mistaken renewal. To read the new law, click here[14]. Why it matters: Regulation of automatic renewal contracts looks to be a hot trend in 2019, with the enactment of the Washington, D.C., law, recent updates to California's statute[15]and new legislation in Vermont[16]becoming effective on July 1, 2019.By Donna L. Wilson[17], Managing Partner-Elect, Leader, Privacy and Data Security[18] | Brandon P. Reilly[19], Counsel, Privacy and Data Security[20] In many ways, it was the year of data privacy. In this article, we identify five of the biggest trends in privacy and data security, including the mammoth European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) taking effect, the hurried passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the rapidly escalating political scrutiny emanating from revelations surrounding the 2016 election and social media accountability, and the new challenges raised by high-profile data breaches and emerging technology. 1. Omnibus privacy legislation becomes 'a thing' Far-reaching and industry-spanning privacy legislation finally matured in 2018. It is now a thing. After years of ramp-up and speculation as to its immediate impact, the GDPR finally became effective on May 25, 2018. Thus far, enforcement actions utilizing the GDPR's severe civil penalty provisions\u2014which include up to \u20ac20 million or 4 percent of a business's global annual turnover\u2014have been limited to data security incidents, including a \u20ac400,000 fine to a Portuguese hospital for granting broader-than-needed access to patient profiles and a \u20ac20,000 fine to a hacked German chat platform that failed to pseudonymize and encrypt sensitive information. European data protection authorities have signaled that enforcement actions for violations of the GDPR's non-breach-related provisions will ramp up shortly. Whether an American Big Tech firm will be hit with the massive, front-page penalty that many have prognosticated since May 25 remains to be seen. Also in May, Californians for Consumer Privacy (CCP), a relatively little-known consumer privacy rights group, submitted enough signatures to qualify the 'California Consumer Personal Information Disclosure and Sale Initiative' for the November 2018 ballot in California. In a last-ditch effort to force the initiative into legislative control\u2014and thus subjecting the law to a much easier threshold for later amendment\u2014the California legislature hurriedly drafted a bill that convinced the CCP to agree to drop the ballot measure. The result was the CCPA, passed on June 28, 2018. As many stakeholders in companies with consumers or employees in California are undoubtedly now aware, the CCPA adopts several GDPR concepts for the protection of data subjects, including the rights to ask a company what personal information it possesses on the consumer, to delete certain personal information and to opt out of any sales of personal information to third parties. The CCPA also implements a first-of-its-kind private right of action for data breaches that attaches civil penalties between $100 and $750 per consumer, per incident. Already the subject of an amendment, the law is expected to undergo additional amendments in the coming legislative sessions in Sacramento. It is currently set to go into effect between January 1 and July 1, 2020, varying by the provision and the date that the California Attorney General introduces implementing regulations. Other jurisdictions will continue the march toward comprehensive privacy protections. In August, for instance, Brazil passed its General Data Privacy Law, which reflects many GDPR concepts and is set to become effective in 2020. That same month, Indian legislators unveiled the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018, which attempts to combine elements of European, American and Chinese data protection regimes. 2. Privacy and security take their turn in the political spotlight The ongoing scrutiny of the role of social media in the 2016 presidential election promises to continue into 2019. These issues bring enough gravity that it is reasonable to conclude that privacy issues will never again be able to hide from the national spotlight. Scrutiny of Big Tech continued throughout 2018, with a number of major data breaches making headlines. In addition, the U.S. Congress convened several high-profile hearings in April and September in which Big Tech executives were grilled about privacy- and security-related issues. Several big data breaches also became front-page news. In April, the Federal Trade Commission revealed that a 2016 breach of Uber resulted in the exposure of personal information of more than 20 million people. The company agreed to a $148 million settlement with the attorneys general of all 50 states and the District of Columbia in September. In December, hotel chain Marriott disclosed a data breach exposing the information of up to 500 million people. The incident is notable not only for its size, but because it apparently emanated from Marriott's acquisition of the Starwood brand and its separate guest reservation system and, according to recent reports, investigators believe the incident is traceable to hackers working on behalf of the Chinese government. If there is anyone who doubts the sobering implications of the CCPA's new statutory penalties for data breaches, simply multiply the minimum penalty of $100 (or if you really want to scare yourself, the maximum of $750) by any of the above numbers and compare the resulting amount to the going rate for civil and regulatory settlements of alleged data breaches. The stakes for data breaches are about to be raised even higher. 3. States continue to expand existing protections Other states expanded the reach of their privacy and security protections as well, even if they have thus far declined to follow California's example of omnibus legislation. On September 4, 2018, the latest phase of the New York Department of Financial Services' (DFS) Cybersecurity Requirements took effect following the regulation's initial March 2017 implementation. The regulation represents perhaps the most sweeping cybersecurity regime in the nation, requiring covered entities to assess their specific risk profile and design programs ensuring information security, establish written cybersecurity policies, adopt encryption and monitoring mechanisms, and design audit trails allowing operational continuity in the event of a breach. By March 2019, these entities will also be expected to evaluate the risks presented by third-party data service providers. Cybersecurity legislation was passed also in Colorado and Ohio in 2018, with the latter jurisdiction providing a notable affirmative defense to breach allegations for companies that implement a recognized cybersecurity framework. State data breach laws also undertook a steady expansion of coverage last year. On June 1, 2018, Alabama\u2014the last state lacking such a law\u2014implemented its notice statute, which notably defines covered PII to include data types on the outer reaches of most notice statutes, such as information relating to medical history and health insurance. Meanwhile, Colorado joined Florida in adopting the most stringent notification deadline, requiring notification no later than 30 days after determining that a security breach has occurred. 4. Emerging tech scrambles pre-existing notions of privacy protection Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning. The Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain. If these concepts were not already in the popular lexicon, they are now. Together, these and other emerging technologies have already reshaped the debate over how best to secure personal information before the prior debate was anywhere near its conclusion. Real-world applications such as digital assistants, self-driving cars, cryptocurrency, facial recognition and data science have already demonstrated the bare minimum of what these technologies are capable of\u2014as well as the many challenging privacy implications presented. Understandably, lawmakers are well behind on legislating for such rapid innovation, but there was some progress in 2018. In May, Vermont passed a first-in-the-nation law to regulate data brokers, or businesses that knowingly sell or license the personal information of consumers with whom that business does not have a direct relationship. As of January 1, 2019, data brokers are required to register annually with the Vermont Secretary of State, disclose details regarding their identity and practices, and provide minimum information security requirements. In September, California passed the first state legislation addressing the security of IoT devices. Effective on January 1, 2020, the law mandates that manufacturers of connected devices follow reasonable security standards and require authentic access codes. It is enforceable by the California Attorney General. 5. A more regulated future awaits The conventional wisdom is that the developments described above may soon converge into a federal privacy law with pre-emptive power over the CCPA and similar state laws. In August, it was reported that several Silicon Valley companies were lobbying the Trump administration to begin outlining a federal privacy law that would pre-empt the CCPA. And there appears to be bipartisan agreement on the now-divided Capitol Hill that privacy legislation is necessary. The remaining question is: What will a successful bill look like? In little more than a month's time, we have already seen three examples of where we may be headed. On November 1, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Consumer Data Protection Act, which resembles the GDPR and turned heads by proposing up to 20 years in prison for executives responsible for misrepresentations in annual reports to the FTC. On November 6, Intel released a 6,000-word draft bill and online portal for further discussion that differs from the Wyden bill by protecting companies from civil actions and moving away from data minimization, among other things. Finally, on December 12, a group of 15 senators led by Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) introduced the Data Care Act, which is notable for, among other things, introducing a fiduciary duty for online service providers and allowing both the FTC and states to enforce privacy violations.By Anita L. Boomstein[21], Partner, Global Payments[22] | Donna L. Wilson[23], Managing Partner-Elect, Leader, Privacy and Data Security[24] | Brandon P. Reilly[25], Counsel, Privacy and Data Security[26] In state enforcement news, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced a settlement with a California-based payment services provider, while New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood reached a deal with five companies related to security vulnerabilities in their mobile apps. The Massachusetts action, which involved allegations that the company exposed the personal information of state residents, resulted in a $155,000 civil penalty, while the companies involved in the New York actions avoided a penalty but agreed to improve their security practices after the attorney general (AG) said they failed to keep sensitive user information secure when it was transmitted online. What happened The Massachusetts action began when the payment services provider notified the Attorney General's Office in 2015 that a data breach had occurred the prior year. An investigation by the AG revealed that while engineers for the payment services provider were modifying its website, they accidentally removed password protections from public-facing websites where users sign up for the company's service. The company stored the personal information of consumers, the AG said, including Social Security and bank account numbers as well as addresses and driver's license numbers. The mistake meant that any Internet user could view the data until August 2015, when the vulnerability was fixed. The investigation found that some employees of the company were aware of the vulnerability as early as August 2014 but neglected to fix it. An estimated 6,800 Massachusetts residents were impacted by the violation of state consumer protection and data security laws, Healey said. Pursuant to an assurance of discontinuance with the AG, the payment services provider agreed to pay $155,000, comply with state laws, and implement policies to improve the security of its systems and protect consumer data online (such as having a chief information security officer, training employees on data security, and assessing and updating information security policies related to changes to its systems and to external vulnerabilities). 'This company broke the law by failing to take immediate action when consumers' personal information was at risk,' Healey said in a statement about the action. 'Through our settlement, [the payment services provider] will pay a penalty and take significant steps to safeguard the personal information of customers.' In the New York actions, AG Barbara Underwood settled with five companies whose mobile apps failed to secure user information transmitted over the Internet. To protect consumers using Wi-Fi networks to connect their mobile devices to the Internet, mobile web browsers and apps use a security protocol known as Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a secure, encrypted connection online, the AG explained. To establish the secure connection, the mobile device must verify the computer's identity by authenticating a security certificate. If an app fails to properly authenticate the identity, it becomes vulnerable to a 'man-in-the-middle attack,' where a third party can intercept and view any information transmitted between the mobile device and the app. App developers can use freely available software to test their apps for this well-known vulnerability. The five companies offered free mobile apps that required users to enter information including an email address and a credit card number. According to the AG, although the companies represented to users that they used reasonable security measures to protect consumer data, they failed to test their apps for this common and known vulnerability, and certain versions of their apps neglected to properly authenticate the security certificates. 'As a result, an attacker could have impersonated the companies' servers and intercepted information entered into the app by the user,' according to Underwood. 'With this information, an attacker could commit various forms of identity theft and fraud, including credit card fraud.' The New York Office of the Attorney General uncovered the vulnerabilities found in the five apps after testing them as part of an initiative to find security problems before a data breach occurs. The settlement agreements require each of the companies to implement comprehensive security programs to protect user information from future potential attacks.

Why it matters: 'Businesses that make security promises to their users\u2014especially as it relates to personal information\u2014have a duty to keep those promises,' AG Underwood said in a statement. 'My office is committed to holding businesses accountable and [ensuring] they protect users' personal information from hackers.' The actions by these two state AGs demonstrate the continuing efforts that states have been pursuing to stem data security and privacy violations.

With COVID-19 and the risk that banknotes could be infected, digital payment solutions are increasingly top of mind and what citizens want.</p><p>A major vulnerability today is that depositors could lose their deposits due to risks taken by commercial banks on their funds. Not all countries offer deposit insurance and therefore are not protecting their citizens. Citizens have no choice but to use a commercial bank for their financial needs. If the commercial bank goes into liquidation, the depositors might not get their funds back.</p><p>My concern is that central banks are so worried about protecting the commercial banks that they are not realising that the risk of inaction is greater than innovation on a gradual basis. The real risk is coming from the private companies that are in the process of issuing payment mechanisms that might entice depositors to never again have to use a legacy bank as we currently know them.</p><p>A move to a private digital currency or 'stablecoin' (currency collateralised by fiat, cryptocurrencies, gold, or an algorithm or combination of financial instruments) could result in less use of fiat currency (currency issued by a central bank). Once this takes place, central banks will lose their ability to affect monetary policy and all their supply and distribution controls of the fiat currency will go out of the window.</p><p>In this time of pandemic that we are all facing, we should not have to ask people to stand in a line, without social distancing, to wait to be paid their social grant or pension funds. If an economic crisis requires that the government financially support its citizens in the form of helicopter money (money deposited by the government into the citizens' accounts), citizens should not have to wait for government-issued cheques to arrive in the post, which then have to be deposited in a bank account when the banks' working hours permit. Blockchain technology enables these payments to be facilitated electronically in real time, directly into the e-wallet of the citizens. No more waiting or standing in line or walking to a bank or post office to be paid by the government. No one should ever have to visit a brick and mortar branch and wait to be served.</p><p>In many countries, the dependence on cash puts undue pressure on citizens who have no option but to risk carrying cash and being robbed. Not to mention a variety of other threats surrounding cash usage such as ATM bombings and hijackings. These threats should motivate central banks to go totally electronic and reduce citizens' dependency on cash.</p><p>BLOCKCHAIN SPECIALIST</p><p>MONICA SINGER CA(SA)</p><p>Blockchain Evangelist for Consensys</p><p>CBDC-WHY NOT?</p><p>Blockchain technology is immutable, auditable, and programmable so it can be adapted to the different needs of financial institutions and citizens in different nations, while still meeting global standards that ensure interoperability between different countries' CBDC solutions.</p><p>Central banks should innovate and level the playing field for their current customers, so commercial banks can compete head-on with the technology companies that have come into this space. To rely on regulation to prevent private coin issuers from operating is not the solution. Big Tech will stop at nothing to ensure that they comply with legislation to offer this service.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ACCTSA-2432845634</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ACCTSAAugust 2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K8-0JV1-JBHT-D3HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315772</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright August 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright August 2020 South African Institute of Chartered Accountants Aug 2020</copyright><publicationName>Accountancy SA</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 02587254</issn><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

We are here to help.</p><p>RILA joins a slew of companies, including Oracle, Yelp, Tripadvisor and News Corp., that have raised concerns about competitive harm from dominant technology platforms. The retailers group has already laid out its views on competition issues to the House Judiciarys antitrust subcommittee, which is investigating the technology industry, Ahrens said.</p><p>The group wrote a letter to the FTC dated Sunday, arguing that the tech platforms create an information bottleneck that has the power to skew markets and circumvent the traditional power of price competition.</p><p>RILA also raised concerns about how tech companies may compromise the brands of retailers, favor their own products over sellers on their platforms, accumulate data about competitors and allow for the proliferation of counterfeit goods.</p><p>It should be quite concerning to the commission that Amazon and Google control the majority of all internet product search, and can very easily affect whether and how price and product information actually reaches consumers, the trade group said in a letter responding to a series of hearings the agency held on competition policy.</p><p>Representatives for Amazon and Google didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The FTC has claimed oversight of probes of Facebook and Amazon, while the Justice Department is set to scrutinize Google and Apple, Bloomberg has reported. Separately, the House Judiciarys antitrust subcommittee kicked off a broad antitrust investigation into the technology industry last month with a hearing on how Google and Facebook have affected the news industry.</p><p>RILA said it agrees with sentiments echoed by Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Departments antitrust division, and more than 40 attorneys general, that prices shouldnt be the sole measure of harm.</p><p>Its the combination of information control and market power that should worry antitrust regulators the most, the letter said. That unhealthy combination exists at the level of the internets pipelines, at the level of product search, in webhosting, on social media platforms and elsewhere.</p><p>The group also pointed to Amazons perceived dominance of e-commerce, where it has nearly 50% of U.S. online sales. Since its both a retailer and a marketplace for third-party sellers, Amazon has drawn scrutiny over whether it uses its clout and huge amount of sales data to give itself a leg up over smaller vendors - an issue the EU is already investigating and which prompted calls by 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren to break up the online retailer and other tech platforms.</p><p>Amazon claims it actually only holds a small percentage of the total retail market in the U.S. and faces formidable competition from the likes of Walmart.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/07/12/google-gives-social-networking-another-try-with-new-shoelace-app/\">Google gives social networking another try with new Shoelace app     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/07/11/whos-listening-to-google-assistant-you-might-be-surprised/\">        Whos listening to Google Assistant?

We are here to help.</p><p>RILA joins a slew of companies, including Oracle, Yelp, Tripadvisor and News Corp., that have raised concerns about competitive harm from dominant technology platforms. The retailers group has already laid out its views on competition issues to the House Judiciarys antitrust subcommittee, which is investigating the technology industry, Ahrens said.</p><p>The group wrote a letter to the FTC dated Sunday, arguing that the tech platforms create an information bottleneck that has the power to skew markets and circumvent the traditional power of price competition.</p><p>RILA also raised concerns about how tech companies may compromise the brands of retailers, favor their own products over sellers on their platforms, accumulate data about competitors and allow for the proliferation of counterfeit goods.</p><p>It should be quite concerning to the commission that Amazon and Google control the majority of all internet product search, and can very easily affect whether and how price and product information actually reaches consumers, the trade group said in a letter responding to a series of hearings the agency held on competition policy.</p><p>Representatives for Amazon and Google didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The FTC has claimed oversight of probes of Facebook and Amazon, while the Justice Department is set to scrutinize Google and Apple, Bloomberg has reported. Separately, the House Judiciarys antitrust subcommittee kicked off a broad antitrust investigation into the technology industry last month with a hearing on how Google and Facebook have affected the news industry.</p><p>RILA said it agrees with sentiments echoed by Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Departments antitrust division, and more than 40 attorneys general, that prices shouldnt be the sole measure of harm.</p><p>Its the combination of information control and market power that should worry antitrust regulators the most, the letter said. That unhealthy combination exists at the level of the internets pipelines, at the level of product search, in webhosting, on social media platforms and elsewhere.</p><p>The group also pointed to Amazons perceived dominance of e-commerce, where it has nearly 50% of U.S. online sales. Since its both a retailer and a marketplace for third-party sellers, Amazon has drawn scrutiny over whether it uses its clout and huge amount of sales data to give itself a leg up over smaller vendors - an issue the EU is already investigating and which prompted calls by 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren to break up the online retailer and other tech platforms.</p><p>Amazon claims it actually only holds a small percentage of the total retail market in the U.S. and faces formidable competition from the likes of Walmart.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/12/google-gives-social-networking-another-try-with-new-shoelace-app/\">Google gives social networking another try with new Shoelace app     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/11/whos-listening-to-google-assistant-you-might-be-surprised/\">        Whos listening to Google Assistant?

Indeed, retail leaders comment to ask for more competition, not less. But all competition must be on a fair and level playing field.</p><p>With assistance from Ben Brody and David McLaughlin</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-6180234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SJMRCN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG9-6YS1-JCX4-60WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Apple itself is a member of RILA.<br/> \"The pro-consumer story for platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon is that, while the companies wield enormous power on the 'seller' or 'advertising' side of their platforms, consumers benefit with free or very low-cost products or services on the other. But it is worth observing how the quality of these products and services have degraded as these companies have shifted from fierce competitors to dominant monopolists,\" RILA COO Brian Dodge write in <br/><br/><br/> The group closed the letter by offering to help the FTC in reviewing antitrust complaints in light of modern retail practices.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) which will require common-sense disclosures and accountability from big tech platforms like Amazon.com who increasingly sell products from third party sellers on their websites. The bill is designed to provide consumers with greater transparency by requiring online marketplaces to simply verify a seller's information and for the seller to provide contact information to consumers. This legislation will hold big tech marketplaces accountable for fraudulent transactions and allow law enforcement to better identify high-frequency sellers suspected of trafficking stolen and counterfeit goods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Consumers continue to buy items online in record numbers, and that shift has exposed a growing and dangerous trend that must be dealt with immediately-the exponential growth of stolen and counterfeit goods sold through online marketplaces,\" said RILA Senior Executive Vice President for Public Affairs Michael Hanson \"The INFORM Consumers Act provides a measured response to this problem by requiring online marketplaces to verify information about the sellers on their platform.\"</p><p>Retailers have seen a dramatic increase in organized retail crime (ORC) in recent years, with career criminals targeting stores with alarming frequency, and in many cases, escalating levels of violence. This is because perpetrators, often organized and coordinated to target multiple retailers, are increasingly turning to online marketplaces to move large quantities of stolen merchandise.</p><p>A report released earlier this year by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) underscored the growing problem of counterfeit goods sold on marketplace platforms, highlighting the need for Congress and regulators to do more to hold sellers and the platforms accountable when fake or illicit products are sold to unsuspecting consumers.</p><p>\"Big tech marketplace platforms have their place in an increasingly diverse and digital economy, connecting legitimate sellers-often small businesses-to a large and growing pool of online shoppers,\" said Hanson. \"But their growth cannot be a golden ticket for criminal rings targeting legitimate businesses and innocent consumers.\"</p><p>\"The continued anonymity and unregulated environment in which these platforms operate have made them a stage to sell products that would never be allowed on a store shelf,\" said Hanson. \"Stolen goods, expired and defective products, products made with unsafe levels of chemical substances, and products that do not meet U.S. quality and safety standards are often deceptively marketed and sold though these platforms.\"</p><p>Tackling the sale of counterfeit and stolen goods is a top priority for leading retailers, but it will require the tech community to step up and do their part.</p><p>\"Large marketplace platforms employ some of the most sophisticated data scientists and logistics professionals in the world, and it is clear the know how exists to identify and crack down on these illegitimate sales,\" said Hanson. \"It's time these companies use their considerable resources and savvy to verify their sellers and shut down criminal elements and fraudsters that are using their platforms as a pipeline for unloading stolen and counterfeit goods.\"</p><p>\"We're pleased to partner with government and other retailers to keep online marketplaces accountable for the products sold on their sites. We believe this is an important step in preventing the sale of counterfeit and stolen items to customers who believe they are buying legitimate products,\" said Scott Glenn, VP of Asset Protection, The Home Depot.</p><p>\"The lack of transparency and accountability in today's digital marketplaces has contributed to the rapid rise of organized retail crime, which has become one of the top challenges facing the retail industry today. Walgreens strongly supports Congresswoman Schakowsky's INFORM Consumers Act, which complements the bipartisan Senate bill introduced earlier this year to require online marketplaces to verify high-volume sellers, remove incentives for retail theft and help make our communities safer. Now, more than ever, consumers deserve to know who they are buying products from online, in order to make safe and informed purchasing decisions for themselves and their families,\" said Alex Gourlay, Co-Chief Operating Officer Walgreens Boots Alliance, and President, Walgreens.</p><p>Source: Retail Industry Leaders Association</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDRNW-0053946333</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDRNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60F2-1SY1-JB5M-W4TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373678</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Retail News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

The WSJ found that Amazon's marketplace carried products that \"big box retailers' policies would bar from their shelves.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, RILA submitted comments to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) outlining retailers' concerns with the ability of big tech companies to control product information, prices, and quality, and the negative impact this can have on consumers, writing:</p><p>\"If the digital interface masks or obfuscates the true identity of the seller, or leaves the misimpression that an item is new and from the manufacturer, or falsely implies that a knock-off item is just like the option from a well-known brand, consumers (as well as regulators and enforcers) have no ability to uncover the truth until after their purchase. That harms consumers who do not get what they were looking for, and may not even realize it because the provenance or nature of their item has been obscured by the very information source through which they sought out the item in the first place.\"</p><p>Today, the Wall Street Journal confirmed retailers' concerns, reporting:</p><p>\"A Wall Street Journal investigation found 4,152 items for sale on Amazon.com Inc.'s site that have been declared unsafe by federal agencies, are deceptively labeled or are banned by federal regulators-items that big-box retailers' policies would bar from their shelves. Among those items, at least 2,000 listings for toys and medications lacked warnings about health risks to children.\"</p><p>RILA and its members continue to urge the FTC to examine competition and consumer protection in the modern economy and take the next steps with investigations and actions against companies that are deceptively selling products that are counterfeit, compromised, or in any way harmful to American consumers.</p><p>RILA is the US trade association for leading retailers. We convene decision-makers, advocate for the industry, and promote operational excellence and innovation. Our aim is to elevate a dynamic industry by transforming the environment in which retailers operate.</p><p>RILA members include more than 200 retailers, product manufacturers, and service suppliers, which together account for more than $1.5 trillion in annual sales, millions of American jobs, and more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing facilities, and distribution centers domestically and abroad.</p><p>Source: Retail Industry Leaders Association</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDRNW-0049181333</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDRNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWJ-N4R1-DXMP-K404-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373678</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"452\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Retail News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 23, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

The WSJ found that Amazon's marketplace carried products that \"big box retailers' policies would bar from their shelves.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, RILA submitted comments to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) outlining retailers' concerns with the ability of big tech companies to control product information, prices, and quality, and the negative impact this can have on consumers, writing:</p><p>\"If the digital interface masks or obfuscates the true identity of the seller, or leaves the misimpression that an item is new and from the manufacturer, or falsely implies that a knock-off item is just like the option from a well-known brand, consumers (as well as regulators and enforcers) have no ability to uncover the truth until after their purchase. That harms consumers who do not get what they were looking for, and may not even realize it because the provenance or nature of their item has been obscured by the very information source through which they sought out the item in the first place.\"</p><p>Today, the Wall Street Journal confirmed retailers' concerns, reporting:</p><p>\"A Wall Street Journal investigation found 4,152 items for sale on Amazon.com Inc.'s site that have been declared unsafe by federal agencies, are deceptively labeled or are banned by federal regulators--items that big-box retailers' policies would bar from their shelves. Among those items, at least 2,000 listings for toys and medications lacked warnings about health risks to children.\"</p><p>RILA and its members continue to urge the FTC to examine competition and consumer protection in the modern economy and take the next steps with investigations and actions against companies that are deceptively selling products that are counterfeit, compromised, or in any way harmful to American consumers.</p><p>* * *</p><p>RILA is the US trade association for leading retailers. We convene decision-makers, advocate for the industry, and promote operational excellence and innovation. Our aim is to elevate a dynamic industry by transforming the environment in which retailers operate.</p><p>RILA members include more than 200 retailers, product manufacturers, and service suppliers, which together account for more than $1.5 trillion in annual sales, millions of American jobs, and more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing facilities, and distribution centers domestically and abroad.</p><p>[Category: Business]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6832736 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6832736</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWJ-V221-JC11-1401-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"455\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 23, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It's probably not even in the top 10. But given the outsized role that tech companies now play, it's time to focus on the ethical responsibilities of the technologists who help shape our lives.</p><p><br/>In a recent talk, technologist <url normalizedValue=\"http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm\">Maciej Ceglowski argued</url>that \"[t]his year especially there's an uncomfortable feeling in the tech industry that we did something wrong, that in following our credo of 'move fast and break things,' some of what we knocked down were the load-bearing walls of our democracy.\"<br/>This was not unforeseeable-or even unforeseen. In 2014, for example, in an article titled \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tarun-wadhwa/how-facebook-is-shaping-w_b_6201652.html\">How Facebook Is Shaping Who Will Win the Next Election</url>,\" Tarun Wadhwa cited a study published in 2012: \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/nature11421.html\">A 61-Milion-Person Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobilization</url>.\" The study's authors reported on  \"a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people.\"<br/>So we already knew that tools for \"maximizing engagement\" can shape the political sphere.  In 2014, Wadhwa concluded, \"Whether it wants this responsibility or not, Facebook has now become an integral part of the democratic process globally.\"<br/>We also know that technology can be harmful to our democracy. Privacy invasions and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/04/google-democracy-truth-internet-search-facebook\">algorithmic manipulation</url>, for example, can limit the ability to research and formulate opinions, and then in turn affect how people express views-even via voting. When companies implement practices that are good for targeted advertising but bad for individuals' democratic engagement (like, for example, the practices involved in the use of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/the-secret-agenda-of-a-facebook-quiz.html?_r=0\">\"dark posts\" on Facebook</url>, tied to the creation of psychological profiles for hundreds of millions of Facebook users in the U.S.), the benefits-versus-harms balance tilts pretty sharply.<br/>Who minds that balance?<br/>You often hear the adage that law can't keep up with technology. What about ethics? Ethics, too, is deliberative, and new norms take some time to develop; but an initial ethical analysis of a new development or practice can happen fairly quickly. Many technologists, however, are not encouraged to conduct that analysis, even superficially. They are not even taught to spot an ethical issue-and some (though certainly not all) seem surprised when backlash ensues against some of their creations. (See, for example, the critical coverage of the now-defunct Google Buzz, or more recent reaction to, say, \"Hello Barbie.\")<br/>A growing chorus has argued that we need a code of ethics for technologists. That's a start, but we need more than that. If technology can mold us, and technologists are the ones who shape that technology, we should demand some level of ethics training for technologists. And that training should not be limited to the university context; an ethics training component should also be included in the curriculum of any developer \"bootcamp,\" and maybe in the onboarding process when tech companies hire new employees.  <br/>Such training would not inoculate technologists against making unethical decisions-nothing can do that, and in some situations we may well reach no consensus on what the ethical action is. Such training, however, would prepare them to make more thoughtful decisions when confronted, say, with ethical dilemmas that involve conflicts between competing goods. It would help them make choices that better reflect their own values.<br/>Sometimes, we need consumers and regulators to push back against Big Tech. But in his talk titled \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm\">Build a Better Monster: Morality, Machine Learning, and Mass Surveillance,</url>\" Maciej Ceglowski argues that \"[t]he one effective lever we have against tech companies is employee pressure. Software engineers are difficult to hire, expensive to train, and take a long time to replace.\" If he is right, then tech employees might have even more power than people realized-or at least an additional kind of power they can wield. All the more reason why we should demand that technologists get at least some ethics training and recognize their role in defending democracy.<br/>I work in an applied ethics center, and we do believe that technology can help democracy (we offer a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethics-app/\">free ethical-decision-making app</url>, for example; we even offer a MOOC-a free online course-on ethical campaigning!). For it to do that, though, we need people who are ready to tackle the ethical questions-both within and outside of tech companies.<br/><br/>This article is part of a collaboration with the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.<br/>Read       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/rethinking-ethics-training-in-silicon-valley/525456/\">Rethinking Ethics Training in Silicon Valley</url> on theatlantic.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-rethinkingethicstraininginsiliconvalley525456</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NMX-P451-DYY9-J2DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

In this excerpt from the Finance Friday webinar, BizNews editor Jackie Cameron discusses retirement annuities with Heystek, who stresses that there is a crisis developing for people who rely on the traditional methods to fund their retirement \u2013 because the instrument that they\u2019re using is busy failing them. To address this crisis, Heystek recommends that, the minute you are over 55, seriously consider getting your money into a  where you can get a 100% . Also of interest, Heystek notes that if he had some spare cash, he\u2019d be buying physical gold. These and a host of other financial issues are picked up on in the BizNews Finance Friday webinar. \u2013 Nadya Swart    Hello everybody, welcome to the BizNews Finance Friday webinar. With me today, I\u2019ve got Magnus Heystek, an independent financial advisor. Magnus, I see you\u2019ve won another award this week.    Well, thank you very much for mentioning that Jackie. Yes, it\u2019s just like the Oscars in the investment world \u2013 the Intellidex Annual Wealth Manager Awards of the Year. And you\u2019ve got two categories: one for the big guys and one for the boutique guys, where we play in, and I\u2019m glad to say we won the best Boutique Wealth Manager of the Year Award. Thank you very much.    Well, congratulations. We\u2019ve had a lot of questions on retirement annuities over the last couple of weeks, and you\u2019ve produced some very interesting graphs here. I wonder if we can just quickly talk through those before we kick off with some of the questions?      Well, just some background there: retirement annuities and pension funds, preservation funds are bound by  \u2013 so they can only get 30% offshore. The balance has to be in the local market, and that\u2019s been the case since 2011. As a result of the poor performance of our local equity market, that has been having a major impact on the growth rates of the traditional retirement annuities or, in fact, all retirement annuities.    And I just took this out as an example \u2013 I\u2019m not picking on anybody, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not publishing the name. But there is a retirement annuity fund of one of the insurance companies where \u2013 after five years \u2013 relative to inflation, you\u2019re down 50%. You\u2019ve made no money in five years. In fact, you\u2019ve lost 5% of your money over a five year period. And you can go through all of the returns \u2013 some are better. This is probably the worst one I\u2019ve seen.      So, there\u2019s a little bit of a crisis developing in people who rely on the traditional methods to fund their retirement \u2013 that graph shows it very clearly. So, there has been no growth, and in fact, you\u2019re down 30%. And that is starting to become a major talking point. People are questioning their RAs. They\u2019re demanding answers and they\u2019re demanding returns. And this is affecting a lot of people in their retirement.    Their retirement projections from five or 10 years ago are out by about 30 to 40% in real terms. And that \u2013 combined with the Covid collapse and the bad property market \u2013 means that most people are now severely underfunded \u2013 not because they haven\u2019t been putting money in. It is because the instrument that they\u2019re using is busy failing them and you can clearly see that.   Really frightening because we\u2019ve been encouraged to invest in RAs, you know, from the day we start working \u2013 we\u2019re encouraged to set aside money because there\u2019s a tax incentive. What do people do with their money in an RA? Isn\u2019t it stuck?    They can change the asset allocation. And when I say this, and I\u2019ve been saying this for a while, if this doesn\u2019t change, cash is not a bad way to protect your money or even bonds. But we need to change Regulation 28. We need more offshore.    And if you\u2019re over 55, there are other ways to get more offshore exposure by actually pulling out your money, getting your tax free portion into your pocket and then reallocating your funds into more offshore or better performing funds.    But this is quite severe: if you look at the performance of the large pension funds (not as bad as this), but I get guys who send me their pension fund statements \u2013 and they haven\u2019t made money in five years. And the media doesn\u2019t talk about it: they are either under-resourced or they\u2019re too scared to talk about it. But we need to talk about it. There\u2019s a massive crisis in retirement funding developing for the middle class to upper class in our society.    It\u2019s been suggested that we should look for a nimble asset manager. I don\u2019t see too many of those at the moment, but perhaps you could name some.    The decision as to the asset allocation depends on the financial advisor \u2013 that has to be more nimble \u2013 or the owner of the product. When you\u2019re in a fund and it\u2019s not performing, the fund manager has got no responsibility towards you. That fund manager must merely stick to the mandate of the fund, and a lot of clients don\u2019t fully understand this. They often say: \u2018But why don\u2019t the fund managers change their investment strategy?\u2019 You have to explain to them that the fund manager is beholden to a specific mandate, which is in the fun fact sheets or the document, and they will invest according to their mandate.    You, as an investor \u2013 and more importantly, your advisor \u2013 is the one that needs to be nimble and is going to find those funds. There are a number of smaller funds that have done very well. You\u2019ve got to go and find them and then put your clients into that if you\u2019re allowed to do that. So, it\u2019s more a reflection on the advisory industry \u2013 that they just tell their clients: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s long term, don\u2019t panic. It\u2019ll come right.\u2019 The more independent advisors, I would suggest, are the ones who get involved and say: \u2018No, no, no \u2013 let\u2019s change it because it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u2019   Thank you. So we\u2019ve got a question here from James who asks if it is possible to transfer a closed RA from provider to provider? He says: \u2018I have two from a previous employer, which I would like to move and merge.\u2019 Is that possible, Magnus?    Yes, it is. It\u2019s a bit of a cumbersome process, and I think it\u2019s called a Section 37 transfer \u2013 a lot of paperwork, there might be some slight penalties involved. But yes, you can move it. I\u2019ve done it with my own RA\u2019s, for instance, moving it from the big ones to a much smaller and nimble fund. And then I can choose my own funds, and I\u2019ve done far better than with the old style.    And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll also be recommending to our clients: that the minute you are over 55 \u2013 seriously consider getting your money into a living annuity where you can get a 100% offshore allocation. As an example, my living annuity returned 37% in the last year. Our stock market has given you zero.    So, people need to get involved in their pension funds, retirement annuity funds and speak to an independent financial advisor.   Great, thank you, and then Zukiso says: \u2018Why are advisors reluctant to recommend ETFs and index tracking unit trusts? Magnus, what is your view on ETFs and unit trusts?    We use increasingly more and more ETFs, especially on the offshore side. I mean, our Global Equity Fund is 100% ETFs \u2013 using  and  \u2013 and you can get them very, very cheaply. My stress is on the world independent. I think a lot of the tied agents, the embedded agents, are forced to recommend their high cost products to their clients \u2013 for obvious reasons.    And, as independents, we get paid by our clients, we don\u2019t get paid by anybody else but our clients. And they are very much sensitive about pricing and costs, and they\u2019re not stupid. And then you try and sell them a very expensive product \u2013 they will walk away. So, we\u2019ve been using it for a very long time.    A lot of questions coming through are about what an independent financial adviser is. So, how do you actually know if you\u2019re in the hands of an independent financial advisor? What are the questions you ask?    I think the regulatory bodies are also trying to define clearly who is a tied agent \u2013 when they work for a certain company and they have to now declare: I work for X, Y, Z company and I can only give you advice on that company\u2019s products. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but you have to declare it.    The second one is the independent agents who are not in that restricted space. They can go out and they can offer virtually any product on the market. And they are then allowed to say: I am an independent financial advisor, which is a really good thing because a lot of people have been walking around saying: \u2018I\u2019m independent, independent!\u2019 But you end up placing all of your business with one company, which is dishonest in many ways.    Jonathan says financial advisors charge a fee, whether you make a gain or not and he has a large problem with this. However, he says he would rather pay an extra percentage on performance. This is a win-win agreement, he says. What do you think, Magnus, about performance fees?    There\u2019s no real merit in that argument, and we get people from time to time saying: \u2018Well, the funds have gone down, but you\u2019re still taking a fee.\u2019 I mean, yeah, you even have it with asset managers, who will take a performance fee, although they\u2019ve lost money, but they have outperformed the benchmark which determines whether they can take fees or not. So, it\u2019s a slightly tricky question.    You can agree with your advisors. Say: \u2018Listen, I\u2019ll pay you a higher percentage performance fee, we\u2019ll set the benchmark and a year or two later \u2013 you two will sit down and work it out.\u2019 And if we had done it in our practice, we would have made far more money, but it\u2019s a very complex calculation to do for every single client. To work out: what was the benchmark, what was the out-performance, what was the percentage fee.    Worldwide, most people \u2013 90% to 95% of IFA practices are very happy for you to pay a fee based on the growth of the assets. They realise that markets can go down and they\u2019re not going to blame the advisor and say: \u2018I\u2019m not going to pay you, because there was a Covid-market crash or there was a 2008 crash. Most advisors or most clients understand that and they\u2019re willing to pay for that.    You often get people that say: \u2018Just do an assessment of all my stuff, pay me an amount and I\u2019ll pay you an amount of money.\u2019 And we do that: we send them a bill like a lawyer \u2013 and they\u2019ll either go away or come back.    It\u2019s quite interesting because you obviously do a lot of work behind the scenes and people don\u2019t necessarily think about that when they pay for their advice. Julian has this question, which touches on the first slide that you showed us. He wants to know why the local equity markets have performed so badly when the top 40 companies seem to earn the bulk of their earnings from offshore assets ?   That\u2019s a little bit of a fallacy \u2013 that they earn the bulk. It\u2019s true to a certain extent, there\u2019s about 30% of companies who earn most of their assets or their earnings offshore. But remember, they are still bound or exposed to local market conditions.    I\u2019ll give you a mine as an example, a gold mine: it produces gold, sends it offshore and it gets paid. But \u2013 it has electricity issues, it has labour issues, it has infrastructure issues. And that is a long, long argument, but in a nutshell \u2013 the macro-economic environment in South Africa in the last five years has been horrendous.    So whether you export stuff and get paid in dollars, your costs relative to your competitor in the United States and in Canada is much higher in many cases. So, you might be competing in the same space, but your competitor is making R10 profit per unit, but you\u2019re only making R5 profit per unit \u2013 because of electricity or labour or water or whatever the issue is.    So, the investment industry has gone out selling the idea that the top 40 is mostly offshore. It\u2019s simply not true. You can look at the performance of the top 40 relative to the  (or any index). Our local macroeconomic situation has pulled us quite down, and if you strip , for instance, out of our market performance and you look at the mid caps and the small caps \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s been a bloodbath as far as profitability is concerned.    So, our market has been driven downwards by two things, in my view. First of all, there\u2019s been a flood of foreign capital flowing out of the market since 2013 and the graph shows it. And secondly, our profitability of listed companies on the JSE as a percentage of GDP has been declining from about 11 to 12%, down to about 6%.    Now, that\u2019s a horrible decline and that\u2019s why our companies are where they are on the market. It\u2019s been driven downwards by real things, profitability and the foreign money, which has been boosting our market for a long time, has just gone elsewhere. And correctly, they\u2019ve gone elsewhere because they\u2019ve made phenomenal money in the US and technology and in other parts of the world. So, that\u2019s why our market is so down and hence our performance is so poor.    Henry asks: \u2018How can I get access to the Vanguard ETFs without transferring my funds overseas first? Is there a way?\u2019     The Vanguard is just not listed on the local market, but you can get equivalent funds via Sygnia, which launched a couple of very exciting and low cost funds that are doing exceptionally well in the fourth industrial revolution. The fans of the S&amp;P 500, and they\u2019ve launched that OSI fund, which is quite exciting.    So, I think you\u2019ve got enough equivalent products with Satrix, with Sygnia, with Easy Equities. You will find them in here. If you want Vanguard, specifically, you need to remit your money into dollars and go and buy on an offshore platform.   Which brings us to Hein\u2019s question or observation. He says that direct overseas investments tend to be prohibitively expensive. What do you think the minimum amount of money is that you need to have to make offshore investing viable from a cost perspective?   It\u2019s a function of two things. First of all, the offshore investment companies and platforms in particular have always demanded a certain minimum dollar amount, whether it\u2019s $10,000 or $15,000. But because the rand has dropped so much \u2013 I mean, 10 years ago you could buy $10,000 with R60,000 \u2013 now it\u2019s going to cost you R180,000.    So, it\u2019s a function of the rand that has dropped and the offshore companies \u2013 because of the fairly large amount of admin to do (money laundering checking and all that kind of stuff) \u2013 do not deal with small amounts of money. And they also don\u2019t deal with debit order stuff like we\u2019re used to in South Africa.    So that seems to make it more expensive, but it\u2019s not if you actually analyse the cost structures of offshore funds, especially ETFs. It\u2019s actually on par, if not cheaper than in South Africa.    Thank you. Now, Peter is asking you to look into your crystal ball and he wants to know if you think there is a global market correction in the near future when earnings are declared post-Covid? You don\u2019t have a crystal ball, Magnus, but what are you sort of reading from trends?   There\u2019s no point wasting your time trying to predict markets, because you will get it wrong. And all around the world, you\u2019ve been very, very smart guys \u2013 much smarter than myself \u2013 also trying to predict market crashes every day. And you get these things in your inbox every day: markets are crashing, markets are crashing. You just ignore them, because you do not know.    Who would have said that in the middle of April this year \u2013 with this Covid pandemic exploding on the front pages and people are dying and companies are being shut down \u2013 that that would be the turning point of a fantastic bull market since the beginning of April. Some sectors are up 50%. Some are up 100%. It made fools of most analysts and predictions.    I look at valuations and I look at trends, and there are certain sectors of the world economy making buckets of money at the moment, including biotech. You have seen all the big tech companies reporting their results: Facebook has come through, Amazon has come through. So, make sure that you\u2019re exposed to that market. Avoid sectors that are being punished like property and shipping and tourism and airlines and that kind of stuff. But to these markets is an absolute waste of time.    Thank you. Bruce says he knows your view on Allan Gray and Orbis funds and wants to know if he should hang on after ten years of underperformance. Maybe you could just update our attendees on your view on those funds, because not everybody knows your previous points about those funds. And, of course, your view might have changed.    You know, my views are just commentary that, you know, here is a fund that is highly rated \u2013 no doubt. It has been around for a very long time. It is humungously big. But for 10 years, it has not beaten it\u2019s benchmark. And in the last five years, substantially so.    Yet, and I sense this is a South African thing, South African advisors are just chucking money at Allan Gray / Orbis on the basis that it\u2019s a brand name company, so people or the investors don\u2019t really question the merits. They go: \u2018That\u2019s fine, Allan Gray is fantastic.\u2019 As opposed to me coming to them with a company called Table Top Investments, and it\u2019s got a great record, but it doesn\u2019t have that public appeal and people don\u2019t talk about it.    It\u2019s just a commentary on the investment industry itself, where sometimes investors fall into the trap of brand name investing and not worrying about the returns. Whereas, when you come to a client and say you\u2019ve got this other fund, it might be a smaller fund, it is doing fantastically well \u2013 which one do you want? They\u2019ll take the Allan Gray fund. It\u2019s just great marketing on the part of Allan Gray.    If you have money in it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll pull it out, but I will also build other funds around it: more specialist funds, more momentum-driven funds. It\u2019s a value style investing and value style has been out of favour since 2010 \u2013 around about there \u2013 and quite badly so. But the momentum-driven stocks have just outperformed everything in sight.    So, what I then sit down and have to analyse and question on behalf of my clients: can you commit money to a fund manager that has a very specific mandate and doesn\u2019t change when the market has changed? And we\u2019ve seen lots of experience over time where fund managers don\u2019t want to change, they keep on saying the market is wrong \u2013 we are right.    We saw it with Neil Woodford in the UK, where he was a superstar investor for many years, and then \u2013 when his style went out of favour \u2013 he kept on saying the market\u2019s wrong, I\u2019m right, and eventually it led to the closure of a very large investment company. So, it\u2019s just little funny things about the investment industry, and it\u2019s got very little to do with investment returns.    Thank you. Rodney wants to know if he should cash in his local equity unit trusts and reinvest in rand denominated global equity unit trusts or if he should move the funds offshore and invest directly there? So, quite a broad question. We were chatting earlier this week and you said there are ways that people can diversify without putting more money on the table. So, would this be one of those situations?     Yes, it would be. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019ve got a couple hundred thousand right in local equity funds and you\u2019re not happy and you want to get into offshore funds or into offshore assets swap funds: you can make use of your capital tax exemption of 40,000 per tax year and make those changes. You can do some changes now, next change in March \u2013 in the next tax year \u2013 to minimise the pain.    But there\u2019s not going to be a lot of pain \u2013 unless you\u2019ve been in the market for a very long time. So capital gains tax is one issue that you need to consider, and if you don\u2019t know how it works, you go and see a financial advisor that will work that out for you. Internal changes in your portfolio quite easily, and if you are making a loss, that\u2019s even better because there\u2019s no capital gains tax, you just switch it into offshore funds.    We\u2019ve got some very good local asset swap funds. They take the money offshore on your behalf, and the returns have been very, very good \u2013 between 13 and 17% per annum. Then, as we previously discussed, you can make changes to your retirement annuities. You can make changes in your preservation funds, etc, but you need to understand a little bit about what is available in that product range and what other funds are there \u2013 and then you can make changes in there.    And then lastly, if you have money in RAs or a combination of RAs and you\u2019re older than 55 and you haven\u2019t pulled out any money: you can, and I strongly recommend that you consider, pulling your money out of these badly performing RAs, get your one third out into your hands. And the balance goes into a living annuity where you can go up to 100% offshore.    Those are all the variables that you can play with, and a lot of people don\u2019t know how it works. You can combine three, four, five, six retirement annuities all into one \u2013 and have one living annuity. You could probably get costs down. You can go to a cheaper list. You can get ETF funds and you can get your money offshore. It all depends.    The investment rule has changed in the last 10 to 15 years \u2013 for the better \u2013 in the sense that there are many more fantastic products available for the local investor at lower fees.    Thank you. Pierre wants to know what cash options are best? What is your view on that? How can people boost their return in their retirement annuity if they\u2019re stuck in there?    We\u2019ve been using these hybrid enhanced income funds, we call them, which is a mixture of shorter dated instruments, and so on, and we normally choose three or four fund managers. We are good in that space, we\u2019ve got a proven track record. And the returns have been between 8 and in one or two cases, closer to 10.    That\u2019s come down and there\u2019s a bit more volatility, which is not necessarily a risk, but it\u2019s infinitely better \u2013 especially for larger amounts of money \u2013 to put it in there. The costs are low and you\u2019ve got access to your money, because if you have large amounts of money and you want the really nice interest rates, you have to tie up your money for five years \u2013 and I don\u2019t like that. Five years is a lifetime, in my view.    And so this enhanced income space is a very nice space and it has worked very successfully. You get access to your money, you could make regular withdrawals if you need the cash, but your returns are between eight and 10 percent. That\u2019s where I would look for that kind of investment.    Graham says the panel is strongly advocating for investing offshore. Assuming you\u2019re able to take R10m offshore \u2013 how would you invest: straight into equity or phased in over a number of months once the funds are transferred?    Right now, I would take the money offshore, I think the rand is under pressure a little bit. And once it\u2019s there, I would put it into a multi-asset income fund, and there are a host of them. And then just do your research thoroughly and understand what your options are. Don\u2019t rush into something that you don\u2019t fully understand.    So, I\u2019ll have a two step approach if I\u2019ve got R10m (which I don\u2019t have \u2013 my ex-wife has got it), but I would first get it into an instrument that gives me 2 or maybe 3%. And then I would thoroughly look at maybe then doing it in chunks. I\u2019ll take R2m here and then wait a month or two, and then R2m there \u2013 until I\u2019m familiar with the process.    And that\u2019s the kind of approach that works over time, because you must know that if you take money offshore \u2013 it is not for short-term, it is a very long-term investment. And my experience has been \u2013 and I\u2019ve been doing investment offshores for like 20 years, 25 years \u2013 people never bring their money back unless they really have to. So, it\u2019s a very long-term investment. So, make sure you get into the right funds at the right time.    Thank you. And then we\u2019ve got a lot of questions about gold and silver, and we\u2019ve seen gold\u2019s been on a bit of a run. What is your view on gold and how to get exposure to that?    The gold price and the gold industry has always been, you know, kind of like a conspiracy theory and the gold price is manipulated, and it\u2019s only a fringe investment. But \u2013 what is very telling is that (I think a week ago) Goldman Sachs, which is really, you know, the vampire squid of investment companies, as someone called it\u2026 I mean, we\u2019re talking about how a substantial financial institution is saying they reckon gold will go to $3,000. To me, that was a game changer.    It\u2019s not these fringe guys trying to scare people and investing into their products or their gold products, but this is a serious financial institution saying there are some weaknesses structurally in the world economy. They are saying gold can go to $3,000. On that basis, I think people must consider gold.    The comment I\u2019d like to make about gold and, more particularly, gold itself, bullion, Krugerrands is that here is an investment that, I mean we used to produce the most gold in the world until about 20 years ago. Our economy has been built on gold. But you\u2019re not allowed to include physical gold in your retirement although it has been the best asset for 15 to 20 years.    So, we need to ask our regulators these questions: why can\u2019t I put some of my money into gold, which has been fantastic! I mean, in Australia \u2013 where they have these super annuity stuff where you can select what you want into this fund \u2013 they\u2019ve got a much more liberal approach to investing. They\u2019re saying: \u2018It\u2019s your money, Jackie, do what you want!\u2019 In South Africa, we\u2019ve got this paternalistic approach. People tell you what to do and how to invest your money. And I always raise this point \u2013 what about gold? I want to buy gold. I can\u2019t do it. So, I have to do it in my private capacity.    But to end my long rambling: yes. Physical gold,  have been a great investment. If you can stomach the volatility of the gold share market itself \u2013 there\u2019s been a great run in the market, it may be a pullback.    But my final point is, I mean, six months ago, there was a huge hullabaloo about  who wanted to close down their gold fund for various reasons and take that asset into one of their general equity funds. Then a lot of people protested and so they kept it open. That has been the best performing fund in South Africa in the last year.    I mean, you have to ask questions. Why do they want to close it? So, I like gold. Timing is a little bit dicey at the moment, but if I had some spare cash, I\u2019ll be buying physical gold. I\u2019ll be buying some more Krugerrands or ETFs.    We are coming to a close. So, a final question for you. This is a theme in a number of questions and this is from Shirley. For parents who are over 80 years old, looking for increased income from their investments: would investing offshore be recommended? So, in other words, let\u2019s get a bit of a turbocharger on our return so that we can enjoy our money while we still can.   You know, it depends on the view of the currency itself, and going forward. And then, of course, the fact that overseas \u2013 your income yields are not that great. In fact, they\u2019re zero.   I\u2019ve been listening to your webinars on  and that\u2019s attracted my interest \u2013 and that might be an option \u2013 where you invest in physical building in the United States \u2013 which houses doctors and specialists \u2013 and that rate then pays your rent in South Africa. So that is an option.    Otherwise, you just invest in an offshore portfolio, and every year you bring back some money to spend your way in South Africa. What we have recommended in our company: we open a debit card in Mauritius for people. They just transfer $10,000 or whatever the amount into that card, which stays in dollars and they walk around SA paying with their debit card at Woolworths, Pick n Pay \u2013 and that\u2019s a strategy that I\u2019ve been using personally and a lot of my clients and they\u2019ve done quite nicely out of that.    Thank you very much to Magnus Heystek of Brenthurst Wealth Management for joining us this week. And thank you to all the attendees for your questions. We\u2019ll see you this time next week.

In this excerpt from the Finance Friday webinar, BizNews editor Jackie Cameron discusses retirement annuities with Heystek, who stresses that there is a crisis developing for people who rely on the traditional methods to fund their retirement \u2013 because the instrument that they\u2019re using is busy failing them. To address this crisis, Heystek recommends that, the minute you are over 55, seriously consider getting your money into a  where you can get a 100% . Also of interest, Heystek notes that if he had some spare cash, he\u2019d be buying physical gold. These and a host of other financial issues are picked up on in the BizNews Finance Friday webinar. \u2013 Nadya Swart    Hello everybody, welcome to the BizNews Finance Friday webinar. With me today, I\u2019ve got Magnus Heystek, an independent financial advisor. Magnus, I see you\u2019ve won another award this week.    Well, thank you very much for mentioning that Jackie. Yes, it\u2019s just like the Oscars in the investment world \u2013 the Intellidex Annual Wealth Manager Awards of the Year. And you\u2019ve got two categories: one for the big guys and one for the boutique guys, where we play in, and I\u2019m glad to say we won the best Boutique Wealth Manager of the Year Award. Thank you very much.    Well, congratulations. We\u2019ve had a lot of questions on retirement annuities over the last couple of weeks, and you\u2019ve produced some very interesting graphs here. I wonder if we can just quickly talk through those before we kick off with some of the questions?      Well, just some background there: retirement annuities and pension funds, preservation funds are bound by  \u2013 so they can only get 30% offshore. The balance has to be in the local market, and that\u2019s been the case since 2011. As a result of the poor performance of our local equity market, that has been having a major impact on the growth rates of the traditional retirement annuities or, in fact, all retirement annuities.    And I just took this out as an example \u2013 I\u2019m not picking on anybody, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not publishing the name. But there is a retirement annuity fund of one of the insurance companies where \u2013 after five years \u2013 relative to inflation, you\u2019re down 50%. You\u2019ve made no money in five years. In fact, you\u2019ve lost 5% of your money over a five year period. And you can go through all of the returns \u2013 some are better. This is probably the worst one I\u2019ve seen.      So, there\u2019s a little bit of a crisis developing in people who rely on the traditional methods to fund their retirement \u2013 that graph shows it very clearly. So, there has been no growth, and in fact, you\u2019re down 30%. And that is starting to become a major talking point. People are questioning their RAs. They\u2019re demanding answers and they\u2019re demanding returns. And this is affecting a lot of people in their retirement.    Their retirement projections from five or 10 years ago are out by about 30 to 40% in real terms. And that \u2013 combined with the Covid collapse and the bad property market \u2013 means that most people are now severely underfunded \u2013 not because they haven\u2019t been putting money in. It is because the instrument that they\u2019re using is busy failing them and you can clearly see that.   Really frightening because we\u2019ve been encouraged to invest in RAs, you know, from the day we start working \u2013 we\u2019re encouraged to set aside money because there\u2019s a tax incentive. What do people do with their money in an RA? Isn\u2019t it stuck?    They can change the asset allocation. And when I say this, and I\u2019ve been saying this for a while, if this doesn\u2019t change, cash is not a bad way to protect your money or even bonds. But we need to change Regulation 28. We need more offshore.    And if you\u2019re over 55, there are other ways to get more offshore exposure by actually pulling out your money, getting your tax free portion into your pocket and then reallocating your funds into more offshore or better performing funds.    But this is quite severe: if you look at the performance of the large pension funds (not as bad as this), but I get guys who send me their pension fund statements \u2013 and they haven\u2019t made money in five years. And the media doesn\u2019t talk about it: they are either under-resourced or they\u2019re too scared to talk about it. But we need to talk about it. There\u2019s a massive crisis in retirement funding developing for the middle class to upper class in our society.    It\u2019s been suggested that we should look for a nimble asset manager. I don\u2019t see too many of those at the moment, but perhaps you could name some.    The decision as to the asset allocation depends on the financial advisor \u2013 that has to be more nimble \u2013 or the owner of the product. When you\u2019re in a fund and it\u2019s not performing, the fund manager has got no responsibility towards you. That fund manager must merely stick to the mandate of the fund, and a lot of clients don\u2019t fully understand this. They often say: \u2018But why don\u2019t the fund managers change their investment strategy?\u2019 You have to explain to them that the fund manager is beholden to a specific mandate, which is in the fun fact sheets or the document, and they will invest according to their mandate.    You, as an investor \u2013 and more importantly, your advisor \u2013 is the one that needs to be nimble and is going to find those funds. There are a number of smaller funds that have done very well. You\u2019ve got to go and find them and then put your clients into that if you\u2019re allowed to do that. So, it\u2019s more a reflection on the advisory industry \u2013 that they just tell their clients: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s long term, don\u2019t panic. It\u2019ll come right.\u2019 The more independent advisors, I would suggest, are the ones who get involved and say: \u2018No, no, no \u2013 let\u2019s change it because it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u2019   Thank you. So we\u2019ve got a question here from James who asks if it is possible to transfer a closed RA from provider to provider? He says: \u2018I have two from a previous employer, which I would like to move and merge.\u2019 Is that possible, Magnus?    Yes, it is. It\u2019s a bit of a cumbersome process, and I think it\u2019s called a Section 37 transfer \u2013 a lot of paperwork, there might be some slight penalties involved. But yes, you can move it. I\u2019ve done it with my own RA\u2019s, for instance, moving it from the big ones to a much smaller and nimble fund. And then I can choose my own funds, and I\u2019ve done far better than with the old style.    And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll also be recommending to our clients: that the minute you are over 55 \u2013 seriously consider getting your money into a living annuity where you can get a 100% offshore allocation. As an example, my living annuity returned 37% in the last year. Our stock market has given you zero.    So, people need to get involved in their pension funds, retirement annuity funds and speak to an independent financial advisor.   Great, thank you, and then Zukiso says: \u2018Why are advisors reluctant to recommend ETFs and index tracking unit trusts? Magnus, what is your view on ETFs and unit trusts?    We use increasingly more and more ETFs, especially on the offshore side. I mean, our Global Equity Fund is 100% ETFs \u2013 using  and  \u2013 and you can get them very, very cheaply. My stress is on the world independent. I think a lot of the tied agents, the embedded agents, are forced to recommend their high cost products to their clients \u2013 for obvious reasons.    And, as independents, we get paid by our clients, we don\u2019t get paid by anybody else but our clients. And they are very much sensitive about pricing and costs, and they\u2019re not stupid. And then you try and sell them a very expensive product \u2013 they will walk away. So, we\u2019ve been using it for a very long time.    A lot of questions coming through are about what an independent financial adviser is. So, how do you actually know if you\u2019re in the hands of an independent financial advisor? What are the questions you ask?    I think the regulatory bodies are also trying to define clearly who is a tied agent \u2013 when they work for a certain company and they have to now declare: I work for X, Y, Z company and I can only give you advice on that company\u2019s products. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but you have to declare it.    The second one is the independent agents who are not in that restricted space. They can go out and they can offer virtually any product on the market. And they are then allowed to say: I am an independent financial advisor, which is a really good thing because a lot of people have been walking around saying: \u2018I\u2019m independent, independent!\u2019 But you end up placing all of your business with one company, which is dishonest in many ways.    Jonathan says financial advisors charge a fee, whether you make a gain or not and he has a large problem with this. However, he says he would rather pay an extra percentage on performance. This is a win-win agreement, he says. What do you think, Magnus, about performance fees?    There\u2019s no real merit in that argument, and we get people from time to time saying: \u2018Well, the funds have gone down, but you\u2019re still taking a fee.\u2019 I mean, yeah, you even have it with asset managers, who will take a performance fee, although they\u2019ve lost money, but they have outperformed the benchmark which determines whether they can take fees or not. So, it\u2019s a slightly tricky question.    You can agree with your advisors. Say: \u2018Listen, I\u2019ll pay you a higher percentage performance fee, we\u2019ll set the benchmark and a year or two later \u2013 you two will sit down and work it out.\u2019 And if we had done it in our practice, we would have made far more money, but it\u2019s a very complex calculation to do for every single client. To work out: what was the benchmark, what was the out-performance, what was the percentage fee.    Worldwide, most people \u2013 90% to 95% of IFA practices are very happy for you to pay a fee based on the growth of the assets. They realise that markets can go down and they\u2019re not going to blame the advisor and say: \u2018I\u2019m not going to pay you, because there was a Covid-market crash or there was a 2008 crash. Most advisors or most clients understand that and they\u2019re willing to pay for that.    You often get people that say: \u2018Just do an assessment of all my stuff, pay me an amount and I\u2019ll pay you an amount of money.\u2019 And we do that: we send them a bill like a lawyer \u2013 and they\u2019ll either go away or come back.    It\u2019s quite interesting because you obviously do a lot of work behind the scenes and people don\u2019t necessarily think about that when they pay for their advice. Julian has this question, which touches on the first slide that you showed us. He wants to know why the local equity markets have performed so badly when the top 40 companies seem to earn the bulk of their earnings from offshore assets ?   That\u2019s a little bit of a fallacy \u2013 that they earn the bulk. It\u2019s true to a certain extent, there\u2019s about 30% of companies who earn most of their assets or their earnings offshore. But remember, they are still bound or exposed to local market conditions.    I\u2019ll give you a mine as an example, a gold mine: it produces gold, sends it offshore and it gets paid. But \u2013 it has electricity issues, it has labour issues, it has infrastructure issues. And that is a long, long argument, but in a nutshell \u2013 the macro-economic environment in South Africa in the last five years has been horrendous.    So whether you export stuff and get paid in dollars, your costs relative to your competitor in the United States and in Canada is much higher in many cases. So, you might be competing in the same space, but your competitor is making R10 profit per unit, but you\u2019re only making R5 profit per unit \u2013 because of electricity or labour or water or whatever the issue is.    So, the investment industry has gone out selling the idea that the top 40 is mostly offshore. It\u2019s simply not true. You can look at the performance of the top 40 relative to the  (or any index). Our local macroeconomic situation has pulled us quite down, and if you strip , for instance, out of our market performance and you look at the mid caps and the small caps \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s been a bloodbath as far as profitability is concerned.    So, our market has been driven downwards by two things, in my view. First of all, there\u2019s been a flood of foreign capital flowing out of the market since 2013 and the graph shows it. And secondly, our profitability of listed companies on the JSE as a percentage of GDP has been declining from about 11 to 12%, down to about 6%.    Now, that\u2019s a horrible decline and that\u2019s why our companies are where they are on the market. It\u2019s been driven downwards by real things, profitability and the foreign money, which has been boosting our market for a long time, has just gone elsewhere. And correctly, they\u2019ve gone elsewhere because they\u2019ve made phenomenal money in the US and technology and in other parts of the world. So, that\u2019s why our market is so down and hence our performance is so poor.    Henry asks: \u2018How can I get access to the Vanguard ETFs without transferring my funds overseas first? Is there a way?\u2019     The Vanguard is just not listed on the local market, but you can get equivalent funds via Sygnia, which launched a couple of very exciting and low cost funds that are doing exceptionally well in the fourth industrial revolution. The fans of the S&amp;P 500, and they\u2019ve launched that OSI fund, which is quite exciting.    So, I think you\u2019ve got enough equivalent products with Satrix, with Sygnia, with Easy Equities. You will find them in here. If you want Vanguard, specifically, you need to remit your money into dollars and go and buy on an offshore platform.   Which brings us to Hein\u2019s question or observation. He says that direct overseas investments tend to be prohibitively expensive. What do you think the minimum amount of money is that you need to have to make offshore investing viable from a cost perspective?   It\u2019s a function of two things. First of all, the offshore investment companies and platforms in particular have always demanded a certain minimum dollar amount, whether it\u2019s $10,000 or $15,000. But because the rand has dropped so much \u2013 I mean, 10 years ago you could buy $10,000 with R60,000 \u2013 now it\u2019s going to cost you R180,000.    So, it\u2019s a function of the rand that has dropped and the offshore companies \u2013 because of the fairly large amount of admin to do (money laundering checking and all that kind of stuff) \u2013 do not deal with small amounts of money. And they also don\u2019t deal with debit order stuff like we\u2019re used to in South Africa.    So that seems to make it more expensive, but it\u2019s not if you actually analyse the cost structures of offshore funds, especially ETFs. It\u2019s actually on par, if not cheaper than in South Africa.    Thank you. Now, Peter is asking you to look into your crystal ball and he wants to know if you think there is a global market correction in the near future when earnings are declared post-Covid? You don\u2019t have a crystal ball, Magnus, but what are you sort of reading from trends?   There\u2019s no point wasting your time trying to predict markets, because you will get it wrong. And all around the world, you\u2019ve been very, very smart guys \u2013 much smarter than myself \u2013 also trying to predict market crashes every day. And you get these things in your inbox every day: markets are crashing, markets are crashing. You just ignore them, because you do not know.    Who would have said that in the middle of April this year \u2013 with this Covid pandemic exploding on the front pages and people are dying and companies are being shut down \u2013 that that would be the turning point of a fantastic bull market since the beginning of April. Some sectors are up 50%. Some are up 100%. It made fools of most analysts and predictions.    I look at valuations and I look at trends, and there are certain sectors of the world economy making buckets of money at the moment, including biotech. You have seen all the big tech companies reporting their results: Facebook has come through, Amazon has come through. So, make sure that you\u2019re exposed to that market. Avoid sectors that are being punished like property and shipping and tourism and airlines and that kind of stuff. But to these markets is an absolute waste of time.    Thank you. Bruce says he knows your view on Allan Gray and Orbis funds and wants to know if he should hang on after ten years of underperformance. Maybe you could just update our attendees on your view on those funds, because not everybody knows your previous points about those funds. And, of course, your view might have changed.    You know, my views are just commentary that, you know, here is a fund that is highly rated \u2013 no doubt. It has been around for a very long time. It is humungously big. But for 10 years, it has not beaten it\u2019s benchmark. And in the last five years, substantially so.    Yet, and I sense this is a South African thing, South African advisors are just chucking money at Allan Gray / Orbis on the basis that it\u2019s a brand name company, so people or the investors don\u2019t really question the merits. They go: \u2018That\u2019s fine, Allan Gray is fantastic.\u2019 As opposed to me coming to them with a company called Table Top Investments, and it\u2019s got a great record, but it doesn\u2019t have that public appeal and people don\u2019t talk about it.    It\u2019s just a commentary on the investment industry itself, where sometimes investors fall into the trap of brand name investing and not worrying about the returns. Whereas, when you come to a client and say you\u2019ve got this other fund, it might be a smaller fund, it is doing fantastically well \u2013 which one do you want? They\u2019ll take the Allan Gray fund. It\u2019s just great marketing on the part of Allan Gray.    If you have money in it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll pull it out, but I will also build other funds around it: more specialist funds, more momentum-driven funds. It\u2019s a value style investing and value style has been out of favour since 2010 \u2013 around about there \u2013 and quite badly so. But the momentum-driven stocks have just outperformed everything in sight.    So, what I then sit down and have to analyse and question on behalf of my clients: can you commit money to a fund manager that has a very specific mandate and doesn\u2019t change when the market has changed? And we\u2019ve seen lots of experience over time where fund managers don\u2019t want to change, they keep on saying the market is wrong \u2013 we are right.    We saw it with Neil Woodford in the UK, where he was a superstar investor for many years, and then \u2013 when his style went out of favour \u2013 he kept on saying the market\u2019s wrong, I\u2019m right, and eventually it led to the closure of a very large investment company. So, it\u2019s just little funny things about the investment industry, and it\u2019s got very little to do with investment returns.    Thank you. Rodney wants to know if he should cash in his local equity unit trusts and reinvest in rand denominated global equity unit trusts or if he should move the funds offshore and invest directly there? So, quite a broad question. We were chatting earlier this week and you said there are ways that people can diversify without putting more money on the table. So, would this be one of those situations?     Yes, it would be. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019ve got a couple hundred thousand right in local equity funds and you\u2019re not happy and you want to get into offshore funds or into offshore assets swap funds: you can make use of your capital tax exemption of 40,000 per tax year and make those changes. You can do some changes now, next change in March \u2013 in the next tax year \u2013 to minimise the pain.    But there\u2019s not going to be a lot of pain \u2013 unless you\u2019ve been in the market for a very long time. So capital gains tax is one issue that you need to consider, and if you don\u2019t know how it works, you go and see a financial advisor that will work that out for you. Internal changes in your portfolio quite easily, and if you are making a loss, that\u2019s even better because there\u2019s no capital gains tax, you just switch it into offshore funds.    We\u2019ve got some very good local asset swap funds. They take the money offshore on your behalf, and the returns have been very, very good \u2013 between 13 and 17% per annum. Then, as we previously discussed, you can make changes to your retirement annuities. You can make changes in your preservation funds, etc, but you need to understand a little bit about what is available in that product range and what other funds are there \u2013 and then you can make changes in there.    And then lastly, if you have money in RAs or a combination of RAs and you\u2019re older than 55 and you haven\u2019t pulled out any money: you can, and I strongly recommend that you consider, pulling your money out of these badly performing RAs, get your one third out into your hands. And the balance goes into a living annuity where you can go up to 100% offshore.    Those are all the variables that you can play with, and a lot of people don\u2019t know how it works. You can combine three, four, five, six retirement annuities all into one \u2013 and have one living annuity. You could probably get costs down. You can go to a cheaper list. You can get ETF funds and you can get your money offshore. It all depends.    The investment rule has changed in the last 10 to 15 years \u2013 for the better \u2013 in the sense that there are many more fantastic products available for the local investor at lower fees.    Thank you. Pierre wants to know what cash options are best? What is your view on that? How can people boost their return in their retirement annuity if they\u2019re stuck in there?    We\u2019ve been using these hybrid enhanced income funds, we call them, which is a mixture of shorter dated instruments, and so on, and we normally choose three or four fund managers. We are good in that space, we\u2019ve got a proven track record. And the returns have been between 8 and in one or two cases, closer to 10.    That\u2019s come down and there\u2019s a bit more volatility, which is not necessarily a risk, but it\u2019s infinitely better \u2013 especially for larger amounts of money \u2013 to put it in there. The costs are low and you\u2019ve got access to your money, because if you have large amounts of money and you want the really nice interest rates, you have to tie up your money for five years \u2013 and I don\u2019t like that. Five years is a lifetime, in my view.    And so this enhanced income space is a very nice space and it has worked very successfully. You get access to your money, you could make regular withdrawals if you need the cash, but your returns are between eight and 10 percent. That\u2019s where I would look for that kind of investment.    Graham says the panel is strongly advocating for investing offshore. Assuming you\u2019re able to take R10m offshore \u2013 how would you invest: straight into equity or phased in over a number of months once the funds are transferred?    Right now, I would take the money offshore, I think the rand is under pressure a little bit. And once it\u2019s there, I would put it into a multi-asset income fund, and there are a host of them. And then just do your research thoroughly and understand what your options are. Don\u2019t rush into something that you don\u2019t fully understand.    So, I\u2019ll have a two step approach if I\u2019ve got R10m (which I don\u2019t have \u2013 my ex-wife has got it), but I would first get it into an instrument that gives me 2 or maybe 3%. And then I would thoroughly look at maybe then doing it in chunks. I\u2019ll take R2m here and then wait a month or two, and then R2m there \u2013 until I\u2019m familiar with the process.    And that\u2019s the kind of approach that works over time, because you must know that if you take money offshore \u2013 it is not for short-term, it is a very long-term investment. And my experience has been \u2013 and I\u2019ve been doing investment offshores for like 20 years, 25 years \u2013 people never bring their money back unless they really have to. So, it\u2019s a very long-term investment. So, make sure you get into the right funds at the right time.    Thank you. And then we\u2019ve got a lot of questions about gold and silver, and we\u2019ve seen gold\u2019s been on a bit of a run. What is your view on gold and how to get exposure to that?    The gold price and the gold industry has always been, you know, kind of like a conspiracy theory and the gold price is manipulated, and it\u2019s only a fringe investment. But \u2013 what is very telling is that (I think a week ago) Goldman Sachs, which is really, you know, the vampire squid of investment companies, as someone called it\u2026 I mean, we\u2019re talking about how a substantial financial institution is saying they reckon gold will go to $3,000. To me, that was a game changer.    It\u2019s not these fringe guys trying to scare people and investing into their products or their gold products, but this is a serious financial institution saying there are some weaknesses structurally in the world economy. They are saying gold can go to $3,000. On that basis, I think people must consider gold.    The comment I\u2019d like to make about gold and, more particularly, gold itself, bullion, Krugerrands is that here is an investment that, I mean we used to produce the most gold in the world until about 20 years ago. Our economy has been built on gold. But you\u2019re not allowed to include physical gold in your retirement although it has been the best asset for 15 to 20 years.    So, we need to ask our regulators these questions: why can\u2019t I put some of my money into gold, which has been fantastic! I mean, in Australia \u2013 where they have these super annuity stuff where you can select what you want into this fund \u2013 they\u2019ve got a much more liberal approach to investing. They\u2019re saying: \u2018It\u2019s your money, Jackie, do what you want!\u2019 In South Africa, we\u2019ve got this paternalistic approach. People tell you what to do and how to invest your money. And I always raise this point \u2013 what about gold? I want to buy gold. I can\u2019t do it. So, I have to do it in my private capacity.    But to end my long rambling: yes. Physical gold,  have been a great investment. If you can stomach the volatility of the gold share market itself \u2013 there\u2019s been a great run in the market, it may be a pullback.    But my final point is, I mean, six months ago, there was a huge hullabaloo about  who wanted to close down their gold fund for various reasons and take that asset into one of their general equity funds. Then a lot of people protested and so they kept it open. That has been the best performing fund in South Africa in the last year.    I mean, you have to ask questions. Why do they want to close it? So, I like gold. Timing is a little bit dicey at the moment, but if I had some spare cash, I\u2019ll be buying physical gold. I\u2019ll be buying some more Krugerrands or ETFs.    We are coming to a close. So, a final question for you. This is a theme in a number of questions and this is from Shirley. For parents who are over 80 years old, looking for increased income from their investments: would investing offshore be recommended? So, in other words, let\u2019s get a bit of a turbocharger on our return so that we can enjoy our money while we still can.   You know, it depends on the view of the currency itself, and going forward. And then, of course, the fact that overseas \u2013 your income yields are not that great. In fact, they\u2019re zero.   I\u2019ve been listening to your webinars on  and that\u2019s attracted my interest \u2013 and that might be an option \u2013 where you invest in physical building in the United States \u2013 which houses doctors and specialists \u2013 and that rate then pays your rent in South Africa. So that is an option.    Otherwise, you just invest in an offshore portfolio, and every year you bring back some money to spend your way in South Africa. What we have recommended in our company: we open a debit card in Mauritius for people. They just transfer $10,000 or whatever the amount into that card, which stays in dollars and they walk around SA paying with their debit card at Woolworths, Pick n Pay \u2013 and that\u2019s a strategy that I\u2019ve been using personally and a lot of my clients and they\u2019ve done quite nicely out of that.    Thank you very much to Magnus Heystek of Brenthurst Wealth Management for joining us this week. And thank you to all the attendees for your questions. We\u2019ll see you this time next week.    Diversify across asset classes \u2013 and geographies. Our guests at the BizNews Finance Friday webinar have been explaining how. Register once to secure your place each week, .

As we have highlighted in the past, laws outside the U.S., like the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), have extraterritorial scope[3], and they provide equal protections to all natural persons, including customers, employees and B2B contacts. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) follows this global trend and defines 'consumers' as California residents, thus providing the same level of rights to employees and B2B contacts who are California residents as well as customers. This article provides an overview of the latest legislative changes under the CCPA as they relate to company obligations concerning employee and B2B data, including exemptions, as well as practical tips for assessing when a company should reexamine employee and B2B privacy issues, including return-to-work (RTW) strategies.HR and B2B Exemption Under the CCPAAlthough the CCPA considers employees and persons who engage in business transactions with you in their professional capacity as consumers, the law as amended included partial exemptions that were set to expire on Jan. </p><p>1, 2021. Notably, for employees and job applicants, businesses were required to provide a notice before collecting any personal information but did not need to provide them the right to know, the right to delete or the right to opt-out (the 'HR exemption'). For more information on the CCPA generally, see our Consumer Privacy Resource Center[4]. For information handled in the context of B2B dealings, such as contact information of sales executives and customers, the CCPA required an opt-out notice if their personal information was being 'sold,' but there was no requirement to provide B2B contacts a notice prior to the collection of their personal information or to provide them other consumer rights under the CCPA, such as the right to know and the right to delete (the 'B2B exemption'). Recent developments in the California Legislature, however, indicate that businesses can continue availing themselves of these exemptions for at least another year.On Aug. 28, 2020, AB 1281, which proposes to extend the HR and B2B exemptions until Jan. 1, 2022, was passed by both the California Senate and the Assembly. Previously, the bill was ordered to the Senate Consent Calendar after sailing through the Judiciary Committee unopposed earlier in August. As originally drafted, AB 1281 proposed disclosure requirements for businesses using facial recognition technology[5]. A reshuffling of priorities necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic[6] may have prompted lawmakers to repurpose AB 1281 to achieve a more targeted goal. On June 26, 2020, AB 1281 was essentially rewritten to focus instead on extending the HR and B2B exemptions. It is important to note that AB 1281 will become inoperative if the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) ballot initiative is approved by voters in the November election, in which case the CPRA will extend the exemptions by two years, to Jan. 1, 2023. Click here[7] for our latest podcast on the CPRA.Now that AB 1281 has passed both houses of the California Legislature, the bill will garner the governor's signature (or veto) by Sept. 30. On the governor's desk are two other privacy bills, the Genetic Information Privacy Act (SB 980) and an amendment to the medical information exemption to the CCPA (AB 713). Stay tuned for our forthcoming analyses of these privacy bills. If not vetoed by the governor, all three bills will become effective on Jan. 1, 2021.Even with the HR exemption, however, businesses have begun to reexamine what personal information about their employees and independent contractors is collected, because of the notice-at-collection requirement under the CCPA. Although AB 1281 most likely would extend the HR exemption for another year, this does not remove the notice requirement, which has been in effect since Jan. 1, 2020, and requires employers to provide, at or before the point where data is collected, a notice accurately describing the categories of data to be collected and the purposes for which it will be used.Employee Privacy Issues to Consider as Part of RTW StrategiesEven for employers that revised employee privacy notices to meet the Jan. 1 deadline last year, the notice-at-collection requirements carry significant compliance implications this year for both employers deploying RTW policies and procedures and employers implementing new procedures in anticipation of long-term remote work. In many cases, and in view of state-issued reopening guidelines (see e.g., the California State Government website[8] for COVID-19), employers may plan RTW for a portion of their workforce and continued remote work for others.For employers deploying RTW strategies, this may involve collection of new information in the form of temperature scans and health questionnaires, as well as the deployment of new technologies and outsourced services such as touchless temperature scanners, temperature scanning kiosks and thermal cameras incorporated into facial recognition-enabled video surveillance programs. Thus, businesses should examine how the employee privacy notices that were previously delivered may need to be revised if additional data collection or processing practices have been implemented to meet workplace safety challenges. For companies that are expanding remote work, new software solutions to allow employees and contractors to Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) may also be adding new challenges to businesses that are concerned about privacy and data security. Because many of these solutions may require onboarding new vendors and outsourcing services, businesses should also undertake a separate legal and regulatory assessment of the vendors and technologies at issue.To comply with the CCPA, the notice at collection should accurately disclose the additional data elements under the appropriate category of personal information enumerated in the CCPA. For example, body temperature would fall in a category (thermal) separate from facial recognition data (biometric), and data processing that may generate inferences about an employee's COVID-19 status should be disclosed under the 'inferences' category.In addition to collecting new data, employers may also be leveraging employee data for new uses, such as processing employee health data to lower insurance costs or processing network data to assess employee productivity. Under the final CCPA regulations issued Aug. 14, 2020, opt-in consent is no longer a permissible mechanism for enabling the use of previously collected personal information for a materially different purpose. As discussed in our earlier blog article[9], a strict reading of the regulations would require businesses to provide a new notice describing the previously undisclosed purpose and to re-collect the data it already has on file before the data can be used for a new purpose. Of course, prompting the consumer to provide the same data under a new notice-at-collection is more cumbersome than obtaining the consumer's consent to a new use. It is important to note that in the next few months, the attorney general will resubmit for administrative approval the provision permitting opt-in consent for new purposes, so re-collection under a new notice may not be necessary. In the meantime, it is unsettled whether previously collected data may be used for a new purpose with a simple opt-in consent from the consumer. Businesses may wish to take a 'wait and see' approach or a more conservative approach, depending on their risk tolerance.For employers that do not have employees in California, it is worth noting that other state, federal and non-U.S. laws may also apply to the handling of employee data. For collection of health-related data, a separate analysis should be undertaken to see if the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) applies, and certain employer actions may result in tort claims such as for invasion of privacy or negligence. States including Illinois, Washington and Texas also have passed specific laws regulating the collection and use of biometric data. If the company is deploying technology solutions that involve the collection of fingerprints, iris scans or facial recognition, for example, a separate biometric privacy law analysis is recommended.Apart from specific types of data that may be considered sensitive, recent guidance[10] from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission covers generally how companies may collect and use data for pandemic preparedness in the workplace. For all employers in the U.S., the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects almost all private-sector employees regardless of whether they are union-represented. Employers should review the latest National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) general counsel's memorandums, including the memorandum published on Mar. 27, which outlines case summaries touching on the duty to bargain when employers are responding to emergencies, while making references to the coronavirus pandemic (see GC 20-04 Case Summaries Pertaining to the Duty to Bargain in Emergency Situations[11]). The NLRB also published on July 28 a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)[12] relating to employee privacy and participation by workers on military leave. Thus, collection and use of personal information belonging to employees should be evaluated not only with regard to consumer privacy laws, like the CCPA and GDPR, but also with regard to labor law to ensure that no adverse actions are being taken on protected concerted activities or unilateral changes are being made to working conditions, including increased employee surveillance, health monitoring or contact tracing. In the next blog article, we will take a closer look at the B2B exemption and issues related to the sale of personal information and the right to opt-out.Key Takeaways Most data protection and labor laws are jurisdiction-specific. Companies should continue to monitor legislative or regulatory changes to make sure the impact of consumer privacy laws and labor laws is understood with regard to employee and B2B data. For example, the definitions of what constitutes 'personal information' or 'biometric data' are rapidly evolving and require close scrutiny. Many RTW strategies involve the collection of new information or use of previously collected information for a new purpose. Companies should examine what notice, if any, was delivered at the time personal information was collected and whether consent was obtained, as appropriate. Even if proper notice was provided at the time of collection, it is difficult for businesses to continue to monitor how that data is used as it moves through the data life cycle. We recommend companies institute a data privacy impact assessment program to continually monitor the types of data processing activities that are considered high risk, to regularly check to make sure no legal or regulatory changes need to be built into business processes, and to test and audit internal controls for remediating any residual risks.

The most significant update in more than two decades, the new regulations approved by the European Parliament will hold social media platforms legally responsible for content uploaded by users. Its chief impact will be on copyright violations and their prevention. The responsibility now lies plainly with the powerful owners of platforms like YouTube, Google and Facebook.</p><p/><p>Today, social media firms have become the dominant suppliers of news and other copyright materials such as music, especially for younger people. Their owners have reaped unimaginable profits and become some of the world's biggest corporations. While exploiting creative materials produced by more traditional content producers, the big tech firms have also contributed directly to their decline as advertising migrates to the dominant social media platforms. In the United States, Facebook and Google accounted for 60 per cent of online advertising revenue last year. Washington has lobbied fiercely against the changes in the EU. One obvious reason is that virtually all the big tech firms are American. But there are also fundamental legal and philosophical differences over regulation of the media.</p><p/><p>By law since 1996 in the US, online platforms are not considered \"publishers\" of content produced by third parties. The crucial difference is that publishers, such as this newspaper, are legally responsible for the content they publish. Google and YouTube, however, are not. This US law arguably lies at the foundation of the profit-making model of such big tech firms. It also puts traditional media at a huge disadvantage.</p><p/><p>In the US and many EU countries, the decline of traditional news media is advanced. Asian cities such as Hong Kong are not far behind. With few exceptions, most of our traditional media companies from print to television are experiencing decline in readership, viewership, circulation and audience ratings. In Hong Kong as elsewhere, younger people prefer online platforms for their daily media diet. The EU is showing there needs to be a balance between regulation and an online free-for-all, between accountability and the free and fair use of copyright materials.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-18a715d4-576e-11e9-a3ae-f2742b367090</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV0-9JP1-DYRW-R4MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"384\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 South China Morning Post Ltd.

The documents include details of how Facebook:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Lobbied politicians across Europe in a strategic operation to head off \"overly restrictive\" GDPR legislation. They include extraordinary claims that the Irish prime minister said his country could exercise significant influence as president of the EU, promoting Facebook's interests even though technically it was supposed to remain neutral. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Used chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg's feminist memoir Lean In to \"bond\" with female European commissioners it viewed as hostile.</p><p> Threatened to withhold investment from countries unless they supported or passed Facebook-friendly laws. </p><p>The documents appear to emanate from a court case against Facebook by the app developer Six4Three in California, and reveal that Sandberg considered European data protection legislation a \"critical\" threat to the company. A memo written after the Davos economic summit in 2013 quotes Sandberg describing the \"uphill battle\" the company faced in Europe on the \"data and privacy front\" and its \"critical\" efforts to head off \"overly prescriptive new laws\".</p><p>Most revealingly, it includes details of the company's \"great relationship\" with Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister at the time, one of a number of people it describes as \"friends of Facebook\". Ireland plays a key role in regulating technology companies in Europe because its data protection commissioner acts for all 28 member states. The memo has inflamed data protection advocates, who have long complained about the company's \"cosy\" relationship with the Irish government.</p><p>The memo notes Kenny's \"appreciation\" for Facebook's decision to locate its headquarters in Dublin and points out that the new proposed data protection legislation was a \"threat to jobs, innovation and economic growth in Europe\". It then goes on to say that Ireland is poised to take on the presidency of the EU and therefore has the \"opportunity to influence the European Data Directive decisions\". It makes the extraordinary claim that Kenny offered to use the \"significant influence\" of the EU presidency as a means of influencing other EU member states \"even though technically Ireland is supposed to remain neutral in this role\".</p><p>It goes on: \"The prime minister committed to using their EU presidency to achieve a positive outcome on the directive.\" Kenny, who resigned from office in 2017, did not respond to the Observer 's request for comment.</p><p>John Naughton, a Cambridge academic and Observer writer who studies the democratic implications of digital technology, said the leak was \"explosive\" in the way it revealed the \"vassalage\" of the Irish state to the big tech companies. Ireland had welcomed the companies, he noted, but became \"caught between a rock and a hard place\". \"Its leading politicians apparently saw themselves as covert lobbyists for a data monster.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for Facebook said the documents were still under seal in a Californian court and it could not respond to them in any detail: \"Like the other documents that were cherrypicked and released in violation of a court order last year, these by design tell one side of a story and omit important context.\"</p><p>The 2013 memo, written by Marne Levine, who is now a Facebook senior executive, was cc-ed to Elliot Schrage, Facebook's then head of policy and global communications, the role now occupied by Nick Clegg. As well as Kenny, dozens of other politicians, US senators and European commissioners are mentioned by name, including then Indian president Pranab Mukherjee, Michel Barnier, now the EU's Brexit negotiator, and Osborne.</p><p>The then chancellor used the meeting with Sandberg to ask Facebook to invest in the government's Tech City venture, the memo claims, and Sandberg said she would \"review\" any proposal. In exchange, she asked him to become \"even more active and vocal in the European Data Directive debate and really help shape the proposals\". The memo claims Osborne asked for a detailed briefing and said he would \"figure out how to get more involved\". He offered to host a launch for Sandberg's book in Downing Street, an event that went ahead in spring 2013.</p><p>Osborne told the Observer : \"I don't think it's a surprise that the UK chancellor would meet the chief operating officer of one of the world's largest companies ... Facebook and other US tech firms, in private, as in public, raised concerns about the proposed European Data Directive. To your specific inquiry, I didn't follow up on those concerns, or lobby the EU, because I didn't agree with them.\"</p><p>He noted it was \"not a secret\" that he had helped launch Sandberg's book at 11 Downing Street and added: \"The book's message about female empowerment was widely praised, not least in the Guardian and the Observer.\"</p><p>In fact, the memo reveals that Sandberg's feminist memoir was perceived as a lobbying tool by the Facebook team and a means of winning support from female legislators for Facebook's wider agenda.</p><p>In a particularly revealing account of a meeting with Viviane Reding, the influential European commissioner for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship, the memo notes her key role as \"the architect of the European Data Directive\" and describes the company's \"difficult\" relationship with her owing to her being, it claims, \"not a fan\" of American companies.</p><p>\"She attended Sheryl's Lean In dinner and we met with her right afterwards,\" the memo says, but notes that she felt it was a \"very 'American' discussion\", a comment the team regarded as a setback since \"getting more women into C-level jobs and on boards was supposed to be how they bonded, and it backfired a bit\".</p><p>The Davos meetings are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of Facebook's global efforts to win influence. The documents reveals how in Canada and Malaysia it used the promise of siting a new data centre with the prospect of job creation to win legislative guarantees. When the Canadians hesitated over granting the concession Facebook wanted, the memo notes: \"Sheryl took a firm approach and outlined that a decision on the data center was imminent. She emphasized that if we could not get comfort from the Canadian government on the jurisdiction issue, we had other options.\" The minister supplied the agreement Facebook required by the end of the day, it notes.</p><p>                     Additional research by Matt Fowler                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-52223595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJ8-S671-F021-643J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1162\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer(London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 2, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Parents said they suspected social media had played a part in their children's suicides.</p><p>A Sunday Times investigation found numerous graphic images of self-harm on Pinterest that could be viewed by children as young as 13.</p><p>They included blood-spattered arms showing self-inflicted wounds, a picture of a teenage girl hanging, and many \"mottos\" that normalised suicide. Another image showed a naked girl sitting in a sink of blood with the words: \"She found relief in a knife.\"</p><p>The site, a virtual scrapbook driven by algorithms that is hugely popular with young women, even sent a personalised email to Molly's email address, a month after she died, with self-harm images including a slashed thigh. The email said: \"I can't tell you how many times I wish I was dead.\"</p><p>The Sunday Times also created a pseudonymous account for a child aged 14 to test how the Pinterest algorithm can target users with personalised content and tempt them to spend longer on the site. Pinterest immediately started to suggest pictures relating to suicide, including a fist holding white pills and images of blood and cuts.</p><p>This newspaper also made more than 20 complaints about images posted on Instagram soon after the company had expressed sorrow to Molly's family. The complaints were rejected and the company decreed the images were fit to be viewed by children of 13 and over. This was despite Instagram claiming that \"content that promotes self-harm or suicide violates our community guidelines and is removed when we are made aware of it\". Many selected images had hashtags such as \"ihatemyselfand iwanttodie\" and \"killmeplease\".</p><p>Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, criticised the complacency of social media companies about their impact on children's health and happiness. He has written to companies including Instagram's owner Facebook and Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, Apple and Google, telling them to remove disturbing material or face legislation. Hancock said that he felt \"physically sick\" reading about Molly's death. \"This is a critical moment: we must act with urgency to stop technology causing harm,\" he said. \"Suicide is now the leading cause of death for young people under 20. Levels of self-harm are rising among teenage girls in particular.\"</p><p>Ian Russell is now calling for the establishment of an independent regulator to ensure that \"distressing content can be removed from social media and online within 24 hours\". He was dismayed by the refusal of tech companies to give him access to Molly's accounts so that he could see the content she was looking at in the hours before her death. Six technology giants - including Apple, YouTube and Facebook - are expected to be asked this week by coroner, Andrew Walker, who is presiding over Molly's inquest, to hand over information about her accounts.</p><p>Instagram said: \"We work with expert groups who \u2026 tell us that the sharing of a person's mental health journey can be an important part of recovery. This is why we don't remove certain content and instead offer people looking at, or posting it, support messaging that directs people to groups that can help.\"</p><p>Interview, pages 4-5</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Molly Russell died in November 2017.

Modi leads India's ultranationalist BJP party, which won a landslide[6] majority of seats (though only 31% of the votes[7]), meaning Modi will have the luxury of leading\u00a0India's first one-party government in 30 years. This is making a lot of people nervous: The last time the BJP party was in power, in 1998, they launched series of nuclear bomb[8] test explosions[9], sparking a nuclear crisis with Pakistan[10] and fears[11] of all-out nuclear war. </p><p>And that was when the BJP was led by a 'moderate'[12] ultranationalist \u2014 and tied down with meddling coalition partners. Modi is different[13]. Not only will he rule alone, he's promised to run India the way he ran the western state of Gujarat since 2001, which Booker Prize-winning author Arandhuti Roy described[14] as 'the petri dish in which Hindu fascism has been fomenting an elaborate political experiment.' Under Modi's watch, an orgy of anti-Muslim violence led to up to 2000 killed[15]\u00a0and 250,000 internally displaced[16], and a lingering climate of fear[17], ghettoization[18], and extrajudicial executions[19] by Gujarat death squads operating under Modi's watch. We can understand the White House being forced to congratulate Modi through gritted diplomatic teeth. What's harder to stomach is the public cheering of India's election results by one of the most prominent progressive names in Silicon Valley. * * * * Omidyar Network, as Pando readers know, is the philanthropy arm of eBay billionaire <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar. </nameText></person>Since 2009, Omidyar Network has made more investments in India[20] than in any other country in its portfolio. These investments were largely thanks to Jayant Sinha[21], a former McKinsey partner and Harvard MBA, who was hired in October 2009 to\u00a0establish[22] and run Omidyar Network India Advisors[23]. During Sinha's tenure, Omidyar Network steered a large portion of its investments into India, so that by 2013, India investments made up 18% of Omidyar Network's[24] committed funds of well over $600 million, and 36% of the total number of companies in its portfolio. In February of this year, Sinha stepped down[25] from Omidyar Network in order to advise Modi's election campaign[26], and to run for a BJP parliamentary seat[27] of his own. Sinha's father, Yashwant Sinha, served as finance minister in the last BJP government from 1998 (when his government set off the nukes) through 2002. This year, Sinha's father gave up his seat in parliament to allow Jayant Sinha to take his place. During the campaign, Sinha's father publicly\u00a0backed\u00a0[28]Modi's refusal to apologize over the deadly riots under his watch: 'Modi is right\u2026why should he apologize?' His\u00a0ex-Omidyar staffer son, Jayant, boasted[29]\u00a0a few weeks ago that his\u00a0father's\u00a0BJP government ignored international outrage in 1998 when\u00a0detonating its nukes, known as\u00a0'Pokhran'[30]: When Atalji became PM in 1998, the global media attacked us similarly. However, we pursued our national interests including Pokhran. Shortly after Sinha left Omidyar Network to help\u00a0Modi win[31], Modi gave a speech calling for opening India's e-commerce[32] market to foreign companies such as Ebay[33], whose largest shareholder[34] is <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar. </nameText></person>The message was clear: Modi is the candidate of hi-tech India[35], violent ultranationalism notwithstanding. At the same time, Sinha helped organize a summit meeting[36] between Modi and major global investors like JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Nomura bank. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, when news broke last weekend that Jayant Sinha had ridden to election victory[37] on Modi's ultranationalist coattails, Omidyar Network offered its congratulations[38]: <br/> Shortly afterwards, the former Omidyar man went on NPR's 'On Point'[39] insisting that 'Mr. Modi is a great democrat.' 'He just won a wonderful election, the greatest election in the history of humanity\u2026.non-Hindus should not be worried about this leadership at all.' To be clear, this isn't just a case of an Omidyar staffer who just happened to become a supporter of Modi. In fact, Pando has learned that Sinha has a long history of working for Modi and his\u00a0Hindu supremacist[40] BJP party, starting before he joined Omidyar Network and continuing during his tenure as the organization's managing director and partner in India, when Sinha oversaw tens of millions of the Redwood City-based fund's investments in the country. Just last month,\u00a0senior BJP party leader\u00a0Shiv Shankar Prasad Gupta told a news conference[41] that Jayant Sinha 'worked in Modi's team for two years (2012 and 2013)' \u2014 while he was simultaneously\u00a0leading\u00a0Omidyar Network's India branch. What Gupta didn't do was explain the full extent the relationship between Sinha, Omidyar Networks, the BJP and the US Government. Here are the highlights: While still heading Omidyar Network India Advisors, Jayant Sinha simultaneously served as a director[42] in the BJP party's main policy think tank, the India Foundation[43], founded by the hardline former director of India's Intelligence Bureau, Ajit Doval[44]. The India Foundation has been described[45] as 'doing all the backroom thinking on economy and security-related issues to prepare policy stances for the\u00a0BJP'; The India Foundation, besides incubating\u00a0Jayant Sinha's pro-business agenda, also pushed\u00a0hardline policies\u00a0to target India's peasant[46] Naxalite insurgency[47], made up of India's poor indigenous peoples. The India Foundation produced a\u00a0propaganda film\u00a0that pushed\u00a0for\u00a0'zero tolerance' [48]against what it called\u00a0'Red terror.' The India Foundation also argued\u00a0that Christian missionaries[49] allied with\u00a0'Maoists' to forcibly convert\u00a0Hindus to Christianity\u00a0\u2014 a typical\u00a0BJP slur that has incited countless Hindu lynch mob attacks[50] on India's Christians; While heading Omidyar Network India Advisors, Jayant Sinha repeatedly[51] called for India's government to allow foreign direct investment into e-commerce[52], a move that would directly benefit eBay, where <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar's </nameText></person>billions are tied up as the company's largest single shareholder; an Omidyar Network-funded\u00a0NGO was accused[53] of using its access to Indian lawmakers to secretly lobby[54] for a bill allowing foreign direct investment into India's e-retail sector; In late February, just weeks after Sinha quit Omidyar Network to advise Modi's campaign, Modi gave a speech in favor of allowing foreign\u00a0e-commerce[55] firms to enter India's markets; eBay has been investing heavily[56] into Indian e-commerce firms in hopes of entering the potentially lucrative market; Under Sinha's guidance, in 2010 Omidyar Network gave its first grant[57] to an Indian NGO, Janaagraha[58], for a well-publicized anti-corruption campaign[59] coinciding with a larger, nationwide anti-corruption campaign that undermined support for the ruling center-left party, dovetailing[60] with\u00a0the campaign of the\u00a0ultranationalist BJP party and Modi as they plotted their return to power. (For more on this, read Arundhati Roy's excellent piece[61] on the right-wing Western-backed leader of India's anti-corruption movement, Anna Hazare.) This year's BJP election landslide victory over India's ruling center-left government has been widely attributed to anti-corruption politics; The Omidyar Network-funded Janaagraha [62]anti-corruption campaigns were enthusiastically supported by USAID officials like Sarah Mendelson, who described herself 'a convert'[63] in 2011 after hearing a Janaagraha official's 'spell-binding' speech describing the NGO's work. The following year, 2012, Mendelson announced[64] a new $55 million USAID program, 'Making All Voices Count,'[65] with Omidyar Network[66] as one of its four principal partners, explaining to Congress the program's larger political purpose[67]: 'The political trajectory of a country is ultimately a U.S. national security issue, and as such, we are intimately involved in advancing U.S. national security interests'; In 2005, Janaagraha was caught secretly participating in a World Bank-funded water privatization[68] scheme in Bangalore, offering to provide 'civil society participation' cover for a program to counter protests[69] from Bangalore's poor. Ultimately, India's anti-corruption campaign leaders fell by the wayside when their ties to Indian ultranationalist groups[70], and their foreign funding[71] (World Bank[72], Ford Foundation[73], Coca-Cola Foundation) were revealed. But even though the grassroots movement faded, the anti-corruption grievances still burned hot, and are considered the single biggest reason for the BJP party's historic election victory. Pando readers who followed our coverage[74] of Omidyar Network's role[75] in the Ukraine revolution[76] will recognize some similarities here: Funding anti-corruption 'good governance' NGOs which effectively served to discredit the ruling party. In Ukraine, Omidyar Network co-funded with USAID a network of NGOs and campaigns through 'Center UA,'[77] led by a former Orange Revolution leader and government minister in charge of NATO integration[78], Oleh Rybachuk, and his former press spokesperson[79], Svitlana Zalishchuk[80]. Despite proclaiming lofty goals about good governance, anti-corruption, and transparency, Omidyar Network's man in Ukraine announced as far back as 2012 his intention\u00a0of organizing another Orange Revolution.[81] Last year, the Financial Times reported[82] that Rybachuk's Omidyar-funded outfit New Citizen 'played a big role'[83] in organizing\u00a0the Maidan revolution protests that led to the government's overthrow this February. There are other similarities between Omidyar's involvement in Ukraine and India that reflect larger political trends: The alliance in India\u00a0between\u00a0oligarchs and Modi's ultranationalism[84]; and in Ukraine the domination of local politics by billionaire oligarchs and violent neofascists[85]. Meanwhile neoliberals are getting their IMF-backed [86]'structural reforms' in Ukraine, and global big business is salivating[87] over the profit potential in Modi-ruled\u00a0India. In India, billionaire oligarchs and the business community overwhelmingly\u00a0support[88] Modi's ultranationalist politics because Modi has been good for business. And Omidyar's man has already been offering insight into how Modi will help big business even more. In the days since India's election, Sinha told CNBC that India needs 'radical reforms'[89] in line with classic neoliberal, pro-business prescriptions, including cutting government subsidies and 'restructuring' India's social welfare programs; 'labor reforms'; and 'land acquisition' laws. These reforms are a top priority for India's mining industry giants, foreign investors\u2026 as well as USAID and their partners, Omidyar Network. * * * * Of course, India is far larger and far more politically complex than Ukraine. No one NGO outfit could play such a central role in politics as 'Center UA' did in Ukraine; no single force or oligarch could sway the politics there alone. What makes this story about Omidyar Network's relationship to the ultranationalist BJP party important is what it reveals about the nature of Silicon Valley money and politics, and what it reveals about the role NGOs and corporate foundations play in advancing the interests of both US geopolitical power and US corporate profits, under the guise of charity. A deeper look at Omidyar Network's activities in India gives concrete insight into the meaning of Silicon Valley 'enlightened self-interest.' For instance, many Omidyar Network's India investments have a dual purpose that neatly coincide with eBay's strategic agenda in India, a closed off but potentially huge e-commerce market that eBay has been trying to break into. As eBay has invested hundreds of millions in Indian e-commerce startups, Omidyar Network has been subtlety reshaping India's 'ecosystem' in ways that would benefit eBay's bottom line \u2014 like bringing mobile technology[90] and access to microfinance loans[91] into India's rural villages and communities, investing in an online classifieds company, and others. India has a lot of problems, not the least of which is its yawning inequality: On one end, India has the sixth largest number of billionaires in the world; on the other end, India has one-third[92] of the world's poor: 400 million Indians live on less than $1.25 a day[93], and half of India's households have no access to a toilet[94]. It's hard to see how what they really need are solar-powered battery-operated mobile devices bought with microfinance loans \u2014 but easier to imagine how that fits into Omidyar's agenda. (Let's not forget that Omidyar-funded SKS Microfinance was implicated[95] in a rash of gruesome suicides[96] by indebted Indian villagers, mostly young women, some of whom drank bottles of pesticides or drowned themselves to avoid SKS Microfinance debt collectors.) On the face of things, it's hard to square allegedly progressive hi-tech billionaires like Omidyar or Google having any interests or links that coincide with brutal sectarian chauvinists like <person><nameText>Narendra Modi </nameText></person>and his BJP party. But techies aren't always as progressive as their PR fluff claims; and in India, tech industry yuppies are open about their enthusiasm[97] for Modi and the BJP. Along with techies and the urban middle-class, Modi's strongest support also comes from India's oligarchs and big business interests. And Omidyar isn't the only Big Tech titan with cozy ties to the 'hi-tech populist.' In September 2012, days after members of Modi's inner circle were found guilty[98] of conspiracy[99] to murder and rape[100] during the 2002 anti-Muslim pogroms, Google and Modi partnered in a cross-promotional Google+ Hangouts event[101]. The Internet search giant boasted that Modi was 'the first Indian politican to debut on Google+ Hangouts,' adding[102]: 'The theme of the Hangout session was 'Strong and Glorious India Long Cherished by Swami Vivekananda'\u2026' A few months later, in spring 2013, Modi was the star speaker at Google's 'Big Tent Activate Summit'[103] in Delhi. Modi's home page boasted[104] of his relationship with Google: 'CM [Chief Minister] to speak on Technology in Politics, interact with Mr. Eric Schmidt at Big Tent Activate Summit 2013. 'Before delivering the address Shri Modi will interact with Mr. Eric Schmidt, the Chairman of Google Inc. via Google+ Hangout.' It was at last year's Google event that Modi coined[105] his pro-tech campaign slogan[106] which he ran on this year: 'The Three IT's: Indian Talent plus Information Technology is equal to India Tomorrow.' Earlier this year, just before the election campaign started in India, Google was dropped[107]\u00a0by India's election regulator as a partner over fears it could rig India's election. In May, Google publicly denied[108]\u00a0reports[109] that it had helped rig its search engine to help\u00a0Modi win the election. There is nothing inherently progressive about high-technology or its leaders. Adolph Hitler famously said, 'I'm mad on technology!'[110] \u2014 and he spared no lives or resources to advance technology, most notably in rocket science and aerospace. IBM punch-card computers played an essential role in organizing the Holocaust[111]. Technology also helped organize the Arab Spring in Egypt \u2014 and the counter-revolution by the current military dictatorship. What the story of Omidyar Network and hi-tech industry's love affair with Indian ultranationalism reveals is that focusing too much on the wonders of technology is a distraction to understanding the more serious business of tech industry politics and power, and how that power is wielded around the globe, whether directly through investments, or indirectly through foundations and political campaigns. Arundhati Roy recently summed it up[112] this way: 'As public money gets pulled out of health care and education and all of this, NGOs funded by these major financial corporations and other kinds of financial instruments move in, doing the work that missionaries used to do during colonialism\u2014giving the impression of being charitable organizations, but actually preparing the world for the free markets of corporate capital.' By following the efforts and investments of Omidyar Network in India, we learn an enormous amount about the complex interplay between Big Tech interests and power, the Pax Americana, local oligarchs, and the useful politics of right-wing populism. There is much more to this story, and it doesn't get any less ugly from here. Omidyar Networks did not respond to a request for comment for this article [~12hrs prior to publication].

The real value added, increasingly, comes from the people who can sell and humanize. Which is why tech startups suddenly crave liberal arts majors.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In less than two years Slack Technologies has become one of the most glistening of tech's ten-digit \"unicorn\" startups, boasting 1.1 million users and a private market valuation of $2.8 billion. If you've used Slack's team-based messaging software, you surely recognize that one of its catchiest innovations is Slackbot, a helpful little avatar that pops up periodically to provide tips so jaunty that it seems human.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such creativity can't be programmed. Instead, much of it is minted by one of Slack's 180 employees, Anna Pickard, the 38-year-old editorial director. She earned a theater degree from Britain's Manchester Metropolitan University before discovering that she hated the constant snubs of auditions that didn't work out. After dabbling in blogging, videogame writing and cat impersonations, she found her way into tech, where she cooks up zany replies to users who type in \"I love you, Slackbot.\" It's her mission, Pickard explains, \"to provide users with extra bits of surprise and delight.\" The pay is good; the stock options, even better.</p><p>What kind of boss hires a thwarted actress for a business-to-business software startup? <person><nameText>Stewart Butterfield, </nameText></person>Slack's 43-year-old cofounder and CEO, whose estimated double-digit stake in the company could be worth $300 million or more. He's the proud holder of an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Canada's University of Victoria and a master's degree from Cambridge in philosophy and the history of science.</p><p>\"Studying philosophy taught me two things,\" says Butterfield, sitting in his office in San Francisco's South of Market district, a neighborhood almost entirely dedicated to the cult of coding. \"I learned how to write really clearly. I learned how to follow an argument all the way down, which is invaluable in running meetings. And when I studied the history of science, I learned about the ways that everyone believes something is true--like the old notion of some kind of ether in the air propagating gravitational forces--until they realized that it wasn't true.\"</p><p>Slack's core business benefits from the philosopher's touch. Hard-core engineers have been trying to build knowledge-management software for at least 15 years. Most of their approaches are so cumbersome that corporate users can't wait to quit. Slack makes everything simple. It bridges everything from Dropbox to Twitter, helping users organize documents, photos and data files into streamlined channels for easy browsing. Considering that Butterfield spent his early 20s trying to make sense of Wittgenstein's writings, sorting out corporate knowledge might seem simple.</p><p>And he's far from alone. Throughout the major U.S. tech hubs, whether Silicon Valley or Seattle, Boston or Austin, Tex., software companies are discovering that liberal arts thinking makes them stronger. Engineers may still command the biggest salaries, but at disruptive juggernauts such as Facebook and Uber, the war for talent has moved to nontechnical jobs, particularly sales and marketing. The more that audacious coders dream of changing the world, the more they need to fill their companies with social alchemists who can connect with customers--and make progress seem pleasant.</p><p>Think of the ways the automobile revolution of the 1920s created enormous numbers of jobs for people who helped fit cars into everyday life: marketers, salesmen, driving instructors, road crews and so on. Something similar is afoot today. MIT professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue in a recent book, The Second Machine Age , that today's tech wave will inspire a new style of work in which tech takes care of routine tasks so that people can concentrate on what mortals do best: generating creative ideas and actions in a data-rich world.</p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2022 some 1 million more Americans will enter the workforce as educators. Another 1.1 million newcomers will earn a living in sales. Such opportunities won't be confined to remedial teaching or department store cash\u00adiers. Each wave of tech will create fresh demand for high-paid trainers, coaches, workshop leaders and salespeople. By contrast, software engineers' ranks will grow by 279,500, or barely 3% of overall job growth. Narrowly defined tech jobs, by themselves, aren't going to be the answer for long-term employment growth, says Michael Chui, a partner at McKinsey Global Institute.</p><p>Such nuances elude policy\u00admakers, who can't shake the notion that tech-centered instruction is the only sure ticket to success. President Barack Obama has repeatedly called for more spending on tech-focused high schools. In a February interview with the Re/code website, he hailed computer-programming classes as \"a huge priority,\" adding: \"It can't just be a handful of kids. It's got to be everybody.\"</p><p>In fact, people without a tech degree may already be benefiting the most from tech's boom. Some fascinating insights can be found on LinkedIn, which tracks graduates of specific universities as they move into the workforce. Say hello to the 62,887 LinkedIn members who attended Northwestern University in the past decade. Now zoom in on the 3,426 who have moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the most popular destinations outside the Midwest, as they chase the Silicon Valley dream. Smart call: The Wildcats' top corporate employers include Google, Apple, Facebook, Genentech and LinkedIn.</p><p>Surprisingly, only 30% of these migrants ended up in engineering, research or information technology. As LinkedIn data show, most of the migrants have created nontechnical career paths in Silicon Valley. The list starts with sales and marketing (14%) and goes on to include education (6%), consulting (5%), business development (5%) and a host of other specialties ranging from product management to real estate. Add up the jobs held by people who majored in psychology, history, gender studies and the like, and they quickly surpass the totals for engineering and computer science.</p><p>Run the numbers on recent graduates of Boston University, the University of Texas at Austin or any of the University of California campuses, and the hiring pattern in Silicon Valley is seen to be broadly similar. A case in point is Rachel Lee, who graduated from UC, Berkeley with a communications degree in 2011; now she's an account manager at Slack. She's been at the company for barely a month but she's already helped a construction company assimilate Slack's software to keep track of things as varied as plaster shipments and building regulations via employee smartphones. Lee says she's in awe of her technical colleagues who write Slack's code. They, in turn, respect her because of her untechnical ability to \"connect with end users and figure out what they want.\"</p><p>In Austin Suzy Elizondo can see tech's new power structure every time she looks around the room during customer meetings. She has been working for five years at Phunware, which develops mobile applications for a wide variety of customers, including AT&amp;T, the Houston airport and celebrity astrologers. When she joined the company as a design specialist after earning an advertising degree from UT Austin, she was the odd one out. Most meetings were packed with software engineers.</p><p>Now nontechnical people from clients and from her own company often occupy at least half the seats. The reason: Software development keeps getting more automated. The rise of content libraries and plug-in modules means that mobile apps can be built much faster, with fewer people. But the nontechnical side--getting everyone to agree on what an app should look like--is more labor-\u00adintensive than ever. That means \u00adendless meetings and revisions for Elizondo, who's now a creative director overseeing a seven-person department.</p><p>Mobile technology doesn't only make life more convenient, observes Robert Tabb, a Phunware salesman who visits medical centers all year. Putting easy-to-use information on everyone's smartphone also redefines a lot of people's jobs. And that means lots of intense conversations about how big organizations should reconfigure themselves to handle these dislocations. Tabb sees this upheaval in action every time he approaches hospitals about installing mobile apps that guide patients toward their appointments, even if it's not obvious which corridors lead from the lobby to Room C-713.</p><p>\"It takes about ten meetings for us to get one of these deals put together,\" Tabb says. \"And only two of those meetings are about the technology.\" The rest of the time Tabb earns his keep by practicing shuttle diplomacy. Early on, the patient-relations specialists love his idea, but the building engineers are dubious. Once the physical mapping issues are resolved, new tensions flare up regarding the prominence--or absence--of the medical center's brand on the mobile app. Eventually everyone is happy, and the deal gets done.</p><p>Being able to read the room is such a crucial skill, adds Phunware sales executive Mike Snavely, that he's willing to hire people who don't know much about technology if they have a gift for relating to other people. It doesn't bother him at all that Tabb started out selling running shoes or that Elizondo sells handmade jewelry at weekend crafts fairs as a hobby. Eccentricity, as least relative to the geeks coding all night in the back, sharpens people skills, he finds.</p><p>To be sure, the financial payoff of an engineering degree remains strong. A 2014 report by the American Association of Colleges &amp; Universities found that engineering majors earned an average of about $92,000 a year in their late 30s, compared with about $61,000 for graduates with degrees in the humanities or social sciences. But strong social skills turn out to be just as important as brainpower in determining future earnings potential. Catherine Weinberger, an economist at UC, Santa Barbara, has been analyzing government data on thousands of high school students and the incomes they earn many years later. Among her findings: People with balanced strengths in social and math skills earn about 10% more than their counterparts who are strong in only one area. In fact, socially inept math whizzes fare no better than go-getters who struggle with numbers.</p><p>Big tech employers are widening their hiring horizons beyond the STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math. Larry Quinlan, Deloitte's chief information officer, argues in favor of \"STEAM,\" in which the A stands for the arts. \"It's not enough to be technologically brilliant,\" Quinlan says. \"We need senior people who understand business processes, too.\"</p><p>This summer's fierce race to beef up sales teams is being played out every day in tech companies' hiring notices. Employee-software specialist Workday has 60 open positions in sales, exceeding the 51 in technology development. Ride-sharing king Uber needs 427 more brand ambassadors, partner-support reps and other operations wranglers, compared with just 168 more engineers. Even Facebook--run by die-hard engineer Mark Zuckerberg--has 225 openings right now for sales and business development specialists, compared with just 146 for software \u00addevelopers.</p><p>Bess Yount epitomizes the \u00adnontechie side of Facebook. She earned a Stanford bachelor's degree in communication and a master's in sociology. Outside the classroom she rounded herself out as captain of the lacrosse team. \"I've always had a greater love for words than numbers,\" Yount says. That hasn't been a problem. When she joined Facebook in 2010, the social media company was evolving rapidly beyond its engineer-centric beginnings. Instead of envisioning a day when ads could be booked online without ever talking to a human being, Facebook's leaders began tapping into the benefits of a personal touch.</p><p>As a marketing manager focused on small businesses, Yount is on the road throughout the year, striking a rapport with shopkeepers who were raised on the Yellow Pages. She introduces them to a new era of advertising in which it's possible to target customers by age, gender, time of day, neighborhood and personal affinities. These bewildering new powers (\"Should we target Rihanna fans? Taylor Swift fans? Both?\") seem easier and more inviting in workshops that Yount runs all over the U.S. On a winter trip to the Berkshires, for example, she showed plumbers how to steer lots of ads into homeowners' news feeds right after a cold snap, so that people with frozen pipes would be likely to call.</p><p>Such hand-holding isn't cheap. Facebook spent $620 million on sales and marketing in the first quarter of 2015, nearly double from a year earlier. But the payoff for restoring human contact has been vast. Facebook's ad business, which was tiny in the days when everything was automated, now tops $12 billion a year and is growing more than $1 billion a quarter.</p><p>Even tiny businesses can gain a lot from customized Facebook ads, Yount says, if she can just help them crack the code. At a recent Philadelphia conference she highlighted the ways that diner owners can photograph a freshly baked pie and then use geo-targeting to show that photo to anyone walking within a mile of the shop. \"One woman who did that managed to sell every piece of pie within three hours,\" Yount says.</p><p>In the restaurant industry, Shawna Ramona is the human face of the data revolution. She graduated from San Francisco State in 2002 with a degree in English literature. Now she is an iPad-toting \"restaurant relations manager\" for Open\u00adTable, the online dinner-booking service. She calls on scores of restaurateurs a year, sharing insights that emerge from her company's data team. There's nothing technical in her background, but she knows how to connect with the old guard.</p><p>On a recent Tuesday she visited Umberto Gibin, the proprietor of two of San Francisco's most popular restaurants, Perbacco and Barbacco. He started in the restaurant trade 45 years ago as a teenage waiter in Italy, learning to carve ducks at patrons' tables. Panache defines him; when he bellows \"Arrivederci!\" to a departing guest, the whole restaurant can hear. His world is being rocked, though, by Moneyball -style insights culled from customers' smartphones, checks and online reservation data. Predictive algorithms can tell Gibin how long each guest is likely to linger and which bookings are the likeliest no-shows. \"I'm trying to change with the times,\" Gibin says. \"But I'm a dinosaur when it comes to technology.\"</p><p>Ramona makes the strain go away. She worked in restaurants for much of her 20s, helping manage everything from steak \u00adhouses to sushi bars. She knows when to make small talk about radicchio and when it's time to circle a disappointing metric on her iPad before gently saying: \"There's an opportunity here for you.\"</p><p>OpenTable is a case in point of how the tech sector has widened its horizons. In the late 1990s California chip engineer Chuck Templeton \u00adcreated OpenTable as a pure tech play: enabling anyone to book a meal reservation online, instantly. The general public loved his concept. Most eateries, however, lacked the scheduling software to make it work. So in 2000 OpenTable began putting muscle into building better information technology for restaurants.</p><p>Suddenly OpenTable needed salespeople. Years of selling helped OpenTable slip its software into more than 10,000 restaurants by 2008. That was a fragile triumph, however. Open-Table's engineers kept upgrading the company's seating systems and data analytics, only to discover that restaurateurs weren't paying attention. That created a greater risk of customer churn. If OpenTable wanted strong, lasting connections with restaurant managers and owners, it needed a second team of frontline relationship-builders.</p><p>So OpenTable executives began hunting for people who had waited on tables, tended bar or managed restaurants earlier in their careers. The company was moving beyond its beginnings as an automation tool. The new priority, as sales chief Mike Dodson explains, was to find or train evangelists who could \"show how tech can enrich the dining experience.\" The influx of some 137 people like Ramona has expanded OpenTable into 32,000 restaurants, with only 14 data scientists needed to run its insight-crunching machinery.</p><p>At 4:30 p.m. on a recent Monday Ramona popped into Marlowe, a bistro in the same trendy San Francisco neighborhood where Slack is based. She greeted owner Anna Weinberg, who also owns Park Tavern and another property, with a big hug. The postwork rush hadn't started yet; Marlowe was empty. Moments later the two women were peering at Ramona's iPad, where a giant \"opportunity\" was on display. In the past year, it turned out, thousands of Open-Table users had been told seats weren't available at Park Tavern. Often people were trying to book tables far in advance. But Weinberg's restaurant offered only a 30-day look-ahead.</p><p>\"Some people look two months out,\" Ramona explained.</p><p>\"Fine!\" Weinberg declared. \"Let's do 60 days then. We'll do it for all three of our restaurants.\"</p><p>The next day Ramona worked her Uber account to exhaustion, dashing into a wide variety of San Francisco cafes, bars and restaurants. At a hipster cocktail establishment, Bar Agricole, Ramona let owner Thad Vogler know that he was getting 37% of his online bookings from mobile users, compared with 32% for his peers. Vogler grinned as if he'd just hit the lottery. His restaurant had been doing a big social media push, he explained, and now he knew it was working. \"This kind of input is endlessly valuable,\" he declared.</p><p>In theory OpenTable could send data analysts on the road to share the same information. But Grant Parsamyan, OpenTable's head of business intelligence, shudders at the thought. He's a stocky man who favors plaid shirts at work. While he enjoys fine dining, he admits to being starstruck by the ways top restaurateurs project their authority. \"I wouldn't be effective at all, trying to do what Shawna does,\" Parsamyan concedes.</p><p>When restaurateurs scoff at OpenTable's analysis, Ramona earns her keep. On a recent visit to Town Hall, a San Francisco restaurant that specializes in country ham and other southern-inspired cuisine, Ramona and a colleague, Denise Capobianco, suggested that restaurant manager Bjorn Kock wasn't doing enough to attract large groups.</p><p>Kock bristled. \"Our design does not lend itself to a lot of large parties,\" he declared. Big groups take too long to finish, he explained. Their rush of orders at the same time strains the kitchen. Besides, his restaurant's long, angular layout would make big tables as unwelcome as a boulder in the midst of a stream. \"Those tens!\" he declared with a dismissive sweep of his hand. \"I don't want them in our dining room.\"</p><p>Ramona didn't give up. \"I see your point,\" she said. \"But what about trying an experiment on Sundays, when traffic is lighter. You could offer one ten-seat booking at 5 p.m. That wouldn't strain the kitchen. It might be extra business that you wouldn't get otherwise.\"</p><p>Kock nodded his head. \"That could work,\" he declared. \"I'm totally willing to play around with that possibility.\" And thus the digital revolution spreads a tiny bit further, thanks to whiz-bang code underpinning OpenTable--and the interpersonal skills of an English major.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORBES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORBES2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GJY-XC11-JBKP-90N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3200\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15305\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 196</volume><issueNumber>No. 2</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>August 17, 2015</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEHO</classCode><className>TECHNICIANS &amp;

One of the central findings of the World Payments Report (2018) is that demand is being driven by emerging and frontier economies.

Not only were career prospects brighter in India, something that was unthinkable a generation ago, their homeland now offered many of the West's comforts: gated housing enclaves, gyms, shopping malls, Italian restaurants and even coffee shops with whiffs of the knee-weakening aroma of Java that characterises the air abroad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to a study by recruitment consultancy firm Kelly Services India, nearly 300,000 NRIs will return by  2015. The number could increase if  the US government imposes stiff immigrant visa rules. This phenomenon has been called India's 'reverse brain drain', with India's best minds going overseas only to come back after some years  with their skills enhanced. In an interview with Thefinancialist.com, Anita Raghavan, the US-based author of The Billionaire's Apprentice: The Rise of The Indian-American Elite and The Fall of The Galleon Hedge Fund, says, \"I think a large cohort of Indians will still come to America, but in the past they would have stayed in America and built a life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today,  because of the dazzling array of opportunities in India, they will probably  go home.\"</p><p>The term 'reverse brain drain' sounds catchy, but as with many such complex patterns of migration, it does not capture the whole story. While many NRIs stick with their decision to return to India, quite a few go right back. Initially, coming back feels wonderful to most. The din and quirks of India are fun. Family is close at hand. But after a while, many of these Indians are drawn back to where they were. Some are cases of professional compulsion, but many are decisions to do with lifestyle, children's education, health and safety. What follow are the stories of some people who went back abroad, and they reveal as much about their aspirations as they do about India and their adopted homes.</p><p>Milind Patwardhan is a Mumbai man employed as an R&amp;D professional in America's infotech industry based in Silicon Valley, California. He has been in the US since 1995. In 2002, he moved to India for a 12-month assignment with a choice of staying back after that. Asked what was nice about coming back to India, he says, \"The thought of being together with family, rekindling old friendships, experiencing the luxuries of an expat package as well as the emergence of India in the context of BRIC nations [Brazil, Russia, India, China].\"</p><p>Patwardhan, however, chose to return to the US. He lists his reasons: \"It was the inability to adjust [to India] despite my best efforts, realising that lives and people change and things move on, and that what I was looking forward to was probably locked in [an old] context and time.\" He was also disturbed by the corruption in the country, as also a deterioration of values among the young, as he saw it. \"Though you see extreme acts such as mass school shootings in the US, when it comes to grassroots rules and regulations, the US system is very high up on [the scale of] fairness and justice for all,\" says the father of two.</p><p>These factors, coupled with professional logic-his contacts network and market for skills were still in the US  and Europe-put Patwardhan back on the plane to America. He says he is willing to return to India so long as he is able to manage his assets and liabilities  irrespective of where he stays and lead a quality life.</p><p>Ajay Kela, a 1981 graduate of IIT-Bombay, is a senior member of India's infotech fraternity in the US. Currently CEO of Wadhwani Foundation, a non-profit organisation management company aiming to accelerate economic growth in India and other emerging markets, Kela spent 22 years in Silicon Valley before moving to Bangalore in 2003. Kela's wife and two children shifted to Bangalore as well. But last year, after nearly a decade in India, his family returned to the US. The main reason for this was not any of the usual. Kela wanted to expose his children to foreign countries in their formative years. It is why he had brought them to India. It is also why he sent them back to the US.</p><p>\"There were three reasons why we moved to India,\" Kela says. \"The first was that I wanted my kids to experience another country. They were four and six [years old] then. I think kids need to be more global in their experience these days. You cannot be one-dimensional. If you have lived in India, you should live elsewhere for a while and vice-versa.\"  The second reason was his career. India's software industry was doing well, but Indian firms were mostly doing backend work. Kela had a rare opportunity to set up a software company in Bangalore, Symphony Services India Pvt Ltd-of which he was managing director and chief mentor-that would go out and generate revenue. That excited him. The third reason was that he did not see relocation as an emotional or logistical strain. \"For my father's generation, even changing a city or a job was difficult. When we moved to India, we thought 'No big deal, if we don't like it, we can move back.' I didn't feel I was uprooting myself or my family.\"</p><p>The Kelas spent a reasonably happy ten years in India. \"As a company, [Symphony] flourished. The kids were flourishing too,\" Kela says. \"I have three siblings and my parents in India. Reconnecting with extended family was excellent. Had my kids been in the US  in this phase of their lives, the bonding with their extended family would not have happened.\"</p><p>But after almost ten years, Kela felt the kids had absorbed enough of India. And there were a few aspects of life in the US that the family missed. \"In India, your standard of living goes up but quality of life diminishes,\" Kela says. \"The moment you step out of your cocoon, it is a mess. We loved to go on hikes and long road trips in the US. Marin County has some beautiful hiking trails and we often  went there. Also, we once did a 3,000-mile road trip in ten days, covering Yosemite, Reno, Disneyland [among other places].</p><p>These are some of the things you cannot do in India. You drive 45 minutes in Bangalore, you are tired. Also, my children are athletes. They were at the top level in India. In the US, they are nowhere. And in India they would participate in three or four meets a year. In the US, there are 21 meets in a four-month athletics season. It is only when you compete with the best, and on a regular basis, that you improve.\"</p><p>Asked if he'd bring his family back to India, Kela says that he'd rather his  children experienced China or a European country.</p><p>Considerations of the well-being and prospects of children are often a determining factor in decisions to go back abroad. Kalyani Balaji, a therapist with Sparrow Health System in Okemos, Michigan, is candid about her India experience, especially about the attitude of schools here. Kalyani, her husband Balaji Srinivasan and their two children shifted to Chennai in 2006 after over a decade in the US. The experiment did not go well.</p><p>\"We shifted mainly hoping to be  closer to family. The big tech growth [in India] encouraged us in that decision,\" says Kalyani, whose husband is an  infotech professional. Asked about the experience, she says, \"Being near family is probably the best thing. Other than that, we are not very attracted to India, even though there is an emotional  attachment.\"</p><p>They faced problems of various kinds.The hassle of enrolling their children  in school was the last straw. \"School admissions are a horror,\" Kalyani says. \"Have you seen an application to elementary school and the ridiculous questions they ask, not to mention parent interviews in addition to these exorbitant  so-called donations? Frustration [over this] was a major concern. Re-enrolling kids in school in the US only required  an e-mail.\"</p><p>Kalyani does not foresee moving back to India. Her children too are at home in the US. \"My kids love visiting India to see grandparents, cousins and relatives. [But] they have always known the US as home. At this stage, we feel the kids are benefiting from the US educational system. There is some stress involved in [the American] high school syllabus, but there is still time for my kids to pursue music, dance and sports.\"</p><p>While the family's experience of India was difficult, almost seven years on, Kalyani does feel that they could perhaps have been more patient. \"I know that our struggles are not unique and have been encountered not just by us, but by every parent, be it Indian or America-returned Indian,\" she says. \"We have not been conditioned to endure the little stresses of life [in India] and were not patient enough. There are a lot of things I might do differently now that I have hindsight.\"</p><p>Ashish Walavakar, an infotech consultant in Hartford, Connecticut, was also not very comfortable with his daughter's school when he came back to India in 2003. He thought the work culture here was poor as well. And he disliked the bumpy roads and traffic that made his commute an ordeal.</p><p>A Dadar boy, Walawalkar studied engineering at Bombay University and got a job in the US in 1995. He came back to Mumbai in 2003. \"As the IT industry and India in general was booming, I decided to come back, anticipating much improved standards of living. With my parents being in India, there was no reason I had to stay away from my country,\" he says. He enjoyed the perks of the move: \"A good salary, standard of living, being with relatives, food and festivals.\"</p><p>But then, the downside began to register. Asked what the difficulties were, Walawalkar says, \"The commute. The roads and traffic were still in terrible condition, although claimed otherwise. [Also, the trauma of] adjusting to the social structure in general-especially the school atmosphere for my daughter and to the still-backward work culture for me-and of seeing Indian politics and life entangled in corruption and injustice.\"</p><p>Walawalkar's employer sent him again to the US on a prolonged assignment. A couple of years later, his wife and daughter rejoined him. \"I was worried how tough it was going to be for my daughter in the long run [in India].\" Asked to specify what problems his daughter faced, he says, \"They were not problems; it was more about the difficulty adjusting to the school atmosphere. Crowded school, sanitation, the way teachers deal with students. In the US kids are appreciated for everything, whereas in India it is very straightforward. And finally, the way students study. In India, you have by-heart [memorising], whereas in the US it is more about understanding the concept and applying it practically. While I say this, she was a topper right from the beginning in her school and the teachers and principal appreciated it very much and gave her a lot of exposure.\"</p><p>Walawalkar says he is open to moving back to India as long as he does not have to work here.</p><p>Brijesh Khergamkar, an IIT-Bombay and IIM-Ahmedabad graduate, works as a techie in San Francisco. In 2011, he and his wife Yaffa Truelove moved to Delhi temporarily from the US. Khergamkar had a project there while Truelove was doing research with a jhuggi cluster in Vasant Kunj, Delhi, on the politics of water access in the city. Though they lived in Delhi only from October 2011 to July 2012, it was long enough for them to learn enough of life in North India. There were some positive things they saw. \"Tech companies in Noida were more professional than, say, in San Antonio,\" Khergamker says. But the bureaucracy, street culture and infrastructural shortcomings tested their patience.</p><p>\"We came for potentially a year's stay,\" Khergamkar says. \"So I got a car and house. Living in Delhi was difficult. I got blindsided by quite a few things. I had  to make 18 trips between the FRRO and the Ministry of External Affairs office  to convert my wife's visa into a spouse visa. There was also a water shortage at home. You had to carry water in buckets. Wires would be of inferior quality... You have to give yourself six months to get used to things.\"</p><p>There were safety concerns as well, given the notorious Indian male gaze and Delhi's crime rate. \"My wife said that in India you become aware of your identity as a woman,\" says Khergamker. \"On the Metro, if there was a girl in jeans, just the way people looked at her was a social experiment. My wife never went out alone after dark. We went out only with people we knew. It's about contacts. If you find a reliable taxi driver or electrician, you stick with him.\"</p><p>Once their work was done, the couple returned to the US.

YonhapBy Lee Min-hyungBanks are raising their voices against the government's 'reverse discrimination' against traditional financial players, as authorities take open-data policies favorable to non-conventional finance business operators - such as Naver and Kakao, industry official said Monday.The complaint comes amid their growing concern that the two emerging players will speed up their expansion in the banking industry on the back of deregulatory policies by the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The so-called 'MyData' project, which the government plans to start this month, is one example of reverse discrimination against existing lenders, they argued. The project will allow financial firms to share customers' personal information - such as their address, age and bank accounts - with other MyData project participants. About 120 companies - such as banks, card firms, fintech players and the two big tech companies - plan to join the project.Banks argue that Naver and Kakao will take advantage of the project by gaining access to such information from traditional financial players, but the latter has little to benefit from the two companies.'Banks will share almost a full scope of information to the companies, but they will provide only some limited amount of information to lenders,' an official from one of the nation's major lenders said on condition of anonymity.'The new finance business players gain a lot more from the project than conventional lenders due to the asymmetry of information.'Under the MyData project, Naver Financial, the finance business affiliate of the nation's dominant portal operator, will share data regarding customers' payment on Naver Financial, but the company does not have to open massive sets of data piled on the portal platform.If financial authorities continue to take such policies, existing financial firms will fall prey to Naver - which does not have a license to operate the banking business - and other emerging players whose primary business is not centered on finance, according to the source.'Conventional banks strictly abide by the financial regulation, but Naver Financial is seeking to expand its presence by taking advantage of such an indirect method,' the official said. </p><p>'Naver cannot launch any services regarding bank accounts, as it is not a licensed finance player. But it appears able to do so by forming a partnership with securities or capital companies.'Given the firm's influence in the local internet market, the company can easily expand its user base for the finance business even without a license, which is a big discrimination against existing lenders, he said.Leaders of the nation's five largest financial holding firms - such as KB and Shinhan - were also known to have expressed a similar complaint to FSC Chairman Eun Sung-soo in mid-July when they held a closed-door breakfast meeting.The financial players have had to keep a low profile when financial authorities have pushed for deregulation in the financial industry with the focus on fintech and tech-driven platform giants. This is because traditional players have for decades had to walk on eggshells on the authoritative power of the FSC.But with the rapid rise of emerging finance players casting a sense of crisis on conventional lenders, they are calling on authorities to enact more balanced policies to benefit both traditional and emerging players.'We need to minimize side effects from innovation led by big tech companies,' Eun said last month. 'The FSC will build a foundation for customers' financial safety and fair competition before the tech companies make major inroads into the finance industry.'The FSC is now in a position to continue carrying out the MyData project without any change in stance over the growing complaints from banks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KX-W9F1-JCBN-5013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp; Employment Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>Reverse Discrimination</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0E2ODAxRjhEMUI1NENDREI2OTBDMDM1RDI5NERBRjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mjc5OTVCOEUxNzU4NDdDNDhCMjBGNkE0REQ1MEFGQjA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000477</classCode><className>DEREGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYDJ</classCode><className>DISCRIMINATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLGK</classCode><className>PUBLIC RECORDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp; OTHER INVESTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001030</classCode><className>LICENSES &amp; PERMITS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090O3</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000962</classCode><className>WEBSITES &amp; PORTALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM31</classCode><className>OPEN DATA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp; OTHER INVESTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

By Franklin Foer. Penguin Press. 257 pages. $27.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Silicon Valley's achievements are typically viewed through the lens of innovations that have transformed modern life. We can go back a few decades and look to Intel's development of the integrated circuit, for instance, or Apple's reimagining of the personal computer. More recent are planet-spanning websites, such as Facebook; search engines that resemble magic mirrors, such as Google's; and bazaars without end, such as Amazon's.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of us over 35 see this as a mixed blessing, of course: Access to wondrous technological tools has also brought us too much email, too many distractions and too much vulnerability: hackings, trollings, stalkings and worse. But what if the trade-offs are much larger than we realized?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the midst of our digital lives, Franklin Foer argues, doesn't it seem possible that Silicon Valley's darkest, stealthiest triumph has been to merge personal technologies that improve our efficiency with personal technologies that alter our humanity?</p><p>On a basic level, Foer's book aims to expose the dangers that technology giants Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon pose to our culture and careers. In their methods of consumer observation and data gathering, and in their intention to replace human decisionmaking with merciless algorithms, these companies, Foer says, \"are shredding the principles that protect individuality.\"</p><p>It's even worse than that, actually. Bent on dominating our markets as well as the world, the four corporations have lulled us into a sense of pliant dependency as they influence our thinking and activities.</p><p>Far more powerful than the elite \"gatekeeping\" institutions of the past, which were the major television networks, for example, or the leading newspapers, this fearsome four, as Foer characterizes them, are the new arbiters of media, economy, politics and the arts.</p><p>By making their services cheap and indispensable, and by tailoring their complex algorithms to our data profiles, they can gently push us toward products they want us to buy or, say, YouTube videos they want us to watch. Yet the methods by which we get such recommendations for news, consumer goods, movies, music, friends and the like remain opaque.</p><p>The heart of the problem, as Foer sees it, \"is that when we outsource thinking to machines, we are really outsourcing thinking to the organizations that run the machines.\" It's an important distinction. Foer isn't an anti-technology zealot; he cops to being a Twitter addict and an enthusiastic user of screens and smartphones, even as he admits that his favorite indulgence is reading a book in his bathtub at home.</p><p>What he most wants us to see is how the companies that dominate the world technology ecosystem have assumed the roles of monopolists, even if by an economist's definition they more closely resemble oligopolies, which is to say they are immensely powerful within certain markets (Web search, for instance, or social media) where there is limited competition.</p><p>I don't think he's exaggerating the point. As the investors Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen make clear, in the tech business, monopoly is not a forbidden zone but a desired destination. And as Foer notes, Andreessen has even argued that it may be the natural order of things, that while normal markets might have a Coke and a Pepsi competing against each other, \"in technology markets in the long run you tend to only have one.\"</p><p>Monopolies or quasi-monopolies that seem to be exploiting consumers, such as Western Electric, AT&amp;T, IBM, Microsoft, have of course long been targets for government scrutiny. But Foer thinks advanced technologies may be creating a more dangerous situation than what we've experienced in the past. Tech companies' wealth, market share, ingenuity and growing power on Capitol Hill make them increasingly formidable.</p><p>As Foer frequently points out, \"We have begun to outsource our intellectual work to companies that suggest what we should learn, the topics we should consider.\"</p><p>But by carving out for themselves immense networks of influence and intelligence, these companies, he argues, also have developed what may prove to be unassailable advantages. They know our preferences better than their upstart competitors ever could, so the more they win, the more they win. And the longer this goes on, Foer fears, the worse it will get.</p><p>The first half of Foer's book is a takedown of what he terms the \"sham populism\" of the big tech companies. While he often seems less critical of Apple, he is scathing on the ambitions of Google's Larry Page, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Foer eventually moves his argument in a more personal direction: toward his experiences as an editor at the New Republic magazine, where he was vanquished by a data-driven owner who bought the magazine with wealth gained from his Facebook stock. Foer's overly sentimental attachment to the magazine narrows the shock-and-awe attack he began waging at his book's start. But it does allow him to illustrate the difficulties of trying to run a struggling cultural institution in the digital age, and it gives him insight into how the Web environment created by the technology behemoths exerts pressure on magazines and newspapers to make knowledge free online, often with diminishing returns to the content producers.</p><p>Also, it leads him toward some prescriptions for lessening the dangers he perceives. For one thing, we need the hand of government to intervene. One start would be to give citizens some control over information that tech companies collect.</p><p>Foer's writing is deft enough to make this a relentless intellectual argument. He pens at least a few dubious, attention-grabbing sentences of caricature and fear-mongering. His essential point seems that at the very least we should pause and consider acting, on a public and a personal level, before we find that we've lost more of our individuality, agency and spontaneity than we ever bargained for.</p><p>We might ask if this is an unwinnable battle. We love technology; we need technology. And in an era when regulation has increasingly fallen out of favor, the likelihood in the near future of a tight yoking of big tech seems unlikely. But I don't think it's unreasonable to believe, judging by the growth trajectory and ravenous appetites of the tech giants, that their day of reckoning will come, as it came for monopolies such as Western Union and AT&amp;T.</p><p>Until then, Foer suggests that refusenik decisions such as reading a book on paper, say, rather than in an electronic format, which allows for the collection of information on our reading habits, are a good place to draw the line. Now, isn't that silly and small bore? At first I thought so, but then his modest argument struck me as having both symbolic and practical import. It's a starter kit for thinking deeper. Even if innovations in personal technology can't be stopped, their true value should always be questioned. And embracing some technologies while rejecting others is not an instance of hypocrisy. As Foer reminds us, the stakes are high, the marketing pitch is deafening, and saying no to big tech, at least sometimes, is an increasingly crucial matter of personal choice and civic responsibility.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC59de3c48d942aimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech\" by Franklin Foer</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Penguin Press</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTCUR-33dbdff8ae9911e7a4fa00163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTCUR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PPR-8381-DYTB-K4SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1220\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Post and Courier All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Post &amp;

We might begin by cheering while ascendant tech monopolies claim more and more of the public sphere; we might allow our attitudes and tastes to then be moulded by those monopolies; we might stand by while privacy collapses, authorship is disregarded and intellectual property goes undefended; we might watch choices become automated and lives become directed by algorithms; we might allow Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon to concentrate their powers to such a degree that divergent conversations, idiosyncratic ideas, become like so many Davids against a few Goliaths in the cloud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, all that has already happened. Or so goes the argument in Franklin Foer's lucid and ambitious new book, World Without Mind, which paints a grim portrait of intellectual life in an online world.</p><p>Back in 2005, <person><nameText>Sergey Brin, </nameText></person>one of the founders of Google, told a journalist, \"Perhaps in the future, we can attach a little version of Googlethat you just plug into your brain.\" Happy day. In our present age of Russian news bots and Facebook-filtered politics, Brin's musing about a jacked-in supplement to human intelligence sounds more than naive; it sounds deeply dangerous. And it is that danger Foer confronts as he details not just the business ambitions but the screwy philosophies that animate the empires of Brin, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Jeff Bezos and all of Silicon Valley's oligarchs. A dream of oneness and permanent connection fuels their desire for total monopolies.</p><p>What the Zuckerbergs of the world see as a utopian whole, the Foers of the world see as a homogenized populace with a deeply constrained ability to originate new ideas. Algorithms, he warns, \"remove humans from the whole process of inquiry.\" What's more, when a company's algorithm nudges you this way or that, it always \"reflects the subconscious of its creators.\"</p><p>Foer is an ex-editor of The New Republic and during his tenure there he had his own run-in with California's chosen tribe. The New Republic, long a bastion of intellectual liberalism, struggled through the early 2000s (as with most publications). When Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes purchased the magazine in 2012 - a vanity project, charged many - he brought an infusion of cash and the sort of radiant optimism only a twentysomething billionaire can muster. However, when The New Republic failed to produce the hockey-stick growth that tech startups aspire to, Hughes infamously canned Foer and put the magazine up for sale. It is difficult not to read World Without Mind, then, as a thinly veiled response to this affront - the bookish Foer getting in his rejoinder after the humiliation of watching Hughes toy with a pillar of American letters.</p><p>Whatever the instigation, Foer is smart and trenchant when he attacks. The book is, of necessity, fast-moving, though - there's a great deal of ground to cover and sometimes it reads like a series of dispatches more than a single arc. Such breeziness has its casualties; his take on Marshall McLuhan seems oversimplified, the tech overlords too easily become bogeyman. And yet the argument does pile up. Only a Snapchat employee could read Foer's book without alarm. Tech monopolies insist on their own style of thought, elbowing aside anything that fails to go viral within those narrow parameters. This amounts to de facto censorship, a silencing of the odd and untested; ultimately, for Foer, tech monopolies bring on an impoverishment of public discourse and then an imperilling of democracy itself. (And who, watching the news, would doubt him?)</p><p>Foer's solution is antitrust law - the body of laws we rely on to prevent monopolies and maintain a competitive economy. He makes the trenchant point that, while our antitrust laws are thought of as saving the public from monopolies that would worsen the consumer experience, \"some of the biggest corporations in America now give their products away for free   \" and so we begin to think that monopolies don't need to be broken apart any more. (Foer points out that the Obama administration brought forward only two cases against existing monopolies.) We need a new approach to antitrust law, one with a different end in mind: a mission of preserving a competitive thought economy where new ideas, strategies and approaches are allowed to have their day. The alternative, argues Foer, is an Orwellian morass controlled by a handful of thought authorities.</p><p>Those who doubt whether tech giants have an interest in policing public thought should consider the charge that Googledonates enormous sums to dozens and dozens of non-profit groups in an effort to expand the company's \"public policy toolbox,\" allowing them to derail the formation of regulations that would threaten their monopoly. (In the European Union, where Googlehas less political influence, they were struck with a $2.7-billion (U.S.) antitrust penalty this summer.)</p><p>Foer subtitles his book \"The existential threat of big tech\" - and the recklessness of Silicon Valley's assault on intellectual life does, here, feel epic. Global villages have global stakes. Unfortunately, so long as Trump-style tycoons hold office, Foer's solution - real government oversight, a new fleet of antitrust laws with updated weaponry - will remain as unlikely as it is needful.</p><p>Michael Harris is the author of Solitude and The End of Absence, which won the Governor-General's Literary Award for Non-Fiction</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: Review: Franklin Foer's World Without Mind explores the dangers of tech monopolies</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20170922escenic_36363670</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ3-K151-JCS0-V2XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><timeReceived>9:14 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

The multibillion dollar industry has exploited those flaws, and Kirby Dick (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/movies/the-invisible-war-directed-by-kirby-dick.html\">\u201cThe Invisible War,\u201d</url> \u201cTwist of Faith\u201d), the documentary\u2019s director, spotlights infuriating examples and conflicts of interest.</p><p>We learn of former F.D.A. officials hired by companies they once regulated, and see business executives named to government positions. That revolving door has been reported elsewhere, and often. Yet as outlined here, corporate influence has reached a point that might seem comical were patients\u2019 lives not being wrecked.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/a-documentarian-focused-on-trauma-in-its-many-forms/\">Mr. Dick</url> smartly summarizes complex procedures and cites exasperating statistics. His script is better still at introducing people affected by the products. The interviewers \u2014 Amy Ziering, aided by Amy Herdy and Mr. Dick \u2014 coax out dozens of quotes and anecdotes you\u2019ll wish were heard by every government official.</p><p>Ana Fuentes, a mother of four, chose Essure as a contraceptive. She and others say they have experienced excruciating pain since being implanted with it. (Last week, Bayer, the maker of Essure, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/health/bayer-essure-birth-control.html\">said it will end sales of the device.</url>) Ms. Fuentes says she is now unable to work because of complications. Her experiences described here, and the toll they take on her children, are heartbreaking.</p><p>Stephen Tower, a physician, received a chrome-cobalt replacement hip, which he suspects poisoned him and led to a mental breakdown. Another segment, on complications said to be caused by vaginal mesh, is particularly harrowing; the mesh, whose potential to create serious problems was long known, \u201ccosts about $25 to bring to market, and they sell for about $2,000,\u201d says an obstetrician. In such cases, if there\u2019s a disagreement between the marketing and the medicine, \u201cthe marketing is always going to win out,\u201d says a lawyer for injured patients.</p><p>A sales representative, whose identity is shielded, discusses financial incentives used to coax surgeons to implant devices: \u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse over time because of greed.\u201d An onscreen statistic notes that medical companies paid doctors more than $2 billion in 2016.</p><p>\u201cThe Bleeding Edge\u201d isn\u2019t an anti-medical film, but a look at calamities caused when the obsession for profit overwhelms an industry. Mr. Dick uses no devious camera tricks, and the soundtrack, by Jeff Beal, is tense yet restrained. Indeed, the filmmakers aren\u2019t shouting \u201cFire\u201d in a crowded theater. For them and their subjects, the inferno has already occurred. Now they\u2019re sweeping up the ashes, and warning of new blazes sure to come.</p><p> The Bleeding Edge Not rated.

The vast majority of the searches were conducted by state and local criminal justice organizations, he noted.</p><p> The attorney general reported that access to Ohio's facial-recognition database is strictly controlled and limited to legitimate law enforcement purposes, such as combating identity theft and aiding in crime scene investigations and missing-person cases.</p><p> He also noted that, even though the facial-recognition database is a tool that law enforcement can use in investigations, the evidence it provides is just one piece of the investigative puzzle and typically does not stand alone in building a case.</p><p> Yost ordered a 30-day review of Ohio's facial-recognition system after an article in The Washington Post noted the potential for federal agencies to use state databases of driver's license photos as a surveillance tool.</p><p> \"I share the privacy and civil-liberty concerns of those who fear misuse of this powerful identification technology,\" Yost said. \"Ohio's database is protected by limited access, regular auditing and strict rules about the kind of searches that can be conducted. That applies to state and local law enforcement as well as federal law enforcement.\"</p><p> The report points out that, during the period of review, local, state and federal law enforcement agencies ran 11,070 searches in Ohio's facial-recognition database. Of those, just 418 were conducted by federal agencies, including the U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Department of State/Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, FBI, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals Service and the NASA Glenn Research Center.</p><p> The rest \u2013 10,652 searches \u2013 were conducted by state or local law enforcement agencies, courts or other criminal justice agencies.</p><p> The attorney general said it's important to remember that driver's license photos are expressly required and intended to be a means for government to identify people. Anyone who applies for a driver's license understands that he or she will be photographed and that the government will use that photo for identification purposes, he said.</p><p> \"Not only is the license photo used to identify you in traffic stops by police officers, it is routinely used for identification by other government agencies, and also by businesses and other private-sector institutions,\" Yost said. \"It also is a safeguard for the licensee, since use of photo IDs makes it harder for a criminal to impersonate someone else.\"</p><p> Yost also noted that in the private sector, Big Tech is on the cutting edge of facial recognition, with services such as Google, Facebook and Apple rapidly improving the technology and expanding their photo collections, often without the knowledge of those whose images are being appropriated.</p><p> \"They are doing this with far less scrutiny and regulation than my agency imposes on law enforcement users of Ohio's facial-recognition system,\" Yost said. \"This raises concerns about facial-recognition technology, and I am ready to work with all those interested in improving rules, transparency and safeguards to prevent abuses.\"</p><p> \"But I want to emphasize that the OHLEG facial-recognition system is being used lawfully, carefully and within strict limits,\" Yost said.</p><p>Ohio's facial-recognition database is maintained by BCI, which is part of the Ohio Attorney General's Office. It is just one of 22 applications and data sets that make up the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway, an online search system known as OHLEG. This electronic information network allows law enforcement entities and other criminal justice agencies to share crime data efficiently and securely.</p><p> Those with access include local and state law enforcement agencies, federal law enforcement agencies, courts and government agencies that include divisions with investigative powers, such as an inspector general. All users of the facial-recognition portion of OHLEG are Ohio-based or, in the case of federal agencies, have offices in Ohio. And although there are some out-of-state users of other parts of the OHLEG system, no out-of-state agencies have access to the facial-recognition system, the review found.</p><p> Access to the facial-recognition database is more restricted than that for other OHLEG databases and is available only to law enforcement officers who submit a separate, additional application to OHLEG. OHLEG currently has 25,558 active users, Yost said, but just 4,549 have facial-recognition access.</p><p> To control access, every user of the facial-recognition system must obtain approval from his or her agency head before being assigned a unique log-on, the report noted, and all searches must be conducted for a legitimate law enforcement purpose under strict guidelines. Each search is recorded for review. OHLEG use, including the facial-recognition database, is audited by auditors from the Ohio Attorney General's Office and by independent outside auditors to detect abuse.</p><p> The OHLEG facial-recognition database currently has 24 million images, Yost reported. More than 21 million of these were supplied by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles in 2013, and all of those images date from 2011 or earlier. An additional 2.4 million images were supplied by the Ohio Supreme Court. The remainder came from various Ohio law enforcement agencies and from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. The use of photos from the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles for law-enforcement purposes is authorized under state and federal law, Yost said.</p><p> The full report is available online.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-c1cf8ca69f8aa148ae6bbd7f10cf488cb75c7d9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A8FE97806AB NWBKOH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVB-9H61-DXVP-V1G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1103\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Pike County News-Watchman.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Or so goes the argument in Franklin Foer's lucid and ambitious new book, World Without Mind, which paints a grim portrait of intellectual life in an online world.</p><p>Back in 2005, <person><nameText>Sergey Brin, </nameText></person>one of the founders of Google, told a journalist, \"Perhaps in the future, we can attach a little version of Google that you just plug into your brain.\" Happy day. In our present age of Russian news bots and Facebook-filtered politics, Brin's musing about a jacked-in supplement to human intelligence sounds more than naive; it sounds deeply dangerous. And it is that danger Foer confronts as he details not just the business ambitions but the screwy philosophies that animate the empires of Brin, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Jeff Bezos and all of Silicon Valley's oligarchs. A dream of oneness and permanent connection fuels their desire for total monopolies.</p><p>What the Zuckerbergs of the world see as a utopian whole, the Foers of the world see as a homogenized populace with a deeply constrained ability to originate new ideas. Algorithms, he warns, \"remove humans from the whole process of inquiry.\"</p><p>What's more, when a company's algorithm nudges you this way or that, it always \"reflects the subconscious of its creators.\"</p><p>Foer is an ex-editor of The New Republic and during his tenure there he had his own run-in with California's chosen tribe. The New Republic, long a bastion of intellectual liberalism, struggled through the early 2000s (as with most publications). When Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes purchased the magazine in 2012 - a vanity project, charged many - he brought an infusion of cash and the sort of radiant optimism only a twentysomething billionaire can muster. However, when The New Republic failed to produce the hockey-stick growth that tech startups aspire to, Hughes infamously canned Foer and put the magazine up for sale. It is difficult not to read World Without Mind, then, as a thinly veiled response to this affront - the bookish Foer getting in his rejoinder after the humiliation of watching Hughes toy with a pillar of American letters.</p><p>Whatever the instigation, Foer is smart and trenchant when he attacks. The book is, of necessity, fast-moving, though - there's a great deal of ground to cover and sometimes it reads like a series of dispatches more than a single arc. Such breeziness has its casualties; his take on Marshall McLuhan seems oversimplified, the tech overlords too easily become bogeyman. And yet the argument does pile up. Only a Snapchat employee could read Foer's book without alarm. Tech monopolies insist on their own style of thought, elbowing aside anything that fails to go viral within those narrow parameters.</p><p>This amounts to de facto censorship, a silencing of the odd and untested; ultimately, for Foer, tech monopolies bring on an impoverishment of public discourse and then an imperilling of democracy itself. (And who, watching the news, would doubt him?) Foer's solution is antitrust law - the body of laws we rely on to prevent monopolies and maintain a competitive economy. He makes the trenchant point that, while our antitrust laws are thought of as saving the public from monopolies that would worsen the consumer experience, \"some of the biggest corporations in America now give their products away for free ... \" and so we begin to think that monopolies don't need to be broken apart any more. (Foer points out that the Obama administration brought forward only two cases against existing monopolies.) We need a new approach to antitrust law, one with a different end in mind: a mission of preserving a competitive thought economy where new ideas, strategies and approaches are allowed to have their day. The alternative, argues Foer, is an Orwellian morass controlled by a handful of thought authorities.</p><p>Those who doubt whether tech giants have an interest in policing public thought should consider the charge that Google donates enormous sums to dozens and dozens of non-profit groups in an effort to expand the company's \"public policy toolbox,\" allowing them to derail the formation of regulations that would threaten their monopoly.</p><p>(In the European Union, where Google has less political influence, they were struck with a $2.7-billion (U.S.) antitrust penalty this summer.)</p><p>Foer subtitles his book \"The existential threat of big tech\" - and the recklessness of Silicon Valley's assault on intellectual life does, here, feel epic. Global villages have global stakes. Unfortunately, so long as Trump-style tycoons hold office, Foer's solution - real government oversight, a new fleet of antitrust laws with updated weaponry - will remain as unlikely as it is needful.</p><p>Michael Harris is the author of Solitude and The End of Absence, which won the Governor-General's Literary Award for Non-Fiction</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20170923bkfoer</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ8-R801-F06S-34V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

When one of the fake teens falls for a fake online conspiracy and attends a fake demonstration, it's juxtaposed against real footage of real violence and real demonstrations, muddying the water between fake and real \u2014 a terrible decision given what this film is about.</p><p> Orlowski would have done better interviewing real teens buffeted by social media and real people caught up in conspiracies. Insulting our intelligence about artificial intelligence is not the way to go.</p><p> The silly dramatizations mar an otherwise excellent documentary that shows how so many Silicon Valley leaders designed ways to keep us engaged online and that led to such things as Pizzagate, international destabilization,higher suicide rates in young people and a boom in depression.</p><p> The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next. That so much online seems free is part of the trap: It's our private data that's being sold. As Aza Raskin, former Firefox and Mozilla Lab worker says: \"Advertisers are the customers. We're the thing being sold.\"</p><p> The film nicely delves into how algorithms that seek to maximize advertising revenue tap into psychology to keep us addicted to our screens. Did a friend just tag me? I got an alert! Hey, Facebook just invited me to an event. Those are all \"positive intermittent reinforcements\" and they keep us checking our phone for more, like a gambler hoping for a windfall at a Vegas slot machine.</p><p> Whether or not these techniques were actively employed, stumbled upon or just a byproduct of a user-engagement model is a little murky. The film offers all sides as to whether software makers consciously exploit human vulnerabilities: The guy who helped create the \"like\" button for Facebook says he wanted to spread love in the world but a former Facebook executive admits purposely creating dopamine-driven feedback loops.</p><p> If there is a hero here it is portrayed by Tristan Harris, an ex-Google executive who is now co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and who hopes to change the system. He and critics like Jaron Lanier, author of \"Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\" explain what the possible consequences are if we continue using our individual digital pacifiers \u2014 lots of cat videos, yes, and also civil war.</p><p> Stick around after the film is over to hear lots of recommendations from former tech leaders who built the mess we're in: They turn off their notifications. They delete many apps. They urge regulation. They don't let their kids use social media. Think about that.</p><p> \"The Social Dilemma,\" a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for some thematic elements, disturbing/violent images and suggestive material. Running time: 94 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-381fe9b07cb35c2a8c39e149e7781a18e302c7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28974E9D92ED57 NWBKOK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T1-PK91-DXVP-V4MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Alva Review-Courier<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed to create addiction and manipulate our behavior, told by some of the very people who supervised the systems at places like Facebook, Google and Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tim Kendall, a former president of Pinterest, admitted that years ago he couldn\u2019t get off his phone even when he came home, despite having two young kids. \u201cI am going to work during the day and building something that then I\u2019m falling prey to,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0\">The documentary</url> is a well paced, absorbing look at the deep costs of Big Tech \u2014 fake news, election security concerns, radicalization, polarization and much more. Only in trying to dramatize those costs does it slip up badly.</p><p>Director Jeff Orlowski interviews former tech execs, historians and social scientists but apparently doesn't trust them enough to tell the story. So he also employs a gimmicky family of five actors \u2014 two parents, three teens \u2014 to dramatize the lure of social media in a clunky way.</p><p>Worse, he also employs an actor \u2014 a weirdly cast Vincent Kartheiser of \u201cMad Men\u201d fame \u2014 to pretend to act like the computer software, sending alluring phone alerts from a console to one of the teens and cuing up videos he knows will be clickbait, while ominous music plays.</p><p>\u201cYes, perfect,\u201d Kartheiser purrs after sending a video of epic skateboard fails to the teen. \u201cHe\u2019s primed for an ad!\" Later: \u201cDon't show him any more sports updates. He doesn't engage.\u201d</p><p>But we know \u2014 from the very talking heads \u2014 that this is an algorithm with no agency other than its program. Why humanize code? And why humanize code by portraying it as a sleazy middle-aged man who acts like a mid-level officer in \u201cMinority Report\u201d?</p><p>The film then steps on itself. When one of the fake teens falls for a fake online conspiracy and attends a fake demonstration, it's juxtaposed against real footage of real violence and real demonstrations, muddying the water between fake and real \u2014 a terrible decision given what this film is about.</p><p>Orlowski would have done better interviewing real teens buffeted by social media and real people caught up in conspiracies. Insulting our intelligence about artificial intelligence is not the way to go.</p><p>The silly dramatizations mar an otherwise excellent documentary that shows how so many Silicon Valley leaders designed ways to keep us engaged online and that led to such things as <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/e0d30f6da17348ce9f354bfd6cb5cd9a/'Pizzagate'-gunman-in-DC-sentenced-to-4-years-in-prison\">Pizzagate</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/0c58cccec2004bf250c8dab38172cbc9\">international destabilization,</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/c8d46d63494d4871b2bbdfc45efc459e\">higher suicide rates in young people</url> and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/Depression\">boom</url> in depression.</p><p>The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next. That so much online seems free is part of the trap: It's our private data that's being sold. As Aza Raskin, former Firefox and Mozilla Lab worker says: \u201cAdvertisers are the customers. We\u2019re the thing being sold.\u201d</p><p>The film nicely delves into how algorithms that seek to maximize advertising revenue tap into psychology to keep us addicted to our screens. Did a friend just tag me? I got an alert! Hey, Facebook just invited me to an event. Those are all \u201cpositive intermittent reinforcements\u201d and they keep us checking our phone for more, like a gambler hoping for a windfall at a Vegas slot machine.</p><p>Whether or not these techniques were actively employed, stumbled upon or just a byproduct of a user-engagement model is a little murky. The film offers all sides as to whether software makers consciously exploit human vulnerabilities: The guy who helped create the \u201clike\u201d button for Facebook says he wanted to spread love in the world but a former Facebook executive admits purposely creating dopamine-driven feedback loops.</p><p>If there is a hero here it is portrayed by Tristan Harris, an ex-Google executive who is now co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and who hopes to change the system. He and critics like Jaron Lanier, author of \u201cTen Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\u201d explain what the possible consequences are if we continue using our individual digital pacifiers \u2014 lots of cat videos, yes, and also civil war.</p><p>Stick around after the film is over to hear lots of recommendations from former tech leaders who built the mess we're in: They turn off their notifications. They delete many apps. They urge regulation. They don't let their kids use social media. Think about that.</p><p>\u201cThe Social Dilemma,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for some thematic elements, disturbing/violent images and suggestive material. Running time: 94 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.</p><p>___</p><p>MPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.

And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive.   It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed to create addiction and manipulate our behavior, told by some of the very people who supervised the systems at places like Facebook, Google and Twitter.   Tim Kendall, a former president of Pinterest, admitted that years ago he couldn\u2019t get off his phone even when he came home, despite having two young kids. \u201cI am going to work during the day and building something that then I\u2019m falling prey to,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d   The documentary is a well paced, absorbing look at the deep costs of Big Tech \u2014 fake news, election security concerns, radicalization, polarization and much more.

So he also employs a gimmicky family of five actors \u2014 two parents, three teens \u2014 to dramatize the lure of social media in a clunky way.

And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive. It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed ...</p><p>\u201cThe Social Dilemma\u201d is the first film you'll watch and immediately want to toss your smartphone into the garbage can. And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive.   It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed to create addiction and manipulate our behavior, told by some of the very people who supervised the systems at places like Facebook, Google and Twitter.   Tim Kendall, a former president of Pinterest, admitted that years ago he couldn\u2019t get off his phone even when he came home, despite having two young kids. \u201cI am going to work during the day and building something that then I\u2019m falling prey to,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d   The documentary is a well paced, absorbing look at the deep costs of Big Tech \u2014 fake news, election security concerns, radicalization, polarization and much more. Only in trying to dramatize those costs does it slip up badly.   Director Jeff Orlowski interviews former tech execs, historians and social scientists but apparently doesn't trust them enough to tell the story. So he also employs a gimmicky family of five actors \u2014 two parents, three teens \u2014 to dramatize the lure of social media in a clunky way.   Worse, he also employs an actor \u2014 a weirdly cast Vincent Kartheiser of \u201cMad Men\u201d fame \u2014 to pretend to act like the computer software, sending alluring phone alerts from a console to one of the teens and cuing up videos he knows will be clickbait, while ominous music plays.   \u201cYes, perfect,\u201d Kartheiser purrs after sending a video of epic skateboard fails to the teen. \u201cHe\u2019s primed for an ad!\" Later: \u201cDon't show him any more sports updates. He doesn't engage.\u201d   But we know \u2014 from the very talking heads \u2014 that this is an algorithm with no agency other than its program. Why humanize code? And why humanize code by portraying it as a sleazy middle-aged man who acts like a mid-level officer in \u201cMinority Report\u201d?   The film then steps on itself. When one of the fake teens falls for a fake online conspiracy and attends a fake demonstration, it's juxtaposed against real footage of real violence and real demonstrations, muddying the water between fake and real \u2014 a terrible decision given what this film is about.   Orlowski would have done better interviewing real teens buffeted by social media and real people caught up in conspiracies. Insulting our intelligence about artificial intelligence is not the way to go.   The silly dramatizations mar an otherwise excellent documentary that shows how so many Silicon Valley leaders designed ways to keep us engaged online and that led to such things as Pizzagate , international destabilization, higher suicide rates in young people and a boom in depression.   The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next. That so much online seems free is part of the trap: It's our private data that's being sold. As Aza Raskin, former Firefox and Mozilla Lab worker says: \u201cAdvertisers are the customers. We\u2019re the thing being sold.\u201d   The film nicely delves into how algorithms that seek to maximize advertising revenue tap into psychology to keep us addicted to our screens. Did a friend just tag me? I got an alert! Hey, Facebook just invited me to an event. Those are all \u201cpositive intermittent reinforcements\u201d and they keep us checking our phone for more, like a gambler hoping for a windfall at a Vegas slot machine.   Whether or not these techniques were actively employed, stumbled upon or just a byproduct of a user-engagement model is a little murky. The film offers all sides as to whether software makers consciously exploit human vulnerabilities: The guy who helped create the \u201clike\u201d button for Facebook says he wanted to spread love in the world but a former Facebook executive admits purposely creating dopamine-driven feedback loops.   If there is a hero here it is portrayed by Tristan Harris, an ex-Google executive who is now co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and who hopes to change the system. He and critics like Jaron Lanier, author of \u201cTen Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\u201d explain what the possible consequences are if we continue using our individual digital pacifiers \u2014 lots of cat videos, yes, and also civil war.   Stick around after the film is over to hear lots of recommendations from former tech leaders who built the mess we're in: They turn off their notifications. They delete many apps. They urge regulation. They don't let their kids use social media. Think about that.   \u201cThe Social Dilemma,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for some thematic elements, disturbing/violent images and suggestive material. Running time: 94 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.   MPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.

Worse, he also employs an actor \u2014 a weirdly cast Vincent Kartheiser of \u201cMad Men\u201d fame \u2014 to pretend to act like the computer software, sending alluring phone alerts from a console to one of the teens and cuing up videos he knows will be clickbait, while ominous music plays.    \u201cYes, perfect,\u201d Kartheiser purrs after sending a video of epic skateboard fails to the teen. \u201cHe\u2019s primed for an ad!\u201d Later: \u201cDon\u2019t show him any more sports updates. He doesn\u2019t engage.\u201d    But we know \u2014 from the very talking heads \u2014 that this is an algorithm with no agency other than its program. Why humanize code? And why humanize code by portraying it as a sleazy middle-aged man who acts like a mid-level officer in \u201cMinority Report\u201d?    The film then steps on itself. When one of the fake teens falls for a fake online conspiracy and attends a fake demonstration, it\u2019s juxtaposed against real footage of real violence and real demonstrations, muddying the water between fake and real \u2014 a terrible decision given what this film is about.    Orlowski would have done better interviewing real teens buffeted by social media and real people caught up in conspiracies. Insulting our intelligence about artificial intelligence is not the way to go.    The silly dramatizations mar an otherwise excellent documentary that shows how so many Silicon Valley leaders designed ways to keep us engaged online and that led to such things as Pizzagate, international destabilization,higher suicide rates in young people and a boom in depression.    The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next. That so much online seems free is part of the trap: It\u2019s our private data that\u2019s being sold. As Aza Raskin, former Firefox and Mozilla Lab worker says: \u201cAdvertisers are the customers. We\u2019re the thing being sold.\u201d    The film nicely delves into how algorithms that seek to maximize advertising revenue tap into psychology to keep us addicted to our screens. Did a friend just tag me? I got an alert! Hey, Facebook just invited me to an event. Those are all \u201cpositive intermittent reinforcements\u201d and they keep us checking our phone for more, like a gambler hoping for a windfall at a Vegas slot machine.    Whether or not these techniques were actively employed, stumbled upon or just a byproduct of a user-engagement model is a little murky. The film offers all sides as to whether software makers consciously exploit human vulnerabilities: The guy who helped create the \u201clike\u201d button for Facebook says he wanted to spread love in the world but a former Facebook executive admits purposely creating dopamine-driven feedback loops.    If there is a hero here it is portrayed by Tristan Harris, an ex-Google executive who is now co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and who hopes to change the system. He and critics like Jaron Lanier, author of \u201cTen Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\u201d explain what the possible consequences are if we continue using our individual digital pacifiers \u2014 lots of cat videos, yes, and also civil war.    Stick around after the film is over to hear lots of recommendations from former tech leaders who built the mess we\u2019re in: They turn off their notifications. They delete many apps. They urge regulation. They don\u2019t let their kids use social media. Think about that.    \u201cThe Social Dilemma,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for some thematic elements, disturbing/violent images and suggestive material. Running time: 94 minutes.
