Then, Facebook refused to implement recommendations of the federal privacy commissioner, ignoring his findings of breach of trust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, like parents who have nurtured their high-tech children in the name of economic development only to watch them grow up and take over the house without heed for consequences, policy-makers don't quite know what to do.</p><p>The most powerful companies in the world, whose market value is growing exponentially, are meeting their day of reckoning in Europe, where lawmakers are introducing regulations, taxes and fines to curtail their power.</p><p>In the United States, one of the co-founders of Facebook called last week for the breakup of the company through antitrust laws. Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren has suggested she wants to break up not just Facebook, but Google and Amazon, too.</p><p>But in Canada, we are only months away from the prime minister posing for ribbon-cutting with the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon, welcoming them to expand their footprints in Canada so they can hire handfuls of people.</p><p>\"The economic development frame has been the driver in this space,\" observes Amanda Clarke, an assistant professor at Carleton University.</p><p>Meanwhile, small businesses, especially in the retail sector, find it harder and harder to expand unless they're on Amazon's good side. Music producers and the news industry are seeing their revenues melt away to the massive advertising and publishing power of Google and Facebook, which take little responsibility for curating quality or adhering to copyright, let alone truth. And alarm bells are ringing about children of all ages, so attached to social media that they no longer know how to conduct face-to-face friendships, let alone romance.</p><p>Big Tech's effects on democracy are only a sliver of the ground-shifting effects of these U.S.-based companies and their giant tentacles.</p><p>It's clear that federal policy-makers want to take action. There has been a notable change in attitude in the past few months, with the photo ops and fawning over Big Tech replaced by a growing mortification at the breaches of privacy, the blind eyes to election interference, and the rapid spread of insidious extremism.</p><p>But the will to take action has not yet turned into a full-fledged plan. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould rolled out a package of measures in January to take aim at foreign influence in elections. The government has passed legislation to reform rules around election advertising. And last week, MPs on the ethics committee took the extraordinary step of issuing a formal summons to Facebook executives, telling them they must appear before international hearings on data and democracy at the end of the month.</p><p>If they don't come, they could be held in contempt of Parliament - a deterrent for some, perhaps, but probably not for a company facing the likelihood of a $5-billion U.S. fine for privacy breaches. And we wonder why they won't listen to Canada's privacy commissioner, with his lack of power to levy financial penalties.</p><p>Galvanized by the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in mid-March, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is heading to France this week to meet with other leaders to sign on to a \"Christchurch call\" list of principles that they hope all governments will follow, and that Big Tech will endorse.</p><p>Trudeau will up the ante in a speech on Thursday at a Big Tech conference, challenging the firms to take responsibility for hatred and extremism. With an election in the offing, he will aim to show strong leadership.</p><p>But at this point, he has a narrow definition of the problems, focused on public safety, privacy and electioneering - and leaving the corporate power issues to another day. Taxation, monopolistic power in advertising, copyright, distortion of markets such as transportation and accommodation - none of those, or other unforeseen disruptions, are on the front burner.</p><p>He also has limited policy options. Canada will work with allies through the G7 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to develop \"best practices.\" But it also has to decide whether it will follow the European Union's hardball regulatory approach to disruption or the more voluntary approach of the United States.</p><p>Here's a quick idea from Clarke: use government procurement to demand higher standards. Governments, she says, have spent years cosying up to technology providers and spending billions on their services. Now is the time to use that purchasing power to at least try to impose some rules around privacy and misinformation.</p><p>Whether Canadian policy-makers can make up for lost time is another question.</p><p>\"We are patching it up,\" Clarke says, \"trying to regain some of that control.\"</p><p>Heather Scoffield is an economics columnist based in Ottawa.

They push extremist content, they are complicit in human rights abuses, they spread spurious information, they undermine democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Angus has also seen social media transform his enormous northern Ontario riding, often for the better. He is an avid user of Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, chatting and advertising to connect with his constituents in remote First Nations communities. And he has been amazed as the constituents - especially Indigenous youth - use the platforms to talk to each other, gaining confidence and knowledge.</p><p>He is hooked by social media's potential to link disparate peoples together, to generate ideas, to collaborate, to start businesses with global reach. But not so hooked, he says, that he is going to sit on the sidelines and take potshots while the technology behemoths steamroll over small business, privacy rights and the roots of democracy.</p><p>\"The days when they can ignore corporate, legal and moral obligations are over. Democratic governments are showing a willingness to take them on with legislation and to break up the monopoly if necessary,\" Angus warns in a press release in which MPs from all parties summon the corporations and experts for an \"international grand committee\" in Ottawa at the end of the month.</p><p>Canadian legislators are looking for a better way, and they are poised to move from the theoretical to the practical. But they are torn between a strong-arm European approach to cracking down on the corporations and how they operate, and a \"wild west\" American approach that relies on voluntary good behaviour.</p><p>Rather than pick a lane, Canada will try to ride the median.</p><p>While there is popular appeal in standing up strong in favour of privacy protections and against the might of powerful corporations (see Europe), there is also a need to be flexible in the face of rapidly changing technology so that businesses can take full advantage of the benefits of technology (see the U.S.). And given that the United States is so integrated into the everyday lives and business of Canadians, compatibility is also a top priority.</p><p>Last Thursday in Paris and a day after signing on to the \"Christchurch call for action\" against online hate speech and extremism, the prime minister vaguely announced his government's intention to set up a \"digital charter\" that would set out some principles for big tech to adhere to. It was a clear indication of taking a middle way and the start of a process that will pick up momentum in the next few weeks.</p><p>\"By allaying people's fears and anxieties, and by restoring trust in the digital world, we can focus on the incredible benefits of technology,\" Justin Trudeau said. \"We can have better banking, more streamlined search, innovative medicine and barrier-free business.\"</p><p>Details for the charter will come from Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains on Tuesday, but the government has already indicated it will set out principles such as accessibility, privacy protection, transparency and control over personal information. It will be mainly aspirational rather than prescriptive, but that part will come too.</p><p>At the end of May in the context of the international grand committee and global meetings on the responsibilities of digital platforms, Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould will roll out more details about legislative steps that could be taken to give the government more clout.</p><p>Trudeau has also indicated that government should be able to impose meaningful financial penalties on big digital companies that don't respect the rules.</p><p>The package of proposals will be deeply inspired by the new U.K. model centred around \"duty of care,\" which makes companies responsible for keeping users of their services safe. A regulator sets safety standards. And there are penalties imposed on any platforms that don't abide by the standards.</p><p>The goal is to shift the onus onto the companies themselves, rather than government officials, to police their own content and behaviour.</p><p>The stakes are high, both in getting the balance right for Canadian businesses and users of social media, and also for Canada's role in the world.</p><p>When Trudeau was in Paris and signing on to the Christchurch call, the United States was conspicuous in its absence. French President Emmanuel Macron was asked pointedly about how he expected to progress without the United States signing on. And twice, Macron pointed to Trudeau's presence as a symbol of a North American alliance with Europe and New Zealand in defeating hate speech on the internet.</p><p>Riding the median may be the Canadian way, but it won't be comfortable.</p><p>Heather Scoffield is an economics columnist based in Ottawa.

As he puts together mandate letters to define expectations for his ministers, here is our own letter-writing attempt with a few suggestions for the finance minister.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dear Minister,</p><p>Congratulations on becoming Canada's finance minister.</p><p>In our platform, we promised Canadians that we would bolster the middle class and help make lives more affordable. As minister of finance, you will be at the front and centre of those policies.</p><p>Implied in our platform is a commitment to maintain a fiscally responsible path that stabilizes the economy, encourages growth, ensures widespread prosperity and protects our most vulnerable - even as the global economy becomes more uncertain and influential.</p><p>Your top priority will be to ensure the disruption that is mounting all around us - in the global economy, in the domestic workforce, and in our politics on Parliament Hill - works to the benefit of Canadians and is a source of opportunity, prosperity and confidence rather than anxiety and harm.</p><p>To that end, here are five areas to work on (in collaboration, of course, with the other political parties):</p><p>Stable finances</p><p>In the months leading up to the federal election campaign, our government made many new commitments for spending. We need to tally those promises up and immediately publish the state of the federal government's books, while also accounting for newly downgraded forecasts for economic growth.</p><p>Once the baseline is established, you need to determine a fiscal track that sets out clear parameters for spending and deficits, and prepares Canada to deal with a downturn or even a recession brought on by trade wars and protectionism. Now that interest rates are at historic lows and the central bank has limited scope to confront a slump, the impetus will be on fiscal policy.</p><p>We should be ready with ideas to make sure any stimulus efforts go straight into the hands of people who will spend it on what the country needs. Our social programs provide some automatic support for the vulnerable but should be reconsidered to reach more people more quickly. You should also put some serious thought into orienting stimulus spending toward dealing with climate change - be it disaster mitigation, home retrofitting or research and development.</p><p>Equalization</p><p>Alberta and Saskatchewan are struggling to deal with the fallout of low oil prices and a hampered ability to take their exports to market. They have asked for a rethink of equalization, and specifically mentioned the fiscal stabilization fund - meant to supplement equalization payments by targeting sudden downturns in individual provinces. The cap on the fund should be lifted and the formula updated to reflect inflation, with an eye to backdating payments for Alberta and Saskatchewan. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has estimated the amount to be $1.7 billion for the 2015-2017 slump in that province.</p><p>Changing the equalization formula itself, however, is only something the federal government should consider if all provinces are onside.</p><p>As finance minister, you should prioritize concrete action on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, negotiating a stake for First Nations business interests and moving to a full sale of the pipeline when market conditions are ripe.</p><p>Tax</p><p>Our election platform committed to cutting income taxes for everyone except the rich - a commitment that should be the first order of business, especially since Conservative support could help with easy passage through the House of Commons. The same could be said for other tax incentives and benefits that were promised - for clean tech, for new parents, for daycare, for students.</p><p>Quick action should also be taken on raising taxes in well-defined areas: luxury goods, real estate speculation, and a new tax on Big Tech companies that make money here.</p><p>Our platform committed to closing corporate tax loopholes, and we trust the finance minister to pursue these loopholes with courage and speed so that we have some extra money to offset the cost of tax cuts.</p><p>Climate</p><p>The carbon tax is here to stay, and you must ensure that it remains close to revenue neutral.</p><p>In order to meet our climate commitments, much more needs to be done, and the finance minister is perfectly placed to work with financial markets and large corporations to amplify their efforts in sustainable finance. You should develop incentives for companies to reduce their emissions, and support efforts that market Canada's expertise in low-carbon financing and sustainable energy. We can develop a competitive advantage here.</p><p>You should work closely with regulators and the Bank of Canada to make sure corporations have completely disclosed their financial exposure to a warming climate, taking steps toward mandatory disclosure unless financial markets force the issue. The risk to the Canadian economy is hard to quantify, and disclosure is a first step to grappling with it.</p><p>Economy of the future</p><p>Canada is not as competitive as it could be when it comes to using its intellectual property and technology to make money. We need to start work immediately on a strategy that pinpoints action on developing a savvy workforce, protecting intellectual property for the benefit of Canada First, and marketing our advantage to attract investment and generate sales.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Heather Scoffield is an economics columnist based in Ottawa.

Network 10 chief operating officer Annabelle Herd said the ACCC's final report on digital platforms would \"be the first big issue that they're going to have to deal with, grapple with\".</p><p>\"We were very encouraged by the ACCC's first report on this, even the fact that it recognises the market power that Google and Facebook have and other digital platforms, and recognises that there are some real challengers for traditional media companies in engaging with those platforms,\" Ms Herd told The Australian.</p><p>The ACCC's preliminary report in December last year outlined 11 recommendations to hold digital platforms to account, including closer scrutiny of their activities by a government agency, tough new data collection rules and overhaul of rules that give them an advantage over traditional media.</p><p>The media industry also wants the government to get rid of old media legislation, including an election advertising blackout law that predates the internet and other data-enabled technologies, including digital platforms.</p><p>Seven West Media chief executive Tim Worner said he wanted an overhaul of Australian content rules, which date back to the 1970s, to reflect changes across the industry and viewing habits and the regulatory imbalance against the tech giants. \"We want to get on with it and hope the government does too,\" Mr Worner said.</p><p>Ms Herd said the regulatory framework was \"just a mess of old platform rules\" that were sometimes applied to new platforms. The inconsistencies were highlighted during the election, with a ban on advertising on radio and television, but not on streaming services owned by those same companies, or YouTube.</p><p>\"You've got media companies that are operating across multiple platforms with different regulatory frameworks applying, depending on what pipe people are receiving content by, which is just crazy, and has to be looked at,\" she said.</p><p>The election ad blackout law was \"the perfect case for the things that are wrong with the framework at the moment\", plus Australian content requirements that dated back to 1961, Ms Herd said.</p><p>Nine Entertainment said it wanted the government to level the playing field for media companies against new, unregulated entrants, adopting the pro-competitive recommendations arising from the digital platforms review and reforming the Australian content rules to reflect how people were watching TV.</p><p>Free TV, which represents the commercial free-to-air TV broadcasters, also urged Morrison's government to act on the ACCC's recommendations and overhaul outdated regulatory frameworks, particularly rules around Australian content.</p><p>Free TV CEO Bridget Fair said another important task was the review of the determination in 2000 under then Communications Minister Richard Alston that streaming was not broadcasting, which is set to expire in October.\"That is probably going to be quite a significant priority for the new minister or if its Minister Fifield again to review,\" Ms Fair said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-95a2865c79fd11e9be442bbed916832ecbf758abea7b16f3f4cade82f6ecdaeb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4X-MGR1-JD3N-52PH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

After this year's slump, analysts are expecting a brighter 2012, and hedge funds are gearing up with riskier bets.Hedge funds, which cater to wealthy investors by chasing higher returns for bigger fees, haven't been living up to high investor expectations this year. Hennessee Group, an adviser to hedge fund investors, said its own hedge fund index is down 3% this year through October, compared with a 0.4% dip on the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis>.</p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"224\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">John Paulson (Paulson &amp; Co.)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\"Renewed optimism about the U.S. economic recovery, Europe's ability to address its debt problems, and China's ability to avoid a hard landing resulted in a remarkable 'risk-on' phase,\" Charles Gradante, co-founder of Hennessee Group, said in an emailed statement. \"It has been an extremely challenging investment environment. We have seen managers get whipsawed due to headline risks, especially related to the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.\"Though returns have been poor and redemptions have been piling up since July, performance is starting to pick up, and investors might find guidance in picking stocks by following where the smart money moved during the third quarter.Heavyweights in the hedge fund world are licking their wounds this year., whose haul of reportedly $5 billion last year was a record for a hedge fund manager, has seen his Advantage Plus fund drop 47% this year through September, according to several media reports that cite investors in the fund. Even Paulson's bet on gold has worked against him, with his gold fund reportedly down about 30% this year.There have been some signs of a turnaround for hedge fund managers like Paulson. Hennessee Group said its hedge fund index rose 2.5% in October, the best monthly gain this year thanks to a rebound in riskier assets. However, the broader-market index<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis>jumped almost 11%, the biggest jump in two decades. TrimTabs has more optimistic news for hedge funds in this riskier climate. Though popular perception may be to the contrary, hedge funds actually have beaten the performance on the S&amp;P 500 over the previous six months, losing only 6.4% to the drop of more than 10% for the broader market.Although TrimTabs says its survey of hedge fund managers reveals they remain downbeat on U.S. equities, sentiment is improving. Bearishness on the S&amp;P 500 decreased to 41% in October from 57% in September, the highest of the year. Meanwhile, bullishness rose to 35% from 16%, the lowest level of 2011. If the worst of 2011 is over for hedge funds, it may pay to look at. Hedge fund and investment managers who manage more than $100 million are required to disclose their equity holdings, options and convertible debt on a Form 13F filed to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Securities and Exchange Commission</emphasis>within 45 days of the end of a quarter. Funds aren't required to report short positions betting on declines, derivatives, bonds or currency bets.TheStreet pored over more than 40 third-quarter regulatory filings by some of the biggest hedge fund managers to examine where the smart money is moving. The most important trends for the quarter, broken down by sector, are highlighted on the following pages.</p><h>Energy</h><p>The energy sector saw plenty of hedge fund activity and it's no wonder why. Through Nov. 10, energy stocks in the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis>are up 3.7% this year, the fourth-best performer of the 10 sectors. In November, energy stocks are up 1.4%, the top gaining sector of the entire S&amp;P 500. This performance comes as crude oil prices have surged from about $80 per barrel in October to more than $100.This upward move in crude prices and energy stocks has likely benefitted a handful of hedge fund managers, assuming they continue to hold shares of oil stocks. David Tepper with Appaloosa Management,, Harbinger Capital's Phil Falcone,andall upped their exposure to energy stocks during the third quarter, It hasn't all been about the recent jump in the price of oil, though. In the third quarter, the energy sector as a whole saw earnings growth of 52%, the highest of any other sector during the quarter and by a wide margin, according to FactSet Research analyst John Butters. In addition, earnings for energy companies in the S&amp;P 500 should climb another 4% in 2012 based on analysts' estimates.Among the favored picks, both Tepper and Klarman picked up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BP</emphasis>, the British oil giant still recovering from the April 2010 Gulf oil spill. Cohen's picks in the energy sector were recent spinoff<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marathon Petroleum</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HollyFrontier</emphasis>, the latter of which was also a favorite of Tepper. Icahn's only energy buy was on the soon-to-be-acquired<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">El Paso</emphasis>, while Falcone picked up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Exco Resources</emphasis>, an oil and natural gas exploration company.Interestingly, those fund managers who reduced their exposure to the energy sector -- notably Sandell Asset Management, Tudor Investment and Moore Capital -- sold shares of Exco Resources. The stock is down more than 38% this year, so perhaps they were cutting losses and moving on. However, since the end of September, shares of Exco are up more than 10%.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CVR Energy</emphasis>was another energy name that found hedge fund managers on either side. Eton Park and GLG Partners sold the stock while Harbinger Capital bought shares. Similarly, while Och-Ziff bought up<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Exxon Mobil</emphasis>shares, Tudor Investment was selling.</p><h>Materials</h><p>Some of the biggest hedge fund managers were down on the materials sector during the third quarter, although one specific stock in the sector was a buy for a few fund managers, which increased their exposure to the group.The materials sector has been the second worst of all S&amp;P 500 sectors this year, falling about 10% through Nov. 10, according to Capital IQ. Only financials have performed worse this year as a group. Interestingly, the materials group saw the second largest increase in earnings growth during the third quarter, with profits up 35% from the prior year. Looking ahead, though, earnings are expected to grow just 12% in 2012, down from an estimate of 34% this year, according to FactSet Research.With slowing growth on the horizon, hedge funds were jumping out of some positions in materials stock, reducing their reported portfolio's overall exposure to the sector.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LyondellBasell</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mosaic</emphasis>were among the names dropped. Both stocks were sold by Third Point and Highbridge Capital. Jana Partners sold shares of Lyondell, while Viking Global sold Mosaic.Meanwhile, Brevan Howard saw a big decline in exposure to materials stocks after the hedge fund dumped<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barrick Gold</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Newmont Mining</emphasis>, two stocks that were sharply higher during the third quarter.On the other hand, hedge funds like Centaurus, Farallon Capital, and <person><nameText>Paulson &amp; Co. </nameText></person>all saw their portfolios increase their stakes in the materials sector. The common thread between all three is<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nalco Holding</emphasis>, a water treatment and chemicals company. However, these hedge funds likely picked up shares of the company after<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ecolabs</emphasis>announced in July it would buy Nalco.John Paulson, who has seen his funds collapse this year, bought other materials companies as he increased his positions in gold-related companies like Barrick Gold,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iamgold</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rangold Resources</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Agnico-Eagle Mines</emphasis>. This came as Paulson slashed his huge position in the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SPDR Gold Trust</emphasis>.</p><h>Industrials</h><p>Like the materials sector, industrials have been a dog for investors this year. Industrial companies in the S&amp;P 500 are down 5.6% this year through Nov. 10, according to Capital IQ, the third worst sector performer this year. Unsurprisingly, hedge funds sold off shares of industrial stocks during the quarter.While much of the selling was scattered across different subsectors, the group of industrials stocks that frequently popped up were the railroads. Vinik Asset Management,, and Caxton Associates sold stocks like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CSX</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Norfolk Southern</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Union Pacific</emphasis>. These stocks sold off sharply from the beginning August through September. Since the end of the third quarter, though, these names are up between 15% and 25%.Railroad companies weren't the only transportation names sold during the quarter. Vinik also sold shares of both<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FedEx</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UPS</emphasis>, while Third Point dumped shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Swift Transportation</emphasis>. Soros also sold shares of FedEx, while Omega Advisors lightened up on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">United Continental</emphasis>.There were some buyers of industrial companies during the quarter. Och-Ziff picked up a basket of industrial stocks like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">United Technologies</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emerson Electric</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Caterpillar</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">General Electric</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deere</emphasis>. Highbridge Capital added shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Parker-Hannifin</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Honeywell</emphasis>.It remains to be seen whether those industrial bets pay off, but for now analysts are looking positively on the sector. According to FactSet Research, industrial companies in the S&amp;P 500 should see earnings grow 13% next year, tied with consumer discretionary for the second highest growth rate for any sector. But with industrials sales up only 9% in the third quarter from a year ago and share prices slipping during August, it's easy to see why some chose to cut and run from the sector.The outlook for consumer discretionary stocks seems to be bright. After earnings grew a solid 16% during the third quarter from a year ago, the sector is tied with industrials for second overall with an expected earnings growth rate of 13% in 2012.</p><h>Consumer Discretionary</h><p>Consumer discretionary as a whole haven't gone anywhere this year, up a paltry 2.8%. With fears that global economies could face another recession, it makes sense that individual investors aren't rushing into consumer discretionary stocks that could be hammered if spending is reined in further. For the most part, though, hedge fund managers are placing their bets in the sector, with media names getting lots of love.The<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liberty Media</emphasis>family of stocks --<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liberty Interactive</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liberty Media</emphasis>, and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liberty Capital</emphasis>-- was particularly in focus. While hedge funds like JAT Capital, Jana Partners and Blue Ridge Capital were buyers, Soros Capital and Farallon Capital were dumping shares. Meanwhile, as hedge funds like Eton Park,and Lone Pine Capital were buying shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">News Corp.</emphasis>, others like Viking Global were dumping shares. The same was true for<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Viacom</emphasis>, with Eton Park and Maverick buying as Farallon and Viking selling.There were some other interesting moves in consumer discretionary stocks. Among hedge funds increasing their reported portfolio's exposure to the sector, names like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Las Vegas Sands</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Virgin Media</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Priceline.com</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McGraw-Hill</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deckers Outdoor</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Family Dollar</emphasis>were among the stocks that saw buying.</p><h>Consumer Staples</h><p>With the global economy at risk due to the European crisis and market volatility scaring investors, it's natural to believe the right place to be invested would be consumer staples. These are companies that are defensive, cyclical names which can help protect against downside risk. For the hedge funds that materially changed what they did with their consumer staples holdings, most were buyers. Unfortunately, there hasn't been a whole lot of growth opportunity in consumer staples stocks. The overall sector is up 5.4% this year -- third best among all S&amp;P 500 sectors -- but worries over growth remain. One of the main reasons is because domestic growth is slowing, forcing these staples companies to depend on international growth.In the third quarter, earnings grew by only 6% from a year ago, the second worst earnings growth rate among all S&amp;P 500 sectors. Based on estimates, consumer staples will see earnings rise 9% in 2012, according to FactSet Research, below the growth rates of industrials, technology and even consumer discretionary names.For that reason, it was hard to find hedge funds that made big alterations to their holdings of consumer staples stocks. The few fund managers who did make big changes increased their reported portfolio's exposure to the sector, rather than sell shares of staples.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dow</emphasis>component<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kraft Foods</emphasis>was one stock that several hedge fund managers picked up in the third quarter. Moore Capital's Louis Bacon, George Soros, andall bought shares of Kraft last quarter. During the quarter, Kraft shares fell about 5%, although the stock has rebounded more than 3% since Sept. 30.Moore Capital was more active in the staples space, also picking up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Altria</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Procter &amp; Gamble</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PepsiCo</emphasis>. Soros also picked up shares of Pepsi as well as<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sara Lee</emphasis>.Elsewhere, Maverick Capital's Lee Ainslie was in the mood for chicken and beer, buying up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anheuser-Busch InBev</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sanderson Farms</emphasis>.</p><h>Health Care</h><p>The health care sector was a popular one in the third quarter for hedge fund managers looking for merger-arbitrage opportunities. Takeover targets like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kinetic Concepts</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cephalon</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Medco Health Solutions</emphasis>were snatched up during the quarter, increasing health care weightings for several hedge fund managers. The merger activity is one way to explain the strong performance of the health care sector this year. Health care names in the S&amp;P 500 are up 6.1% overall, according to Capital IQ, the second best sector performance this year. The outlook for health care stocks, though, leaves plenty to be desired. After notching only 7% earnings growth in the third quarter, analysts are only calling for 5% earnings growth for the sector in 2012. In addition, health care companies will be in limbo as President Obama's health care reform bill gets challenged in the courts.If they weren't playing M&amp;A activity in the sector, hedge fund managers were selling for the most part.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pfizer</emphasis>was a popular name to sell, withandreducing their holdings in the drugmaker. Tepper also sold shares of fellow drug stock<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Merck</emphasis>, as well as<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Medtronic</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UnitedHealth Group</emphasis>.Elsewhere, Steven Cohen's SAC Capital sold out of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dendreon</emphasis>, which had been one of the hedge fund's largest holdings before the stock crumbled. Cohen's fund also sold shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tenet Healthcare</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Express Scripts</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Novartis</emphasis>, among others. Meanwhile, both Blue Ridge Capital andcut their holdings in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Teva Pharmaceutical</emphasis>, although that may be due to the fact that the company's shares fell very sharply in August.</p><h>Financials</h><p>Given the sharp drop in financial stocks this year, it should come as no surprise that hedge fund managers were dumping shares during the third quarter. There was nearly uniform disgust with U.S. bank stocks like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bank of America</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citigroup</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase</emphasis>, which had all been big winners for hedge fund managers who bet on their recovery after the financial collapse in late 2008.Financials as a group are the worst performing sector on the S&amp;P 500, down 19% this year through Nov. 10, according to Capital IQ. That performance may have been too much for the likes of David Tepper. His Appaloosa Management hedge fund completely sold out of its positions in Bank of America,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wells Fargo</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fifth Third</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MetLife</emphasis>. He also reduced his Citigroup stake.Others followed in Tepper's footsteps, with Eton Park, <person><nameText>Paulson &amp; Co., </nameText></person>Glenview, Maverick Capital, and Lone Pine Capital among the other big hedge funds slashing their U.S. bank holdings. Among other interesting sales, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square sold shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greenlight Capital Re</emphasis>, John Paulson sold<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">State Street</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NYSE Euronext</emphasis>, and Maverick Capital dumped shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BlackRock</emphasis>.Though it may be hard to believe, some hedge fund managers were buyers of financial stocks last quarter, which increased their reported portfolio's sector weighting. Most notably, Caxton Associates bought shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo, among others. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital picked up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Legg Mason</emphasis>.was a buyer of Citigroup and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis>.These financial buyers may not be completely crazy. If there's one reason for optimism, next year's earnings growth may be it. According to FactSet Research, financials should see earnings growth of 25% in 2012, the highest based on analysts' estimates of all sectors. It remains to be seen if the European debt crisis and the exposure to those troubled countries derails those rosy forecasts.</p><h>Information Technology</h><p>The technology sector gets a lot of attention from hedge funds, mostly because it seems like everyone wants to own shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>. The truth, though, is that the sector has performed admirably this year and should do well into 2012 based on analysts' estimates.Through Nov. 10, the tech sector of the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 2.4%, falling in the middle of the pack of the 10 sectors of the broad market index. Looking ahead to 2012, analysts expect earnings for the sector to grow 11%, which is a fine enough number but one that also ultimately falls in the middle of the pack. As tech isn't excelling when it comes to performance or earnings growth expectations, hedge funds managers are predictably found on the opposite sides of stock bets. The 13F system isn't perfect, as we can't tell whether ownership of a stock means the hedge fund manager loves the company or is simply hedging a short position. That said, it's interesting to look at opposing views based on these filings.Apple is the perfect example. In the second quarter, Apple was among the most held of any stock by hedge funds and it may be likely to repeat again in the third quarter. Viking Global, Greenlight Capital, Omega Advisors, Soros Capital and Citadel all bought shares of the gadget maker during the third quarter. But on the other hand, hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates, Moore Capital, Vinik Asset Management and Tudor Investment dumped shares of the company during the quarter.The same story holds true among the other big tech stocks. Farallon Capital and Citadel bought<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>as Moore Capital and Tudor sold. Brevan Howard picked up<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco</emphasis>while Bridgewatch cut its holding., Viking Global, and Soros bought<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SanDisk</emphasis>shares while JAT Capital sold the stock.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualcomm</emphasis>all faced the similar push-and-pull.</p><h>Telecom</h><p>The telecom sector evokes yawns from the casual investor. Hedge fund managers, too, find little to be excited about in the sector. With telecom shares down 3% this year through Nov. 10, investors bored with wireless companies look smart to have skipped the sector.The reasons for the aversion are simply because there's little growth to be had. FactSet Research has the telecom sector growing earnings by only 8% next year based on analysts' estimates, a far cry from the 25% expected earnings growth in financials or even 13% expected growth in consumer discretionary and industrials. By comparison, telecom companies in the S&amp;P 500 saw earnings grow 17% during the third quarter.Though certainly not the sexiest sector, some hedge fund managers increased their reported holdings during the third quarter. The most notable call was by Centaurus, which picked up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Level 3 Communications</emphasis>, a stock that has surged nearly 40% this year. Glenview, meanwhile, made a third-quarter buy of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">American Tower</emphasis>shares.Elsewhere, Moore Capital's Louis Bacon made several buys, picking up shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AT&amp;T</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Verizon</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CenturyLink</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BCE</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Windstream</emphasis>.</p><h>Utilities</h><p>If there is one sector more boring that telecom, it's utilities. Though many are big dividend payers, there's little excitement in owning an electricity company. Making matters worse, the utility sector saw a meager 5% increase in earnings from a year ago, according to FactSet Research, the lowest growth rate of all 10 sectors of the S&amp;P 500. Looking ahead, utilities are the only sector expected to see earnings shrink in 2012, with analysts' estimates calling for a 2% slide.Despite those negatives, utility stocks have been the best performers this year on the S&amp;P 500, climbing 10.7% in 2011 through Nov. 11. Boring and unsexy is much more palatable if it means getting a big return. However, hedge funds aren't making big changes to their exposure to the sector.Louis Bacon's Moore Capital is one of very few funds to increase its portfolio weighting for the utility sector. During the third quarter, Moore Capital bought shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PPL Corp.</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Southern Company</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Westar Energy</emphasis>. The three stocks were mixed in the third quarter, with Southern up 5%, PPL up 2.5% and Westar down 1.8%.On the other hand, Avenue Capital lowered its utilities holdings after dumping shares of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dynegy</emphasis>. The stock has fallen more than 50% this year, -- Written by Robert Holmes in Boston.&gt;To contact the writer of this article, click here:.&gt;To follow Robert Holmes on Twitter, go to.&gt;To submit a news tip, send an email to:.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-11314967</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5490-9SK1-JCMB-G0K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3380\"/><timeReceived>07:27 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 TheStreet.com, Inc.

And it's got some big names on it.When it comes to investing, a rising tide tends to lift all ships. So it's telling when hedge fund managers opt to sink a few of their ships by taking the transaction fees and potential opportunity costs of selling. In short, when equities are broadly moving higher, portfolio managers have to really hate a stock to sell it.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-hedge-funds-love-and-so-should-you.html-0\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Hedge Funds Love -- and So Should You</url>Too often, investors only focus on what institutional investors like hedge funds are buying; but there's something to be gleaned from both sides of the trade. So instead, we'll focus on five stocks that hedge funds hate today.And luckily for us, we can get a glimpse at exactly which stocks are on top of hedge funds' hate lists by looking at 13F statements. Institutional investors with more than $100 million in assets are required to file a 13F -- a form that breaks down their stock positions for public consumption. From hedge funds to mutual funds to insurance companies, any professional investors who manage more than that $100 million watermark are required to file a 13F.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-loser-stocks-poised-comeback-2013.html\">&gt;&gt;4 Loser Stocks Poised for a Comeback in 2013</url>So far, 239 funds filed the form for last quarter, and by comparing one quarter's filing to another, we can see how any single fund manager is moving their portfolio around.Without further ado, here's a look at      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/stocks-fund-managers-hate-q4-2012/\">five stocks fund managers hate</url>.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-toxic-stocks-are-poisoning-your-portfolio.html-0\">&gt;&gt;5 Toxic Stocks That Are Poisoning Your Portfolio</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>I guess it's not a huge surprise that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>(AAPL:NYSE) tops hedge funds' hate list --<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/apple-doesn't-suck-its-stock-does.html\">everybody hates this stock right now</url>. Shares of the $439 billion tech behemoth have fallen by around 25% in the last six months, dropping like a rock while the rest of the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis>actually climbed 8%.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-big-tech-stocks-trade-or-not.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Big Tech Stocks to Trade (or Not)</url>The selling was enough to scare hedge funds away from shares; funds unloaded 1.27 million shares of Apple last quarter, dropping their combined stake in the stock by $1.5 billion.Apple has been getting a lot of attention -- and rightfully so. As the biggest publicly traded company in the world, Apple's fall is a big deal. But I've said before that this is a case of a stock price that's diverged considerably from this company's value. If Apple were a tenth of its size, it wouldn't be under the same pressures. Now, though, its $439 billion market cap and $467 per share price tag look scary for investors; the bigger they are, the harder they fall, right?Not quite. Apple's growing market share, impressive diversification, and gargantuan cash cushion impart a fundamental floor on share prices. Management has shown a willingness to at least talk about returning more of Apple's $137 billion in cash to investors, and that's an excellent step in the right direction. In the mean time, investors shouldn't ignore the fact that Apple created more than $41 billion in free cash flows last year. Hedge fund managers are selling this stock on a kneejerk reaction to price -- and they're leaving money on the table.All of that said, I'd recommend waiting for the technicals to change before jumping into Apple. This stock is still in a downtrend, and as long as more investors keep selling at a kneejerk, you can jump in at a better price.I also featuredc Apple recently in \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/apple-doesn%E2%80%99t-suck-its-stock-does.html\">Apple Doesn't Suck -- but Its Stock Does</url>.\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>Another tech giant that's getting sold off by hedge funds right now is<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>(MSFT:NYSE). Hedge funds sold 9.15 million shares of the Redmond, Wash.-based software firm in the last quarter. That decreased their collective stake in the stock by more than a quarter -- and around a half billion dollars.<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-hated-stocks-set-soar-earnings.html-5\">&gt;&gt;5 Hated Stock Set to Soar on Earnings</url>Microsoft is the firm behind products such as the standard-bearer Windows operating system, the Office suite of productivity tools and a bevy of enterprise applications. Notice that I called Microsoft a software firm; even though MSFT does make hardware like the XBOX and now the Surface tablet, software remains the biggest part of its revenue by far. And the firm's huge installed base means that dominance (and those cash flows) are likely to continue for some time.Like Apple, Microsoft has a huge cash position. At last count, the firm sported more than $78 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet, offset by a $12 billion debt load. That's $7.80 per share in net cash, a nice safety net by any measure. To be clear, MSFT doesn't look like much of a growth stock right now. It operates in a saturated market, and management has been grabbing at straws to find a new niche. But consistent sales, tons of cash and a hefty 3.3% dividend yield make hedge funds' hate of this stock look misplaced.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AmerisourceBergen</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>2013 is panning out to be a good year for<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AmerisourceBergen</emphasis>(ABC:NYSE). Shares of the pharmaceutical distributor have climbed almost 9% year-to-date, topping even the impressive performance of the S&amp;P over that same period. But hedge funds have missed out on those gains. Funds sold off 7.43 million shares of ABC last quarter, cutting their stake in the firm by 84%. So, was it worth it? In my view, yes.AmerisourceBergen is one of the biggest pharmaceutical distributors in the U.S., a business that involves acting as a middleman between pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers. It's a business that provides slim margins -- after all, if profitability grew too attractive pharmaceutical and healthcare firms could just fire the middleman and replicate ABC's offerings internally. In other words, AmerisourceBergen is attractive because its business isn't.Even though health care reforms should provide ABC with some tailwinds in the next couple of years, extremely tight competition and an industry ruled by oligarchy make finding an edge difficult. AmerisourceBergen may be the most attractive distributor in the industry, but I'd rather avoid pharma distributors in toto.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wells Fargo</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wells Fargo</emphasis>(WFC:NYSE), on the other hand, hasn't lost its luster as the best of the big banks -- unless you're a hedge fund. Fund managers offloaded 6.96 million shares of the San Francisco-based bank, cutting their collective stakes in the stock by a quarter-billion dollars. Wells' biggest advantage right now is that it avoided the big mistakes its peers made heading in to the Great Recession. WFC had the most exposure to retail and commercial banking heading into 2007, and the relative lack of toxic assets on its balance sheet gave it the wherewithal to greatly increase its scale by acquiring Wachovia on the cheap in 2008. Now a bigger, stronger Wells Fargo is well-positioned to ride out this low-rate environment, and start raking it in when the Fed starts to target higher rates down the line.There are some speed bumps in Wells' strategy, to be sure. As a big bank, the firm's balance sheet is riddled with at least a couple tears. And increased regulation means that management can't make stewardship decisions (like a dividend hike) without asking Uncle Sam first. Ultimately, everyone has eyes on WFC, and there isn't a big edge in shares right now. That said, relative strength remains stellar in the financial sector, and investors could find worse exposure to financials than this stock. Even if hedge funds are trying to move their money to more exciting opportunities, they mistimed selling WFC.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">General Electric</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>We round out the hedge fund hate list with another huge blue-chip:<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">General Electric</emphasis>(GE:NYSE). Hedge funds sold off 6.99 million shares of the industrial conglomerate last quarter, reducing GE's position in funds' portfolios by $238 million. That's an about-face from where funds stood on this stock just a few months ago; less than a year ago,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-industrial-stocks-funds-love-2012.html\">GE was funds' favorite industrial stock</url>. Fund managers seem to be content with their 19% gains, at least on those 6.99 million shares.GE is involved in a bevy of heavy manufacturing segments, from making jet engines to wind turbines and medical equipment. While those units seem unsuited to work together at fist, the firm is able make the puzzle pieces fit together and share technologies and customers across business lines. The wind turbine business, for instance, can benefit from the advances that the firm is making in the jet engine business -- and the firm can make money by financing all of those customers through GE Capital.With a solid 3.4% dividend yield and the financial stability you'd expect from a stalwart industrial blue chip, GE still looks like a good option for stock investors, even if hedge funds disagree. With the S&amp;P clawing its way higher in 2013, this stock should go along for the ride.To see these stocks in action, check out the at      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/stocks-fund-managers-hate-q4-2012/\">Stocks Fund Managers Hate Q4 portfolio</url>on Stockpickr.&amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;-- Written by Jonas Elmerraji in Baltimore.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED LINKS:</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-hedge-funds-love-and-so-should-you.html-0?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Hedge Funds Love -- and So Should You</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-reasons-buy-stocks-2013.html?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;4 Reasons to Buy Stocks in 2013</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-rocket-stocks-ready-blastoff-week.html?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;5 Rocket Stocks Ready for Blastoff</url>Follow Stockpickr on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>and become a fan on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-11840989</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57RK-4031-F03D-61SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1608\"/><timeReceived>11:02 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Here's everything you need to know.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Want an investing shortcut where the world's most prominent professional investors do the heavy lifting for you? All you need to do is follow the money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hedge funds have been net buyers of stocks again in 2016, but they've been much more selective than in years past. That's not totally surprising, considering the market environment we've been stuck in this year; the stats on the big <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500 </emphasis>index have been masking the fact that a big chunk of the market is actually working in 2016, and an equally big chunk of stocks are absolutely not working.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Put simply, stock picking still matters a lot this year, \u00a0so why not let the hedge funds pick the stocks for you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Think of it like an investing shortcut. By leaving the hard analysis to the pros, you get all the perks of a well-staffed equity research department, without paying the hefty management fees the world's most successful hedge funds charge.</p><p>And believe it or not, you don't have to guess to figure out what the funds are buying right now. In fact, they'll tell you.</p><p>That's because institutional investors with more than $100 million in assets are required to file a 13F, a form that breaks down their stock positions for public consumption. From hedge funds to mutual funds to insurance companies, any professional investors who manage more than that $100 million watermark are required to submit a form 13F to the SEC.</p><p>Want to know which stocks are pro investors' favorites? Those 13F filings hold the key.</p><p>By comparing one quarter's filing to another, we can see how any single fund manager is moving their portfolio around. And by looking at those changes collectively, we can see which stocks the pros are betting on as a group. In other words, we can see which stocks Wall Street loves. While the data is generally delayed by about a quarter, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Research shows that applying a lag to institutional holdings can generate positive alpha in some cases. That's all the more reason to crack open the moves being made with pro investors' $21 trillion under management.</p><p>Because we're still relatively early in 13F filing season, consider this your sneak peek at the stocks hedge funds are buying. So, without delay, here's a closer look at five stocks fund managers love right now:</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alibaba  </emphasis><br/></p><p>Leading things off on hedge funds' list of favorites this quarter is $260 billion Chinese e-commerce giant <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alibaba  </emphasis>. Alibaba has been an outstanding performer in 2016, up almost 30% since the calendar flipped to January, so it's not totally out of left field that this big tech company is getting funds' attention. All told, early-filing funds added 12.6 million shares of Alibaba to their portfolios during the third quarter, a $1.3 billion buying operation at current share price levels.</p><p>Perhaps even more telling, that buying represented a 34% upsizing in those funds existing Alibaba positions from the prior quarter. That's a big conviction bet if there ever was one.</p><p>Alibaba is the biggest online commerce company on the planet, with 434 million active buyers and a gross merchandise volume that's expected to rise above $550 billion in 2016. That huge scale comes from an equally huge market -- Alibaba owns many of the most popular online marketplaces in China. Besides its namesake site, Alibaba's marketplaces include web marketplace Tmall, consumer-to-consumer sales site Taobao, and daily deals site Juhuasuan. Alibaba also operates the Alipay payment network, and a collection of smaller niche internet businesses.</p><p>At the same time, scores of U.S. e-commerce operators are working to push more business to mobile, China's demographics have been working in Alibaba's favor in a big way. The firm saw mobile sales account for about 65% of total merchandise value this past year, a massive share of the company's overall business that helps to ensure that consumers always have shopping available to them. Considering the fact that one in five Chinese consumers is presently an active shopper on one of the firm's websites, Alibaba's marketplaces have some major advantages over the competition. Shoppers use Alibaba because of its vast selection of products, and merchants sell on Alibaba's sites because it's where the shoppers are. That cycle makes Alibaba an attractive holding now, especially with buyers in control of shares this fall.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon  </emphasis><br/></p><p>Another one of funds' favorite stocks last quarter was U.S.-based e-commerce giant <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon  </emphasis>Are we sensing a theme here?</p><p>Amazon is another one of the world's biggest e-commerce companies. And while the firm's $205 billion in gross merchandise volume means that its scale is dramatically less than Alibaba's, it's still obviously a massive operator. Like its bigger peer, Amazon has been a notable outperformer in 2016, rallying more than 23% since the start of the year. That positive performance was good at catching hedge funds' attention. The first wave of pro investors added 738,000 shares of Amazon to their portfolios in the third quarter, a $616 million buying spree at current price levels.</p><p>Amazon's success story is built on scale and bridging the convenience gap between online retail and conventional brick-and-mortar retail. Not only does the firm use its scale and low-cost structure to move products more cheaply than competing sellers -- it also has gone to great lengths to reduce delivery times, most recently expanding its distribution infrastructure with new hubs in key markets. By adding services like Prime Video to its menu of offerings, the firm has increased customer stickiness in a way that pure price competitors can't touch.</p><p>Beyond its core retail business, Amazon has been building out a huge cloud computing operation that's grown into a material component of sales. Amazon Web Services reached $7.9 billion in revenues in 2015, and it's up to about $10 billion in the trailing four quarters. That entr\u00e9e into higher-margin enterprise computing services should continue to be an attractive source of growth for Amazon, particularly as other big tech firms seek to hand off the challenges of building out a cloud infrastructure to an expert like Amazon.</p><p>Keep an eye out for Amazon's third quarter earnings results, set to hit Wall Street after the closing bell tomorrow.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase</emphasis><br/></p><p>The year 2016 has been treacherous for the financial sector. After starting off the year in free fall, financials have managed to more or less right themselves, with the exception of high-profile big banks like\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"http://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=035744\">Action Alerts PLUS</url> holding <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wells Fargo  </emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Deutsche Bank  </emphasis>, which have found themselves embroiled in scandal and financial crisis, respectively. But funds haven't been steering clear of the big banks in the last quarter. Instead, they piled into one of them.</p><p>Early filing funds picked up 2.13 million shares of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase  </emphasis> during the past quarter.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase is one of the biggest financial institutions, with more than $2.4 trillion in assets. Like the other big banking firms, JPMorgan operates a diversified financial services business, with operations in commercial and retail banking, asset management and treasury services, and investment banking. The past few years have been challenging for banking stocks, and while the smoke has largely cleared with respect to the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, it doesn't change the fact that returns have been tamped down by increased regulatory scrutiny and low net interest margins.</p><p>The light at the end of the tunnel for investors in JPMorgan Chase is the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fed</emphasis>. A tiny rate hike in December looks very likely, bringing JPMorgan and its peers a little closer to the higher net interest margins that market participants have been hoping for. For that reason, JPM also makes a strong hedge this fall for income investors who have outsize exposure to big dividend payers.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iShares Russell 2000 ETF</emphasis><br/></p><p>Hedge funds weren't solely interested in stocks last quarter. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iShares Russell 2000 ETF  </emphasis>was the sole exchange-traded fund that made the cut of the pros' favorite names for the third quarter of 2016. Funds added 3.93 million shares of IWM to their portfolios during the period.</p><p>Once again, the love for IWM looks like a case of chasing performance (on the surface, anyway). Year-to-date, this small-cap focused fund is up 7.4%, stomping the 4.8% price return found in the S&amp;P 500. But for any strategists counting on small-cap outperformance for the rest of the year, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is a pretty logical choice: it has exposure to 1,977 holdings (making it widely diversified, and trimming some of the headline risk that comes from owning a smaller portfolio of small-cap stocks), and relatively low fees.</p><p>After a pretty challenging couple of years for small-cap performance, IWM is overdue for some meaningful performance in 2016 -- and it's on track to make it happen. The fact that pro investors are buying up this big ETF makes it an especially interesting trade for investors looking to get a portfolio boost in the final stretch of the year.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Merck  </emphasis><br/></p><p>Last up on our list of hedge funds' favorite stocks is pharmaceutical maker <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Merck  </emphasis>. Merck is a drug giant, with more than $42 billion in sales last year. While Merck has been hit by a patent cliff just as hard as any of its other big pharma peers, the company's drug pipeline is one of the strongest in the industry. Relatively recent drugs like Januvia for diabetes, Keytruda for cancer, Isentress for HIV and anesthesia drug Bridion have the potential to be blockbusters for the company.</p><p>Merck is in good shape from a financial standpoint. The firm currently carries $23.7 billion in cash and investments, enough to offset nearly its entire $24 billion debt load. That ample cushion of financial reserves means that Merck is able to continue to make tactical purchases this year -- and that it's also able to continue boosting its 3% dividend payout.</p><p>This week's third-quarter earnings results were positive, leaving shares of Merck within grabbing distance of new 52-week highs this fall. Meanwhile, funds were fans of this stock in the most recent quarter, with early filers adding more than 275,000 shares of this stock to their aggregated portfolios. Look for a positive follow-up to Merck's earnings reaction in the trading sessions ahead.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-13866973</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M1F-K7X1-JCHV-V25F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1703\"/><timeReceived>7:45 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 TheStreet.com, Inc.

It seems that competition and data protection enforcers are less hesitant to impose administrative fines, when it is believed that data protection or competition rules are violated by companies that utilize data as a part of their entrepreneurial activities1. In this respect, on 29 November 2018, Italian Competition Authority, Autorit Garante Della Concorrenza E Del Mercato (\"AGCM\") imposed an administrative fine against both Facebook Ireland Ltd. and its parent company Facebook Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"Facebook\" collectively), on the grounds that the firm had undertaken misleading and aggressive practices affecting its users2.AGCM launched the probe leading to a hefty fine against Facebook in April, 2018 based on the concerns that articles 21, 22, 24 and 25 of the Italian Consumer Code (\"Consumer Code\") had been breached3. As per the assessments made through the course of the investigation, ACGM explains that Facebook was fined due to the its conducts listed below, which are alleged to be in contradiction with the said articles of the Consumer Code:Misleading the users in the sign-up process via a failure to explicitly indicate the purpose of data collection and specifying that the collected items would be utilized for commercial means by Facebook.Incentivizing the users to make decisions of a commercial nature without being granted access to the full facts, namely the profitable ends that could be achieved by Facebook via providing social network services to users.Undertaking an aggressive practice on registered users of Facebook by transmitting their data from the network to third parties and vice versa for achieving commercial purposes.With regards to the concerns about Article 21 and 22 of the Consumer Code, AGCM focuses on Facebook's misleading conduct against its users during the account creation phase. </p><p>AGCM points out that while the data required from Facebook users for the sign-up process is used for commercial purposes, Facebook do not provide adequate and immediate information to its users in relation with this purpose. Accordingly, AGCM sets forth that Facebook places an emphasis on the free nature of the services to induce its users to make a commercial decision that they would not have made otherwise, instead of revealing to the customers the commercial objectives underlying the provision of social network services. More specifically, Facebook's practice of emphasizing the \"free of charge\" nature of the social network services, is deemed as a misleading conduct that manipulates user decisions. Furthermore, AGCM has established that information provided by Facebook do not include a distinction per the functionality of the data collected and that it is incomplete. For instance, it is noted that Facebook do not inform its users whether the data would be used to personalize the network services or for advertising campaigns aimed at specific targets.In relation with the assessment made on Articles 24 and 25 of the Consumer Code, AGCM focuses on Facebook's conduct which is described as \"aggressive practices\", directed towards the registered consumers. Within this scope, AGCM expresses that the data obtained from the registered customers were being transmitted to third party websites or apps and vice versa for commercial purposes, without obtaining express and prior consent. Hence, by making its \"active platform\" function default, Facebook pre-sets its users' ability to access websites and external apps that use their Facebook accounts without their express consent. Accordingly, Facebook repeats the pre-selection mechanism whenever the user accesses a third-party website or an app, which is integrated with his or her Facebook account and merely provides an opt-out option. Considering the nature of this mechanism, AGCM indicated that Facebook's conduct induces unconscious and automatic consumer choice, on the ground that customers are not required to give an express and prior consent for data transmission.In further assessment, such conduct is characterized as an \"undue influence\", which stems from the pre-selection mechanism that ensures the broadest consumer consent to data sharing. AGCM ultimately establishes that, although registered consumers may limit their consent regarding the scope of data sharing, they are exposed to significant restrictions concerning the use of the social network, third-party websites and apps in a way that disincentivizes any potential variations of the pre-selected choice.Considering the foregoing, AGCM published a press release notifying that the investigation is concluded on 29 November 2018. In the press release it is declared that Facebook was fined 10 million Euros by AGCM for data misuse and that it was obliged to publish a correction statement on its app and website4.It is noteworthy to mention that it is not the first time that Facebook got in trouble with data protection rules. The company has previously been exposed to investigations in Ireland and the UK, with concerns regarding data protection rules. On 24 September 2018, Facebook engineers discovered that hackers were able to take over users' accounts and this led to a major scandal affecting nearly 50 million Facebook accounts. Consequently, the Irish Data Protection Commission initiated an investigation to examine whether Facebook complies with its obligations under General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\")5.Facebook stated in its press releases that they were cooperating with the Irish Data Protection Commission since they realized such a security attack, the company has also been conducting an internal investigation and \"continued to take remedial actions to mitigate the potential risks to users\". In the wake of the Irish Data Protection Commission's announcement concerning the investigation, the Spanish Data Protection Agency stated that it would collaborate on the investigation for the rights of the Spanish citizens6.According to the GDPR, companies who fail to adequately protect relevant data could be fined for 20 million Euros or 4% of their global annual revenue from prior year, depending on which amount is greater. However, companies who notify the violation within three days will benefit from a reduction amounting to 2% of their global revenue. In this regard, the Irish Data Protection Commission reported that Facebook notified the breach on time to benefit from such reduction7. The investigation is not concluded yet and the potential fine that Facebook might face is estimated as $1.63bn, which is a considerable amount. The investigation is also crucial as it is considered as the first major test of Europe's new rules8.In the UK, Facebook was fined for 500.000 GBP on 25 October 2018, when old data privacy rules of the EU were still in force, which allowed for a maximum amount of fine of 500,000 GBP by Information Commissioner's Office (\"ICO\"). In the UK case, Facebook was penalized for unlawfully processing personal information of its users between 2007 and 2014, without obtaining sufficiently clear and informed consent. The fine imposed by ICO was also justified by Facebook's failure to keep its users' personal information secure, which meant that the personal data of 87 million Facebook users located in the UK, US and other countries were shared with a third-party company named GSR. It was determined that GSR later shared a subset of the data with other organizations, including SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica - a company involved in political campaigning in the United States. Within this context, ICO established that Facebook had failed to take adequate and timely remedial action, involving deletion, despite the fact that it discovered such misuse of data in 2015 and it did not suspend the company from its platform until the year of 2018.To wrap up, AGCM's recent decision on Facebook appears to be the latest indicator that signifies competition and data protection enforcers' tendency to scrutinize big technology companies over data-related conducts. Thus, it seems that the big-tech companies have much to expect and learn from competition and data protection authorities all over the world.Footnotes1 As is known, Italian Competition Authority, Autorit Garante Della Concorrenza E Del Mercato (\"AGCM\"), had imposed a 3 million-euro fine on Whatsapp on 11 May 2017, for having forced its users to share their personal data with Facebook.2 <url normalizedValue=\"http://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2018/12/Facebook-fined-10-million-Euros-by-the-ICA-for-unfair-commercial-practices-for-using-its-subscribers%E2%80%99-data-for-commercial-purposes\">http://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2018/12/Facebook-fined-10-million-Euros-by-the-ICA-for-unfair-commercial-practices-for-using-its-subscribers%E2%80%99-data-for-commercial-purposes</url>[1]3       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1130918.shtml\">http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1130918.shtml</url>[2]4       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2018/12/Facebook-fined-10-million-Euros-by-the-ICA-for-unfair-commercial-practices-for-using-its-subscribers%E2%80%99-data-for-commercial-purposes\">http://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2018/12/Facebook-fined-10-million-Euros-by-the-ICA-for-unfair-commercial-practices-for-using-its-subscribers%E2%80%99-data-for-commercial-purposes</url>[3]5       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/facebook-data-breach-social-network-could-face-eu-fine.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/facebook-data-breach-social-network-could-face-eu-fine.html</url>[4]6       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/03/facebook-data-breach-latest-fine-investigation\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/03/facebook-data-breach-latest-fine-investigation</url>[5]7       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-eu-fine-163-billion-massive-data-breach-50-million-users-2018-10\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-eu-fine-163-billion-massive-data-breach-50-million-users-2018-10</url>[6]8       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-faces-potential-1-63-billion-fine-in-europe-over-data-breach-1538330906\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-faces-potential-1-63-billion-fine-in-europe-over-data-breach-1538330906</url>[7]The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

pressure grows on social media and internet companies for broadcasting the Christchurch massacre, Prime Minister Scott Morrison will today announce record penalties for online giants who breach -privacy laws, declaring \"the -internet cannot be a lawless -society\".</p><p>The crackdown comes a week after Mr Morrison told The Sunday Mail he wanted companies such as Facebook and Twitter to take responsibility for broadcasting footage of New Zealand's worst-ever mass shooting.</p><p>Today's historic privacy shake-up will see the online -giants fined hundreds of millions of dollars - up from just $2.1 million - for serious data breaches or repeatedly flouting privacy laws.</p><p>Mr Morrison told The Sunday Mail tech titans must do the right thing with -people's information and stop hate content.</p><p>\"They have had the smarts to build the technology and rake in the revenues, they can use these same smarts to keep Australians safe,\" he said.</p><p>The Sunday Mail can reveal next week's Federal Budget will include $25 million for Australia's privacy watchdog to investigate dodgy tech companies who illegally track web activity without consent or collate personal data and share with third parties.</p><p>Australia's Information Commissioner will also be given new powers to force the tech industry to take part in -investigations and improve -behaviour if caught mishandling data.</p><p>The new laws, to be introduced if the Coalition wins the election, will also boost the maximum penalties issued by the Australian regulator to either $10 million, three times the value of any benefit gained or 10 per cent of annual domestic turnover.</p><p>Regulators will be able to issue fines for the highest amount of those three amounts meaning Google could be slapped with a penalty as high as $102 million or $47 million for Facebook for doing the wrong thing, based on 2017 earnings.</p><p>The tough new approach brings Australia in line with European Union-wide privacy law, which came into effect last year.</p><p>Big tech operators that -refuse to co-operate with the Australian Information Commissioner or those that fail to change their behaviour will face additional penalties.Today's privacy crackdown comes ahead of a crucial meeting this week with Mr Morrison summoning tech giants to Canberra amid a global backlash following the viral spread of the

intensified in the United States with some calling for similar measures for Americans, and others warning the rules could fracture the global internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US tech firms, and virtually all companies with online operations, will need to comply with the rules if their sites are used in the European Union, or face hefty financial penalties.</p><p>Some American firms, including news sites like the Los Angeles Times and New York Daily News, blocked access in the EU because they were unable to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect Friday.</p><p>Other US websites have shut down entirely, and some have hired consultants to help shut off access for any users in Europe.</p><p>Large US tech firms have pledged compliance with the EU rules, and have in many cases promised to extend the same protections worldwide.</p><p>But legal challenges filed in Europe accused Google and Facebook of failing to abide by the new law.</p><p>- Why not in US? -</p><p>Some US activists argue that the implementation offers an opportunity to give more privacy and data protection benefits to Americans.</p><p>\"We see no reason why US companies, as they strive to comply with the new European policies, cannot extend the GDPR standard to American consumers,\" said Katharina Kopp of the Center for Digital Democracy, one of 28 activist groups endorsing a letter in that vein to major US and global companies.</p><p>Senator Ed Markey and three fellow lawmakers introduced a resolution this week that would call on firms to offer the same protections of the European law in the US.</p><p>\"The American people are going to wonder why they are getting second-class privacy protections,\" said Markey.</p><p>The law establishes the key principle that individuals must explicitly grant permission for their data to be used, and give consumers a right to know who is accessing their information and what it will be used for.</p><p>Companies can be fined up to 20 million euros ($24 million) or four percent of annual global turnover for violations.</p><p>- Cumbersome, confusing -</p><p>GDPR critics argue the law is confusing and cumbersome, and could lead to unintended effects on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank, called GDPR \"a confusing and impractical set of rules\" that offers consumers little benefit.</p><p>\"Instead of hiring engineers, companies are hiring privacy lawyers,\" Castro said in a blog post with researcher Alan McQuinn.</p><p>Ryan Radia of the Competitive Enterprise Institute said that although GDPR was aimed at Big Tech, it is likely to strengthen the grip of large internet firms.</p><p>\"This will result in greater market concentration, as small firms and startups will find it difficult to comply with the increased regulatory cost burden,\" Radia said.</p><p>Amy Webb, a fellow at Harvard's Nieman Foundation and founder of the Future Today Institute, warned the new law could lead to a \"splinternet\" with different kinds of data available in various regions of the world, and could be particularly cumbersome for news organizations.</p><p>\"It's plausible within a decade, we could find ourselves stuck in a new digital divide, where many disparate splinternets behave and function differently, depending on where in the world the net is being accessed,\" she said in a blog post this week.</p><p>Webb said news organizations could find it especially difficult to comply because of the need for consent in organizing feeds and promoting content.</p><p>\"The business model for news, already tenuous, could be further weakened,\" she said.</p><p>Henry Farrell, a George Washington University professor who follows transatlantic relations, said the entire business model of the tech sector could be at risk from GDPR.</p><p>\"This is a fundamental attack on the 'two sided market' profit model that e-commerce companies have pioneered of providing services to individuals, while watching their behavior and feeding up access or data to advertisers,\" Farrell said in a tweet Friday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But legal challenges filed in Europe accused Google and Facebook of failing to abide by the new law.- Why not in US? - Some US activists argue that the implementation offers an opportunity to give more privacy and data protection benefits to Americans.\"We see no reason why US companies, as they strive to comply with the new European policies, cannot extend the GDPR standard to American consumers,\" said Katharina Kopp of the Center for Digital Democracy, one of 28 activist groups endorsing a letter in that vein to major US and global companies.Senator Ed Markey and three fellow lawmakers introduced a resolution this week that would call on firms to offer the same protections of the European law in the US.\"The American people are going to wonder why they are getting second-class privacy protections,\" said Markey.The law establishes the key principle that individuals must explicitly grant permission for their data to be used, and give consumers a right to know who is accessing their information and what it will be used for.Companies can be fined up to 20 million euros ($24 million) or four percent of annual global turnover for violations.- Cumbersome, confusing - GDPR critics argue the law is confusing and cumbersome, and could lead to unintended effects on both sides of the Atlantic.Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank, called GDPR \"a confusing and impractical set of rules\" that offers consumers little benefit.\"Instead of hiring engineers, companies are hiring privacy lawyers,\" Castro said in a blog post with researcher Alan McQuinn.Ryan Radia of the Competitive Enterprise Institute said that although GDPR was aimed at Big Tech, it is likely to strengthen the grip of large internet firms.\"This will result in greater market concentration, as small firms and startups will find it difficult to comply with the increased regulatory cost burden,\" Radia said.Amy Webb, a fellow at Harvard's Nieman Foundation and founder of the Future Today Institute, warned the new law could lead to a \"splinternet\" with different kinds of data available in various regions of the world, and could be particularly cumbersome for news organizations.\"It's plausible within a decade, we could find ourselves stuck in a new digital divide, where many disparate splinternets behave and function differently, depending on where in the world the net is being accessed,\" she said in a blog post this week.Webb said news organizations could find it especially difficult to comply because of the need for consent in organizing feeds and promoting content.\"The business model for news, already tenuous, could be further weakened,\" she said.Henry Farrell, a George Washington University professor who follows transatlantic relations, said the entire business model of the tech sector could be at risk from GDPR.\"This is a fundamental attack on the 'two sided market' profit model that e-commerce companies have pioneered of providing services to individuals, while watching their behavior and feeding up access or data to advertisers,\" Farrell said in a tweet Friday.

debate in US as EU privacy rules take effect.(Tech News)</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Agence France-Presse</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid a global scramble to comply with new EU data protections laws, the debate on privacy has intensified in the United States with some calling for similar measures for Americans, and others warning the rules could fracture the global internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US tech firms, and virtually all companies with online operations, will need to comply with the rules if their sites are used in the European Union, or face hefty financial penalties.</p><p>Some American firms, including news sites like the Los Angeles Times and New York Daily News, blocked access in the EU because they were unable to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect Friday.</p><p>Other US websites have shut down entirely, and some have hired consultants to help shut off access for any users in Europe.</p><p>Large US tech firms have pledged compliance with the EU rules, and have in many cases promised to extend the same protections worldwide.</p><p>But legal challenges filed in Europe accused Google and Facebook of failing to abide by the new law.</p><p>Why not in US?</p><p>Some US activists argue that the implementation offers an opportunity to give more privacy and data protection benefits to Americans.</p><p>\"We see no reason why US companies, as they strive to comply with the new European policies, cannot extend the GDPR standard to American consumers,\" said Katharina Kopp of the Center for Digital Democracy, one of 28 activist groups endorsing a letter in that vein to major US and global companies.</p><p>Senator Ed Markey and three fellow lawmakers introduced a resolution this week that would call on firms to offer the same protections of the European law in the US.</p><p>\"The American people are going to wonder why they are getting second-class privacy protections,\" said Markey.</p><p>The law establishes the key principle that individuals must explicitly grant permission for their data to be used, and give consumers a right to know who is accessing their information and what it will be used for.</p><p>Companies can be fined up to 20 million euros ($24 million) or four percent of annual global turnover for violations.</p><p>Cumbersome, confusing</p><p>GDPR critics argue the law is confusing and cumbersome, and could lead to unintended effects on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank, called GDPR \"a confusing and impractical set of rules\" that offers consumers little benefit.</p><p>\"Instead of hiring engineers, companies are hiring privacy lawyers,\" Castro said in a blog post with researcher Alan McQuinn.</p><p>Ryan Radia of the Competitive Enterprise Institute said that although GDPR was aimed at Big Tech, it is likely to strengthen the grip of large internet firms.</p><p>\"This will result in greater market concentration, as small firms and startups will find it difficult to comply with the increased regulatory cost burden,\" Radia said.</p><p>Amy Webb, a fellow at Harvard's Nieman Foundation and founder of the Future Today Institute, warned the new law could lead to a \"splinternet\" with different kinds of data available in various regions of the world, and could be particularly cumbersome for news organizations.</p><p>\"It's plausible within a decade, we could find ourselves stuck in a new digital divide, where many disparate splinternets behave and function differently, depending on where in the world the net is being accessed,\" she said in a blog post this week.</p><p>Webb said news organizations could find it especially difficult to comply because of the need for consent in organizing feeds and promoting content.</p><p>\"The business model for news, already tenuous, could be further weakened,\" she said.</p><p>Henry Farrell, a George Washington University professor who follows transatlantic relations, said the entire business model of the tech sector could be at risk from GDPR.</p><p>\"This is a fundamental attack on the 'two sided market' profit model that e-commerce companies have pioneered of providing services to individuals, while watching their behavior and feeding up access or data to advertisers,\" Farrell said in a tweet Friday.</p><p>CAPTION(S):</p><p>New EU privacy rules require online services such as Facebook to get consent for how personal data is accessed and shared.

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, April 23rd. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Kicking off the busiest week in earnings season so far, one-third of the S&amp;P 500 and a third of the Dow Industrials are reporting their first quarter this week. The market has turned higher, we're expecting a higher opening for the broader averages. DowIndustrials is up 17, S&amp;P up a fraction, NASDAQ up 12.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alphabet, the name to watch after the close tonight. It comes amid new concerns surrounding Google's data collection. Markets tumbled on Friday meanwhile, Apple is the big drag on the Dow after analysts report suggested smartphone sales could slow in the coming month. Take a look at European indices right here and the European indices are fractionally lower but have turned higher. Take a look, FT-100 is now up four points. CAC quarante is squeaking out a gain and the DAX index in Germany is up 1-1/2. Meanwhile over in Asia right across the board, the Hang Send, the big loser there down just about half a percent. Fractional move there as well.</p><p>Forging new ties of America's oldest ally. President Trump welcomes French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House today from trade to national security. Where are taking a look at what's on the agenda for the two world leaders. And then no official intelligence. Shocking new revelations this weekend surrounding the start of the FBI probe into the Trump campaign. House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes telling me about his findings yesterday right here on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We've long wanted to know what intelligence would you have that actually led to this investigation. So what we found now, after the investigators have reviewed it, is that in fact there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will have the very latest from that investigation coming up. And then a new tune for Tencent, the Chinese streaming giant reportedly planning to go public. The company's mammoth evaluation coming up.</p><p>Plus, shook off. Taylor Swift losing her spot atop Spotify's most opening day stream. Who knocked the pop star from her thrown? All that coming up this morning. But first, we kick off this hour with a look at who is taking the gavel from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan after he retires. Speaker Ryan already throwing his support behind House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy as his successor. But does the California Congressman have enough votes? Joining me right now, the man himself, House Majority Leaders, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy. Great to see you, Congressman.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Oh, thanks for having me back on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. And congratulations that Paul Ryan endorsed you.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, it's how (INAUDIBLE) endorsed but the most important thing here is we have to make sure there is an opportunity for Republican to even run for Speaker next year. So, we have a work cut out for us, we have a great team in this conference, we're fighting hard. We got a lot of successes. But we've got a November election to go forward, so it's a little premature to everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you feel that you have the support from within your party to become the next speaker?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, we've got to make sure we have the opportunity to run there. I think that's the discussion with the conference. I feel confident, I'm humble that Paul and Steve would support me from that position but we've got a long way to go before that election to start.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, let's talk about your priorities then. I mean, this $1.3 trillion omnibus bill, obviously it was a lot of upset because of all the spending, the White House is aiming to spend its recession requests to Congress early next despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is really dismissal of any claw back in spending. You've been leading this charge. Will we see a recession of that spending?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, remember, recessions are not about the omni and the whole reason why you even got into an omni, the House did all the work. We passed all 12 appropriation bills. The challenge was the minority in the Senate not voting against appropriation bill but voting against to even allow it to come up to be debated. You're allowing the minority to control what happens. And remember what happened to our military in the eight years cut by 20 percent. More of our men and women were dying in training than in combat. They were going to museums at times to get parts for our planes. And the world has not gotten 20 percent safer. But this is where the minority in the Senate withheld everything. We watched what they're doing to Pompeo, you watched what they're doing to all the appointment. They're plain politics. Now, a recession is much like what we've been using before. Remember our Congressional Review Acts that allows Senate just with 51 votes to repeal these burdensome regulations. We were successful 16 times. Rescissions have been used always before. Reagan used it more than 200 times, Bill Clinton used it more than 111 times. It's our ability to go back find ways, and I think, any member of Congress on any side of the aisle would want more ability to eliminate wasteful spending in government. So what we're doing is we're looking back not just when it comes to the omni, any place in government and it should be used many times. So it's our ability, you could pass it to the House and then you could the pass the bill in the Senate with 51 votes to be able to cut spending but nothing to do with the omni.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It makes perfect sense actually.</p><p>MCCARTHY: It does.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So why would McConnell be so dismissive about it?</p><p>MCCARTHY: The Democrats are trying to play another political game. This was common practice with Clinton, with Reagan, with Ford, with Carter, Obama did not use it. And so, from my point of view any opportunity we have to be able to save the taxpayers' money, we should work together and make it happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're still -- you're still working on that then?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCARTHY: I just had Mick Mulvaney in the office last week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that the President just after signing it into law basically said well, now everyone is complaining about the omni and there's too much spending even, I understand the rescission not about omnibus per se but do you think he just decided, well, you know, that was a mistake. Did you feel that it will was a mistake after you signed it?</p><p>MCCARTHY: No. Because when you're looking at we're going forward in the military. What the mistake is allowing the minority in the Senate to control government. You should not be able to have a few in minority to vote to not even bring a bill up. Look at what they're doing when it comes to Mike Pompeo or any appointment. There is 1200 positions that have to be confirmed. At the rate they're going now, it will take 11 years. They are holding anybody up even at the end of the day, they may vote 100 percent for him. They are just trying to stop the government from being effective, efficient or accountable. And this President has looked at -- looked at what he's cut on regulations. Look how he used the Congressional Review Act, it's only been successful one time in history prior to President Trump. Look how much regulations he cut, look what he's done with V.A. And then when it comes to tax, you know, two million more people, have entered the workforce expanded it. Our unemployment claims are at 44-year low. Under Obama, our participation rate actually dropped from 65 to 62. It's going back up to more people in the workforce here. These are all positive things. So we're looking at every opportunity we can to not let the minority stop us and make -- actually put America First before politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And that's why the markets are up 30 percent since the election and certainly this year you're seeing a lot of companies, animal spirits because of that tax plan. Do you think this resonates with people? Do you think the American people recognize that the tax cut plan was very positive, that moved the needle on economic growth and on jobs and at the same time, that the Senate is slow-walking all this stuff or the Democrats are trying to slow-walk everything in particular today with Pompeo and the vote.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes. It's -- to me it's more and more seeing it because I just watched the small business, I read the other day and Nevada got a bonus, so this one employee with John. It was -- it was a small visit, he just had a new child that had some difficulties. He was worried about how he was going to pay that bonus. 39 states have now their electrical bills lowered because of that tax cut. In one company 1.2 million employees now have a longer maternity leave because of that tax cut.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a big deal.</p><p>MCCARTHY: That's not Armageddon and those are not crumbs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: So there is -- and there wasn't one Democrat that stood up against Nancy Pelosi or Schumer and said I'm going to vote for the American public, I'm going to let keep -- let them keep more of what they earn. I'm going to make sure they get more bonuses, look at how more jobs created and think of all those billions of dollars that coming back from overseas and investing in America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will that be enough for you guys to keep the House majority? I mean, is this -- is this resonating to the extent that people are going to say I don't want to vote Democrat because they're going to raise my taxes. I don't want to vote Democrat because these are the policies that have been working. I mean, do you think people that's going to help you keep the majority?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, we got a lot more to do as well. That's one of the elements because there is a fundamental difference. The Democrats have come out with their tax plan to actually raise your taxes, and then they even make the debt even larger. They increased taxes by more than three trillion and they go six trillion on adding to the debt. They're not solving the problem. But look at what we've done with the V.A. You know, the G.I. bill was 15 years or you lose it? No, now it's a lifetime. Look what we've done when it comes to human trafficking, for more than eight- years we've tried to stop it. There were more 100 children are human trafficked in America. 70 percent of that happens online. We've been trying to stop back page, that just got shut down last week based upon the legislation that President Trump championed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: People are through increasingly worried about the debt. I mean, are you -- hypothetically speaking if you are the next speaker, are you going to have a program to rein in the spending on entitlements, rein in things like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid because we know those programs are going broke?</p><p>MCCARTHY: We have to. If you want to protect programs you got to reform them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ok.</p><p>MCCARTHY: You almost need -- remember when we had a deal with the military, have like a rack of base realignment and closure where you brought everybody together that have one bill that would come down to the floor, we need that dealing with our debt because when Ronald Reagan was president, the discretionary spending, all those appropriations with 75 percent of the budget the mandatory was 25. Well, now that's 66 percent. It's (INAUDIBLE) so here you are, member of Congress, you vote for all 12 appropriation bills, you put it in direction but that's a small element of one-third of the government. And if you're not getting to the real root of the problem here you're not going to be able to have those entities for a future generation to support.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're absolutely right. All right. Let me ask you about -- you mentioned Mike Pompeo, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee expected to vote against endorsing Pompeo, the nomination of the CIA Director Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. This -- just in middle of all this happens with North Korea, North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp emerging as the first Democrat to throw his support behind Pompeo. Your reaction to this opposition at the very moment in time that we're talking about SIS possibly returning, North Korea, Iran and the threats are only getting worse.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Pure politics. Look at, this is an individual I served with. He went to West Point, one of the first in his to graduate. You watch what he did in the House and in Intel Committee. But then he gets confirmed to be the head of the CIA. So, if those who didn't know him but they voted for him there, watch the job that he did there. He only expanded his ability and look what we're dealing with with North Korea what he's able to do so far. I think this is playing politics and they need to stop it because it's jeopardizing our country in a really critical time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We heard stunning claims earlier, Congressman, about this Russia probe, the chairman of the House Intel Committee Devin Nunez joining me yesterday revealing that the results of his review is the beginning of the Trump campaign probe? Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES: What we found after the investigators have reviewed it is that in fact there was no intelligence, now we're trying to figure out as you know, we are investigating the state department, we think there's some major irregularities at the state at state department.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Nunes investigating state department to find out how the FBI got information about former Trump campaign advisor George Padopoulos. Your thoughts on this investigation even launching with no official intelligence.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, one thing you know about this investigation, it started out saying there was some collusion, no one has found it. I don't know why this investigation continues onward. And remember House Intelligence did, it separate but co-equal. And how long have they had to fight to get any of the information, not only their committee but Judiciary and others to fight to have the information, so it could be co-equal to look at these problems going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that's what we're certainly following as well. By the way, Kate Middleton has had her baby. We're going to get that breaking news in a moment.</p><p>MCCARTHY: That is breaking news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is breaking news. But real quick on France, the President is welcoming the French President to the White House for three days. You're going to be at that state dinner.</p><p>MCCARTHY: I will be there tomorrow night but, you know, there's a special place in my heart for France and should be for all Americans because they were there in the creation of our country and our -- and our battle to create this country, they supported us, maybe because they didn't like the England or not but they were there at the time hanging in -- hanging in the Capital inside chambers is Lafayette.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Macron and Trump seem to have good rapport.</p><p>MCCARTHY: That's a thing that America doesn't quite understand this President. He's been so successful but what he is really successful on, relationships. They may report something. I have been with him so many times. These world leaders call him, they admire this man, they support him and have a great relation even if they have a difference of opinion. They work with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you (INAUDIBLE) you have a good relationship with the President and it's one of the things that people like and certainly his supporters because you've supported him and tried to execute his plans. A lot of your colleagues haven't, they've been never-Trumpers.</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think that's wrong, you know. You have a campaign for who you want but when the election is over, let's put the country first and that's what I watched with this President. And it doesn't matter some support or not, he works with them. And he's debate some great -- look at what's happening in North Korea. Look what's happening to our economy when more people are able to work, unemployment at 4.1 percent. Look what's happening when it comes to more people keeping what their own money what they have or what changes happen to V.A. There's so much more we can do if people would work together to put the country first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Great point. Congressman, good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Kevin McCarthy joining us there. The Majority Leader. That breaking news, Kate Middleton, wife of Prince Williams has given birth to baby boy, weighing in at eight pounds, seven ounces. It is the couple's third child. Kensington palace says both mother and baby are doing well. Kate Middleton delivers a baby boy. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Police are intensifying their search for the Waffle House shooter. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST: Maria, police are still looking for 29-year-old Travis Reinking who opened fire at the suburban national restaurant before a hero customer brought an end to the chaos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES SHAW, JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO: I locked and I made up my mind because there's no way to lock that door. That if it was going to come down to it he is going to have to work -- to work to kill me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: James Shaw prevented further tragedy suffering only a minor injury. Police say Reinking is armed and dangerous and national public schools are in lockdown mode this morning. And we have now learned the shooter had a previous run-in with police, he was arrested last year for being in a restricted area near the White House. The four people who were killed had been identified. Authorities say they are Taurean Sanderlin, Joe Perez, Akilah DaSilva, and DeEbony Groves.</p><p>Well, cooler company Yeti is the latest company to separate ties with the National Rifle Association. The NA -- NRA, excuse me, reportedly sent out an e-mail to its members blasting Yeti saying the decision was not sportsmanlike. Yeti hasn't not said why it's parting ways with the NRA. Several companies, Enterprise, Hertz, Delta, United Airlines have all cut ties with the NRA in response to public outcry for gun control following the Florida school shooting in February that left 17 people dead.</p><p>Well, the late first lady Barbara Bush buried over the weekend at a gated plot in George H.W. Presidential Library in College Station, Texas. She is now near the grave of her daughter Robin who died from leukemia when she was just three years old. The grave site is going to be open to the public starting this morning. The Bush family did share photos from the private ceremony, hundreds of family and friends giving a final farewell. The day brought together four former presidents, the President Bushes as see here as well as bill Clinton, Barack Obama, the first ladies also there including Melania Trump.</p><p>And an attribute to his life's commitment to literacy, former President Bush wore a pair of socks decorated with stacks of colorful books. OK. Maria, you brought us the breaking news, it's a boy, baby number three for Kate and Prince Williams. Finally here, we just the announcement. The royal baby weighing in at -- get this, eight pounds, seven ounces. Prince William was by his wife's side when the baby was delivered. Fifth in line to the throne now. This baby is behind siblings Prince George and Prince Charlotte. His name has not been announced yet. We probably have to wait a little bit for that. A lot of well wishers looking at this live pictures at London obviously. Have been camped outside the hospital for at least two weeks and of course now there's a ton of buzz over in London. So happy news. Ahead of the royal wedding by the way which is coming up as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Congratulations to them. Thank you so much, Cheryl. China's largest music streaming company reportedly exploring going public. How Tencent music could follow in Spotify's footsteps, that's coming up. And then the rise of Artificial Intelligence. New ways the technology could Transform the workplace. That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Thinking beyond Alexa, Amazon reportedly working on a plan to build a robot for your home. The technology titan plans to start testing the new machines later this year. According to Bloomberg, the robots can move from room to room using tech similar to driverless cars. Just another example of how A.I. technology has the potential to transform your life. Joining us right now is the chief technology and innovation officer of Accenture, Paul Dougherty. Good to see you, Paul. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>PAUL DOUGHERTY, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION OFFICER, ACCENTURE: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you wrote a whole book about these human machines, Reimagining Work in the Age of A.I. How has it reimagined work?</p><p>DOUGHERTY: Yes. You know, we have this narrative around A.I. We hear about it these days and we think about A.I. taking over the human race, taking all of our jobs and beating us on all games and taking all our fun away. And we think that's the wrong narrative for A.I. What A.I. is really about is that it's a set of rules for companies in terms of how to be more competitive, how to drive more efficiency and how to drive growth and create a new business models and we don't talk enough about that and who wrote the book as guidance for executives and how to apply A.I. to transform their business and also how to do it in a way that represents the right way to use people and the capabilities of people to drive -- you know, to drive that growth and to use the technology worth it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it is taking away jobs. Not to be, you know, a fearmonger but when you do things more productive and you can do things easier from a robot standpoint, you're going to do it, right?</p><p>DOUGHERTY: Right. Absolutely. And so, A.I. is no different than any other technology and the fact that it, you know, every technology creates efficiencies and allows us to do things more effectively. A.I. is going to be no different. And there's a report recently from the OECD that talks about on the order of 14 percent of jobs being, you know, threatened by A.I. We think that's' about right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fourteen percent?</p><p>DOUGHERTY: About 14 percent. And another third of jobs beyond that being transformed significantly by A.I. and that's probably about right also. So, the issue is not that we don't have enough jobs because we're talk about many, many new types of jobs being created by companies. The issue is how do we prepare people with the right skills for these jobs because some will be displaced more quickly and that's why when decision we've made with the book is we're donating all the proceeds of the book to nonprofits and organizations that are helping with the rescaling challenge effectively for midcareer professionals. So we think that's where the challenge is. And we don't have all the answers to that but that' s what we think, we as business in society needs to deal with a little bit more effectively.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: And it's not the skills that some people might think looking down the road, we've talked about this, it's not computer programming, math and science, ultimately it's going to be humanities and ethics and areas like that kind of the arts if you will, because we're going to have to decide right, again. How do you -- what is OK for a robot to do in your life?</p><p>DOUGHERTY: Yes. Exactly right. We talk in the book about six new categories of jobs that we think represent millions and millions of jobs in the new economy and we call it the missing middle because we don't think that people are thinking about these jobs enough today is such missing in the current discussion. And these jobs are the key to really reshaping business and, you know, thinking about how we build the right skills in people. And broadly, we could talk about this market. There's two categories of jobs. There's one set of jobs which is all about where people are needed to help machines, you know, like you describe, implementing A.I. responsibly and reflecting the right behavior. It's trading A.I. properly. That's one entire category of jobs. The other set of jobs are jobs where A.I. and machines and robots help people work effectively, increase productivity up to 40 percent from the research that we've done. And we use phrase that gives humans superpower, that gives us better tools to do our jobs and allows people to do new things. And that's -- those categories of jobs are where we think the opportunity is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Elon Musk said recently with the production staffers on the Model 3 that he underestimated the value of human. That he overestimated the ability to basically use robots in manufacturing.</p><p>DOUGHERTY: That's a great example. Elon said that humans are underrated, it was his quote. And they're introducing more humans in the factories. They found they were overautomated, they were overindustrialized. Mercedes did the same with their S-class factory. BMW did the same in their factory. We're seeing the same another none, you know, robotic, nonmanufacturing scenarios where people are needed to apply creativity. People can improvise. People have the ability to communicated in a emotive response. And those types of things are necessary for the next generation of work that we're moving to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really interesting stuff. Paul, thank you so much. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>DOUGHERTY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you. Paul Dougherty there. Human Machine is name of the book.

The first state dinner of the Trump administration indeed goes to Emmanuel Macron of France. He will arrive later this afternoon, and then the first couples will head to nearby Mt. Vernon for dinner tonight at George Washington's home. The policy discussion will take place in earnest tomorrow, and trade and tariffs will be front and center.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON: I hope he will -- we will not implement these new tariffs, and he will decide to -- for an exemption for European Union. You don't make trade war with your ally.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: But he said that he is going to implement --</p><p>MACRON: He said, exemption through May 1st. Let's see what he will decide on May 1st. I just say, where are your priorities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The administration does point out that France is exempt to steel and aluminum tariffs, at least for now.

The White House does not push back on the notion that it was Macron who convinced President Trump to take action inside that country. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Blake, thank you so much. Blake Burman with the latest there. Meanwhile, shocking new revelations this morning about how the FBI probe into the Trump campaign really began. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes shares his newest findings on the investigation into accusations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. Here's what he told me yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES: So, we've long wanted to know what intelligence did you have that actually led to this investigation? So, what we found now after the investigators have reviewed it, is that, in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is former U.S. Attorney and Avenue Strategies Partner, Bud Cummins. Bud, good to see you. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>BUD CUMMINS, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY AND AVENUE STRATEGIES PARTNER: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to this, this morning, that Chairman Nunes says there was actually no official intelligence used to launch that investigation into the Trump campaign.</p><p>CUMMINS: I think it's significant. I mean, I saw that piece yesterday, on your show, I -- you know, I said wow! It's -- it draws us back, and I think not enough attention has been placed back to the time that this investigation started. And who knew all the facts and who didn't know all facts in the process of starting the, the appointment of special prosecutor. I think people need to be held accountable for withholding information about what actually happened, because it really looks like that politicians on the left, fraudulently put this information into the stream of commerce, and the FBI ran with it, and nobody seems to want to hold those people accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, so, maybe that was the insurance policy that Peter Strzok was texting Lisa Page about? Just constant --</p><p>CUMMINS: I think that's exactly what that is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Investigation after investigation, I mean, that's what I think, what do you think?</p><p>CUMMINS: I think that -- well, I think that's true, and I want to ask you all, you know, if someone proposed that we go to the summer convention in the next election cycle, and as part of the process, each party nominated some lawyer that it in the event they lose the election, that person will be immediately vested with investigatory powers and have access to grand jury to just perpetually investigate the winner. I don't think anybody would be for that, but I don't know how that's any different than what we have here, for a special prosecutor who has put in place apparently on totally fraudulent information that people knew was fraudulent. And now it just -- it's going on in the perpetuity. I mean, what do we do about that? And I really don't have answer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Extraordinary.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: It is extraordinary. But one of the things that I find fascinating talking to voters is that they say, it almost is doesn't matter how this all started, it matters now what they find. And that's a pretty dangerous mind-set. So, can you tell me how you share with the implications of what this means if, if the process totally changes as a result of this?</p><p>CUMMINS: Well, I mean, you know, this is this happens in typical investigations out of U.S. Attorneys officers all the time. You start in one area, you trip up some other information, that you didn't know about when you started, and you pursue it because you can't come in to look for the drugs and find a dead body and ignore it. I mean, you have to do what you got to do. But the question I think is, are all these new issues that the special prosecutor may or may not find, to start looking into, are -- do they still fall into the scope of the need for a special prosecutor? Can't most of these things be looked at through Department of Justice and through the U.S. Attorney's offices in the typically setup? And I don't really know a mechanism to shut down as special prosecutor until special process himself comes forward and says I'm done. And I'm not sure that's the way we want it to be set up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I mean, knowing what we know, in terms of the bias at the top of the FBI and the Department of Justice during election, knowing what we know that DNC paid for dossier to use to spy on the Trump campaign, and knowing that there was no other intelligence used to launch that campaign. Shouldn't -- I mean, shouldn't Robert Mueller be looking at these things? Is this going to be part of his investigation? Or are you saying, this investigation the special council should be shut down?</p><p>CUMMINS: Well, I think all these things can be looked at by Robert Mueller, or the IOG, or investigators in a criminal context out of the Department of Justice. I think that the main point from what you said that I'm interested in is the people really want the truth. This lock her up, lock him up mentality, this weaponization of politics trying to incarcerate people, as part of the political process I think is very dangerous and could lead to really bad place. We really want truth, and I think, from my money, we could go immunize all these people and say, look, you tell the truth, we're not going to prosecute anybody -- General Flynn, Papadopoulos, McCabe, Comey. Just tell us the truth and let's take a look at what happens so we don't repeat this. That's what's most important, I think, for the American people, but I don't think that that's possible. I mean, they've already gotten the guilty plea out of General Flynn, and I don't know how you take a guilty plea from General Flynn not charge Andrew McCabe. I mean, it's really a mess, and it has started by bad leadership at the Department of Justice and the FBI.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you think, Bud, it's Dagen McDowell that those charges will happen? Again, because we've talked about people -- just Martha Stewart as one example that we keep using, she lied to FBI and she went to prison. And you got Andy McCabe who was out there writing that editorial along with his wife in Washington Post, basically saying that it was a witch hunt, and he told the truth, and he actually -- he said he misremembered, I think, might've been the word that he used. But, again, he lied. He lied under oath three times according to the inspector general. Should you think he will be prosecuted?</p><p>CUMMINS: It's a very difficult question, but I think that if you look at the president, I've seen FBI prosecute lots of people who didn't commit any other crimes for lying under oath one time; he lied under oath three times. And you know -- but moreover, again, the truth is what's important to me, and the truth is that that guy should've never been deputy director of the FBI. One thing that jumped out of me in that IOG report was not criminal conduct, was how he threw his supervisors in New York and Washington under the bus when he'd leaked the information and then he called and chewed them out on numerous instances for not managing the leaks that he was leaking. That kind of leadership is, is, well, it's disturbing, to say the least, there are other words could I use that we probably shouldn't use on T.V.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES: Bud, it's Mike Murphy. I agree with your point that the -- when left versus right, real loser here is American public. So, maybe your idea of just granting immunity to people out there, just so we can get to the bottom of this, put it behind us and not have to go through a situation like this that drags on forever, and really hurts the country, and hurts citizens of this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, but that's another thing. I mean, the Clinton people did get immunity, right? Cheryl Mills -- even though they lied.</p><p>CUMMINS: Well, there wasn't even an investigation. I mean, you can't call what happened there an investigation. They, they touched and they moved on. They wrote a memo to dismiss it all before they'd done 17 interviews. That was a joke. There was a Hillary Clinton fan club, on the fifth floor of the FBI. And whether Jim Comey was part of it or not, I think, what he needs to write about in his book is how he was -- his management was -- abilities were unable to detect that his entire management team was in Hillary Clinton's pocket.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And abusing their power. Abuse of power.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You what the story is, though? It's very clear from listening to Jim Comey on this book tour, they just assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win, but they want to keep their jobs, they weren't going to put the hammer down on her because they were sure she was going to win, and then they didn't want the Clinton ire and the Clinton machine coming after them when she did win. That's the real backstory.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- said out loud or not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. And here Jim Comey is writing a book and on a book tour, rolling on with Amazon headquarters today, Bud. He's reportedly speaking for free to employees there, the fired FBI director's book: \"A Higher Loyalty\", top seller on Amazon. The company is taking drastic measures to avoid posts by people who did not read the book? So, Amazon is only allowing \"verified buyers\" to review best seller. It's just incredible.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CUMMINS: Yes, it is incredible, and you know, I'm more on that because as former colleague of Jim Comey, he was looked up to, and he worked very hard, frankly, to cultivate this stellar reputation in the law enforcement community. And his actions over the last two years, and especially, you know, tapping it all for this book tour have kind of ruined that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And how aggressive the Democrats? They're actually now suing the Republicans for exactly the reason and what they did during the 2016 election by protecting Hillary. Bud, it's good to see you, sir. Thank you.</p><p>CUMMINS: Thank you. Good to talk to you. Bye.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bud Cummins. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it is going to be a monster week for first-quarters earnings. More than a third of the Dow companies and the S&amp;P 500 companies are set to report. Alphabet, the name we're watching this morning with the reports after the close tonight. Nicole Petallides on the floor of New York Stock Exchange with a preview of expectations. Over to you, Nicole, good morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST: Good morning to you, Maria. We see Futures higher thus far, earnings season has been a win. We have 17 percent of the companies that have reported, 79 percent have actually beaten on earnings per share. We're watching Alphabet, Google parent, up one-third of one percent, today will report after the bell.</p><p>A couple of things, we've watched that some of the money according to one of the analysts I spoke to, a tech analyst, have moved out of semis because we had such week with semis last week in concerns about Apple and chip production and the like, moving into FANG. So, we'll watch Google in particular which has been a winner over the last 52 weeks. The other story pertaining to Google is a story in The Wall Street Journal, that who has more of your personal data than Facebook, try Google, and just evaluating the shadow profiles that they have on folks.</p><p>We're watching all these tech names, big week for tech as you said, Maria, reporting: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft. Another story we continue to follow is that of Southwest Airlines. The fatality last week when a fan blade broke off from the engine, the engine inspection is underway, 40 flights were canceled for them to inspect the engines. And they had an actual incident back in 2016, but that was not a fatality, that there was an incident with the same sort of engine. So, the checks are on. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Nic. Thank you so much, Nicole Petallides on Wall Street. The 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around three percent right now. The equity market seems to be taking it in stride. Futures now pointing to a higher opening with the Dow Industrials set to be up about 40 points. Let's get in with Stuart Varney right now, host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" looking at yields and stocks today. Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: I -- that's exactly what I'm looking at. And by the way, I cast my eye over Europe. Do you know what the 10-year Treasury or the Bunt yields in Germany? It is 0.63 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God. Wow!</p><p>VARNEY: And in France, it is 0.84 percent. In America, it's 2.98 percent. Now, I would have thought that a yield that high and probably going higher towards three percent would have caused something of Minor League sell-off in the stock market. But look at that, we're going to be up about 40 points on the Dow Industrials. My, how times change since January, when we pushed up towards three percent, and the markets sold off. Maybe, Maria, it's got something to do with big tech profits, which are going to be reported this week. They could be really, really good and maybe that's what's putting a base under the stock market. What do you guys say?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I definitely think earnings is a big part of the story, not just tech, but the fact that the first-quarter earnings are expected to be up 19 percent, just in a three-month period, year-over-year. I mean, it's --</p><p>VARNEY: Which is huge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because some people think -- some of these tech companies are going to miss, by the way, like Apple, like Google.</p><p>MURPHY: And, Stuart, you make some -- it's Mike Murphy. You make some great points. And if I told you on January 1st that we were going to get 19 percent growth on earnings per share in the S&amp;P 500 and the market was going to be flat, I think it'd be a buy-out.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. As a matter of fact, I would. And I'm glad you've been all over my show and Maria's shows, giving the good news there, Murphy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. We will be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now this, the head of Korean Airlines says that his two daughters have resigned from the company, after an uproar over allegations that they abused employees. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: OK. So, Maria, public anger forced the Chairman of Korean Air, Cho Yang-ho, to issue a public apology -- big deal over there -- this comes after Emily Cho is accused of throwing water in the face of an employee during a meeting. These allegations against the family have really since snowballed. On Saturday, the Korea Custom service raided the Cho's family home, seeking evidence that the family used their fleet of planes to bring luxury goods into South Korea without paying any taxes. There's been allegations of abuse against the employees we should say for years within this same family, so this is not a new story, frankly, for them.</p><p>OK. China's largest music streaming company, Tencent Music, is going to go public. They're expected to be one of the biggest tech IPOs ever. The valuation could exceed 25 billion. Tencent Music has got about 700 million monthly active users and this comes after Spotify's success (INAUDIBLE) with public of the New York Stock Exchange just earlier this month.</p><p>OK, stay with music. Rapper J. Cole just dropped his latest album on Spotify and it's shattering records.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>J.COLE, AMERICAN RAPPER: Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it. Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it. Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: OK. KOD, the album's title track was streamed 4.2 million times on Spotify. That makes it to the most listened to song on any opening day. J. Cole took the title from Taylor Swift, oh, who sung \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" Set the record at 3.8 million streams. That was August the last year. He also passed the debuts from Kendrick Lamar's \"DNA\" and The Weeknd's recent hit \"Call Out My Name.\" The song \"Photograph\" on J. Cole's KOD cracked the top five as well, streaming 3.5 million times. So, now, I'm going to go back and actually listen to the J. Cole's music because I never have. Full disclosure (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Am I totally lame for not knowing who they are?</p><p>CASONE: I obviously am, just to be cool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, final thoughts from this all- star panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Lee Carter?</p><p>CARTER: I just am so fascinated by the lack of trust that most Americans have in any institution and I think that's going to be the key to election in 2018. Who do they trust more?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point. Mike Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY: Big week for earnings. We're going to hear a lot from the big tech companies and I think you want to see not only the profits they're making but the cost and how they're pick up. But I think it's a great opportunity in this market as the underlying economy improves. Great opportunity out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Expenses could be an issue for Google. That's for sure. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Donald Trump deserves to have his secretary of state, demand that he chose Mike Pompeo, and it is appalling that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee could today vote against backing Pompeo's nomination. They need to look in the mirror and look -- and stop thinking about themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stop playing politics.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Have a great day, everybody. Let's get Stuart Varney on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" right now. Stu, over to you.</p><p>VARNEY: I'll take it, Maria, and good morning. Good morning, everyone. All right. For several years, the big American technology companies have shocked the world. They've innovated their way to global dominance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018042303cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5J-VB01-DXH2-645W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7961\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

My Android phone still thinks I\u2019m \u201cwing Cruz\u201d and doesn\u2019t know my kids. Pandora overplays The Church and Deadmau5 (no offense).<br/>As hackable as\u00a0Alexa,\u00a0Jeep Cherokees\u00a0and\u00a0credit card\u00a0services are over a public Internet not designed for security, the networked gadgetries enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT)\u00a0continue to dazzle. An overwhelming number of them will be on display again in January at the 2020\u00a0Consumer Electronics Show\u00a0(#CES2020).</p><p><br/>The primary vulnerability of the IoT is not hackers, though, but IoT\u00a0policy.<br/>Technology that overcomes\u00a0\u201cmarket failure\u201d in the provision of goods and services should enable the reduction and\u00a0streamlining of regulatory burdens. Instead it sometimes threatens to foster the expansion of government power.<br/>That is, the same IoT that animates objects can also mean\u00a0instantaneous nanny-state regulation from a distance\u2014of drones, vehicles, buildings, social media use, schooling and more. \u00a0<br/>You\u2019ve heard of free-range kids vs. helicopter parenting?<br/>Well, the society fancying itself on the verge of flying cars may face helicopter government instead; assorted bureaucrats clicking and swiping from afar, using the IoT to control the IoT.<br/>It\u2019s one thing for Tesla to send its own software updates to its customers\u2019 cars. We definitely want such things to happen\u2014a lot.<br/>But as Jason Dorrier\u00a0noted\u00a0in\u00a0Singularity Hub, \"regulations \u2026 written into software\u201d could be highly appealing to regulators. A \u201cNo drones within 100 feet of federal buildings,\u201d rule, for example, could be enforced by requiring the uploading to networked objects of software patches altering GPS coordinates, and disabling them in event of non-compliance.<br/>Dorrier named other examples: software patches imposing speed restrictions and no-drive zones on vehicles, preventing cars from starting without seatbelt attachment, and\u00a0mandating thermostat settings and water use restrictions\u00a0in buildings.<br/>Entrepreneur Marc Andreessen long ago\u00a0described software eating the world. Titans in sectors from \u201cmovies to agriculture to national defense\u201d are now software companies, run on software and delivered as online services.<br/>Unfortunately, while software has eaten business models, it is not eating traditional top-down central regulatory regimes in the sense of displacing them.<br/>Those systems are preparing to eat the IoT instead.\u00a0<br/>The next step in this \u201cevolution\u201d could go beyond rules mandating the updating or patching of software, to unelected bureaucrats simply doing it themselves remotely by clicking and swiping rather than enacting a law or rule, Constitution notwithstanding. The use of guidance documents, informal directives and other \u201coffers you can\u2019t refuse\u201d are already a prominent regulatory\u00a0concern highlighted by\u00a0the Administrative Conference of the United States. The IoT could magnify such abuse.<br/>In Long Beach, California, water authorities used\u00a0smart meters to nab alleged water-wasting\u00a0villains. The \u201clogical\u201d next step is government remotely overriding commercial building water and energy usage, perhaps even drafting the utility to countermand people\u2019s own smart home preferences. This is particularly galling since it\u00a0ignores governments\u2019 culpability\u00a0in the prevalence of shortages.<br/>For policymakers infected with Green New Deal (GND) fever and taking steps like installing\u00a0rooftop-mounted carbon-footprint monitors,\u00a0one need not speculate\u00a0on how\u00a0authoritarian they are prepared\u00a0to be when it comes to tweaking office buildings and regional tailpipes. Google\u2019s Street View cars fitted with\u00a0chemical sensors\u00a0now map air quality in several cities and provide that information to governments. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has already\u00a0invested in technology tracking office workers\u2019 energy and water usage, complete with visual alerts.<br/>The EPA has protested exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that might permit owners and researchers to\u00a0access and modify\u00a0vehicle software on the grounds that emissions might increase. But one suspects a future GND-lubricated EPA would itself love to remotely modify emission control software in vehicles \u2013 but punish you harshly if you do the same.\u00a0<br/>Politicians like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) take addiction psychology seriously, and Hawley has\u00a0introduced legislation\u00a0to require Big Tech to eliminate \u201cinfinite scrolling\u201d and set timers on gaming and social media. Future rules would be\u00a0written and enforced by\u00a0the Federal Trade Commission under this (so far, unpopular) scheme. Since these services are cloud based too, helicopter government may elect to ensure future compliance should such a regime emerge. For the children, of course.<br/>In a progressive society bent on turning professors and administrators into government employees via \u201cfree\u201d college, major\u00a0textbook publishers are going digital. So do not be surprised if students are required to use the government\u2019s preferred \u201cconstantly updated texts, tethering students and schools exclusively\u00a0to the publisher\u2019s digital platform.\u201d<br/>And so on.<br/>The \u201cSmart Cities\u201d movement potentially may present the\u00a0most significant incarnation\u00a0of Regulation from A Distance, though. Versions I\u2019ve noticed seem to involve heavy\u00a0governmental control, \"partnered\" with large corporations or government-preferred players.<br/>Despite\u00a0inherent operational difficulties\u00a0like procurement challenges, public-private partnerships indeed can play important roles in society (the more open to transition to fully market operations they are, the better, in my view). But\u00a0\u201cPPPs\u201d present problems\u00a0if they trend toward the \u201cpublic\u201d piece running the show and locking in a permanent regulated public infrastructure and utility mindset rather than ever envisioning any path to voluntarism and privatization. Here especially, the very IoT technology capable of overcoming ancient market failure justifications for government regulations and steering can be misused to expand the administrative state instead. As in any field, the political entrepreneurs among Big Tech\u2019s ranks will be happy to oblige and offer the licensed/approved technologies, such as traffic routing,\u00a0vehicle to infrastructure\u00a0V2I communications,\u00a0securing a monopoly\u00a0on emergent local or regional drone deliveries, or scoring coveted e-scooter contract (while I can\u2019t park my motorcycle on the sidewalk).<br/>It may be perfectly reasonable for\u00a0Uber and other ride-sharing outfits to collect and share\u00a0vast amounts of anonymized locational and traffic data with public authorities. But for reasons apart from the emissions tweaking noted, authorities in \u201csmart\u201d cities are also attracted to\u00a0remote override capabilities\u00a0over automated vehicles for\u00a0clearing lanes for emergency vehicles, routing around police and fire activity, or shutting down\u00a0the vehicle of a fleeing suspect. On an already\u00a0insecure-by-design\u00a0Internet on which targeted hacking could cause monumental\u00a0stranding and gridlock\u00a0(or even\u00a0weaponize\u00a0vehicles) this global \u201cLoJack\u201d is concerning and feeds into a suspicion that smart cities will be\u00a0primarily surveillance cities\u00a0that ignore requirements for court orders, echoing\u00a0abuses of red light traffic cameras and biometrics. In China, many vehicle manufacturers have been\u00a0sending locational information\u00a0to the government without the vehicle owner\u2019s awareness, and facial recognition there\u00a0enables jaywalkers to be outed on giant public screens.<br/>Ironically, local city planners themselves sometimes\u00a0game the useful traffic routing apps\u00a0commuters rely upon to thwart them, and even create gridlock\u00a0to drive distressed people into biking or public transport. Smart city planners can be similarly suspect.<br/>The most significant issues in the IoT, properly, entail\u00a0hazards or injury to third parties. But government can aggravate those. The federal government pursued a V2V (vehicle to vehicle) mandate that would have\u00a0locked in obsolete technology and increased an array of risks\u00a0across networked infrastructure. Furthermore, governments are prone to inappropriately indemnifying favored industries from the harms they cause, such as homeland security legislation that indemnified manufacturers of security technologies (like weapon alarms and bomb detectors) for losses above insured levels in the event of failure. Similarly, in the\u00a0nascent space commercialization\u00a0sector, the Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship (SPACE) Act of 2015 (in\u00a0Sec. 103\u2019s extension of \u201cIndemnification for Space Flight Participants\u201d) absolves launch providers from catastrophic losses or for injury to third parties (through September 2025). In this vein, it is likewise interesting that the\u00a0orbital space debris\u00a0that has become a concern has happened primarily without a large private sector presence in space.<br/>So in spite of the default to government that is now apparent in IoT, continuous safety and due care advances are not a challenge for industry, they are the normal goal and operational mode. Big Tech has lives and assets to protect.<br/>Indeed, technology helps expose regulatory malpractice and expands the case for\u00a0separation of tech and state. But it will be difficult to unspool opportunistic government entrenchment like that sought in the IoT if the bureaucratic impulse is allowed to prevail. Instead of worrying about autonomous vehicles, we\u2019d best thwart\u00a0autonomous regulation\u00a0and ensure ample opportunities for opt-out,\u00a0evasive entrepreneurship, and alternative business models.<br/>And for goodness sake\u00a0stop trying to do everything in the city. In colonial America, settlers sailed up the James and other rivers and built cities once they hit the rocks. Now the cities\u00a0are\u00a0the rocks. Rather than jump the gun with VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) air taxis, for example, practice in the county and the peripheries on networks of private land and construct altogether new property rights/corridor/route and infrastructure regimes. Then, sit back and enjoy the emergence of \u201cnew\u201d cities\u00a0out there. Afterward take the lessons learned and improve the old-school cities. Above all, do not use the IoT to \u201csolve\u201d a \u201ccity problem\u201d and inflict it on the nation. Offer it as one option, sure, but not the only.<br/>Foundational issues like these need to be worked out experimentally, not imposed push-button style. Scientists debate whether the best approach to AI is to program everything in, or to let it\u00a0learn like a baby, or some mix. Routing by AI algorithm can save lives in airspace and highways by\u00a0eliminating the human-error hazard, but it\u00a0doesn\u2019t have to be and ought not be government dominating this. I\u2019ve joked that technology and tracking could eventually make it possible to\u00a0pack the sky like a neutron star with commercial and personal drones, with defined corridors respecting rights.\u00a0Data sharing by entities\u00a0like the Space Data Association\u2019s satellite operators plays a large already prevalent role in risk management and situational awareness in space with insights that could potentially cross fertilize what happens on the ground with cars, and in-between with drones. Instead, drones are being absorbed into decades old commercial airspace models, not to mention already required to be registered with the federal government.<br/>Contractual devices, insurance and liability innovations that mitigate risk become easier, not harder in the normal course of events. Will those smart cites consist of hive-mind \u201croadway management systems\u201d and networked cars rather than\u00a0actually\u00a0independent autonomous vehicles that detect on their, not imposed, terms? Not so far. Instead, fusion of the (regulated) vehicle and the (hyper-regulated) infrastructure is the path we are on now, and it may or may not be the right one, depending on the setting (cities vs. country, for example). Amazon has patented a networking technology to allow self-driving vehicles en bloc to\u00a0navigate reversible lanes. Amazon, not the automakers, would own and operate such a network and presumably let any makers vehicles participate, and it seems a better, intermediate, approach than governmental management.<br/>But bottom-up and top-down approaches need to remain viable, because what governments seem to want is not localized, independent control from inside smart, autonomous vehicles (and intermediate-scale networking innovations atop that), but external control over everything. It\u2019s noteworthy that plain old\u00a0ice-skating rinks thrive without somebody with a megaphone telling everybody where to go, and the same can be true over tomorrow\u2019s networked world if allowed. Maybe it\u2019s best for city planners to control roadway signals, rather than potentially individual vehicles or fleets of them.<br/>Rather than top-down push button rules for the most complicated cases of cities, the rocks-in-the-river experimental stance also preserves the ability to explore trespass, peeping tom and vicious animal-style rules against misuse of drones and other IoT-enabled vehicles. as entrepreneur John Chisholm\u00a0described in defense of \u201corganic\u201d rather than imposed regulation\u00a0in\u00a0Unleash Your Inner Company. Heck, given the pace of miniaturization, maybe there won\u2019t be smart cars at all, but husks or \u201csleds\u201d that we snap our mobile devices into. But that can\u2019t be the case if smart cities amount to the major automakers teaming up with planners for a lock on the market.<br/>By this point it should be clear that another major problem with remote regulation at a distance is that it steamrolls over synergies with sibling and cousin network infrastructures that should be evolving in parallel. The planners\u2019 approaches so far preserve the siloed regulation of infrastructure that prevails today (power, water, sewer, transportation). The expansion of 5G and air and land corridors invites huge possibilities for simultaneous infrastructure development like privately managed drone docking/recharge stations (such as on\u00a0lampposts and church property) and other heavy-duty networking assets. But such symbiosis isn\u2019t happening that I can see.<br/>The gaps and sub-optimality imposed by the threat of top-down, siloed IoT regulation are symptomatic of the\u00a0myth that federal agencies offer expertise, let alone the myth of impartiality. Expertise in the modern IoT context necessarily consists of extending institutions of complex property rights and contract on land and in air and space. Bureaucrats, as well as the entire smart city concept, ignore that pretty much entirely in favor of the default public utility model as the backdrop and framework.<br/>The concerns preoccupying IoT policy seem not to be the actual complex property rights problems needing resolution, but rather seem self-reinforcing of regulatory bureaucracy, even cronyism. The Internet of Things also needs to be the Internet of Thinks; that means not entrenching dumb, permanent market-socialist policy via misuse of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>remote regulation and pushbutton bureaucracy.<br/>A main point of Jason Dorrier was that, while software updates typically add functionality, they can also take functionality away. While I might fantasize about pushing a button to ground Leonardo Decaprio\u2019s next\u00a0high-carbon-footprint jet flight\u00a0to a global warming confab, I\u2019d better not.<br/>But the same goes for bureaucrats when it comes to All Things IoT; they\u2019d best not. We\u2019ve a long way to go to get even the easy stuff right; take it from wing Cruz. \u00a0<br/>Originally published at Forbes.<br/>Image:\u00a0Experts:\u00a0Clyde Wayne CrewsDate:\u00a0Tuesday, November 12, 2019Source:\u00a0ForbesIssues:\u00a0Antitrust and CompetitionRegulatory ReformSearch Keywords:\u00a0regulationsinternetMedia appearance type:\u00a0Op-Eds and ArticlesTeaser:\u00a0Artificial intelligence can be curiously stupid.

Big Media, so easily seduced by Big Tech: we're liberal, too, and together we'll lead the world out of darkness into light, blah blah blah.Then Big Media discovered its virtue-signaling liberal sweetheart, Big Tech, is just as threatened by liberals as by conservatives,and it turns its firepower on liberals with the same savage abandon as it does on independent and conservative media.The bitter rage of the previously besotted and now betrayed suitor is evident in these recent articles inThe Atlantic, New York Times and Washington Post, all bastions of virtue-signaling self-righteous defense of the state-cartel Empire, a.k.a. liberalism.When the Tech Mythology Collapses[1](The Atlantic)Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook's Leaders Fought Through Crisis[2](NY Times)How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the 'Father of Android'[3](NY Times)It's time to start regulating Facebook[4](Washington Post)The high dudgeon of WaPo is especially amusing to those us blacklisted by the faux-liberalWashington Post'switch-hunting promotion of a bogus list of \"Russian propaganda\" sites in 2016.As I noted recently, some observers suspect Facebook is using this same baseless, fact-free libelous list in itsshadow banningof independent journalists and commentators.That Facebook would stick a knife in neoliberal globalist George Soros (gasp!)</p><p> to mask its calumny might have been an eye-opener for the enamored liberals who foolishly believed the facile PR of Facebook, Google et al.Nobody's more offended that the chump who falls for the obvious scam, a scam that any streetwise person would have spotted a mile away.Big Media so desperately wanted a partner in its faux-liberal virtue-signaling that it overlooked the abundant evidence that Facebook and Google are only interested in reaping billions of dollarsin ever greater concentrations of wealth and power. These are corporations, after all, and just like the corporations that own Big Media, maximizing profits is their soleraison d'etre, self-congratulatory preening claims of public service wonderfulness aside.Here's the ugly truth: Facebook and Google are profit-maximizing quasi-monopolies who will do anything to protect their monopolies.Just like all the other monopolies that had to be busted up to protect the public from their predatory power.I just received this email from theWall STreet Journal:the Big media war on Facebook just opened a new front, and it looks like a take-no-prisoners conflict now:With Facebook Under Siege, Zuckerberg Adopts More Aggressive StyleMark Zuckerberg gathered roughly 50 of his top lieutenants earlier this year and told them that Facebook was at war and he planned to lead the company accordingly.Mr. Zuckerberg's new approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook, driving several key executives from the company, according to people familiar with the matter.I've written a lot about these issues:here's a selection of recent essays:Are Facebook and Google the New Colonial Powers?[5]September 18, 2017The Demise of Dissent: Why the Web Is Becoming Homogenized[6]November 17, 2017Addictions: Social Media ...bile Phones Fall From Grace[7]November 24, 2017Should Facebook, Google and Twitter Be Public Utilities?[8]March 5, 2018Is Profit-Maximizing Data-Mining Undermining Democracy?[9]March 19, 2018The Blowback Against Facebook, Google and Amazon Is Just Beginning[10]April 27, 2018Shadow Banning Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg: We're All Digital Ghosts Now[11]October 27, 2018 My new mysteryThe Adventures of the Consulting Philosopher: The Disappearance of Drake[12]is a ridiculously affordable $1.29 (Kindle) or $8.95 (print);read the first chapters for free (PDF)[13]My bookMoney and Work Unchained[14]is now $6.95 for the Kindle ebook and $15 for the print edition.Read the first section for free in PDF format.[15] If you found value in this content, please join me in seeking solutions bybecoming a $1/month patron of my work via patreon.com[16].NOTE: Contributions/subscriptions are acknowledged in the order received.

The term was used by tech philosopher Langdon Winner in his essay, Technology As Forms Of Life. Winner puts forth the idea that we are simply in a state of sleepwalking in our mediations with technology. The reasoning is that technologies are developed faster than we can possibly understand their full implications, and as long as consumers attempt to keep in step with the ever-accelerating march of innovation, they \"willingly sleepwalk through the process of reconstituting the conditions of human existence\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Marcel O'Gorman of the University of Waterloo, what the kings of Silicon Valley really want is the \"somnambulation\" of its consumer base-a sleepwalking consumer is the best consumer. But a creeping deficit of public trust in powerful tech companies, or what has come to be known as a \"techlash\", might well be an indication that the somnambulists are waking up. This backlash against technology is for real, so much so that it is not only taking Big Tech down, but also having it to strive to win back the trust of people.</p><p>Scathing revelations about the role of fake news in the 2016 US elections, or Google being slapped with another record antitrust fine over its mobile software, or comparing tech firms that peddle \"addictive\" technology to be regulated like big tobacco, have set alarm bells ringing and are prompting calls of change.</p><p>Big Tech now finds itself facing huge scrutiny from regulators worldwide. It is fighting back to maintain or win the trust of its users. Companies are now factoring an emphasis on privacy, security and ethics in their hiring. According to CB Insights, some of the jobs read like this: investigations analyst for machine learning ethics at Google, director of privacy and customer trust covering Alexa service at Amazon, WhatsApp policy program manager for elections at Facebook, and so on.</p><p>Such developments have lessons for startups back home, especially as they now have global aspirations. There is a resounding message that even big technology companies can go from hero to zero if one is too fixated with a growth-at-all costs mentality. It is now calling upon the tech industry to re-evaluate its focus on short-term decisions that spur rapid user growth, and instead focus on how products will be used by society.</p><p>One might argue that despite the regulatory ire, Facebook just announced a jump in its quarterly revenues. This is exactly the question startups need to ask themselves: Do they want to grow into a tech giant that everyone loves to hate?</p><p>At the heart of the matter is the sheer power that tech companies/startups can command as they scale-Facebook is one of the richest and most politically influential companies in the world. But with great power also comes great responsibility. Startups need to be mindful of that. The argument has now shifted from innovation to responsible innovation.</p><p>If the techlash was not enough, there is growing noise around the tech bubble, which is now increasingly gaining currency among venture capital investors. Competition among VCs to invest in technology startups has driven up prices exponentially. But that pricing is justified only if there is an exit. Mega unicorns such as Uber, Lyft, Slack, Peloton and Airbnb, among others, are prepping for initial public offerings. If this group trades above their last private valuations, then it's validation for the mega-unicorn phenomenon. Else, it's a problem. Not only will it make or break existing funds, but it will likely determine the availability of late-stage capital.</p><p>Second, measures such as the modified foreign direct investment (FDI) rules for e-commerce, which has created pain for foreign players like Amazon and Walmart, will have other large FDI investor(s) become cagey about investing in India. Third, China is slowing down and sentiment isn't great. Down rounds have already begun to enter the lexicon in China's much-hyped tech sector. According to a Bloomberg report, venture capital deal-making is at its lowest since 2015 in China even as funding sizes shrink.</p><p>Whether it's a techlash or a tech bubble, it will be interesting to see how the industry manifests itself in 2019. It's about time the somnambulists woke up.</p><p>Shrija Agrawal is Mint's associate editor.

He is a left winger who wanted to remain in the EU, but the series of video reports by him and John Domokos called #8216;Anywhere but Westminster#8217;[1] showed their determination to literally and figuratively move outside their comfort zone on the issue of Brexit. </p><p> Now he has turned his attention to a new subject: health apps and Big Data in the age of the Internet of Things. Will having longer, healthier lives be worth losing the most basic kinds of privacy?[2] The deal has yet to be approved by the relevant regulators, but Google has got most of the way to buying Fitbit #8212; the maker of wearable devices that track people's sleep, heart rates, activity levels and more. And all for a trifling $2.1bn (1.6bn).The upshot is yet another step forward in Google's quest to break into big tech's next frontier: healthcare. Last month, in a Financial Times feature about all this, came a remarkable quote from a partner at Health Advances, a Massachusetts-based tech consulting company. Wearables, he reckoned, would be only one small part of the ensuing story: just as important were #8212; and no guffawing at the back, please #8212; #8216;bedside devices, under-mattress sensors, [and] sensors integrated into toilet seats#8217;. Such inventions, it was explained, can #8216;get even closer to you than your smartphone, and detect conditions such as depression or heart-rate variability#8217;. Most people here will probably think that the article and even more so the comments give too much weight to the creepiness of private corporations monitoring your every breath and too little to the creepiness of the NHS doing it. But even the biggest fans of capitalism can feel unease at anyone having this level of knowledge of the most intimate aspects of our lives. (Time was it was only little green men from flying saucers who had such a probing interest.) Nowadays both the private and the public sectors are amassing data, and whichever of them gets a comprehensive health surveillance system working first will promptly sell it to the other. Then again, before you declare that you will never allow the Internet of Things anywhere near your body, read this comment[3] from #8216;ID20857#8217;: A few months ago my Mum had a stroke. She is now paralysed down half of her body and confined to a wheelchair. I'm sure if she had the option of an early warning which could have prevented her stroke she wouldn't give a f**k about her privacy.

In December, he walked the red carpet, along with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, at a screening of ''The Post'' in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Friday, Mr. Bezos and his <person><nameText>wife, MacKenzie, </nameText></person>made public their $33 million donation to a nonprofit that provides college scholarships to so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. In October, he received an award for a donation to a marriage equality campaign. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Jennifer Cast, an Amazon executive who solicited the donation from him, said at the event that they could have donated anonymously to the campaign. ''But just as critical as the money was Jeff's offer to let us publicly acknowledge their gifts,'' she said.</p><p>  ''By allowing us to take their donation public,'' she added, ''the world quickly knew that <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos </nameText></person>supported marriage equality.''</p><p>  The appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos.</p><p>  As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world's most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon's hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon's growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.</p><p>  But while Mr. Bezos -- who at 54 is the world's richest person, with a net worth of more than $100 billion -- can afford virtually any luxury, obscurity is no longer among them.</p><p>Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of ''big tech,'' along with Apple, Alphabet's Googleand Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter.</p><p>  ''People are starting to get scared of Amazon,'' said Steve Case, a co-founder of America Online, who recently started an investment fund focused on start-ups in underserved areas, with Mr. Bezos among its contributors. ''If Jeff continues to hang out in Seattle, he's going to get a lot more incoming. Even for just defense reasons, he has to now play offense.''</p><p>  Mr. Bezos' portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city's most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city's political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.</p><p>  Mr. Bezos' space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.</p><p>  ''He's getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums -- not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,'' said Margaret O'Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos.</p><p>  In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, ''Jeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.''</p><p>  But interviews with more than 30 people who know Mr. Bezos, most of whom declined to be identified to protect their relationships with him, revealed his awareness of the growing opposition to Amazon and his growing comfort with being in the public eye.</p><p>  Mr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test.</p><p>  The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos' mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors.</p><p>  ''You're going to get a lot of scrutiny if you're disrupting other people's livelihoods,'' Mr. Buffett said.</p><p>  Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth.</p><p>  But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.</p><p>  Hiding in Plain Sight</p><p>  Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon's chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world.</p><p>  But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation.</p><p>  Even as he was named Time magazine's person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said.</p><p>  There were business benefits to staying out of the glare.</p><p>  A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.</p><p>  But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country's most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence.</p><p>  For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities.</p><p>  Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><p>  It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.</p><p>  By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.</p><p>  ''I'm not aware of what Amazon does in the community,'' Sally Jewell, the chief executive of the retailer R.E.I. at the time, said in The Seattle Times in 2012. ''It's not a name that comes up often in the nonprofit organizations I'm involved with.''</p><p>  With investors, Mr. Bezos gave just enough of a peek at Amazon's business to win their confidence while saying as little as possible to keep competitors guessing. To this day, Amazon will not disclose exactly how many Kindles, Echoes and other devices it has sold, and for years it refused to reveal financial details about Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud computing business.</p><p>  Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth.</p><p>  A Growing Spotlight</p><p>  A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments.</p><p>  At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon's image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said.</p><p>  Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.</p><p>  As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs.</p><p>  Suddenly, a company that once refused to confirm how many employees it had at its Seattle headquarters could not stop talking about how many jobs it was creating. It now has 542,000 employees.</p><p>  As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully.</p><p>  Waves of store closings by bricks-and-mortar retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble and Macy's increased the volume. ''Amazon Must Be Stopped,'' read a 2014 New Republic article about the company's growing market power.</p><p>  That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon's reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher's titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order.</p><p>  After the matter was resolved, Mr. Bezos told an interviewer that Amazon was simply negotiating hard on behalf of its customers.</p><p>  ''It's very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,'' he said, referring to book publishers.</p><p>  Another blow to the company's public standing landed in 2015 when The New York Times published a lengthy examination of Amazon's corporate work culture, which was depicted as an unforgiving environment. ''The article doesn't describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day,'' Mr. Bezos said in an email to the company's employees after the article came out.</p><p>  According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar.</p><p>  By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post.</p><p>  ''The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon!'' he tweeted in December that year. ''Big tax shelter.''</p><p>  Mr. Bezos responded by offering to launch the future president of the United States into space on a Blue Origin rocket.</p><p>  A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>  The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power.</p><p>  ''The purchase of Whole Foods was a moment when people looked up and recognized this company as a force in the economy,'' said Stacy Mitchell, a co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit advocacy group for local businesses, which has published a critical report on Amazon's impact on jobs and communities.</p><p>  Mr. Bezos Goes to the Other Washington</p><p>  People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality.</p><p>  He became an active user of Twitter in late 2015, posting a photo of himself wearing his lucky cowboy boots and a video clip of him standing atop a wind turbine in Texas. At an event with his brother in Los Angeles in November, as part of a long lineup of presentations by an array of business, wellness and entertainment leaders, he said his ideal job would be bartender, partly because he enjoys talking to people.</p><p>  ''I pride myself on my craft cocktails,'' he said.</p><p>  If there's an image that captures Mr. Bezos at the moment, it's a picture of him with his biceps bulging out of a polo shirt at a business conference in Idaho from July. ''Swole <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos</nameText></person>'' instantly became an internet meme, with one tweet juxtaposing shots of a doughy Mr. Bezos from the late 1990s (caption: ''I sell books'') and the brawny 2017 version (''I sell whatever I want'').</p><p>  The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon.</p><p>  On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin.</p><p>  Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post's leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper's top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in ''Joy of Cooking'' on their first visit to his house.</p><p>  ''It wasn't like we went to some billionaire's house and the help outnumbered the guests,'' said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper's chief information officer. ''He was trying to get the dog off the couch.''</p><p>  Mr. Bezos' more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.</p><p>  Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company's advantage. In September, he masterminded the company's splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move -- up to 50,000 total -- and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply.</p><p>  In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital's stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue's row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home -- two combined properties that used to be the city's Textile Museum.</p><p>  Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city's movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions.</p><p>  ''It's a very big house,'' said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. ''I hope he has a party for us in the house.''</p><p>  Sally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city's social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos' plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum.</p><p>  ''There's really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,'' said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of ''The Post.'' ''It would be like a throwback to the old days.''</p><p>  ''I think Jeff,'' she said, ''is the only person who could do that.''</p><p>  Follow Nick Wingfield and Nellie Bowles on Twitter: @nickwingfield and @NellieBowles</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: A wide portfolio of ventures has thrust <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos, </nameText></person>right, further into the spotlight.

The courier fled - without the order.  </p><p>  The violent incident is the latest in a growing number of horror stories from restaurateurs who say they are being forced into heated interactions with angry delivery people - thanks to big tech companies like DoorDash that motivate their couriers to move quickly and handle high volumes.  </p><p>  \"These companies like DoorDash claim to do heavy background checks, but I wouldn't want to have these people at my door at 11 p.m.,\" Good Pizza's owner, Nando de Stefano, told The Post. De Stefano filed a police report over the March incident.  </p><p>  Kwan Disbanchong, who owns Ruam Mitr, a Thai restaurant in LA, said she recently received a negative Yelp review from an out-of-line DoorDash worker calling the food \"trash\" because he was angry about how long it took for the order to be cooked.  </p><p>  \"Trash food, took over an hour for them to cook it,\" read the Feb. 24 review, which implied the courier was a customer.  </p><p>  After finding the same review on the courier's personal Facebook page, Disbanchong complained to DoorDash, which said it would \"tell the driver\" about her complaint, she said.  </p><p>  Another DoorDash hire made a scene in Disbanchong's restaurant after he got a ticket for parking in a loading zone, she said.  </p><p>  \"He told me that I need to pay for his ticket and he got louder and louder because he wanted my customers to hear,\" the Ruam Mitr owner told The Post. </p><p>  \"We investigated these reports of inappropriate behavior as soon as they were brought to our attention and took appropriate action in each case,\" said DoorDash, without specifying the actions it took.  </p><p>  Orozco, Good Pizza's general manager, claims DoorDash \"didn't do anything\" after it was informed of her assault, which she says sent her to the hospital.  </p><p>  The privately held company is the fastest-growing Silicon Valley food delivery business, recently overtaking the longtime industry leader, Grubhub - which owns Seamless - in market share, according to sales data tracker Second Measure.  </p><p>  The San Francisco company and its competitors, Postmates and UberEats, generally pay their delivery hires a flat fee based on the time and distance they estimate it will take a courier to complete the order, sources told The Post. Under this scheme, the more quickly couriers can move, the more they stand to get paid per hour.  </p><p>  In some cases, companies can send couriers to restaurants to place an order and wait for the food to be cooked - often for little to no pay, sources said.  </p><p>  \"Postmates pays pennies for the courier to wait and DoorDash pays nothing,\" said George Montgomery, who has delivered food for both. </p><p>  Adding to the couriers' stress are restaurants that are hostile to outside delivery people, the Charlotte, NC, resident said.  </p><p>  \"I've had a Cheesecake Factory manager tell me to shut up and sit in the corner and if I ask how long the order will take, he'll kick me out of the restaurant,\" he said.  </p><p>  Concerns over aggressive and unsanitary behavior from third-party couriers generally have spurred a group of restaurant owners in LA's Westwood neighborhood to call on the city's health department to regulate the industry. They want the city to require food couriers to be trained in proper food-handling procedures, including temperature issues, and to inspect drivers' vehicles. </p><p>  \"I have concerns about how clean and safely my food deliveries are made and whether my customers feel safe,\" Roozbeh Farahanipour, owner of LA-based Delphi Greek, told The Post. \"If a customer gets hepatitis, they are going to sue the restaurant.\" </p><p>  One viral video from earlier this year showed a DoorDash delivery person, known as a Dasher, sneaking a sip of a milkshake before ringing the doorbell of a Stockton, Calif., homeowner who ordered the beverage. In another widely reported story, a Yorktown, Pa., diner complained he opened his order - also delivered by a Dasher - only to discover two of his six ribs had been eaten. </p><p>DoorDash has said it terminated the milkshake courier, and the Pennsylvania customer received a refund from DoorDash for his meal, according to reports.  </p><p>  \"I've seen homeless people deliver food from their cars which are stuffed with all of their belongings and it's heartbreaking,\" Farahanipour said about the industry generally. \"But we do not exist to be a charity.\" </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lfickenscher@nypost.com\">lfickenscher@nypost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Red-hot food tape These video stills from a security camera at an LA pizza spot document events involving a DoorDash courier: 1.

In pursuing a multi-alternatives strategy in line with its objective, your Board continues to believe this Company offers an attractive opportunity to access a range of assets which tends to be less sensitive to the volatility of equity markets and which therefore constitutes a useful and important portfolio diversifier.<br/>   Performance and Dividend<br/>   During the period under review the Company's Net Asset Value (\"NAV\") per share fell by 0.6% to 333.4p. Inclusive of the final dividend of 2.5p paid in August 2019 shareholders received a (Sterling) NAV total return of 0.1% for the period. This performance compares disappointingly with the 10.6% return from the Company's benchmark, the FTSE World Total Return Index(1) .  Equity markets have delivered exceptional annualised returns since the end of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, with a marked contribution from 'big tech' companies, notably in the US.  The Company's equity benchmark is not an ideal comparator and a more appropriate reference point may be the average return of 4.6%(2) achieved over the same reporting period by the AIC Flexible Investment Trust sector in which your Company sits.<br/>   As your investment team discusses in greater detail in its report, performance for the period was impacted significantly by the well-publicised 'short-attack' on our holding in the listed litigation funding business, Burford Capital, and by a marked deterioration in the outlook for Riverstone Energy, a listed investor in oil and gas. Despite these significant setbacks during the period within our public equity allocation, the portfolio delivered good performance elsewhere, notably in its private equity portfolio.<br/>   The last annual report covered the 18 months to 31 March 2019, following the change to the Company's year-end from September to March.  During that 18-month period the Company paid an interim dividend. It remains the Board's intention to revert to the payment of a yearly dividend at the end of the financial year. Accordingly, this will be announced in our annual results for the March 2020 year-end and put forward for approval at the annual general meeting. In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the Board intends at least to maintain current dividend levels and, in the future, to seek to deliver a progressive annual dividend policy, by using accumulated revenue reserves where necessary.<br/>   Fund Management Team and Strategy<br/>   Alex Barr joined the Company's investment management team as the senior manager in mid-July. Alex, a specialist in alternative and private markets investments, has held senior roles at both Deutsche Asset Management and Aberdeen Standard Investments. Since Alex's arrival, he has undertaken a root-and-branch review of the portfolio and our Company's competitive positioning. In addition, he has been meeting shareholders and listening to their views. His conclusions are being considered by your Board and its advisers and any recommendations and consequent proposals will be shared with shareholders early in 2020.  As always, I welcome the opportunity to meet shareholders and listen to their opinions and views.<br/>   Discount<br/>   At the period-end, the share price discount to NAV stood at 19.3%, largely unchanged from the 31 March discount of 19.5%, but it has since widened to 21.2%(3) .<br/>   Discounts continue to be wide for many specialist investment companies, particularly so for listed private equity companies, with which your Company shares some similarities. Given the increasing importance advisers and investors are attaching to having an allocation to alternatives in their portfolios - and the consistency of investment returns being generated by many closed-end alternatives companies - your Board remains very concerned with the level of the Company's discount. Your Board is also aware that the Company's share price discount may widen as a result of an overhang from time to time of stock in the market. It is now your Board's intention to use its share buyback powers more tactically, taking into account the size of the Company and any possible impact on liquidity.<br/>   In combination with the reinvigorated and ongoing investor engagement and marketing programme being undertaken by the investment management team, your Board believes these measures will be supportive in narrowing the discount.<br/>   Outlook<br/>   Shorter-term political risks persist, particularly with regard to the outcome of the imminent UK December election (and resultant consequences for raised government spending), to external investment confidence (in the UK) and to the future outcome of Brexit. Longer-term risks are centred on global growth and specifically the unresolved trade and tariff dispute between the US and China which may yet spread to Europe. Despite such threats, public equity valuations seem accommodative of some further momentum in equity markets.<br/>   It is against this backdrop the investment management team is developing its pipeline of alternatives investments. The private markets space (accessed via both listed and non-listed securities), one of several investment strands available through the Company's multi-alternative remit, remains particularly attractive. It rewards thorough and professional due diligence and can capture 'illiquidity premia'(4) in addition to the many themes and ideas not always available through more conventional investment strategies. The Company's multi-alternatives strategy remains an important portfolio diversifier for many shareholders.  I look forward to presenting our proposals early in 2020 following the 'fresh impetus, energy and experience'(5) that has been demonstrated with the recent strengthening of our investment team.<br/>   Richard Gubbins<br/>   Chairman<br/>   25 November 2019<br/>   1 Source: Bloomberg, return in Sterling<br/>   2 Source: Morningstar Direct, NAV total return basis (as at 22 November 2019)<br/>   3 Source: Based on NAV of 328.55p and share price of 259.00p (as at 15 November 2019)<br/>   4 The additional gains normally offered as compensation for not being to sell an illiquid asset more immediately than a liquid one (for example, shares in a FTSE-100 company)<br/>   5 Source: 'Investment Trust Newsletter', a subscription-only FCA regulated tipsheet published by The McHattie Group.

Equity markets have delivered exceptional annualised returns since the end of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, with a marked contribution from 'big tech' companies, notably in the US. The Company's equity benchmark is not an ideal comparator and a more appropriate reference point may be the average return of 4.6%2 achieved over the same reporting period by the AIC Flexible Investment Trust sector in which your Company sits.</p><p>As your investment team discusses in greater detail in its report, performance for the period was impacted significantly by the well-publicised 'short-attack' on our holding in the listed litigation funding business, Burford Capital, and by a marked deterioration in the outlook for Riverstone Energy, a listed investor in oil and gas. Despite these significant setbacks during the period within our public equity allocation, the portfolio delivered good performance elsewhere, notably in its private equity portfolio.</p><p>The last annual report covered the 18 months to 31 March 2019, following the change to the Company's year-end from September to March. During that 18-month period the Company paid an interim dividend. It remains the Board's intention to revert to the payment of a yearly dividend at the end of the financial year. Accordingly, this will be announced in our annual results for the March 2020 year-end and put forward for approval at the annual general meeting. In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the Board intends at least to maintain current dividend levels and, in the future, to seek to deliver a progressive annual dividend policy, by using accumulated revenue reserves where necessary.</p><p>Fund Management Team and Strategy</p><p>Alex Barr joined the Company's investment management team as the senior manager in mid-July. Alex, a specialist in alternative and private markets investments, has held senior roles at both Deutsche Asset Management and Aberdeen Standard Investments. Since Alex's arrival, he has undertaken a root-and-branch review of the portfolio and our Company's competitive positioning. In addition, he has been meeting shareholders and listening to their views. His conclusions are being considered by your Board and its advisers and any recommendations and consequent proposals will be shared with shareholders early in 2020. As always, I welcome the opportunity to meet shareholders and listen to their opinions and views.</p><p>Discount</p><p>At the period-end, the share price discount to NAV stood at 19.3%, largely unchanged from the 31 March discount of 19.5%, but it has since widened to 21.2%3.</p><p>Discounts continue to be wide for many specialist investment companies, particularly so for listed private equity companies, with which your Company shares somesimilarities. Given the increasing importance advisers and investors are attaching to having an allocation to alternatives in their portfolios - and the consistency of investment returns being generated by many closed-end alternatives companies - your Board remains very concerned with the level of the Company's discount. Your Board is also aware that the Company's share price discount may widen as a result of an overhang from time to time of stock in the market. It is now your Board's intention to use its share buyback powers more tactically, taking into account the size of the Company and any possible impact on liquidity.</p><p>In combination with the reinvigorated and ongoing investor engagement and marketing programme being undertaken by the investment management team, your Board believes these measures will be supportive in narrowing the discount.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>Shorter-term political risks persist, particularly with regard to the outcome of the imminent UK December election (and resultant consequences for raised government spending), to external investment confidence (in the UK) and to the future outcome of Brexit. Longer-term risks are centred on global growth and specifically the unresolved trade and tariff dispute between the US and China which may yet spreadto Europe. Despite such threats, public equity valuations seem accommodative of some further momentum in equity markets.</p><p>It is against this backdrop the investment management team is developing its pipeline of alternatives investments. The private markets space (accessed via both listed and non-listed securities), one of several investment strands available through the Company's multi-alternative remit, remains particularly attractive. It rewards thorough and professional due diligence and can capture 'illiquidity premia'4 in addition to the many themes and ideas not always available through more conventional investment strategies. The Company's multi-alternatives strategy remains an important portfolio diversifier for many shareholders. I look forward to presenting our proposals early in 2020 following the 'fresh impetus, energy and experience'5 that has been demonstrated with the recent strengthening of our investment team.</p><p>Richard Gubbins</p><p>Chairman</p><p>25 November 2019</p><p>1 Source: Bloomberg, return in Sterling</p><p>2 Source: Morningstar Direct, NAV total return basis (as at 22 November 2019)</p><p>3 Source: Based on NAV of 328.55p and share price of 259.00p (as at 15 November 2019)</p><p>4 The additional gains normally offered as compensation for not being to sell an illiquid asset more immediately than a liquid one (for example, shares in a FTSE-100 company)</p><p>5 Source: 'Investment Trust Newsletter', a subscription-only FCA regulated tipsheet published by The McHattieGroup.

Through this transaction, Henkel will expand its D2C go-to-market footprint in beauty care and add strong digital capabilities in areas such as performance marketing, analytics and fast innovation.</p><p>\"As part of our strategic framework for purposeful growth we pursue value-adding acquisitions to strengthen our businesses. This agreement is a proof point of how we consistently implement our strategy. It is also in line with our objective to strengthen our competitive edge in the area of digitalization by expanding our direct-to-consumer activities,\" said Henkel CEO Carsten Knobel.</p><p>HelloBody, Banana Beauty and Mermaid+Me offer premium beauty care products and address the growing trend of sustainable and clean beauty. HelloBody is active in the skin, body and hair care categories, Mermaid+Me focuses on hair care products. Banana Beauty offers decorative cosmetics such as lipsticks and eyeliners.</p><p>For the 12 months ended June 2020, the businesses generated total sales of approximately [euro]100 million ($117.4 million) and employed around 180 people, including an experienced incubator team.</p><p>\"I would like to thank our entire team at Invincible Brands, together with capital D, for executing a phenomenal growth plan over the past two years,\" added Bjoern Keune, co-founder of Invincible Brands. \"With Henkel there is now an exciting opportunity to continue building on that. The combination of our direct-to-consumer and social media marketing skills with Henkel's R&amp;D, product knowledge and global footprint provides a winning formula. I am very much looking forward to working with the team at Henkel.\"</p><p>The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.</p><p>US Targets French Cosmetics with 25% Duties</p><p>* FRANCE: In July, The Trump administration announced 25% tariffs on $1.3 billion of French cosmetics, handbags and other imports.

The US has initiated similar Section 301 investigations of digital services taxes adopted or being considered by 10 other countries, which could result in tariffs against their goods as well.</p><p>OECD talks aimed at developing a multilateral solution for taxing digital services have failed to produce any results, with negotiations complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The Trump administration said it would hold off on implementing the tariffs for up to 180 days.</p><p>Mary Kay Tackles Sexual Harassment</p><p>* UNITED KINGDOM: Earlier this year, Mary Kay Inc. joined the International Women's Forum (IWF) Virtual Conference, for a session titled \"Safe Sets: An online panel discussion with Time's Up UK.\" The live session tackled the ever-present issue for women across the globe: sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace. Time's Up UK stressed the critical importance of changing the culture to ensure a safe workplace free from harassment and referred to the work being done to define safety for women in film through intimacy guidelines.</p><p>\"Time's Up's efforts will help bring about broader change for women in the workplace--worldwide and across industries,\" said Carolyn Passey, general manager of Mary Kay UK and Ireland. \"Mary Kay is proud to support, through IWF, women leaders who are standing up to give fellow women a voice, help them embrace their identity and define their own boundaries.\"</p><p>The speakers with Time's Up UK included Dame Heather Rabbatts, Time's Up UK Chair, managing director of Cove Pictures, chair of Soho Theatre and non-executive board member for Arts Alliance, and Ita O'Brien, an intimacy coordinator and founder of Intimacy on Set, her company through which she has been developing best practices regarding intimacy and nudity in film, television and theatre and through which she trains intimacy coordinators all over the world.</p><p>\"What was increasingly apparent throughout the conversation was how #MeToo and Time's Up have had a huge and positive influence for changing the way productions work, how they are shifting to better practices in many new ways, and in particular with the new role of the intimacy coordinator,\" said Dame Heather Rabbatts. \"The conversation about safe sets is about how we make the culture shift, one industry after another, until we don't need to have this conversation ever again.\"</p><p>\"It is invigorating to witness the influential work that female thought leaders and advocates have achieved over the past several years for the advancement of women's safety and security in the workplace. These women, some of the most influential thought leaders in the United Kingdom, are on a mission to champion the next generation of women to become tomorrow's leaders,\" said Marty Wikstrom, member of IWF UK and co-chair of the Cornerstone Conference. \"IWF has been advancing women's leadership and championing equality worldwide since 1974, and Mary Kay has been an advocate of women's entrepreneurship and leadership since 1963. This session reflects a meeting of the minds, and we are proud to showcase this female-fueled partnership.\"</p><p>Kose Creates New In-Store Experience</p><p>* JAPAN: Kose is offering customized masks at its Tokyo store by using Bellus3D face scanning technology to provide customers with the unique and personalized beauty experience.</p><p>Using Bellus3D face scanning technology, Kose can develop personalized sheet masks that precisely match the contours of each customer's face. Kose's process captures a 3D scan of the customer's face at the store, converts it to 2D data, and uses a laser processing machine to cut the sheet mask and provide it to the customer right in the store.</p><p>Maison Kose, a concept store featuring digital technology, opened in December 2019 and offers a variety of beauty content across its brands fusing digital and experience. These \"beauty attractions\" provide unique new beauty experiences tailored to each customer.</p><p>\"This is one of the beauty attractions that we would like to offer to our customers at Maison Kose and we are excited to be partnering with the technology leader in 3D facial scanning,\" said Akira Matsubara, executive officer of Kose Corporation.</p><p>BASF Wins Ingredients Award</p><p>* JAPAN: BASF Personal Care Solutions has received the \"Effective Ingredient\" award for its latest innovation, BioToLife.</p><p>Employing an innovative Japanese technology backed by academic studies, BASF uses a unique glycolipid as its active ingredient in BioToLife, originally fermented by a special strain of Starmerellabombicola yeast, derived from vegetable oil and sugar. This unique fermented extract curbs the overgrowth of microbials by uprooting the biofilm that form on surfaces and restores an environment which supports the formation of a balanced micro-ecosystem.</p><p>With BioToLife, BASF has applied the same mechanism that took millions of years in natural evolution, to cosmetics and rinse-off products.</p><p>BASF says its ultimate goal in developing BioToLife is to retrieve the optimal balance for our wellness--now, and in the future. From the wellness of our skin, hair and scalp, to our oral health, overall beauty and well-being--both inside and out.</p><p>The Effective Ingredient\" award was given to BASF by Ringer Technology and sponsored by Happi.</p><p>Perrigo Acquires Self-Care Brands from Sanofi</p><p>* IRELAND: Perrigo Company plc, a global provider of self-care products, is acquiring three Eastern European OTC skin care and hair loss treatment brands (Emolium, Iwostin and Loxon) from Sanofi. For the year ending June 30, 2020, product sales were approximately $23 million.</p><p>\"We continue to prioritize opportunities that build on our self-care transformation and seek bolt-on assets that support our five growth pillars. We are pleased to add these margin enhancing assets to strengthen our international self-care portfolio and deliver value for our shareholders,\" commented Perrigo President and CEO Murray S. Kessler.</p><p>Perrigo EVP and President of CSCI Svend Andersen added, \"The addition of these market-leading OTC brands serves as another step for Perrigo's CSCI growth plans, expands our already robust skin care franchise and adds scale to our Eastern Europe business.\"</p><p>The transaction is expected to close early in the fourth quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. Other terms of the transaction were not disclosed.</p><p>Perfect Diary Seeks Investment</p><p>* CHINA: Perfect Diary, the Chinese online makeup brand, is in talks to raise between $100-200 million from potential investors, including Warburg Pincus, TPG Capital and Blackstone Group, as well as existing investors such as Hopu Management Investments and Boyu Capital.</p><p>The talks are ongoing and have not been finalized and details may still change, but if successful, the investment would double the startup's valuation to $4 billion from $2 billion. The company declined to comment.</p><p>Competition is getting fierce in China's cosmetics market. With China emerging as one of the largest economies to begin recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, global brands are relying even more on Chinese consumers to prop up sales.</p><p>Research consultancy Gartner said in a June report that Chinese consumers have become more nationalistic and health conscious since the outbreak of Covid-19. Domestic brands such as Perfect Diary \"flourished during the pandemic, releasing low cost, high value, viral products driven by social media in the middle of the lockdown,\" the report said.</p><p>Meanwhile, richer and younger Chinese consumers are shifting their spending away from foreign brands in several categories including cosmetics, according to a report by online retailer JD.com.</p><p>Perfect Diary is part of a trend of China's homegrown consumer brands looking to displace traditional retailers and foreign brands. The Guangzhou-based startup is leveraging Chinese social networks such as WeChat and ByteDance's Douyin video app, as well as e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba's Tmall, to mount a challenge against more established foreign rivals like Chanel and Estee Lauder.</p><p>SMA Opens Technology Innovation Center in Seoul</p><p>* SOUTH KOREA: SMA Collaboratives LLC opened a Technology Innovation Center in South Korea in July.</p><p>\"The center is a major milestone for our organization. Not only will it support innovations, it will enable SMA to take another key step forward on entering new areas with high value and sophisticated technologies,\" said Saad Ashoor, the company's president. Located in Seoul, the facility will host both R&amp;D and the global applications team.</p><p>Kuida Expands into Asia-Pacific</p><p>* HONG KONG: Colombian CBD skin care brand Kuida says it is the first brand from Colombia to enter the Asia-Pacific market.
