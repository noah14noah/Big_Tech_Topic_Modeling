The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

More than 90 percent of all students were not allowed to attend school, according to the UNESCO World Education Report 2020. And even now, many students still have to study online. These restrictions have impacted equal opportunities and high-quality education, especially for children from financially weaker and disadvantaged backgrounds. This year's International Literacy Day 2020 on September 8 therefore focuses on \"Literacy teaching and learning in the COVID-19 crisis and beyond\", especially on the role of educators and changing pedagogies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The pandemic further increases inequalities in the education system. We embrace the current dynamics and have developed digital enhancements to our programmes that will reach students, even if studying at home\", says Lareena Hilton, Global Head of Brand &amp; Corporate Social Responsibility, Deutsche Bank.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Baut Eure Zukunft</p><p>Together with our partner organisations, we have adapted many of our Born to Be youth engagement programmes to meet the current restrictions. New online platforms now complement traditional classroom settings to reach everyone everywhere, like our Baut Eure Zukuft (Build your Future) project, which encourages students in grades 8 to 10 to work against social challenges like bullying, violence and racism. The programme is starting with online classes and workshops to allow anyone who wants to participate - Germany-wide.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 SUMMARY</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD\">http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD</url></p><p>Industry: Capital Markets</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>August 18: Deutsche Bank appoints Vietnam Country Chief</p><p>Deutsche Bank today announced the appointment of respected Vietnamese banker, Huynh Buu Quang, as Acting Chief Country Officer (CCO) Vietnam, pending State Bank of Vietnam final approval.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Alexander von zur Muehlen, said: \"With Vietnam a key growth market for our bank in ASEAN, we are delighted to have an individual of Quang's calibre and experience leading the next phase in the expansion of the local franchise.\"</p><p>An experienced CEO, Quang has led significant transformation and growth strategies for both international and local banks. To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

Solid trade finance performance across key markets, with solutions for Tianshan Aluminium and Nayara Energy named the best structured solutions in China and India respectively. Double win in the 'Best ESG Solutions' category for service to Cargill and Payoneer, evidencing Deutsche Bank's market-leading expertise in this critical sector.</p><p>David Lynne, Deutsche Bank's Head of Fixed Income &amp; Currencies, APAC and Corporate Bank, APAC said: \"We are honoured to receive this recognition that reflects the depth and breadth of our solutions and the strength of our client partnerships across the region.</p><p>June 30: Deutsche Bank signs climate commitment</p><p>Today Deutsche Bank signed the climate commitment of the German financial sector. By doing so, we pledge to align our credit and investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"Banks play a crucial role in the fight against climate change. Because it is up to us to provide the funds for the transformation of the global economy through financing and investment products. We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets.

Supervisory Board. \"Flavio has been responsible for restructuring and relaunching Deutsche Bank's Italian business, revitalising the company's I.T. infrastructure and engaging in an active and constructive dialogue with all stakeholder groups. Flavio developed and launched the Deutsche Bank Italia Foundation and has been a champion of a number of social causes in Italy during his career.

Altogether, Germany's anti-crisis measures - consisting of extra spending, guarantees and loan/participation programs - sum up to an astronomic value of around EUR 1.9 tr (well above 50% of GDP in 2019). This gives the government huge scope to fight the pandemic and economic crisis.

Her first stint in sustainability was in the non-profit sector, where she spent several years managing large programs in areas like global health and microfinance. When she decided to make the leap to the private sector because of her \"firm belief that private capital can make a significant difference in accelerating the shift to a sustainable economy\", she first completed a Finance degree before joining Sustainalytics, an ESG rating agency.</p><p>As global head of green and sustainable bonds, Taneja was responsible for growing the issuer side of the business, new product development and commercializing ESG products for issuers.</p><p>Then Deutsche Bank came calling</p><p>\"I'm quite entrepreneurial, and ESG is a fast-moving market, so the opportunity to grow the bank's Sustainable Finance business further really appealed to me. It's an exciting new venture,\" said Taneja, whose experience helping more than 200 issuers with their green and sustainable bonds directly translates to her new role at Deutsche Bank. As the Green, Social, Sustainable bonds (GSS) market is only about five or six years old, it can be a challenge to find someone with experience working with different types of issuers, whether that's corporates, banks or sovereigns, in different countries and regions.</p><p>\"Our mandate is two-fold: first, we want to act as ESG advisors to the bank's clients, helping position Deutsche Bank as an expert on ESG,\" she explained.</p><p>August 31: Anna Herrhausen appointed Head of Art, Culture &amp; Sports at Deutsche Bank</p><p>Anna Herrhausen Anna Herrhausen, Executive Director Alfred Herrhausen Gesellschaft, takes charge of Deutsche Bank's Art, Culture &amp; Sports department, embedded within the Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility function, with immediate effect. In this role she succeeds Anke Hallmann, Deputy Head of Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility, who took on responsibility for the department from Thorsten Strauss and had been its provisional head since the beginning of 2020.</p><p>Art, Culture &amp; Sports manages all Deutsche Bank's sponsorship programmes and initiatives worldwide. These activities include its commitment to contemporary art, where the bank sets international standards - with its art collection, its global exhibition programmes and as a partner of respected art fairs such as Frieze in London, New York and Los Angeles. The department is also responsible for the bank's long-term partnership with the Berliner Philharmoniker orchestra and the \"PalaisPopulaire\", whose doors were opened in Berlin as the bank's forum for art, culture &amp; sports in September 2018.</p><p>Anna Herrhausen has been Executive Director Alfred Herrhausen Gesellschaft since 2016. After working for McKinsey as a management consultant and for Allianz in the corporate social responsibility field, she joined Deutsche Bank's Communications &amp; Corporate Social Responsibility team in 2014.</p><p>August 28: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: New CIO Special: The 'G' in ESG: Governance ' a question of balance</p><p>Coronavirus and its economic impact have put a renewed focus on corporate governance - the subject of the latest special report by Deutsche Bank's International Private Bank on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) themes.</p><p>The report argues that:</p><p>Governance is a source of corporate resilience. During the pandemic, good governance has allowed firms not only to maintain basic functions, such as cash flow and fulfilling contractual obligations, but has also helped them to keep their workforce and customers safe. The scope of governance will widen further in future. The socio-economic effects of this crisis, including the growing involvement of governments in many areas, will put new demands on corporate governance. Environmental aspects are also likely to stay prominent. Future governance changes will require a sense of balance. In a constantly changing environment, new approaches will need to evolve to address a range of concerns in a financially sustainable way that balances the needs of individuals, governments, corporates and investors.</p><p>The report provides an overview of governance components and studies their impact on firms' performance. It also includes a brief history of corporate governance and a guest contribution on governance in German family-owned firms.</p><p>August 26: Deutsche Bank acts as joint marketing coordinator for educating investors on the Federal Republic of Germany's inaugural Green Bond</p><p>Germany has just published its Green Bond Framework and is now marketing its inaugural Green German Federal Security Deutsche Bank is acting as joint marketing coordinator to ensure a smooth investor education process The inaugural Green German Federal Security is to be issued within the next few weeks</p><p>Over the last six months Germany has developed its first Green Bond Framework, joining several other countries such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands in the Green Bond market.

Market participants with different investment horizons will have at their disposal a green, transparent investment opportunity with first-class credit quality. For that purpose, a unique issuance approach has been adopted: each new Green German Federal security will always be issued alongside an existing, conventional German Federal security, with exactly the same characteristics, i.e.</p><p>August 26: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Applications open for second Female FinTech Competition</p><p>Deutsche Bank has joined forces with Atos, Google Cloud and TechQuartier to launch the second Female FinTech Competition.</p><p>FinTechs with a female founder or female(s) in the top management groups are invited to enter the competition to pitch their business case.

What if Deutsche Bank had an app that could track clients' carbon footprints and help them save money by challenging their behaviour? And what if this app could also help those clients reinvest those extra savings in a more responsible way?</p><p>This idea became GreenR, a prototype developed as part of the Intrapreneur Initiative. GreenR will allow users to clearly see their personal environmental footprint. It will link directly to your Deutsche Bank accounts and translate your last six months of bank transactions- from where and what you eat, to how you move around - into how much C02 you produce.</p><p>Once a pattern emerges, GreenR will present a set of challenges designed to reduce your C02 footprint by, for example, helping you buy more local products, eat less meat or cycle more. For things you cannot change, like needing to fly, you can offset your carbon footprint by investing in environmental projects.</p><p>GreenR Logo \"Typically you have the option to donate to specific environmental projects to offset your C02 output. This is money you won't see again,\" said Saenz de Alba, a mathematician originally from Mexico. \"Our idea is to instead have a range of investments focused on environmental projects that, for example, help to reduce C02 or to reforest, so you're getting both an economic and an environmental return.</p><p>August 19: Deutsche Bank named Best Corporate Trust Bank in APAC and Best Domestic Custodian in four regional markets</p><p>The Asset Magazine has named Deutsche Bank \"Best Corporate Trust Bank\" in Asia Pacific and \"Best Domestic Custodian\" in four markets at their 2020 Sustainable Investing Institutional Investor, ETF and Asset Servicing Awards.

As a firm that has been recognized ten times or more, the firm also earns designation on Working Mother's Hall of Fame.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The list of Best Law Firms for Working Mothers, which has been published for 13 years, showcases law firms' efforts and successes in finding, retaining, promoting, and developing women lawyers. The 2020 Working Mother Best Law Firms for Women application, administered by the Working Mother Research Institute, included more than 300 questions about attorney demographics at different levels, schedule flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Subra Barry, president of Working Mother Media noted, \"Law firms on this year's list were better prepared to respond to the effects of the pandemic because of their continued support of flextime and remote work for working parents and caregivers. We are proud to recognize their resilience and steadfast commitment to supporting gender equality.\" All the firms on the 2020 list offer reduced hours and remote work for lawyers and this year's research found 39% of female lawyers used remote work in 2019.</p><p>Holland &amp; Hart has long been in the vanguard of supporting the success of women attorneys. An early-adopter of a formalized policy that enables lawyers to work on a reduced time basis, the firm's first female reduced-time attorney took advantage of this opportunity almost 30 years ago. Holland &amp; Hart was also one of the first law firms in its region to adopt a maternity leave policy in the 1980's, providing up to six months of leave (some paid, some unpaid)-practically unheard of at the time.</p><p>Earlier this year, Holland &amp; Hart also received U.S. Gold Standard Certification from the Women in Law Empowerment Forum (WILEF) for the tenth consecutive year, being one of only 12 firms to receive this recognition every year since WILEF began the award in 2011. The firm was also ranked tenth on the 2020 A-List: Female Equity Partner Scorecard by The American Lawyer.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 HOLLAND &amp; HART PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 HOLLAND &amp; HART TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 HOLLAND &amp; HART PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Holland &amp; Hart helps clients with integrated legal solutions.

As a firm that has been recognized ten times or more, the firm also earns designation on Working Mother's Hall of Fame.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The list of Best Law Firms for Working Mothers, which has been published for 13 years, showcases law firms' efforts and successes in finding, retaining, promoting, and developing women lawyers. The 2020 Working Mother Best Law Firms for Women application, administered by the Working Mother Research Institute, included more than 300 questions about attorney demographics at different levels, schedule flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Subra Barry, president of Working Mother Media noted, \"Law firms on this year's list were better prepared to respond to the effects of the pandemic because of their continued support of flextime and remote work for working parents and caregivers. We are proud to recognize their resilience and steadfast commitment to supporting gender equality.\" All the firms on the 2020 list offer reduced hours and remote work for lawyers and this year's research found 39% of female lawyers used remote work in 2019.</p><p>Holland &amp; Hart has long been in the vanguard of supporting the success of women attorneys. An early-adopter of a formalized policy that enables lawyers to work on a reduced time basis, the firm's first female reduced-time attorney took advantage of this opportunity almost 30 years ago. Holland &amp; Hart was also one of the first law firms in its region to adopt a maternity leave policy in the 1980's, providing up to six months of leave (some paid, some unpaid)-practically unheard of at the time.</p><p>Earlier this year, Holland &amp; Hart also received U.S. Gold Standard Certification from the Women in Law Empowerment Forum (WILEF) for the tenth consecutive year, being one of only 12 firms to receive this recognition every year since WILEF began the award in 2011. The firm was also ranked tenth on the 2020 A-List: Female Equity Partner Scorecard by The American Lawyer.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 HOLLAND &amp; HART PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 HOLLAND &amp; HART TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 HOLLAND &amp; HART PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Holland &amp; Hart helps clients with integrated legal solutions.

As a firm that has been recognized ten times or more, the firm also earns designation on Working Mother's Hall of Fame.</p><p>The list of Best Law Firms for Working Mothers, which has been published for 13 years, showcases law firms' efforts and successes in finding, retaining, promoting, and developing women lawyers. The 2020 Working Mother Best Law Firms for Women application, administered by the Working Mother Research Institute, included more than 300 questions about attorney demographics at different levels, schedule flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women.</p><p>Subra Barry, president of Working Mother Media noted, \"Law firms on this year's list were better prepared to respond to the effects of the pandemic because of their continued support of flextime and remote work for working parents and caregivers. We are proud to recognize their resilience and steadfast commitment to supporting gender equality.\" All the firms on the 2020 list offer reduced hours and remote work for lawyers and this year's research found 39% of female lawyers used remote work in 2019.</p><p>Holland &amp; Hart has long been in the vanguard of supporting the success of women attorneys.</p><p>September 04: Holland &amp; Hart: Google could face antitrust charges from Justice Department this month</p><p>An antitrust case against Google is coming as soon as this month.</p><p>Justice Department officials have pressured attorneys working on the case to wrap things up quickly so that an action can be brought against Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -3.64% GOOG, -3.68%, the parent company of Google and YouTube, multiple sources told the New York Times on Thursday. MarketWatch was able to independently confirm the timing of the antitrust action.</p><p>A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the Times report. A company spokesman said Google would \"continue to engage with ongoing investigations\" and that its business practices enabled \"increased choice and competition.\"</p><p>Google shares were flat in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p><p>The reasoning behind a rush to action underscores a belief among some antitrust experts that the Trump administration is seeking punitive measures against Big Tech for its influence over consumers and multiple markets to curry favor with voters. Anger toward the largest tech companies has resonated across political parties, from liberals to conservatives.</p><p>But some questioned the swift timetable, which could ultimately wreak havoc on a stock market driven by tech companies.</p><p>SECTION 4 HOLLAND &amp; HART TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>Sharon Busheff, Director-Human Resources</p><p>Evan W.

To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals.

Altogether, Germany's anti-crisis measures - consisting of extra spending, guarantees and loan/participation programs - sum up to an astronomic value of around EUR 1.9 tr (well above 50% of GDP in 2019). This gives the government huge scope to fight the pandemic and economic crisis.

More than 90 percent of all students were not allowed to attend school, according to the UNESCO World Education Report 2020. And even now, many students still have to study online. These restrictions have impacted equal opportunities and high-quality education, especially for children from financially weaker and disadvantaged backgrounds. This year's International Literacy Day 2020 on September 8 therefore focuses on \"Literacy teaching and learning in the COVID-19 crisis and beyond\", especially on the role of educators and changing pedagogies.</p><p>\"The pandemic further increases inequalities in the education system.

Her first stint in sustainability was in the non-profit sector, where she spent several years managing large programs in areas like global health and microfinance. When she decided to make the leap to the private sector because of her \"firm belief that private capital can make a significant difference in accelerating the shift to a sustainable economy\", she first completed a Finance degree before joining Sustainalytics, an ESG rating agency.</p><p>As global head of green and sustainable bonds, Taneja was responsible for growing the issuer side of the business, new product development and commercializing ESG products for issuers.</p><p>Then Deutsche Bank came calling</p><p>\"I'm quite entrepreneurial, and ESG is a fast-moving market, so the opportunity to grow the bank's Sustainable Finance business further really appealed to me.

As the Green, Social, Sustainable bonds (GSS) market is only about five or six years old, it can be a challenge to find someone with experience working with different types of issuers, whether that's corporates, banks or sovereigns, in different countries and regions.</p><p>\"Our mandate is two-fold: first, we want to act as ESG advisors to the bank's clients, helping position Deutsche Bank as an expert on ESG,\" she explained.</p><p>August 31: Anna Herrhausen appointed Head of Art, Culture &amp; Sports at Deutsche Bank</p><p>Anna Herrhausen Anna Herrhausen, Executive Director Alfred Herrhausen Gesellschaft, takes charge of Deutsche Bank's Art, Culture &amp; Sports department, embedded within the Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility function, with immediate effect.

During the pandemic, good governance has allowed firms not only to maintain basic functions, such as cash flow and fulfilling contractual obligations, but has also helped them to keep their workforce and customers safe. The scope of governance will widen further in future. The socio-economic effects of this crisis, including the growing involvement of governments in many areas, will put new demands on corporate governance. Environmental aspects are also likely to stay prominent. Future governance changes will require a sense of balance. In a constantly changing environment, new approaches will need to evolve to address a range of concerns in a financially sustainable way that balances the needs of individuals, governments, corporates and investors.</p><p>The report provides an overview of governance components and studies their impact on firms' performance.

What if Deutsche Bank had an app that could track clients' carbon footprints and help them save money by challenging their behaviour? And what if this app could also help those clients reinvest those extra savings in a more responsible way?</p><p>This idea became GreenR, a prototype developed as part of the Intrapreneur Initiative. GreenR will allow users to clearly see their personal environmental footprint. It will link directly to your Deutsche Bank accounts and translate your last six months of bank transactions- from where and what you eat, to how you move around - into how much C02 you produce.</p><p>Once a pattern emerges, GreenR will present a set of challenges designed to reduce your C02 footprint by, for example, helping you buy more local products, eat less meat or cycle more. For things you cannot change, like needing to fly, you can offset your carbon footprint by investing in environmental projects.</p><p>GreenR Logo \"Typically you have the option to donate to specific environmental projects to offset your C02 output. This is money you won't see again,\" said Saenz de Alba, a mathematician originally from Mexico. \"Our idea is to instead have a range of investments focused on environmental projects that, for example, help to reduce C02 or to reforest, so you're getting both an economic and an environmental return.</p><p>August 19: Deutsche Bank named Best Corporate Trust Bank in APAC and Best Domestic Custodian in four regional markets</p><p>The Asset Magazine has named Deutsche Bank \"Best Corporate Trust Bank\" in Asia Pacific and \"Best Domestic Custodian\" in four markets at their 2020 Sustainable Investing Institutional Investor, ETF and Asset Servicing Awards.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>SECTION 5 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>SECTION 5 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>SECTION 5 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>SECTION 5 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

It aimed to become more stable, innovative, trustworthy, excellent - and relevant, to its clients, to its investors, and to society as a whole.</p><p>\"Hard work pays off,\" said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer in a note to employees, thanking them for their \"passion and contribution\". \"Our transformation is gaining traction, not just in financial terms but also in tonality and recognition from all of the bank's stakeholders\", he said.</p><p>The bank set clear short-term and mid-term targets and accountabilities for financial and non-financial objectives through to 2022 and has achieved all of its major objectives since then.</p><p>It completed business exits, including cash equities trading and equity derivatives, agreed on the transfer of Global Prime Finance and has been reshaping businesses, including Rates. It has significantly reduced Risk Weighted Assets through the Capital Release Unit; is delivering significant cost reductions on target; and, despite the challenges of the coronavirus crisis, has maintained a strong capital ratio above the threshold.</p><p>Recent landmarks have included launching the International Private Bank; merging the German legal entities; reorganising DWS; integrating the Corporate Bank in Germany; and creating a holistic Chief Risk Office function.</p><p>\"Deutsche Bank is changing for the better,\" said Fabrizio Campelli, Management Board member and Chief Transformation Officer, who made the formal pitch for the award.</p><p>August 18: Deutsche Bank appoints Vietnam Country Chief</p><p>Deutsche Bank today announced the appointment of respected Vietnamese banker, Huynh Buu Quang, as Acting Chief Country Officer (CCO) Vietnam, pending State Bank of Vietnam final approval.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Alexander von zur Muehlen, said: \"With Vietnam a key growth market for our bank in ASEAN, we are delighted to have an individual of Quang's calibre and experience leading the next phase in the expansion of the local franchise.\"</p><p>An experienced CEO, Quang has led significant transformation and growth strategies for both international and local banks. To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

Because it is up to us to provide the funds for the transformation of the global economy through financing and investment products. We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals. All signatories will report on their progress annually.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 25: Deutsche Bank announces changes to the Italian franchise and to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank S.p.A.</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) After a 20-year career with Deutsche Bank, including 12 years of consecutive service as Chief Country Officer Italy and Chief Executive Officer at Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Flavio Valeri has decided to leave Deutsche Bank to pursue new challenges.</p><p>\"Flavio Valeri has been instrumental in developing the bank's Italian business and positioning it for growth in the years ahead,\" said Werner Steinmueller, Chairman of the Deutsche Bank S.p.A.

Altogether, Germany's anti-crisis measures - consisting of extra spending, guarantees and loan/participation programs - sum up to an astronomic value of around EUR 1.9 tr (well above 50% of GDP in 2019). This gives the government huge scope to fight the pandemic and economic crisis.

A consensus seems to be emerging that this is becoming the new normal. Many companies have already offered their employees the option to work from home for several days per week, even post-COVID. An enforceable right for employees to work from home would imply that employers must compensate employees for the additional living space required for home offices. In this paper we analyse the long-term implications of such legislation.

These restrictions have impacted equal opportunities and high-quality education, especially for children from financially weaker and disadvantaged backgrounds. This year's International Literacy Day 2020 on September 8 therefore focuses on \"Literacy teaching and learning in the COVID-19 crisis and beyond\", especially on the role of educators and changing pedagogies.</p><p>\"The pandemic further increases inequalities in the education system.

Her first stint in sustainability was in the non-profit sector, where she spent several years managing large programs in areas like global health and microfinance.

It's an exciting new venture,\" said Taneja, whose experience helping more than 200 issuers with their green and sustainable bonds directly translates to her new role at Deutsche Bank. As the Green, Social, Sustainable bonds (GSS) market is only about five or six years old, it can be a challenge to find someone with experience working with different types of issuers, whether that's corporates, banks or sovereigns, in different countries and regions.</p><p>\"Our mandate is two-fold: first, we want to act as ESG advisors to the bank's clients, helping position Deutsche Bank as an expert on ESG,\" she explained.</p><p>SECTION 4 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>Hubert Harbach, Chief Operating Officer</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-1209202246423787000133053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TN-RWJ1-DXKH-N2NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5711\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

A consensus seems to be emerging that this is becoming the new normal. Many companies have already offered their employees the option to work from home for several days per week, even post-COVID. An enforceable right for employees to work from home would imply that employers must compensate employees for the additional living space required for home offices. In this paper we analyse the long-term implications of such legislation. We find serious side effects, in particular for the real estate market and the labour market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 SUMMARY</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD\">http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD</url></p><p>Industry: Capital Markets</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>September 10: Deutsche Bank wins 'World's Best Bank Transformation' in prestigious Euromoney awards</p><p>Deutsche Bank has won a prestigious Euromoney award for \"World's Best Bank Transformation\" for the progress it has made in the strategic transformation it launched last year to become stronger, more efficient and better positioned for the future.</p><p>\"It's clear that Deutsche Bank has resisted the distractions in market conditions that might have grabbed all its attention in the past,\" the editorial team of the leading industry publication wrote in announcing the award today. \"Its transformation is still a work in progress, but its achievements so far deserve recognition.\"</p><p>Deutsche Bank's \"compete to win\" strategy, announced in July last year, was to refocus on its core strengths, to do so within its own, existing capital resources, and to become sustainably profitable. It aimed to become more stable, innovative, trustworthy, excellent - and relevant, to its clients, to its investors, and to society as a whole.</p><p>\"Hard work pays off,\" said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer in a note to employees, thanking them for their \"passion and contribution\". \"Our transformation is gaining traction, not just in financial terms but also in tonality and recognition from all of the bank's stakeholders\", he said.</p><p>The bank set clear short-term and mid-term targets and accountabilities for financial and non-financial objectives through to 2022 and has achieved all of its major objectives since then.</p><p>It completed business exits, including cash equities trading and equity derivatives, agreed on the transfer of Global Prime Finance and has been reshaping businesses, including Rates. It has significantly reduced Risk Weighted Assets through the Capital Release Unit; is delivering significant cost reductions on target; and, despite the challenges of the coronavirus crisis, has maintained a strong capital ratio above the threshold.</p><p>Recent landmarks have included launching the International Private Bank; merging the German legal entities; reorganising DWS; integrating the Corporate Bank in Germany; and creating a holistic Chief Risk Office function.</p><p>\"Deutsche Bank is changing for the better,\" said Fabrizio Campelli, Management Board member and Chief Transformation Officer, who made the formal pitch for the award.</p><p>August 18: Deutsche Bank appoints Vietnam Country Chief</p><p>Deutsche Bank today announced the appointment of respected Vietnamese banker, Huynh Buu Quang, as Acting Chief Country Officer (CCO) Vietnam, pending State Bank of Vietnam final approval.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Alexander von zur Muehlen, said: \"With Vietnam a key growth market for our bank in ASEAN, we are delighted to have an individual of Quang's calibre and experience leading the next phase in the expansion of the local franchise.\"</p><p>An experienced CEO, Quang has led significant transformation and growth strategies for both international and local banks. To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

By doing so, we pledge to align our credit and investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"Banks play a crucial role in the fight against climate change. Because it is up to us to provide the funds for the transformation of the global economy through financing and investment products. We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals. All signatories will report on their progress annually.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 25: Deutsche Bank announces changes to the Italian franchise and to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank S.p.A.</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) After a 20-year career with Deutsche Bank, including 12 years of consecutive service as Chief Country Officer Italy and Chief Executive Officer at Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Flavio Valeri has decided to leave Deutsche Bank to pursue new challenges.</p><p>\"Flavio Valeri has been instrumental in developing the bank's Italian business and positioning it for growth in the years ahead,\" said Werner Steinmueller, Chairman of the Deutsche Bank S.p.A.

To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals. All signatories will report on their progress annually.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 25: Deutsche Bank announces changes to the Italian franchise and to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank S.p.A.</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) After a 20-year career with Deutsche Bank, including 12 years of consecutive service as Chief Country Officer Italy and Chief Executive Officer at Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Flavio Valeri has decided to leave Deutsche Bank to pursue new challenges.</p><p>\"Flavio Valeri has been instrumental in developing the bank's Italian business and positioning it for growth in the years ahead,\" said Werner Steinmueller, Chairman of the Deutsche Bank S.p.A.

It aimed to become more stable, innovative, trustworthy, excellent - and relevant, to its clients, to its investors, and to society as a whole.</p><p>\"Hard work pays off,\" said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer in a note to employees, thanking them for their \"passion and contribution\". \"Our transformation is gaining traction, not just in financial terms but also in tonality and recognition from all of the bank's stakeholders\", he said.</p><p>The bank set clear short-term and mid-term targets and accountabilities for financial and non-financial objectives through to 2022 and has achieved all of its major objectives since then.</p><p>It completed business exits, including cash equities trading and equity derivatives, agreed on the transfer of Global Prime Finance and has been reshaping businesses, including Rates. It has significantly reduced Risk Weighted Assets through the Capital Release Unit; is delivering significant cost reductions on target; and, despite the challenges of the coronavirus crisis, has maintained a strong capital ratio above the threshold.</p><p>Recent landmarks have included launching the International Private Bank; merging the German legal entities; reorganising DWS; integrating the Corporate Bank in Germany; and creating a holistic Chief Risk Office function.</p><p>\"Deutsche Bank is changing for the better,\" said Fabrizio Campelli, Management Board member and Chief Transformation Officer, who made the formal pitch for the award.</p><p>August 18: Deutsche Bank appoints Vietnam Country Chief</p><p>Deutsche Bank today announced the appointment of respected Vietnamese banker, Huynh Buu Quang, as Acting Chief Country Officer (CCO) Vietnam, pending State Bank of Vietnam final approval.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Alexander von zur Muehlen, said: \"With Vietnam a key growth market for our bank in ASEAN, we are delighted to have an individual of Quang's calibre and experience leading the next phase in the expansion of the local franchise.\"</p><p>An experienced CEO, Quang has led significant transformation and growth strategies for both international and local banks. To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

By doing so, we pledge to align our credit and investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"Banks play a crucial role in the fight against climate change. Because it is up to us to provide the funds for the transformation of the global economy through financing and investment products. We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals. All signatories will report on their progress annually.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 25: Deutsche Bank announces changes to the Italian franchise and to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank S.p.A.</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) After a 20-year career with Deutsche Bank, including 12 years of consecutive service as Chief Country Officer Italy and Chief Executive Officer at Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Flavio Valeri has decided to leave Deutsche Bank to pursue new challenges.</p><p>\"Flavio Valeri has been instrumental in developing the bank's Italian business and positioning it for growth in the years ahead,\" said Werner Steinmueller, Chairman of the Deutsche Bank S.p.A.

To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

By doing so, we pledge to align our credit and investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"Banks play a crucial role in the fight against climate change. Because it is up to us to provide the funds for the transformation of the global economy through financing and investment products. We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals. All signatories will report on their progress annually.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 25: Deutsche Bank announces changes to the Italian franchise and to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank S.p.A.</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) After a 20-year career with Deutsche Bank, including 12 years of consecutive service as Chief Country Officer Italy and Chief Executive Officer at Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Flavio Valeri has decided to leave Deutsche Bank to pursue new challenges.</p><p>\"Flavio Valeri has been instrumental in developing the bank's Italian business and positioning it for growth in the years ahead,\" said Werner Steinmueller, Chairman of the Deutsche Bank S.p.A.

A consensus seems to be emerging that this is becoming the new normal. Many companies have already offered their employees the option to work from home for several days per week, even post-COVID. An enforceable right for employees to work from home would imply that employers must compensate employees for the additional living space required for home offices.

These restrictions have impacted equal opportunities and high-quality education, especially for children from financially weaker and disadvantaged backgrounds.

Her first stint in sustainability was in the non-profit sector, where she spent several years managing large programs in areas like global health and microfinance.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Samsung itself is hosting its third digital product event since early August, with its Unpacked for Every Fan on Wednesday. While most of Apple's employees are based in Northern California, Samsung's R&amp;D centers are spread across the globe, making a virtual event difficult to coordinate.</p><p>\"To protect the health and safety of the developer community, our partners, our employees and local communities, we have made the difficult decision to not hold the Samsung Developer Conference this year,\" Samsung said in a statement. \"We remain committed to keeping our developer community informed of our latest platform updates, and will continue to share important news and useful resources through our developer website and community forums.\"</p><p>The novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 31 million people around the globe, has caused companies to rethink their events. GSMA canceled Mobile World Congress, the world's biggest mobile show, a week before journalists were due to arrive in Barcelona in late February. Instead of holding in-person product launches, Apple, Samsung, Huawei and OnePlus have all held digital events or introduced devices via press release. In late June, Apple hosted a virtual developers conference rather than gathering thousands of app makers in California, while companies like Google and Facebook opted to scrap their developers conferences this year. IFA proceeded with some in-person elements earlier this month, but CES in January will be all digital.

At the time, it was looking for a way to set its Android devices apart from those made by its rivals. It pushed its own Tizen software, urged developers to make apps and features exclusively for Samsung devices, and showed off the breadth of its portfolio, from its wearables to its smart appliances.</p><p>While the early years of SDC were heavily developer-focused, small events -- the biggest news often was SDKs to add features to apps -- the company later used its conference to unveil new products. And it moved its conference from a hotel in San Francisco to a convention center that could accommodate thousands of attendees. At SDC in 2018, Samsung gave the first glimpse of its foldable phone, which would later be sold as the Galaxy Fold. Last year, Samsung teased the Galaxy Z Flip, its second foldable, which resembles a flip phone.</p><p>For many developers, SDC was the only time they could meet with the Korea-based engineers behind Samsung's newest gadgets and software. It also became a place for a wide variety of Samsung executives to make their pitch for using and developing for the company's products.</p><p>Samsung plans to continue sharing information with developers through its website and forums, rather than hosting its formal event.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 MEDIA CONVERGENCE GROUP INC.

To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p>Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month.

Big tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter are already being scrutinized by Democrats and Republicans, as lawmakers on both sides look to rein in their power.

I walk down the row to try prying open each one to look inside. After just a year of use, most of these latrines are either brimming with feces, stripped for parts, locked shut or some combination of the three. People in the neighborhood, noticing our curiosity in their broken toilets, tell us they typically defecate in a nearby trash-strewn dirt field instead.</p><p>\"It's pretty disgusting. Most of the times you see there's no lighting, no ventilation, the toilets get vandalized. There's shit all over, it's clogged,\" Midha, co-founder and CEO of a fledgling smart sanitation startup called Garv Toilets, says about these facilities.</p><p>September 08: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple's next online-only launch will be Sept. 15 with Apple Watch, iPad on tap</p><p>Apple has set the date for its next event. The company's latest devices -- which will likely include the sixth-generation Apple Watch and a new iPad -- will be unveiled on Sept. 15 at 10 a.m. PT. Like Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, the event will be held entirely online amid continued concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Apple's event will be streamed via its website.</p><p>Apple's invite, posted on its website, included a variation on its logo, done in swirling blue lines that turns out to be a bit of AR trickery. When viewed on an iPhone, the Apple invite logo morphs into the event's date: 9.15. The invite sent to reporters included another clue -- the phrase \"Time Flies.\" That hints at the event focusing on the Apple Watch, the tech giant's popular wearable, instead of the first 5G iPhone. CNET Apple Report</p><p>Stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews and advice on iPhones, iPads, Macs, services and software.</p><p>Apple typically holds a flashy product launch in September to show off its newest iPhones.

But it's also spent more than $10 billion buying development studios behind some of the most popular video games in the world. To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p>Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth. In 2019, it bought Double Fine, maker of adventure game Psychonauts. For more like this Subscribe to the CNET Now newsletter for our editors' picks of the most important stories of the day.

Samsung itself is hosting its third digital product event since early August, with its Unpacked for Every Fan on Wednesday. While most of Apple's employees are based in Northern California, Samsung's R&amp;D centers are spread across the globe, making a virtual event difficult to coordinate.</p><p>\"To protect the health and safety of the developer community, our partners, our employees and local communities, we have made the difficult decision to not hold the Samsung Developer Conference this year,\" Samsung said in a statement. \"We remain committed to keeping our developer community informed of our latest platform updates, and will continue to share important news and useful resources through our developer website and community forums.\"</p><p>The novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 31 million people around the globe, has caused companies to rethink their events.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters.

With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, the political conversation has now shifted to the battle over filling her seat on the court. Meanwhile, the tech world will be holding its breath to see whether President Donald Trump can pull out a victory. That's because even if topics like net neutrality and rural broadband aren't hot political issues, a second Trump term could have a huge impact on technology's direction.</p><p>Even though tech policy may not be at the forefront of voters' minds, whoever wins the presidential election will have a lot of influence on what happens in technology over the coming years. This includes everything from setting infrastructure policy on broadband deployment to foreign policy and national security issues involving China as well as what, if any, regulation is imposed on social media giants. Big tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter are already being scrutinized by Democrats and Republicans, as lawmakers on both sides look to rein in their power.

It's a movement waiting to begin. Samsung's winning redesign of its first foldable phone improves on the original Galaxy Fold in nearly every way -- from the new 6.2-inch outer screen to the 7.6-inch inner display -- delivering a device that for the first time draws a full-size foldable phone from the realm of fantasy and grounds it in reality.</p><p>Samsung's original Galaxy Fold was a bold concept with terrible execution. Besieged by problems and pitfalls at nearly every turn, Samsung had to redesign the device after review models broke in multiple ways, causing the brand to lose distribution partners, drop color options and deliver the foldable device four months late.

Behind us is a standing pond of sewage. Over to our left are the narrow alleyways and tight living quarters of the slum, the outer walls of the skinny mud-brick buildings painted in cracked purples, yellows, aquamarines and blues. Stray dogs laze around, and children laugh and run down the corridors. The smell leaches from open sewer lines carved into the walkways made of dusty stone pavers. In one doorway, there's a woman hunched over washing dishes on the floor.</p><p>The toilet stalls, roughly the size of portable toilets, are made of concrete, porcelain and rusted metal. I walk down the row to try prying open each one to look inside. After just a year of use, most of these latrines are either brimming with feces, stripped for parts, locked shut or some combination of the three. People in the neighborhood, noticing our curiosity in their broken toilets, tell us they typically defecate in a nearby trash-strewn dirt field instead.</p><p>\"It's pretty disgusting. Most of the times you see there's no lighting, no ventilation, the toilets get vandalized.

But it's also spent more than $10 billion buying development studios behind some of the most popular video games in the world. To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p>Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth. In 2019, it bought Double Fine, maker of adventure game Psychonauts. For more like this Subscribe to the CNET Now newsletter for our editors' picks of the most important stories of the day.

Samsung itself is hosting its third digital product event since early August, with its Unpacked for Every Fan on Wednesday. While most of Apple's employees are based in Northern California, Samsung's R&amp;D centers are spread across the globe, making a virtual event difficult to coordinate.</p><p>\"To protect the health and safety of the developer community, our partners, our employees and local communities, we have made the difficult decision to not hold the Samsung Developer Conference this year,\" Samsung said in a statement. \"We remain committed to keeping our developer community informed of our latest platform updates, and will continue to share important news and useful resources through our developer website and community forums.\"</p><p>The novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 31 million people around the globe, has caused companies to rethink their events.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday.

Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases.

With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, the political conversation has now shifted to the battle over filling her seat on the court. Meanwhile, the tech world will be holding its breath to see whether President Donald Trump can pull out a victory. That's because even if topics like net neutrality and rural broadband aren't hot political issues, a second Trump term could have a huge impact on technology's direction.</p><p>Even though tech policy may not be at the forefront of voters' minds, whoever wins the presidential election will have a lot of influence on what happens in technology over the coming years. This includes everything from setting infrastructure policy on broadband deployment to foreign policy and national security issues involving China as well as what, if any, regulation is imposed on social media giants. Big tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter are already being scrutinized by Democrats and Republicans, as lawmakers on both sides look to rein in their power.

It's a movement waiting to begin. Samsung's winning redesign of its first foldable phone improves on the original Galaxy Fold in nearly every way -- from the new 6.2-inch outer screen to the 7.6-inch inner display -- delivering a device that for the first time draws a full-size foldable phone from the realm of fantasy and grounds it in reality.</p><p>Samsung's original Galaxy Fold was a bold concept with terrible execution. Besieged by problems and pitfalls at nearly every turn, Samsung had to redesign the device after review models broke in multiple ways, causing the brand to lose distribution partners, drop color options and deliver the foldable device four months late.

Behind us is a standing pond of sewage. Over to our left are the narrow alleyways and tight living quarters of the slum, the outer walls of the skinny mud-brick buildings painted in cracked purples, yellows, aquamarines and blues. Stray dogs laze around, and children laugh and run down the corridors. The smell leaches from open sewer lines carved into the walkways made of dusty stone pavers. In one doorway, there's a woman hunched over washing dishes on the floor.</p><p>The toilet stalls, roughly the size of portable toilets, are made of concrete, porcelain and rusted metal. I walk down the row to try prying open each one to look inside. After just a year of use, most of these latrines are either brimming with feces, stripped for parts, locked shut or some combination of the three. People in the neighborhood, noticing our curiosity in their broken toilets, tell us they typically defecate in a nearby trash-strewn dirt field instead.</p><p>\"It's pretty disgusting.

But it's also spent more than $10 billion buying development studios behind some of the most popular video games in the world. To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth. In 2019, it bought Double Fine, maker of adventure game Psychonauts. For more like this Subscribe to the CNET Now newsletter for our editors' picks of the most important stories of the day.

Samsung itself is hosting its third digital product event since early August, with its Unpacked for Every Fan on Wednesday. While most of Apple's employees are based in Northern California, Samsung's R&amp;D centers are spread across the globe, making a virtual event difficult to coordinate.</p><p>\"To protect the health and safety of the developer community, our partners, our employees and local communities, we have made the difficult decision to not hold the Samsung Developer Conference this year,\" Samsung said in a statement. \"We remain committed to keeping our developer community informed of our latest platform updates, and will continue to share important news and useful resources through our developer website and community forums.\"</p><p>The novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 31 million people around the globe, has caused companies to rethink their events.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday.

The launch, which was broadcast live, was deemed a success after about 20 minutes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: Media Convergence Group Inc: EU targets Apple Pay, App Store with antitrust investigations</p><p>Within the course of a single day, Apple has found itself the subject of two new EU antitrust probes. Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases.

She often lays awake at night trying to go to sleep, replaying videos that she has seen in her mind,\" says the lawsuit, which was filed in a California superior court on Monday. The former moderator also can't be in crowded places because she's afraid of mass shootings, suffers from panic attacks and has lost friends because of her anxiety. She also has trouble being around kids and is now frightened to have children, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Media Convergence Group Inc: What a Trump reelection would mean for the tech world</p><p>The global coronavirus pandemic, which has resulted in the deaths of nearly 200,000 Americans, has largely dominated the political debate. With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, the political conversation has now shifted to the battle over filling her seat on the court. Meanwhile, the tech world will be holding its breath to see whether President Donald Trump can pull out a victory. That's because even if topics like net neutrality and rural broadband aren't hot political issues, a second Trump term could have a huge impact on technology's direction.</p><p>Even though tech policy may not be at the forefront of voters' minds, whoever wins the presidential election will have a lot of influence on what happens in technology over the coming years. This includes everything from setting infrastructure policy on broadband deployment to foreign policy and national security issues involving China as well as what, if any, regulation is imposed on social media giants. Big tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter are already being scrutinized by Democrats and Republicans, as lawmakers on both sides look to rein in their power.

The issue appears to be related to a bug discovered in July, when Facebook said the app didn't actually use the camera, even though Apple's iOS 14 software indicated it did.</p><p>\"Instagram is constantly accessing users' smartphone camera feature while the app is open and monitors users without permission,\" says the suit, filed in US District Court in San Francisco by New JerseyInstagram user Brittany Conditi.

It's a movement waiting to begin. Samsung's winning redesign of its first foldable phone improves on the original Galaxy Fold in nearly every way -- from the new 6.2-inch outer screen to the 7.6-inch inner display -- delivering a device that for the first time draws a full-size foldable phone from the realm of fantasy and grounds it in reality.</p><p>Samsung's original Galaxy Fold was a bold concept with terrible execution. Besieged by problems and pitfalls at nearly every turn, Samsung had to redesign the device after review models broke in multiple ways, causing the brand to lose distribution partners, drop color options and deliver the foldable device four months late.

CNET Section Editor Juan Garzon's review unit has a bubbled interior screen, which would clearly fall under Samsung's warranty if a purchased product arrived damaged. The review unit I've been using hasn't experienced any issues.</p><p>September 16: Media Convergence Group Inc: Facebook wants to put smart glasses on your face next year</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday the social network plans to release its first pair of smart glasses next year.</p><p>The company has partnered with EssilorLuxottica, which owns eyewear brands including Ray-Ban, to support different designs and styles for the upcoming glasses.

You're now able to preorder the new console \"at select retailers\" for $500 (Pound450, AU$750) for the Blu-ray equipped version or $400 (Pound360, AU$600) for the digital-only PS5. Both consoles will ship on Nov. 12 in the US, with online preorders at some major retailers including Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop and Target starting (and selling out quickly) on Wednesday.</p><p>The reveal finally gives a firm price and release date for Sony's next PlayStation beyond the vague \"holiday 2020\" timeframe the company previously used when describing its forthcoming system. Sony initially said preorders would begin Thursday before retailers decided to go early. See at Sony See at Amazon</p><p>After trailing Microsoft and its upcoming PS5-rival Xbox Series X and Series S in the news department, with Wednesday's announcement Sony is finally setting the bar for what to expect when it comes to pricing its next generation of game consoles. The Series X and Series S will arrive on Nov. 10 for $499 (Pound449, AU$749) and $299 (Pound249, AU$499) respectively, or $35 per month and $25 per month on a payment plan. While Sony's said the disc-less PS5 will have the same chips and performance of its Blu-ray-equipped cousin, Microsoft's Xbox Series S is designed as a less powerful sibling of the Series X.</p><p>In addition to the console price and release date, Sony also detailed pricing for accessories, including $70 for a standalone DualSense wireless controller and $100 for its Pulse 3D wireless headset.</p><p>September 09: Media Convergence Group Inc: iPhone 12 finally gives us a reason to get excited about 5G</p><p>Sorry to Samsung, Verizon, T-Mobile and everyone else in the mobile industry trying to make 5G a thing. The next-generation wireless technology still needs a cheerleader who can break through to the mainstream. Fortunately, Apple is right around the corner with the iPhone 12, which won't be launching at Apple's just-announced Sept. 15 event (it'll likely come later).</p><p>If this were any other year, 5G would already be a much bigger deal. After a mixed start in 2019, 5G coverage has improved, the number of devices -- including last month's Galaxy Note 20 -- has grown, and pesky network compatibility issues have largely been resolved. Apple's next flagship iPhone, widely expected to support 5G, would serve as the capper to a year of 5G excitement.

The coronavirus pandemic has kept millions in their homes, which negates the need for high-speed wireless access on the go. Millions of jobs lost and an uncertain economy mean premium-priced 5G devices are more out of reach than they should be.</p><p>Enter Apple and its uncanny ability to whip consumers into a frenzy over the latest technology that competitors have already embraced (think wireless charging in the iPhone 8).</p><p>September 09: Media Convergence Group Inc: Media Convergence Group Inc: </p><p>JoAnn Morgan was just 17 years old when she worked on her first rocket launch.</p><p>It was the spring of 1958, and Morgan had just graduated high school in Florida, just a few miles from the Space Coast. Keen to find a summer internship, Morgan saw an advertisement from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency looking for students to work in the missile firing lab.</p><p>NASA wouldn't officially open its doors until October that year (in accordance with a presidential order signed by Dwight Eisenhower), but the Soviet Union had just launched Sputnik 1 and the United States was playing catch-up. The Army was testing rocket systems to launch its first satellite, and it was short on labor.

Behind us is a standing pond of sewage. Over to our left are the narrow alleyways and tight living quarters of the slum, the outer walls of the skinny mud-brick buildings painted in cracked purples, yellows, aquamarines and blues. Stray dogs laze around, and children laugh and run down the corridors. The smell leaches from open sewer lines carved into the walkways made of dusty stone pavers. In one doorway, there's a woman hunched over washing dishes on the floor.</p><p>The toilet stalls, roughly the size of portable toilets, are made of concrete, porcelain and rusted metal. I walk down the row to try prying open each one to look inside. After just a year of use, most of these latrines are either brimming with feces, stripped for parts, locked shut or some combination of the three. People in the neighborhood, noticing our curiosity in their broken toilets, tell us they typically defecate in a nearby trash-strewn dirt field instead.</p><p>\"It's pretty disgusting. Most of the times you see there's no lighting, no ventilation, the toilets get vandalized. There's shit all over, it's clogged,\" Midha, co-founder and CEO of a fledgling smart sanitation startup called Garv Toilets, says about these facilities.</p><p>September 08: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple's next online-only launch will be Sept. 15 with Apple Watch, iPad on tap</p><p>Apple has set the date for its next event. The company's latest devices -- which will likely include the sixth-generation Apple Watch and a new iPad -- will be unveiled on Sept. 15 at 10 a.m. PT. Like Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, the event will be held entirely online amid continued concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Apple's event will be streamed via its website.</p><p>Apple's invite, posted on its website, included a variation on its logo, done in swirling blue lines that turns out to be a bit of AR trickery. When viewed on an iPhone, the Apple invite logo morphs into the event's date: 9.15. The invite sent to reporters included another clue -- the phrase \"Time Flies.\" That hints at the event focusing on the Apple Watch, the tech giant's popular wearable, instead of the first 5G iPhone. CNET Apple Report</p><p>Stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews and advice on iPhones, iPads, Macs, services and software.</p><p>Apple typically holds a flashy product launch in September to show off its newest iPhones.

With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, the political conversation has now shifted to the battle over filling her seat on the court. Meanwhile, the tech world will be holding its breath to see whether President Donald Trump can pull out a victory. That's because even if topics like net neutrality and rural broadband aren't hot political issues, a second Trump term could have a huge impact on technology's direction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even though tech policy may not be at the forefront of voters' minds, whoever wins the presidential election will have a lot of influence on what happens in technology over the coming years. This includes everything from setting infrastructure policy on broadband deployment to foreign policy and national security issues involving China as well as what, if any, regulation is imposed on social media giants. Big tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter are already being scrutinized by Democrats and Republicans, as lawmakers on both sides look to rein in their power.

That will be a big issue for either Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee.</p><p>So far, Biden has remained relatively quiet on tech, although many experts expect he will revert back to many Obama-era policies. (You can read about Biden's views on tech here).</p><p>President Trump, on the other hand, has a more defined track record as the incumbent.</p><p>Here's a closer look at what we know about Trump's positions on Big Tech regulation, the digital divide, the push toward 5G wireless and clashes with China. Deregulation</p><p>The hallmark of the Trump presidency when it comes to policy has been the quick pace with which he's deregulated many industries, including the tech sector.</p><p>The biggest example was the rollback of Obama-era net neutrality rules. Within the first month of Trump taking office, the Federal Communications Commission repealed a net neutrality decision approved under President Barack Obama. These rules were meant to preserve an open internet and prevent broadband companies from limiting access to content or charging companies extra to deliver traffic to consumers. The rules also gave the FCC more authority to police the internet and treat it more like a public utility.</p><p>In October last year, when a federal appeals court upheld the FCC's reversal of the rules, Trump congratulated the FCC on Twitter and called it a big win for the future of the internet, including 5G wireless.</p><p>Within months of taking office, Trump's FCC rolled back several Obama-era protections, including broadband privacy rules and subsidies for some broadband and wireless providers as part of the federal Lifeline program. Section 230 and social media</p><p>A big exception to the current administration's deregulatory agenda is Trump's executive order that points toward greater regulation of social media companies. That order, signed in May, asks for a reinterpretation of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives online platforms, like Facebook, legal immunity for content posted by third-party users. The statute also gives these companies legal cover to make good-faith efforts to moderate their platforms.</p><p>Trump has long argued that social media giants are biased against conservatives. The executive order is directly targeted at Twitter and Facebook, which have labeled some Trump statements as false, misleading or in violation of company guidelines. Specifically, Trump is asking the FCC to use its regulatory authority to \"limit legal protections for social media platforms if they don't adhere to standards of neutrality.\" But it's unclear how those \"neutrality\" standards would be defined or enforced. The FCC is considering public comment on a proposal introduced by the Commerce Department.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 MEDIA CONVERGENCE GROUP INC.

It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month.

Behind us is a standing pond of sewage. Over to our left are the narrow alleyways and tight living quarters of the slum, the outer walls of the skinny mud-brick buildings painted in cracked purples, yellows, aquamarines and blues. Stray dogs laze around, and children laugh and run down the corridors. The smell leaches from open sewer lines carved into the walkways made of dusty stone pavers.

The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine. Although the employees were later released without charges, the arrests further attest to tension between the private and public sectors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

But it's also spent more than $10 billion buying development studios behind some of the most popular video games in the world. To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p>Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month.

The 2020 show, which was scheduled for late February, was one of the first major tech events to be canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. But while MWC 2020 didn't take place at all, the expectation now is that MWC 2021 will -- albeit with a delay.</p><p>With COVID-19 still circulating around the world, the show's organizers have decided to play it safe and schedule the show for next June instead of its usual February dates. In an announcement on Tuesday, the GSMA said the show would take place between June 28 and July. 1. A smaller, China-based event, MWC Shanghai, has been moved to take place in February.

It's a movement waiting to begin. Samsung's winning redesign of its first foldable phone improves on the original Galaxy Fold in nearly every way -- from the new 6.2-inch outer screen to the 7.6-inch inner display -- delivering a device that for the first time draws a full-size foldable phone from the realm of fantasy and grounds it in reality.</p><p>Samsung's original Galaxy Fold was a bold concept with terrible execution. Besieged by problems and pitfalls at nearly every turn, Samsung had to redesign the device after review models broke in multiple ways, causing the brand to lose distribution partners, drop color options and deliver the foldable device four months late.

To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it's all about the future of software.</p><p>Though not known as a gamer himself, Nadella's made big bets on the video game industry, buying Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion shortly after he was named CEO in 2014. Then he bought five more studios in 2018, including role-playing game maker Obsidian, known for the space adventure The Outer Worlds and the well-received South Park: The Stick of Truth.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters.

In the revealing documentary Oliver Sacks: His Own Life, streaming this week, he gets inside his own head, sharing the personal struggles that shaped him into a fearless student of the human experience.</p><p>The British doctor, whose memoir Awakenings inspired a 1990 movie of the same name starring Robin Williams, speaks with remarkable candor of the childhood fear that he might suffer severe mental illness like his older brother. He talks about shyness, self-doubt, insecurity and an amphetamine addiction that kept him awake for 36 hours at a time as a young physician.

With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, the political conversation has now shifted to the battle over filling her seat on the court.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>September 22: Business Monitor International Inc.: Saudi Arabia's Medical Device Exports To Remain Volatile While Imports Supported By Covid-19</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile due to limited domestic production. The country relies on imports and has limited local manufacturing, resulting in a trade deficit of -USD1.1bn in 2019, though this was down from the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic will disrupt efforts to reduce its trade deficit, but it will support imports of medical devices to Saudi Arabia in FY2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's medical device exports will remain volatile and underperform in the coming years. Exports totalled SAR53.6mn (USD14.3mn) in 2019, representing a y-o-y decrease of 63% from 2018 mainly due to the reliance on imports and the markets limited local manufacturing. The scope of manufacturing in Saudi Arabia consists of consumables, including bandages, gloves and syringes, but the Saudi Arabian governments National Transformation Program (NTP) aims to diversify this by supporting local manufacturing through foreign investments in the healthcare sector. Exports will also suffer in FY2020 due to protectionism with the country likely seeking to restrict the export of medical products it sees as critical in containing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 21: Business Monitor International Inc.: Diesel: Recovery Underway But Headwinds Aplenty</p><p>Global diesel prices have strengthened somewhat from their Q2 lows but the nascent recovery still has further to go.

While the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations in July, airlines and airports are not required to follow them and practices can vary widely across the industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Americans are already wary about traveling during a global pandemic and deserve to know that strict COVID-19 safety precautions will be followed if they choose to fly,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"We need mandatory, enforceable health and safety rules so that every airline, airport and passenger can be held accountable to help stop the spread of this potentially deadly virus. Mandatory standards will ultimately help the airlines recover from the current crisis by giving Americans more confidence that they will be safe when flying.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, Consumer Reports noted that Americans encounter a confusing patchwork of conflicting health and safety policies at hundreds of U.S. airports and every airline. Travelers cannot be sure, when they make a reservation, what the airline's policies on healthy travel will be on the date when their flight takes off.</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, other carriers are booking passengers on every seat on their planes. CR has heard from travelers concerned about overcrowded flights and that mask requirements are not being enforced consistently.</p><p>CR urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials to establish requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel.

The report, \"Platform Perceptions: Consumer Attitudes on Competition and Fairness in Online Platforms,\" was issued by the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. Here's a look at the findings:</p><p>A majority of consumers-about 6 out of 10-support more government regulation of platforms (60%) and mandating interoperability features (61%) to deal with the growing power of large online platforms that may be hurting competition and consumers.</p><p>79% of Americans say Big Tech mergers and acquisitions unfairly undermine competition and consumer choice.</p><p>65% say platforms should be held accountable for the products and services sold on their platforms.</p><p>74% believe companies should be required to take more responsibility for evaluating information before it's shared on their platforms.</p><p>46% have difficulty distinguishing between what is a paid ad and objective search result, and 58% are not confident that they are getting objective and unbiased search results when using an online platform to shop or search for information;</p><p>85% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned about the amount of data online platforms store about them.</p><p>81% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned that platforms are collecting and holding this data about consumers in order to build out more comprehensive consumer profiles.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 30: Consumers Reports investigation finds that the College Board is sharing students personal information with tech companies</p><p>Consumer Reports released findings from an investigation into the privacy practices of the College Board and found that the organization appears to be in violation of its own policies.</p><p>Researchers at CR's Digital Lab found that the College Board is sending personally identifiable student information to major technology companies and ad platforms including Adobe, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat, and Yahoo.</p><p>\"College-bound students don't have any choice but to transact with the College Board-which is what makes these findings so concerning,\" said Ben Moskowitz, Director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. \"Because of its mission and its importance in the college admissions process, it is critical that the organization meet a high privacy standard, communicate clearly with its users, and limit the user data it shares with third parties for advertising purposes.\"</p><p>The College Board is a non-profit company that owns and operates the SAT test. The organization also administers the Advanced Placement exam, which high school students can take to earn college credit and strengthen applications. In some states, the SAT is even required for high school graduation. For millions of students, the College Board is an unavoidable gatekeeper on the path to higher education.</p><p>After contacting the College Board with our findings, the organization made some updates to its site, but the underlying problem as found in the investigation remains.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 13: Consumer Reports launches petition calling for mandatory COVID-19 health and safety standards for airlines and airports</p><p>Consumer Reports is calling on Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to issue mandatory, enforceable health and safety standards for airlines and airports to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. CR launched a petition urging Secretary Chao to take more aggressive action to protect passengers one week after the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations without requiring airlines and airports to comply with them.</p><p>\"Americans shouldn't have to figure out on their own whether it's safe to fly during a global pandemic,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"Secretary Chao is essentially making passengers gamble with their health by failing to require airlines and airports to abide by mandatory safety protocols. We need enforceable rules to protect travelers, especially now that some airlines are ignoring social distancing recommendations and packing flights with passengers.\"</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, American, Spirit, and United airlines say they will book passengers on every seat on their planes. Some airlines and airports are enforcing mask requirements, while others are not. And some airports are doing health screenings without any clear rule on how that information will be acted on, raising both medical and privacy concerns.</p><p>In June, Consumer Reports urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials and take an active role in establishing requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Secretary Chao has the authority to make COVID-19 safety protocols mandatory using the same authority used by the DOT in the past to require airlines to adopt stronger security measures following the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p><p>May 13: CR, U.S. PIRG and activist deliver nearly 250,000 petition signatures to airlines calling for full refunds for canceled flights</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and a consumer-turned-activist delivered nearly 250,000 petition signatures today to the airlines calling on them to provide full refunds when passengers cancel their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus. The petition delivery came on the same day that Senator Edward Markey (MA) introduced legislation in Congress endorsed by the groups that would make refunds mandatory in such cases.</p><p>Despite receiving a $50 billion taxpayer-funded bailout as part of the CARES Act, the majority of airlines are only offering vouchers instead of refunds to passengers who canceled their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, even though passengers are legally entitled to a full refund if the airline cancels their flight, some carriers are offering vouchers as the default option. This forces passengers to take extra steps to get the cash refund they deserve.</p><p>\"It's simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who cannot travel safely or to those who are facing financial hardship and need the cash,\" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports. \"The airlines are, in effect, forcing millions of Americans to provide an interest-free loan after these companies have already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, the groups noted that they have heard from thousands of people from all over the country who are frustrated that they can't get a refund for their canceled flight. These stories include customers who canceled flights because of stay-at-home orders, senior citizens and other at-risk customers worried about their safety, and the newly unemployed who need the money to pay their bills. Others have expressed concerns that the vouchers will expire before it is safe to travel again.</p><p>\"The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well.</p><p>May 01: Consumer Reports Applauds ICANN's Decision to Reject.ORG Sale to Private Equity Firm</p><p>ICANN announced last night that it would reject a plan to sell the.ORG domain registry. The sale would have transferred control of the Public Interest Registry from the Internet Society to Ethos Capital, a private equity firm. This is a major victory for the nonprofit community and the public interest.</p><p>\"ICANN's rejection of the sale of.ORG to Ethos Capital is a win for nonprofits around the world. The sale would have resulted in one company deciding who gets the domain and how much they would have to pay for it. We applaud ICANN, and we thank California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and all of the organizations that came together to push back against this sale. Although the process for securing a steward for the.org domain is not yet over, we hope that the search is transparent, competitive, and in the interest of the public. This news is especially welcome at a time when nonprofits are focused on meeting their communities' needs during the coronavirus pandemic.\" Katie McInnis, Policy Counsel for Consumer Reports.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 31: Zoom Makes Improvements to Privacy Policy after Consumer Reports Investigation</p><p>Yonkers, NY -Consumer Reports recently uncovered a range of privacy concerns with Zoom, a videoconferencing service that has gained in popularity as consumers, businesses, and schools have come to rely on the platform during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Researchers at CR's Digital Lab found that Zoom, like many digital platforms, outlines in its privacy policy that it collects personal information about its users, but failed to disclose details about how that information is used for advertising, marketing, or other business purposes. Such information, known as \"Customer Content\" could include cloud video recordings and information that was shared during the recordings such as instant messages, files, and whiteboards.</p><p>After these findings by CR, Zoom made significant changes to its privacy policies, which was announced in a blog post and detailed in a new CR article. The updated policy now states that so-called \"Customer Content\" is not allowed for advertising purposes, that video is only retained at the user's request, and that it's not accessed by Zoom. The new policy also provides more insight into the type of consumer data Zoom collects, such as phone numbers and user names.</p><p>While CR is pleased to see the quick response by Zoom, there is still work to be done. For example, Zoom should make a clear differentiation between hosts and participants, and require participants to click on a consent button before a recording can begin.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 02: Consumer Reports: Consumer Reports responds to EPA Science Advisory Board final report about fuel economy rollback plan</p><p>The science advisory board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a final report about the proposed EPA &amp; DOT plan to rollback vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, known as the 'SAFE' Rule.</p><p>In response to the report, David Friedman, Vice President of Advocacy at Consumer Reports, provides the following statement:</p><p>\"The EPA's own scientific advisors confirm many of CR's criticisms of the proposed rule. They even acknowledge that the original, \"2012 rule might provide a better outcome for society than the proposed revision.\" Our analysis shows that it is more than a possibility. Strong fuel economy standards save consumers money, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. So, whether it is a full or partial rollback, the administration should ditch its current plans so consumers won't be stuck spending billions more than they should just to go about their daily lives.\"</p><p>You can learn more about how costly the proposed rollback would be for consumers at CR.org/unsaferule.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 28: Consumer Reports: DOJ/FTC proposed update to Vertical Merger Guidelines needs more work, more relevance to today's marketplace</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports has filed comments with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in response to a proposal to update their Enforcement Guidelines for assessing vertical mergers under the antitrust laws. These are mergers that combine two companies that operate at different levels in a supply and marketing chain, and therefore do, or could, do business with each other. The updated Vertical Merger Guidelines would replace guidelines published in 1984, before the arrival of the internet and its dramatic transformation of the marketplace. The 1984 guidelines are largely ignored in actual enforcement decision making, but they remain on the books.</p><p>CR welcomes the plan to update the guidelines as long overdue, but says the current draft needs more work.</p><p>\"To be useful, updated guidelines need to be relevant, and they need to be clear,\" says George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"They need to speak to the challenges to competition we are facing in today's online marketplace, and they need to be understandable to the wider public, not just antitrust economists and lawyers. Curiously, the descriptive examples used in the current draft could have been written for the marketplace as it existed decades ago, or even for the marketplace Adam Smith wrote about 250 years ago. There is not a single reference to today's online marketplace, where a handful of giant platforms are increasingly able to control the choices that can reach consumers.</p><p>\"Age-old competition concerns are being magnified and transformed by an entirely new dimension of high-tech market power, fueled by massive troves of data and awesome technological capabilities to gather, sort, and manipulate it, reaching into all corners of our commercial and personal interactions and preferences.</p><p>February 25: Consumer Reports calls for major safety improvements across the industry after NTSB makes new findings in Tesla investigation</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In light of new findings by the National Transportation Safety Board related to Tesla Autopilot, Consumer Reports today called for manufacturers to include key safety features in any vehicle that has an active driving assistance system - a type of emerging technology that helps human drivers accelerate, brake, and steer but also requires them to be responsible for the driving at any moment - and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that is the case.</p><p>Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for cars and product safety at Consumer Reports, said, \"This shouldn't be considered optional. Manufacturers and NHTSA must make sure that these driver-assist systems come with critical safety features that actually verify drivers are monitoring the road and ready to take action at all times. Otherwise, the safety risks of these systems could end up outweighing their benefits.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear, and continuing to pile up, that if a car makes it easier for people to take their attention off the road, they're going to do so-with potentially deadly consequences. So far, federal safety regulators have done little to reduce these risks, and the NTSB makes clear that NHTSA's hands-off approach is far too weak. It's time for NHTSA to go beyond mere words and take some real, forceful action to keep people safe.\"</p><p>CR's call comes as the NTSB today released a preliminary report on the fatal March 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged. The NTSB attributed the crash to several factors, including Autopilot's limitations and \"cell phone distraction.\" The investigative board also reiterated that regulators and manufacturers alike have ignored the NTSB's previous recommendations for system safeguards, and called for an overhaul of how manufacturers design their active driving assistance systems to ensure a human driver stays engaged and ready to take action.</p><p>February 25: Consumers Union: Investigation finds Allstate's secret algorithm resulted in \"suckers list\" of drivers deemed unlikely to shop for better deals</p><p>A joint investigation by Consumer Reports and The Markup sheds light on how a controversial plan pushed by Allstate in Maryland could be functioning in other states that have allowed the company's customer \"retention model.\" The groups found that Allstate would have saddled Maryland customers paying the most expensive premiums with big increases that it wasn't willing to pass on to thriftier customers with similar risk profiles.</p><p>Maryland and a few other states have rejected these efforts, but ten other states have allowed Allstate to use a customer retention model. The groups based their joint investigation on a statistical analysis of the documents Allstate submitted on its plan in Maryland. It offers a rare public window revealing details of Allstate's pricing plan that have otherwise been kept secret.</p><p>\"Despite the purported complexity of Allstate's price adjustment algorithm, it was actually simple: It resulted in a suckers list of Maryland customers who were big spenders and would squeeze more money out of them than others,\" according to the report by Maddy Varner and Aaron Sankin of The Markup, the data-driven journalism organization launching today focused on the impact of technology on society.</p><p>\"These revelations are concerning enough on their own, but they're also an unmistakable harbinger of the new age of consumer threats we're racing headlong into,\" said Marta L. Tellado, President &amp; CEO of Consumer Reports. \"Like security flaws in our gadgets and invisible toxins in our food, hidden biases in the algorithms that set more and more of the prices we pay pose an insidious threat.\"</p><p>Seven years ago, when Allstate filed this plan with Maryland, the company said that its new risk analysis showed that it was charging nearly all of its customers outdated premiums. Rather than apply the new rates all at once, Allstate asked the Maryland Insurance Administration for permission to run each policy through an advanced algorithm containing dozens of variables that would adjust it in the general direction of the new customer \"retention\" model.</p><p>But The Markup and Consumer Reports found that customers who were due a big rate hike may or may not get it based on whether Allstate thought they were likely to shop around:</p><p>It appears that Allstate assumed drivers with a cheap policy would shop around for a better deal, while those with an expensive policy would not.</p><p>February 11: Consumers Union: Court Rules Against State Antitrust Challenge to T-MobileSprint Merger</p><p>A federal district court ruled today against the antitrust action by 13 states and the District of Columbia to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.</p><p>Consumer Reports said the merger will combine two giant nationwide wireless phone service carriers into one, leaving consumers with only three giant carriers to choose from and reducing the incentives of the three remaining carriers to compete by offering more affordable, higher quality, and more innovative service.</p><p>Consumer Reports has been raising strong concerns that the merger would harm competition, and harm consumers and others in the wireless marketplace who depend on that competition</p><p>\"We commend the states for their perseverance and determination in challenging this anti-consumer combination,\" said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"From the moment this merger was announced, it was clear that it went against what is needed to give consumers the benefits of competition. This merger should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom. Unfortunately, despite all the states' efforts, and the strong case they presented, the court could not be convinced.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a similar merger in the past, when AT&amp;T sought to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. However, DOJ gave T-Mobile and Sprint a green light, based on a side deal it helped engineer to set up satellite TV company DISH to become a new fourth nationwide mobile phone carrier to replace the loss of Sprint.</p><p>Slover said DISH is an unproven newcomer, with no mobile phone network, and no experience providing mobile phone service. It will have to build both essentially from scratch, he said.</p><p>\"Sprint is an established carrier, with a track record of determination and success in spurring competition that benefits consumers,\" said Slover.</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 23: Lack of key considerations in FDA food chemical safety process leaves consumers at risk of chronic diseases</p><p>(Washington, D.C. - September 23, 2020) Today, a group of health, environmental, and consumer organizations challenged the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) practice of not accounting for the cumulative health effect of chemicals in the diet when allowing new chemicals in food. Over 60 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring that FDA and industry do just that. Unfortunately, an Environmental Defense Fund investigation of nearly 900 safety determinations found that only one considered the requirement in a meaningful way.</p><p>In reviewing the correspondence between FDA and manufacturers, EDF found no evidence the agency raises concerns with this major shortcoming. The analysis also demonstrates that, when evaluating the safety of new additives, FDA and food manufacturers all too often consider one chemical at a time rather than as a class of related substances.</p><p>\"The collective failure by FDA and the food industry to follow the law may well have contributed to the dramatic increases we have seen in chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease in the US in recent decades,\" said Tom Neltner, Chemicals Policy Director for Environmental Defense Fund. \"Every time we eat highly processed food, we are exposed to chemical additives, and - for the chemicals that cause similar toxic effects - that combined exposure can increase the harm to our health.</p><p>September 17: Consumers Union: Consumer Reports applauds California's settlement against Glow for privacy violations that risked exposing women's sensitive health data</p><p>Consumer Reports today praised the state of California following the announcement of a settlement with Glow, a technology company that operates a mobile fertility application.</p><p>In 2016 Consumer Reports found that the Glow app exposed women to privacy threats. The company responded by fixing the app.</p><p>The state's complaint says from 2013 to 2016 \"the Glow app had serious basic security failures that put its users' data at risk.\"</p><p>The $250,000 settlement also will require Glow to comply with state consumer protection and privacy laws, and what the state called \"a first-ever injunctive term that requires Glow to consider how privacy or security lapses may uniquely impact women.\"</p><p>Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumer Reports noted, \"Tech companies, especially those with a health focus, have access to incredibly sensitive information about consumers and too often fail to take the most rudimentary of protections. Especially with California's new privacy law in effect, the Attorney General's office is at the front line of protecting our privacy and security. Rules are meaningless without robust enforcement, so this action is a promising sign.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 16: Consumers Union: Keep Antibiotics Working coalition urges FDA to strengthen plan for protecting critical medications in veterinary settings</p><p>Letter from Consumer Reports and other members of the Keep Antibiotics Working coalition calling on the FDA to to protect the effectiveness of critical medications by strengthening its Five-Year Action Plan for Supporting Antimicrobial Stewardship in Veterinary Settings</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 16: Consumers Union: Keep Antibiotics Working coalition letter to USDA urging it to research animal rearing practices that can help reduce the use of antibiotics</p><p>Letter from Consumer Reports and other members of the Keep Antibiotics Working coalition calling on the USDA to broaden its research on animal rearing practices that can improve animal health and reduce the use of antibiotics.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 03: Consumer Reports urges OCC to rescind proposal that would encourage \"rent-a-bank\" lending schemes</p><p>A proposal by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) would make it easier for predatory lenders to evade state laws limiting interest rates by partnering with national banks, according to Consumer Reports. In a letter submitted to the OCC today, CR called on the federal regulator to protect consumers from high-cost loans by rescinding the proposal.</p><p>\"With so many Americans out of work and struggling to pay their bills, the last thing the OCC should be doing is making it easier for shady lenders to charge exorbitant interest rates,\" said Antonio Carrejo, policy counsel for Consumer Reports. \"Unfortunately, the OCC's proposal would enable predatory lenders to 'rent-a-bank' that isn't subject to state consumer protection laws and get away with peddling high-priced loans that trap borrowers in debt.\"</p><p>Rent-a-bank lending schemes typically involve partnerships between a national bank and a non-bank lender marketing payday loans, auto title loans, or auto installment loans. The bank originates the loan and the high-cost lender manages all other aspects of the transaction, including marketing, reviewing, approving and servicing the loan. The high-cost lender buys the loan from the bank and provides it with a small percentage for each loan sold.</p><p>By originating the loan with a national bank, high-cost lenders take advantage of their partner bank's authority under federal law to charge higher interest rates - even though the lender approved the loan before the bank originated the loan.</p><p>Federal banking regulators, including the OCC, adopted policies to prohibit rent-a-bank lending schemes beginning in the early 2000s after payday lenders used these arrangements to get around state usury caps.</p><p>September 02: Consumers Union: Blog: Consumer Reports calls on automakers to drop support for rollback of federal gas mileage standards</p><p>Consumer Reports continues to demand that automakers stop support for an initiative that will cause U.S.consumers to lose hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>Earlier this year, CR delivered a petition signed by over 75,000 consumers to the heads of several major auto manufacturers that are lobbying and suing to weaken federal fuel economy and vehicle emissions standards.</p><p>Today that message is being delivered again, as CR combines its petition with a coalition of consumer, climate, science, and faith advocacy groups in delivering a new combined total of over 285,000 signatures to the CEOs of General Motors, FiatChrysler, Toyota and other automakers supporting this rollback of fuel economy and emissions rules. Rolling back America's Clean Car standards will increase the cost of owning a new vehicle by $2,100 by 2025, and cost American consumers $300 billion in total.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 01: Consumers Union: California legislature votes to protect the privacy of genetic data, CR urges the governor to sign bill into law</p><p>Yesterday, the California legislature approved SB 980, a bill endorsed by Consumer Reports that establishes key privacy protections over the data collected by direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies, like Ancestry.com and 23 &amp; Me. On Sunday, the California Assembly voted 54-10 in favor of the bill, and the bill concurred in the Senate on Monday night on a 39-0 vote.</p><p>\"Genetic data can provide deeply sensitive insights into a consumer's health profile, and no one should be able to access it without the consumers' permission,\" said Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst for Consumer Reports. \"This bill puts consumers squarely in control of their genetic data.

The proposal to strengthen state oversight of the financial industry was originally made by Governor Gavin Newsom when he introduced his budget earlier this year.</p><p>Consumer Reports and a coalition of consumer and small business groups had urged state lawmakers to support the proposal in light of the severe economic crisis that has made millions of Californians more vulnerable to unfair financial practices.</p><p>\"So many Californians across the state are suddenly out of work and struggling to pay their bills as a result of the COVID pandemic,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager for Consumer Reports. \"Predatory financial firms are taking advantage of the crisis by peddling high-priced loans and other risky products that could make things even worse for families desperate for cash. California's revamped financial watchdog will have the authority and resources it needs to monitor companies that currently evade state oversight and stop illegal practices that cheat vulnerable consumers out of their money.\"</p><p>Under AB 1864, the Department of Business Oversight will be augmented and renamed the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI).</p><p>August 31: Consumers Union: Landmark California product safety bill to hold online marketplaces liable for selling defective products fails to advance</p><p>AB 3262, a bill endorsed by Consumer Reports that would have ensured online marketplaces were held strictly liable for selling defective products to consumers at the same extent as brick-and-mortar retailers, failed to advance to a floor vote in the California Senate.</p><p>\"Amazon and other online marketplaces shouldn't get a free pass for selling defective products that cause consumers harm,\" said Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports. \"We urge California lawmakers to renew the effort in the next legislative session, and call on other states to pursue similar legislation to ensure consumer safety.\" Source: Company Website</p><p>August 31: Consumers Union: California legislature passes student borrower bill of rights</p><p>Californians working to pay off their student loans are poised to enjoy the strongest consumer protections in the country now that the Assembly has passed the Student Borrower Bill of Rights approved by the Senate on Friday.

Consumer Reports co-sponsored the legislation with NextGen California, Student Borrower Protection Center, Student Debt Crisis, and Young Invincibles.</p><p>\"Millions of Californians who went to college seeking a better future are now facing the daunting challenge of paying off a mountain of debt,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager. \"Too often, that burden is made heavier by for-profit loan servicing companies that mismanage accounts and steer borrowers into more expensive payment plans. The Student Borrower Bill of Rights will protect Californians from predatory loan servicing practices and help ensure they stand a fair shot at putting these debts behind them.

Over 60 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring that FDA and industry do just that. Unfortunately, an Environmental Defense Fund investigation of nearly 900 safety determinations found that only one considered the requirement in a meaningful way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In reviewing the correspondence between FDA and manufacturers, EDF found no evidence the agency raises concerns with this major shortcoming. The analysis also demonstrates that, when evaluating the safety of new additives, FDA and food manufacturers all too often consider one chemical at a time rather than as a class of related substances.</p><p>\"The collective failure by FDA and the food industry to follow the law may well have contributed to the dramatic increases we have seen in chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease in the US in recent decades,\" said Tom Neltner, Chemicals Policy Director for Environmental Defense Fund. \"Every time we eat highly processed food, we are exposed to chemical additives, and - for the chemicals that cause similar toxic effects - that combined exposure can increase the harm to our health. FDA and industry can and must do better to ensure our food is safe.\"</p><p>\"Pediatricians have been urging the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make urgently needed improvements to the food additive regulatory process. Children are uniquely vulnerable to chemical exposures because they eat and drink more, relative to body weight, than adults do. For children, studies have suggested that some food additives can have potentially serious health consequences, such as interfering with hormones, impeding growth and development, and increasing the risk of childhood obesity. It is absolutely critical that the FDA evaluate the cumulative effects of food additives across the diet and the lifespan in order to best support children's healthy growth and development.\" - American Academy of Pediatrics President Sara \"Sally\" Goza, MD, FAAP.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Consumers Union publishes magazines and newsletters.

While the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations in July, airlines and airports are not required to follow them and practices can vary widely across the industry.</p><p>\"Americans are already wary about traveling during a global pandemic and deserve to know that strict COVID-19 safety precautions will be followed if they choose to fly,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"We need mandatory, enforceable health and safety rules so that every airline, airport and passenger can be held accountable to help stop the spread of this potentially deadly virus. Mandatory standards will ultimately help the airlines recover from the current crisis by giving Americans more confidence that they will be safe when flying.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, Consumer Reports noted that Americans encounter a confusing patchwork of conflicting health and safety policies at hundreds of U.S. airports and every airline. Travelers cannot be sure, when they make a reservation, what the airline's policies on healthy travel will be on the date when their flight takes off.</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, other carriers are booking passengers on every seat on their planes. CR has heard from travelers concerned about overcrowded flights and that mask requirements are not being enforced consistently.</p><p>CR urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials to establish requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel.</p><p>July 30: Consumers Reports investigation finds that the College Board is sharing students personal information with tech companies</p><p>Consumer Reports released findings from an investigation into the privacy practices of the College Board and found that the organization appears to be in violation of its own policies.</p><p>Researchers at CR's Digital Lab found that the College Board is sending personally identifiable student information to major technology companies and ad platforms including Adobe, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat, and Yahoo.</p><p>\"College-bound students don't have any choice but to transact with the College Board-which is what makes these findings so concerning,\" said Ben Moskowitz, Director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. \"Because of its mission and its importance in the college admissions process, it is critical that the organization meet a high privacy standard, communicate clearly with its users, and limit the user data it shares with third parties for advertising purposes.\"</p><p>The College Board is a non-profit company that owns and operates the SAT test. The organization also administers the Advanced Placement exam, which high school students can take to earn college credit and strengthen applications. In some states, the SAT is even required for high school graduation. For millions of students, the College Board is an unavoidable gatekeeper on the path to higher education.</p><p>After contacting the College Board with our findings, the organization made some updates to its site, but the underlying problem as found in the investigation remains.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 13: Consumer Reports launches petition calling for mandatory COVID-19 health and safety standards for airlines and airports</p><p>Consumer Reports is calling on Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to issue mandatory, enforceable health and safety standards for airlines and airports to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. CR launched a petition urging Secretary Chao to take more aggressive action to protect passengers one week after the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations without requiring airlines and airports to comply with them.</p><p>\"Americans shouldn't have to figure out on their own whether it's safe to fly during a global pandemic,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"Secretary Chao is essentially making passengers gamble with their health by failing to require airlines and airports to abide by mandatory safety protocols. We need enforceable rules to protect travelers, especially now that some airlines are ignoring social distancing recommendations and packing flights with passengers.\"</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, American, Spirit, and United airlines say they will book passengers on every seat on their planes. Some airlines and airports are enforcing mask requirements, while others are not. And some airports are doing health screenings without any clear rule on how that information will be acted on, raising both medical and privacy concerns.</p><p>In June, Consumer Reports urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials and take an active role in establishing requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Secretary Chao has the authority to make COVID-19 safety protocols mandatory using the same authority used by the DOT in the past to require airlines to adopt stronger security measures following the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p><p>May 13: CR, U.S. PIRG and activist deliver nearly 250,000 petition signatures to airlines calling for full refunds for canceled flights</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and a consumer-turned-activist delivered nearly 250,000 petition signatures today to the airlines calling on them to provide full refunds when passengers cancel their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus. The petition delivery came on the same day that Senator Edward Markey (MA) introduced legislation in Congress endorsed by the groups that would make refunds mandatory in such cases.</p><p>Despite receiving a $50 billion taxpayer-funded bailout as part of the CARES Act, the majority of airlines are only offering vouchers instead of refunds to passengers who canceled their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, even though passengers are legally entitled to a full refund if the airline cancels their flight, some carriers are offering vouchers as the default option. This forces passengers to take extra steps to get the cash refund they deserve.</p><p>\"It's simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who cannot travel safely or to those who are facing financial hardship and need the cash,\" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports. \"The airlines are, in effect, forcing millions of Americans to provide an interest-free loan after these companies have already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, the groups noted that they have heard from thousands of people from all over the country who are frustrated that they can't get a refund for their canceled flight. These stories include customers who canceled flights because of stay-at-home orders, senior citizens and other at-risk customers worried about their safety, and the newly unemployed who need the money to pay their bills. Others have expressed concerns that the vouchers will expire before it is safe to travel again.</p><p>\"The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well.</p><p>May 01: Consumer Reports Applauds ICANN's Decision to Reject.ORG Sale to Private Equity Firm</p><p>ICANN announced last night that it would reject a plan to sell the.ORG domain registry. The sale would have transferred control of the Public Interest Registry from the Internet Society to Ethos Capital, a private equity firm. This is a major victory for the nonprofit community and the public interest.</p><p>\"ICANN's rejection of the sale of.ORG to Ethos Capital is a win for nonprofits around the world. The sale would have resulted in one company deciding who gets the domain and how much they would have to pay for it. We applaud ICANN, and we thank California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and all of the organizations that came together to push back against this sale. Although the process for securing a steward for the.org domain is not yet over, we hope that the search is transparent, competitive, and in the interest of the public.

Such information, known as \"Customer Content\" could include cloud video recordings and information that was shared during the recordings such as instant messages, files, and whiteboards.</p><p>After these findings by CR, Zoom made significant changes to its privacy policies, which was announced in a blog post and detailed in a new CR article. The updated policy now states that so-called \"Customer Content\" is not allowed for advertising purposes, that video is only retained at the user's request, and that it's not accessed by Zoom. The new policy also provides more insight into the type of consumer data Zoom collects, such as phone numbers and user names.</p><p>While CR is pleased to see the quick response by Zoom, there is still work to be done. For example, Zoom should make a clear differentiation between hosts and participants, and require participants to click on a consent button before a recording can begin.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 02: Consumer Reports: Consumer Reports responds to EPA Science Advisory Board final report about fuel economy rollback plan</p><p>The science advisory board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a final report about the proposed EPA &amp; DOT plan to rollback vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, known as the 'SAFE' Rule.</p><p>In response to the report, David Friedman, Vice President of Advocacy at Consumer Reports, provides the following statement:</p><p>\"The EPA's own scientific advisors confirm many of CR's criticisms of the proposed rule. They even acknowledge that the original, \"2012 rule might provide a better outcome for society than the proposed revision.\" Our analysis shows that it is more than a possibility. Strong fuel economy standards save consumers money, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. So, whether it is a full or partial rollback, the administration should ditch its current plans so consumers won't be stuck spending billions more than they should just to go about their daily lives.\"</p><p>You can learn more about how costly the proposed rollback would be for consumers at CR.org/unsaferule.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 28: Consumer Reports: DOJ/FTC proposed update to Vertical Merger Guidelines needs more work, more relevance to today's marketplace</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports has filed comments with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in response to a proposal to update their Enforcement Guidelines for assessing vertical mergers under the antitrust laws. These are mergers that combine two companies that operate at different levels in a supply and marketing chain, and therefore do, or could, do business with each other. The updated Vertical Merger Guidelines would replace guidelines published in 1984, before the arrival of the internet and its dramatic transformation of the marketplace. The 1984 guidelines are largely ignored in actual enforcement decision making, but they remain on the books.</p><p>CR welcomes the plan to update the guidelines as long overdue, but says the current draft needs more work.</p><p>\"To be useful, updated guidelines need to be relevant, and they need to be clear,\" says George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"They need to speak to the challenges to competition we are facing in today's online marketplace, and they need to be understandable to the wider public, not just antitrust economists and lawyers. Curiously, the descriptive examples used in the current draft could have been written for the marketplace as it existed decades ago, or even for the marketplace Adam Smith wrote about 250 years ago. There is not a single reference to today's online marketplace, where a handful of giant platforms are increasingly able to control the choices that can reach consumers.</p><p>\"Age-old competition concerns are being magnified and transformed by an entirely new dimension of high-tech market power, fueled by massive troves of data and awesome technological capabilities to gather, sort, and manipulate it, reaching into all corners of our commercial and personal interactions and preferences.</p><p>February 25: Consumer Reports calls for major safety improvements across the industry after NTSB makes new findings in Tesla investigation</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In light of new findings by the National Transportation Safety Board related to Tesla Autopilot, Consumer Reports today called for manufacturers to include key safety features in any vehicle that has an active driving assistance system - a type of emerging technology that helps human drivers accelerate, brake, and steer but also requires them to be responsible for the driving at any moment - and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that is the case.</p><p>Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for cars and product safety at Consumer Reports, said, \"This shouldn't be considered optional. Manufacturers and NHTSA must make sure that these driver-assist systems come with critical safety features that actually verify drivers are monitoring the road and ready to take action at all times. Otherwise, the safety risks of these systems could end up outweighing their benefits.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear, and continuing to pile up, that if a car makes it easier for people to take their attention off the road, they're going to do so-with potentially deadly consequences. So far, federal safety regulators have done little to reduce these risks, and the NTSB makes clear that NHTSA's hands-off approach is far too weak. It's time for NHTSA to go beyond mere words and take some real, forceful action to keep people safe.\"</p><p>CR's call comes as the NTSB today released a preliminary report on the fatal March 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged. The NTSB attributed the crash to several factors, including Autopilot's limitations and \"cell phone distraction.\" The investigative board also reiterated that regulators and manufacturers alike have ignored the NTSB's previous recommendations for system safeguards, and called for an overhaul of how manufacturers design their active driving assistance systems to ensure a human driver stays engaged and ready to take action.</p><p>February 25: Consumers Union: Investigation finds Allstate's secret algorithm resulted in \"suckers list\" of drivers deemed unlikely to shop for better deals</p><p>A joint investigation by Consumer Reports and The Markup sheds light on how a controversial plan pushed by Allstate in Maryland could be functioning in other states that have allowed the company's customer \"retention model.\" The groups found that Allstate would have saddled Maryland customers paying the most expensive premiums with big increases that it wasn't willing to pass on to thriftier customers with similar risk profiles.</p><p>Maryland and a few other states have rejected these efforts, but ten other states have allowed Allstate to use a customer retention model. The groups based their joint investigation on a statistical analysis of the documents Allstate submitted on its plan in Maryland. It offers a rare public window revealing details of Allstate's pricing plan that have otherwise been kept secret.</p><p>\"Despite the purported complexity of Allstate's price adjustment algorithm, it was actually simple: It resulted in a suckers list of Maryland customers who were big spenders and would squeeze more money out of them than others,\" according to the report by Maddy Varner and Aaron Sankin of The Markup, the data-driven journalism organization launching today focused on the impact of technology on society.</p><p>\"These revelations are concerning enough on their own, but they're also an unmistakable harbinger of the new age of consumer threats we're racing headlong into,\" said Marta L. Tellado, President &amp; CEO of Consumer Reports. \"Like security flaws in our gadgets and invisible toxins in our food, hidden biases in the algorithms that set more and more of the prices we pay pose an insidious threat.\"</p><p>Seven years ago, when Allstate filed this plan with Maryland, the company said that its new risk analysis showed that it was charging nearly all of its customers outdated premiums. Rather than apply the new rates all at once, Allstate asked the Maryland Insurance Administration for permission to run each policy through an advanced algorithm containing dozens of variables that would adjust it in the general direction of the new customer \"retention\" model.</p><p>But The Markup and Consumer Reports found that customers who were due a big rate hike may or may not get it based on whether Allstate thought they were likely to shop around:</p><p>It appears that Allstate assumed drivers with a cheap policy would shop around for a better deal, while those with an expensive policy would not.</p><p>February 11: Consumers Union: Court Rules Against State Antitrust Challenge to T-MobileSprint Merger</p><p>A federal district court ruled today against the antitrust action by 13 states and the District of Columbia to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.</p><p>Consumer Reports said the merger will combine two giant nationwide wireless phone service carriers into one, leaving consumers with only three giant carriers to choose from and reducing the incentives of the three remaining carriers to compete by offering more affordable, higher quality, and more innovative service.</p><p>Consumer Reports has been raising strong concerns that the merger would harm competition, and harm consumers and others in the wireless marketplace who depend on that competition</p><p>\"We commend the states for their perseverance and determination in challenging this anti-consumer combination,\" said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"From the moment this merger was announced, it was clear that it went against what is needed to give consumers the benefits of competition. This merger should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom. Unfortunately, despite all the states' efforts, and the strong case they presented, the court could not be convinced.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a similar merger in the past, when AT&amp;T sought to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. However, DOJ gave T-Mobile and Sprint a green light, based on a side deal it helped engineer to set up satellite TV company DISH to become a new fourth nationwide mobile phone carrier to replace the loss of Sprint.</p><p>Slover said DISH is an unproven newcomer, with no mobile phone network, and no experience providing mobile phone service. It will have to build both essentially from scratch, he said.</p><p>\"Sprint is an established carrier, with a track record of determination and success in spurring competition that benefits consumers,\" said Slover.</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 17: Consumers Union: Consumer Reports applauds California's settlement against Glow for privacy violations that risked exposing women's sensitive health data</p><p>Consumer Reports today praised the state of California following the announcement of a settlement with Glow, a technology company that operates a mobile fertility application.</p><p>In 2016 Consumer Reports found that the Glow app exposed women to privacy threats.

Especially with California's new privacy law in effect, the Attorney General's office is at the front line of protecting our privacy and security.

In a letter submitted to the OCC today, CR called on the federal regulator to protect consumers from high-cost loans by rescinding the proposal.</p><p>\"With so many Americans out of work and struggling to pay their bills, the last thing the OCC should be doing is making it easier for shady lenders to charge exorbitant interest rates,\" said Antonio Carrejo, policy counsel for Consumer Reports. \"Unfortunately, the OCC's proposal would enable predatory lenders to 'rent-a-bank' that isn't subject to state consumer protection laws and get away with peddling high-priced loans that trap borrowers in debt.\"</p><p>Rent-a-bank lending schemes typically involve partnerships between a national bank and a non-bank lender marketing payday loans, auto title loans, or auto installment loans. The bank originates the loan and the high-cost lender manages all other aspects of the transaction, including marketing, reviewing, approving and servicing the loan. The high-cost lender buys the loan from the bank and provides it with a small percentage for each loan sold.</p><p>By originating the loan with a national bank, high-cost lenders take advantage of their partner bank's authority under federal law to charge higher interest rates - even though the lender approved the loan before the bank originated the loan.</p><p>Federal banking regulators, including the OCC, adopted policies to prohibit rent-a-bank lending schemes beginning in the early 2000s after payday lenders used these arrangements to get around state usury caps.</p><p>September 02: Consumers Union: Blog: Consumer Reports calls on automakers to drop support for rollback of federal gas mileage standards</p><p>Consumer Reports continues to demand that automakers stop support for an initiative that will cause U.S.consumers to lose hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>Earlier this year, CR delivered a petition signed by over 75,000 consumers to the heads of several major auto manufacturers that are lobbying and suing to weaken federal fuel economy and vehicle emissions standards.</p><p>Today that message is being delivered again, as CR combines its petition with a coalition of consumer, climate, science, and faith advocacy groups in delivering a new combined total of over 285,000 signatures to the CEOs of General Motors, FiatChrysler, Toyota and other automakers supporting this rollback of fuel economy and emissions rules.
