It has recently become a point of contention between Big Tech and the Trump Administration. Recently, a presidential tweet was labeled with a fact-checking message that described the content as 'unsubstantiated.'[2][2] The President claimed the label was intended to chill his rights under the First Amendment and subsequently signed the Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship, calling for review and clarification of the scope of Section 230. The Executive Order also calls on the Secretary of Commerce and the Attorney General to engage in rule-making with the Federal Communications Commission to clarify when a tech company could be deemed to be taking part in 'not 'taken in good faith.''[3][3] Additionally, the Order encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate 'unfair or deceptive acts or practices' committed by online platforms.How did this relatively small piece of legislation become the center of a heated debate?By way of background, Section 230 shields websites from legal liability for posts, including comments, images, and videos, of third-party users. </p><p>At the time this legislation was passed, the Internet was vastly different from what it is today. In the '90s, as the tech world was beginning to grow, Congress sought to encourage that growth through statutory protections. Section 230 provides websites with immunity for posts left by users, and allows for 'Good Samaritan' protection from civil lawsuits if websites remove or moderate posts that they consider to be 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.'[4][4] This way, websites can still 'clean up' posted content without having to worry about being targeted via lawsuits for choosing to police and self-regulate their own domains, so long as they do so in 'good faith.'Section 230 allows platforms to be available to all users to share, gather, and disseminate information. Websites, especially those with enormous platforms, host millions upon millions of individual posts every single day. Even with dedicated moderators and advanced algorithms in place, it is a huge undertaking to examine every single post to determine whether it is illegal or inappropriate; and even with a robust procedure in place, it is hardly fail-safe. But there is growing concern about who gets the final say about what is considered inappropriate and when it should be revised, removed, or labeled. Section 230 has become a flashpoint and raises complex First Amendment, online safety, and competition considerations.The Executive Order alone might not seem like it has teeth, unless Congress agrees with the President and passes legislation that repeals or amends Section 230. But the rule-making prompted by the Executive Order could shift interpretation of the law, calling into doubt the wide protections enjoyed by tech companies. Moreover, Attorney General William Barr has been vocal about his concerns regarding Section 230 and its protections, prompting the DOJ to seriously examine the law to propose a way forward.In February, the DOJ hosted a one-day workshop called 'Section 230 - Nurturing Innovation or Fostering Unaccountability?' inviting both public and private stakeholders to confer about the law's transformation since its enactment to the present day and whether it needs to be modified to account for this new era of Big Tech. The DOJ states that it also met with companies that attended or indicated interest in talking about Section 230, although it is unclear which companies that included.Last month, following its 10-month review of the law, the DOJ released its recommendations for Section 230 reform.[5][5] Rather than seek a complete repeal of the legislation, the DOJ identified four key categories where reform should take place in order 'to realign the scope of Section 230 with the realities of the modern internet.'[6][6] These four areas are (1) Incentivizing Online Platforms to Address Illicit Content, (2) Clarifying Federal Government Enforcement Capabilities to Address Unlawful Content, (3) Promoting Competition, and (4) Promoting Open Discourse and Greater Transparency.[7][7]The first category seeks to strip away protection from those who purposely facilitate or solicit unlawful content and allows for civil lawsuits involving child abuse, terrorism, and cyber-stalking to proceed, thus incentivizing websites to be proactive about tracking and removing illegal content. The second category proposes more government intervention through civil enforcement actions. The third category seeks to clarify that companies cannot use Section 230 to protect themselves from antitrust actions 'where liability is based on harm to competition, not on third-party speech.'[8][8] Finally, the fourth category is aimed at refining the language of Section 230, including an addition of 'good faith.'Some argue that Section 230 should be updated to address some of the potential dangers of the growing Internet that were not present in 1996. If this effort gains more traction, many view it as imperative that tech representatives be involved in the conversation because they are the experts in devising the algorithms and training the moderators to track down illegal and harmful content. A company's role and responsibility to police, remove, and/or label content may implicate complex First Amendment concerns. There may not be a one-size-fits-all approach to updating Section 230 to address all posted content in all types of forums. Many will be watching to see whether there will be changes to this law that has helped fuel online growth.[1][9] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-recommendations-section-230-reform\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-recommendations-section-230-reform</url>.

Its Antitrust Division will seek public input, including from industry participants with direct insight into competition between online platforms.<br/>The goal is to ensure Americans have access to free markets. The DoJ will seek redress if it identifies violations of the law.<br/>While the department did not name any companies specifically, there are strong indications that Google, Facebook and Amazon are among its targets of interest.<br/>\"The breadth of this seems to be enormous, which means it will probably lack depth, focus or meaningful change,\" remarked Willy Leichter, vice president of marketing at Virsec.<br/>\"A thoughtful analysis of actual antitrust issues with e-commerce being increasingly dominated by Amazon might yield useful results,\" he told TechNewsWorld, \"but throw in a jumble of issues with conflicting agendas, and the process will likely devolve into political theater.\"<br/>There's no doubt big tech companies are feeling pressure. The House Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee last month announced a bipartisan antitrust investigation into competition in digital markets.<br/>Cheers and CautionsPoliticians on both sides of the aisle, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., welcomed the DoJ's announcement.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Congressional oversight is needed to ensure that the Trump administration \"doesn't abuse this necessary review in order to pursue its own partisan agenda,\" Warren said. \"This issue is too important to be dragged into Trump's petty grievances against these companies.\"<br/>Peter Klein, a professor at Baylor University, pointed to a policy shift.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Some tech analysts expressed skepticism.<br/>\"We can expect rigorous investigations prior to the election year cycle,\" said Ray Wang, principal analyst at Constellation Research.<br/>\"This comes from both sides, where the one political party fears big tech and the other fears the silencing of freedom of speech,\" he told TechNewsWorld.<br/>The investigation \"will put a microscope on big tech and it will empower those who focus on compliance, but without a decision framework, this is just likely to create confusion and reduce these firms' ability to execute short term,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group.<br/>\"These things can become huge distractions,\" he told TechNewsWorld.<br/>The DoJ investigation \"will lower [the United States'] ability to compete globally in the short term, but could result in stronger firms in the long term,\" Enderle said. \"It all depends on how the government and these firms deal with what comes out of the investigation.\"<br/>On the other hand, \"the slow speed of investigations is unlikely to keep up with the growth of big tech and will probably be no more than a speed bump,\" Virsec's Leichter suggested.<br/>Fear and LoathingFacebook and Google have been fined repeatedly for violating users' privacy. Both companies, as well as Amazon, face potential antitrust actions in the EU.<br/>While huge fines have been levied -- Facebook just agreed to a US$5 billion settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission -- activists' concerns have not been allayed.<br/>The settlement \"lets Facebook off the hook for violating kids' privacy and manipulating children and teens into making in-app purchases,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.<br/>The FTC \"did not require an admission of guilt from Facebook,\" noted Sarah Miller, co-chair of Freedom From Facebook.<br/>The fine amounts to \"a joke to Facebook, a one-time parking ticket,\" she said.<br/>Congress should empower state attorneys-general to investigate Facebook before it \"can further dismantle democracy,\" Miller suggested.<br/>Amazon, meanwhile, has struck fear into retailers small and large.<br/>Nearly 75 percent of retailers with at least 100 employees have expressed concern over being underpriced by Amazon, according to an ActiveViam study covering 500 senior pricing decision makers at such firms.<br/>Where a market has more than 100 million active users, there's cause for concern, Wang said. \"When markets have 1 billion monthly active users, you have a situation headed to digital duopolies. This is the crux of the concern.\"<br/>We need regulatory protections, he said, but \"the problem is that most legislators lack the technical chops to understand how to write privacy policies that put the power back in the consumers' hands while ensuring public good and enabling a marketplace for e-commerce.\"<br/>A behavioral change would do big tech good, Enderle suggested.<br/>\"Recall when Microsoft actually decided to comply with EU requests, they got stronger,\" he pointed out. \"Behaving allows for more focus on the markets and customers that the firms should be focused on in the first place.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-28472</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP7-X581-DYDW-711D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Currently they are essentially free to act as they wish.</p><p>Conservatives say they have used that discretion to censor or downplay material from right-leaning websites, a row which exploded Tuesday when Google threatened to demonetize The Federalist, a conservative website founded by Meghan McCain's husband Ben Domenech.</p><p>Another part of the proposal would make them more liable for content related to child exploitation and terrorism.</p><p>If passed the proposal would change decades of legal protection enjoyed by social media companies. </p><p>The move is the next step in the administration's war on big tech over claims of anti-conservative bias, and comes after President Trump signed an executive order at the end of May that limited the companies' legal protections.</p><p>But legal experts said the president's order would likely have little effect on tech companies. It was immediately challenged in court. </p><p>A change in law pushed by the Justice Department would have greater impact. </p><p>Democrats and Republicans have found rare common ground in attacking Section 230. The law, adopted in the the 1990s, is seen by both sides as out of date in governing the rapidly evolving internet. </p><p>That law gave big tech companies immunity from lawsuits that would have threatened the existence of the then-infant companies but now it protects the online giants from liability. </p><p>Democrats complain the law allows social media companies to spread political falsehoods, disinformation, and hate speech while Republicans claim it allows the stifling of conservative voices. </p><p>The president has been one of big tech's biggest critics on the matter, claiming the companies silence conservative voices. </p><p>'We're here today to defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly,' Trump said in the Oval Office on May 28 when he signed the order. 'A small handful of powerful social media monopolies control the vast portion of all private and public communications in the United States.' </p><p>That order came after Twitter marked some of tweets as needing more information, a move that infuriated the president. </p><p>The debate over the president tweets highlights the struggle social media platform have as they try to balance freedom of speech with cracking down on misinformation. </p><p>The Justice Department's proposal would strip big tech companies of the civil immunity they have in a number of areas, including third-party content or activity that violates federal criminal law or situations involving online child exploitation and sexual abuse, terrorism or cyberstalking.</p><p>It would also make clear the companies don't have immunity in civil enforcement actions brought by the federal government, and can't use immunity as a defense against antitrust claims, The Journal reported. </p><p>Additionally, Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a close ally of President Trump, introduced legislation that would allow users to sue social media platforms over accusations of censorship of political speech.</p><p>A user could sue any large platform - with more than 30 million users in the U.S. in a month - that are not 'operating in good faith' for $5,000 and attorneys' fees. </p><p>Under current law, tech platforms are generally not legally liable for the actions of their users, except in rare, small cases. The social media companies also have a broad ability to police their sites of content as they see fit.</p><p>Twitter's fact checking of two Trump tweets - which made false claims about absentee voting - sparked the president's fury and his threat against them. </p><p>'Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,' Trump tweeted after the fact checking took place. 'We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that.... happen again.' </p><p>Twitter later red-flagged another Trump tweet, one he wrote about the Minneapolis riots in the wake of George Floyd's death, claiming that it 'glorifies violence'. </p><p>His tweet saying that 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts' was hidden by a warning that it violated Twitter's rules - but the message can be bypassed and the tweet remains live. </p><p>Trump has a large online presence. His Facebook page has more than 28 million followers and he has more than 82 million followers on Twitter.</p><p>The Justice Department's proposal also comes as NBC News is under fire for appearing to influence Google to punish two conservative news sites over what was deemed offensive coverage of the protests that sprung up after Floyd's death.</p><p>The network reported on Tuesday that Google 'banned' The Federalist and ZeroHedge from Google Ads for 'pushing unsubstantiated claims' about the Black Lives Matter movement. </p><p>Google, however, said The Federalist 'was never demonetized.' </p><p>'We worked with them to address issues on their site related to the comments section,' the company said.</p><p>However, it appears it was NBC News' inquiry that led to Google's action with The Federalist, an American conservative online magazine run by Meghan McCain's husband.</p><p>NBC was reporting on a study about online hate done by a British non-profit and noted in its report: 'Google blocked The Federalist from its advertising platform after the NBC News Verification Unit brought the project to its attention. ZeroHedge had already been demonetized prior to NBC News' inquiry, Google said.' </p><p>Conservatives jumped on Google, accusing it of bias.</p><p>Meghan McCain tweeted: 'Google is now trafficking in digital fascism. How soon until all conservative speech and publications are completely banned?' </p><p>Donald Trump Jr. said the company was trying to have it 'both ways' by on the one hand seemingly trying to hold The Federalist accountable for comments posted on its site while shirking responsibility for what appears on its own search results page - something that has recently been called into question by the president as tech giants' way of getting out of being sued. </p><p>And, in a letter to Google on Monday night, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said Google's actions 'raise serious concerns that it is abusing its monopoly power in an effort to censor political speech with which it disagrees'. </p><p>Cruz demanded Google turn over all correspondence it had with NBC, the think tank and all communications between staff about The Federalist. </p><p>'Google seems more than happy to play this censorship role by trying to break the financial back of a media publication with which it disagrees. </p><p>'Whether or not one agrees with this characterization, destroying the publisher's ability to use advertising to reach willing readers should be wholly beyond the pale,' Cruz continued. </p><p>He said it was indicative of the 'bigger problem' that 'the culture of free speech in this country is under attack.' </p><p>'Google is helping lead the charge,' he went on. </p><p>The company has in the past been accused of promoting left-wing sites over right-wing counterparts but insists its algorithms are impartial.</p><p>NBC JOURNALIST THANKS BRITISH THINK-TANK FOR 'COLLABORATING' TO DEFUND RIGHT-WING SITES                    </p><p> The NBC journalist who wrote the piece which initially seemed to prompt Google's decision to defund ZeroHedge is Adele Momoko-Fraser. </p><p>She quoted a Google spokeswoman who said both ZeroHedge and The Federalist had been stripped of their ability to monetize. </p><p>Momoko-Fraser has worked with NBC for six months. Before that, she worked for British TV networks Channel 4 and Sky, but her journalism experience is brief. </p><p>She tweeted, after NBC published its story, to thank The for Countering Digital Hate for 'collaborating'. </p><p>She was slammed for her terminology, with some accusing her and the center of silencing free speech. </p><p>Momoko-Fraser then tweeted again: 'To clarify this earlier tweet, we obtained this research exclusively from @SFFakeNews but we did not collaborate on the research itself.' </p><p>The account she tagged stands for Stop Funding Fake News. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-63704277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6054-TJF1-F021-63X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1616\"/><timeReceived>1:57 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The DOJ wants the information of gun owners who use the mobile app called Obsidian 4, which allows rifle owners to calibrate their scope using their cell phone, Forbes[2]reported. </p><p>The government wants users' data as part of a larger immigration and customs enforcement investigation into breaches of weapons export regulations. Specifically, the DOJ is looking into illegal exports of American Technologies Network Corp's, the owner of Obsidian 4, scopes. From Forbes: It's looking into illegal exports of ATN's scope, though the company itself isn't under investigation, according to the order. As part of that, investigators are looking for a quick way to find out where the app is in use, as that will likely indicate where the hardware has been shipped. ICE has repeatedly intercepted illegal shipments of the scope, which is controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), according to the government court filing. They included shipments to Canada, the Netherlands and Hong Kong where the necessary licenses hadn't been obtained. 'This pattern of unlawful, attempted exports of this rifle scope in combination with the manner in which the ATN Obsidian 4 application is paired with this scope manufactured by Company A supports the conclusion that the information requested herein will assist the government in identifying networks engaged in the unlawful export of this rifle scope through identifying end users located in countries to which export of this item is restricted,' the government order reads. (The order was supposed to have been sealed, butForbesobtained it before the document was hidden from public view.) There's no clear stipulation on the government's side to limit this to countries outside of America, though that limitation could be put in place. It's unclear just whom ICE is investigating. No public charges have been filed related to the company or resellers of its weapons tools. Reports online haveclaimed[3]ATN scopes were being used by the Taliban. It's unclear just how man people have downloaded the mobile app. Google Play confirms more than 10,000 downloads but Apple doesn't provide that information. If the judge agrees to this unprecedented move, the tech giants will have to provide the DOJ with the names, phone numbers and IP addresses of everyone who downloaded the app between August 1, 2017 to now. The government also wants to know when each person utilized the app. Should the tech giants have to hand over users' data, this would be a huge violation of public trust. It would be a fishing expedition. And who would suffer? The greater public and gun owners in particular. Allowing this request to go through would create a dangerous precedent. The most dangerous aspect, though, is the government being able to pinpoint every single person and every single firearm a person has. It's a form of a gun registrywithout calling it that.Sean Walton is a researcher and journalist for The Daily Sheeple[4], where this article first appeared[5].

Congress is already grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, a stalled new stimulus package and a growing fight over a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p><p>\"Congress could take up the proposal or others like it next year,\" the Journal added. \"Both Democrats and Republicans say they want to review the legal protections internet companies enjoy, though they have differing concerns.\"</p><p>Abishur Prakash is a geopolitical futurist at the Center for Innovating the Future, a strategy consulting firm based in Toronto. He told International Business Times that both political parties in the U.S. are coming out with their own ideas for regulating \"Big Tech.\"</p><p>\"Central to all the ideas is two things: internet dominance and industry monopolies,\" he said. \"By redesigning Section 230, the U.S. is ensuring that internet companies take on more responsibility for how they monitor and manage content. Of course, during the election season, this is crucial.\"</p><p>What's taking place with Section 230 is part of a bigger shift for tech firms, he noted.</p><p>\"Their operating landscape is changing,\" he said. \"[Previously], they transcended borders and were not under stringent regulation. Now, from Australia to India to Europe, governments are clamping down on tech firms in their own ways. This is changing the business model and profitability of these firms.\"</p><p>Prakash also said there's geopolitical component to this issue.</p><p>\"As the U.S. government seeks to change Section 230 and moderate online content, [Chinese-owned video sharing app] TikTok has launched a similar initiative,\" he said. \"Now, a western government and a Chinese tech firm are eyeing the same thing. This could be a new flashpoint.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-636309086</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 636309086</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XF-6MY1-JCBJ-K2P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"688\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newsweek Media Group</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political activity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political aspects</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Public affairs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Congress is already grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, a stalled new stimulus package and a growing fight over a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p><p>\"Congress could take up the proposal or others like it next year,\" the Journal added. \"Both Democrats and Republicans say they want to review the legal protections internet companies enjoy, though they have differing concerns.\"</p><p>Abishur Prakash is a geopolitical futurist at the Center for Innovating the Future, a strategy consulting firm based in Toronto. He told International Business Times that both political parties in the U.S. are coming out with their own ideas for regulating \"Big Tech.\"</p><p>\"Central to all the ideas is two things: internet dominance and industry monopolies,\" he said. \"By redesigning Section 230, the U.S. is ensuring that internet companies take on more responsibility for how they monitor and manage content. Of course, during the election season, this is crucial.\"</p><p>What's taking place with Section 230 is part of a bigger shift for tech firms, he noted.</p><p>\"Their operating landscape is changing,\" he said. \"[Previously], they transcended borders and were not under stringent regulation. Now, from Australia to India to Europe, governments are clamping down on tech firms in their own ways. This is changing the business model and profitability of these firms.\"</p><p>Prakash also said there's geopolitical component to this issue.</p><p>\"As the U.S. government seeks to change Section 230 and moderate online content, [Chinese-owned video sharing app] TikTok has launched a similar initiative,\" he said. \"Now, a western government and a Chinese tech firm are eyeing the same thing. This could be a new flashpoint.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-636268007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 636268007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XF-6MY1-JCBJ-K2DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"688\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newsweek Media Group</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political activity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political aspects</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Public affairs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Some even accuse social media companies like Twitter and Facebook of suppressing their political viewpoints through \"shadow-banning,\" the act of making certain posts less visible than others. And politicians like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz have suggested that the Justice Department should review that supposed censorship. During a Senate hearing in April, Cruz commented, \"By almost any measure, the giant tech companies today are larger and more powerful than Standard Oil was when it was broken up [in the early 20th century]. They are larger and more powerful than AT&amp;T when it was broken up [in 1982]. If we have tech companies using the power of monopoly to sanction political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues.\"</p><p>Asked whether it's the role of antitrust regulators to ensure diversity of viewpoints in social media, DOJ Antitrust Division chief Makan Delrahim is hesitant. \"It's not my job to ensure diversity,\" he says. \"It is my job to ensure that there's competition should there be, in what we call in economic parlance, a revealed preference on behalf of consumers to want that type of diversity.\"</p><p>But Delrahim does imagine a scenario where the DOJ could get involved. \"Obviously, Rupert Murdoch at Fox showed there was a market for half the country who wanted a different viewpoint of news presented to them,\" he says. \"And they did that. Now, if the market was blocked for him to invest and create something that he felt the market needed or demanded, that would be a problem. But otherwise, it's not our job to regulate the content of speech.\"</p><p>Interestingly, his comment about Murdoch recalls a nearly forgotten episode nearly a quarter century ago.</p><p>When Time Warner merged with Turner Broadcasting in 1995, the company agreed to pick up an additional cable news network on top of CNN, one of its subsidiaries.Time Warner chose MSNBC instead of Murdoch's Fox News, which led to a big courtroom brawl. Encouraged by then-New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, Fox News filed antitrust claims while Time Warner countersued with the allegation that city officials had conspired with Murdoch's companies to suppress its free speech rights to offer what it wished on its cable system. The judge ruled in favor of Time Warner. \"The city's purpose in acting to compel Time Warner to give Fox one of its commercial channels was to reward a friend and to further a particular viewpoint,''\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://casetext.com/case/time-warner-cable-v-city-of-new-york\">wrote the judge</url>.</p><p>Fortunately for Murdoch, he eventually negotiated a deal for wider carriage of Fox News.

I cited a Forbes article that featured an interview with Andrew Svetly, Florida Hospital's chief medical information officer, who said possessing clinician credentials helped him earn respect from physicians and hospital administrators.</p><p/><p>That kind of in-depth domain knowledge would probably be a plus for any CIO but may be especially critical for health care, an industry with specialized operational requirements and lots of regulatory and security issues.</p><p/><p>As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InformationWeek</emphasis> reports, AT&amp;T's health care division has <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">appointed Geeta Nayyar, MD, MBA as its first chief medical information officer</emphasis>. Nayyar, a practicing rheumatologist, helped implement an electronic health record system for the faculty practice at George Washington University while she was studying for her MBA there. Randall Porter, assistant VP of AT&amp;T ForHealth, told InformationWeek that CMIOs who practice medicine are more in touch with the rapidly changing health care sector.</p><p/><p>AT&amp;T wants to be a big player in the health care market -- along with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">just about every other technology vendor out there</emphasis>. As IT Business Edge's Loraine Lawson wrote last summer, health care IT was once considered a niche market, served primarily by smaller vendors with proprietary solutions. But big tech vendors became seriously interested after the federal government announced plans to spend some $20 billion updating the country's medical records and other IT systems.</p><p/><p>In a post on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">hot market for IT talent with experience in electronic health records</emphasis>, IT Business Edge's Susan Hall mentioned a recent a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that predicted health care spending will make up nearly 20 percent of the U.S. economy by 2019 and research from RNCOS forecasting 24 percent spending growth on health care technology in the U.S. between 2012 and 2014.</p><p/><p>The InformationWeek article mentions several IT health initiatives in which AT&amp;T is involved, including a joint effort with the Department of Health and Human Services and the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) to improve self-management training of diabetic patients.

Essentially, he believes robots canbe a positive force in our lives if done the right way.</p><p>He takes offence when it comes to pop culture and the depiction of robots. \"We've been taught that robots are supposed to be our slaves. There was a play in the 1920s where robots were slaves and at the end of the play there were so many robots, they got bored and took over so they became the humans,\" he explains.</p><p>Instead of this dystopian vision, Coplin thinks the potential for domestic robots is huge. \"The opportunity in the domestic context is neither be a slave nor a master, but to be a companion and peer to the family.\"</p><p>Anki's</p><p> Vector robot is betting on robotics becoming a part of the home (</p><p>Anki</p><p>)</p><p>Recently, he collaborated with robotics company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/techandgadgets/robots-will-take-over-third-of-british-jobs-in-next-15-years-says-report-a3498056.html\">Anki</url>, which makes       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/techandgadgets/robots-will-take-over-third-of-british-jobs-in-next-15-years-says-report-a3498056.html\">the cute Pixar-inspired robots Vector</url> and Cosmo, to explore the British public's attitudes to domestic robots. This companion idea was one of the findings from the survey: 16 per cent of respondents said they were hopeful robots could offer companionship, byeither listening to their problems or helping keep their pets company when they were away.</p><p>\"For me, the opportunity is that people get the utility value of domestic robots. What we've got to do is take them on a journey so they can see the emotional and social value,\" says Coplin.</p><p>The emotional and social value of domestic robots</p><p>Coplin is throwing his futurist weight behind social robotics, the genre of robotics trying to imbue emotion into communication between humans and robots. Anki is doing this with its Vector robots, MIT Media Lab start-up Affectiva is doing it by developing tech to read human facial expressions, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/techandgadgets/robots-will-take-over-third-of-british-jobs-in-next-15-years-says-report-a3498056.html\">Dr Madeline Gannon</url> is doing it at her lab in Pittsburgh.</p><p>In particular, Dr Gannon's work focuses on the idea that teaching robots to be more human means they will work better alongside us.</p><p>Coplin agrees with this: \"We need to get this right because when you get the communication right between humans and a machine, the efficiency of what they're able to do goes through the roof,\" he says.</p><p>We know AI technologies are getting better, including computer vision and natural language processing, all key capabilities for robots to function. But, Coplin says the power of these devices also depends on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/techandgadgets/robots-will-take-over-third-of-british-jobs-in-next-15-years-says-report-a3498056.html\">data</url> they have access to. Unlike industrial robots, whose insights are based on structured factory floors, domestic robots have to contend with the chaos of domestic life.</p><p>\"Every home is different, laid out in different ways and it changes every now and again. For a poor robot, it's quite tricky to navigate,\" he explains.</p><p>There are also concerns around giving a robot access to the information it needs to be helpful in the home. \"If you want a domestic robot in your home, it needs to access a lot of personal, private data in your home to work well. What kind of regulation should we have for that data?\" asks Coplin. To deal with this, he believes companies and governments need to work together to create the right kind of regulations, that will ensure humans benefit from the intelligence of robots in their homes but feel their private data is protected.</p><p>One in 10 UK households now own a smart speaker like the Google Home Mini(Google)</p><p>Once these issues are solved though, the potential for help from robots is enormous.</p><p>At the ILC conference, Waters said robots will have an emancipatory effect on humans. \"We should pose the question in a different way: when will we finally be able to relinquish the burden of work to AI and robots, so we can focus our problem solving on things that matter?,\" she asked.</p><p>In the Anki survey, it appears the British public is on board with the time-saving domestic robots could offer, with respondents imagining they could get two hours a day back with the help of a robot. Around 38 per cent said they wanted to use that time to have richer relationships with people inside the home, whilst 30 per cent said they would use the time for hobbies.</p><p>\"It's a counter-intuitive point to what people were expecting - you think these robots are going to disrupt us but actually they could enable us to become more human,\" says Coplin. \"If that's what we choose to do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTONL-50142813</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V08-FXX1-F021-648Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1028\"/><timeReceived>11:16 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>standard.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"27119\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

in the summer  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dominance of tech giants such as Facebook and Google in the UK's digital advertising market is preventing rivals from competing with them on \"equal terms\". </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is according to UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) which, in its 283-page interim report [PDF], suggests that the government should consider taking tougher measures to tackle the dominance of the online advertising giants.</p><p>Their dominance in online advertising is also slowly squeezing the life out of publishers and publications dependent upon advertising for their survival. </p><p>The comments from the UK's competition watchdog come amid recent reports claiming that the government is considering setting-up a new regulatory agency to oversee these businesses.</p><p>They are both now so large and have such extensive access to data that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms</p><p>According to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Financial Times</emphasis>, the new watchdog will have the power to implement a new code of conduct for large tech companies to provide more data accessibility for customers.</p><p>Google has generated nearly 90 per cent of UK search traffic each year over the past decade and also accounted for more than 90 per cent of UK search advertising revenues last year, according to the CMA.</p><p>Facebook, on the other hand, accounted for nearly 50 per cent of the \u00a35 billion in display advertising revenues in the UK in 2018.</p><p>\"We are concerned that they are both now so large and have such extensive access to data that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms,\" the watchdog said.</p><p>It is important that consumers have control over the use of their data</p><p>\"If competition in search and social media is not working well, this can lead to reduced innovation and choice in the future and to consumers giving up more data than they feel comfortable with.\"</p><p>The watchdog is also concerned that weak competition in online advertising market can increase the prices of services while also hurting the ability of newspapers to publish valuable content.</p><p>The CMA's market study was launched in July, a few weeks after the Authority published its own report raising privacy concerns around programmatic advertising by big tech firms.</p><p>The Authority will release a final report on the issue next summer, presenting final conclusions and recommendations for interventions.</p><p>The CMA said it is currently considering possible \"data access remedies\" and \"measures to increase interoperability and structural interventions\". </p><p>Forcing Google to separate its advertising unit from the rest of its business is another possible intervention that the data watchdog is considering.</p><p>\"It is important that consumers have control over the use of their data - allowing them to decide whether to provide or deny access and share it with others if they wish,\" CMA suggested.</p><p>\"This will benefit consumers directly and help increase competition between platforms,\" it added.</p><p>In July, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission published its final report on its 18-month inquiry into the impact of Facebook, Google, and other digital platforms on the day-to-day lives of the people in Australia.</p><p>In its report, the Australian watchdog recommended the creation of a new Digital Platforms Branch under its own supervision that would probe how tech firms use their algorithms to match ads with viewers, and whether they are using those algorithms to give precedence to their own products over that of rivals.</p><p>Last month, an online advertising company, called Inform, sued Google over anti-competitive practices that, it claimed, drove the company out of the industry.</p><p>The company accused Google of engaging in \"blatant and rampant coercive and anti-competitive activities\" to kill competition from rival firms. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The international investment community seems to think so, at least if sky-high tech valuations are any indication. But while that might be good news for the tech oligarchs, whether it is good for the economy is far from clear.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/>To be fair, the tech sector has been the United States\u2019 economic pride and joy in recent decades, a seemingly endless wellspring of innovation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The speed and power of Google\u2019s search engine is breathtaking, putting extraordinary knowledge at our fingertips. Internet telephony allows friends, relatives, and co-workers to interact face to face from halfway around the world, at very modest cost.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Yet, despite all this innovation, the pace of productivity growth in the broader economy remains lackluster. Many economists describe the current situation as a \u201csecond Solow moment,\u201d referring to legendary MIT economist Robert Solow\u2019s famous 1987 remark: \u201cYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are many reasons for slow productivity growth, not least a decade of low investment in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Still, one has to worry that the big five tech firms have become so dominant, so profitable, and so all-encompassing that it has become very difficult for startups to challenge them, thereby stifling innovation. Sure, once upon a time, upstarts Facebook and Google crushed Myspace and Yahoo. But that was before tech valuations soared into the stratosphere, giving entrenched players a massive funding advantage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks to their deep pockets, Big Tech can gobble up or squelch any new firm that threatens core profit lines, no matter how indirectly. Of course, an intrepid young entrepreneur can still spurn a buyout, but that is easier said than done. Not many people are brave enough (or foolish enough) to turn down a billion dollars today in hopes of much more later. And there is the risk that the tech giants will use their vast armies of programmers to develop a nearly identical product, and their vast legal resources to defend it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Big Tech firms might argue that all the capital they pour into new products and services is pushing innovation. One suspects, however, that in many circumstances the intent is to nip potential competition in the bud.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It is notable that Big Tech still derives most of its revenues from its companies\u2019 core products \u2014 for example, the Apple iPhone, Microsoft Office, and the Google search engine. Thus, in practice, potentially disruptive new technologies are as likely to be buried as nourished.<br/><br/><br/><br/>True, there are successes. The remarkable British artificial intelligence firm DeepMind, which Google purchased for US$400 million in 2014, seems to be plowing ahead. DeepMind is famous for developing the first world champion-beating Go program. But, by and large, DeepMind seems to be the exception.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Urgent intervention needed<br/><br/><br/><br/>The problem for regulators is that standard anti-monopoly frameworks do not apply in a world where the costs to consumers (mainly in the form of data and privacy) are thoroughly non-transparent. But that is a poor excuse for not challenging relatively obvious anti-competitive moves, such as when Facebook purchased Instagram (with its rapidly growing social network) or when Google bought its map competitor, Waze.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Perhaps the most urgent intervention is to weaken Big Tech\u2019s grip on our personal data, a grip that allows Google and Facebook to develop targeted advertising tools that are taking over the marketing business. European regulators are showing one possible path forward, even as US regulators continue to sit on their hands. The European Union\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation now requires firms to allow consumers \u2014 albeit only those in the EU \u2014 to port their data between providers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In their important recent book \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d economists Glen Weyl and Eric Posner go one step further and argue that Big Tech should have to pay for your data, instead of claiming it for their own use.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whereas the practicality of this remains to be seen, surely individual consumers should have a right to know which data of theirs is being collected and how it is being used.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, the US Congress and regulators need to rein in Big Tech in many other key areas as well. For example, Congress currently gives Internet-based firms a veritable free pass in promulgating fake news.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unless Big Tech platforms are held to standards that parallel those applied to print, radio, and television, in-depth reporting and fact-checking will remain dying arts. This is bad for both politics and the economy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Regulators and politicians in the homeland of Big Tech need to wake up. The prosperity of the US has always depended on its ability to harness economic growth to technology-driven innovation. But right now Big Tech is as much a part of the problem as it is a part of the solution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the IMF, is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University.

The international investment community seems to think so, at least if sky-high tech valuations are any indication. But while that might be good news for the tech oligarchs, whether it is good for the economy is far from clear.</p><p><br/><br/>To be fair, the tech sector has been the United States\u2019 economic pride and joy in recent decades, a seemingly endless wellspring of innovation.<br/><br/>The speed and power of Google\u2019s search engine is breathtaking, putting extraordinary knowledge at our fingertips. Internet telephony allows friends, relatives, and co-workers to interact face to face from halfway around the world, at very modest cost.<br/><br/>Yet, despite all this innovation, the pace of productivity growth in the broader economy remains lackluster. Many economists describe the current situation as a \u201csecond Solow moment,\u201d referring to legendary MIT economist Robert Solow\u2019s famous 1987 remark: \u201cYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\u201d<br/><br/>There are many reasons for slow productivity growth, not least a decade of low investment in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.<br/><br/>Still, one has to worry that the big five tech firms have become so dominant, so profitable, and so all-encompassing that it has become very difficult for startups to challenge them, thereby stifling innovation. Sure, once upon a time, upstarts Facebook and Google crushed Myspace and Yahoo. But that was before tech valuations soared into the stratosphere, giving entrenched players a massive funding advantage.<br/><br/>Thanks to their deep pockets, Big Tech can gobble up or squelch any new firm that threatens core profit lines, no matter how indirectly. Of course, an intrepid young entrepreneur can still spurn a buyout, but that is easier said than done. Not many people are brave enough (or foolish enough) to turn down a billion dollars today in hopes of much more later. And there is the risk that the tech giants will use their vast armies of programmers to develop a nearly identical product, and their vast legal resources to defend it.<br/><br/>Big Tech firms might argue that all the capital they pour into new products and services is pushing innovation. One suspects, however, that in many circumstances the intent is to nip potential competition in the bud.<br/><br/>It is notable that Big Tech still derives most of its revenues from its companies\u2019 core products \u2014 for example, the Apple iPhone, Microsoft Office, and the Google search engine. Thus, in practice, potentially disruptive new technologies are as likely to be buried as nourished.<br/><br/>True, there are successes. The remarkable British artificial intelligence firm DeepMind, which Google purchased for US$400 million in 2014, seems to be plowing ahead. DeepMind is famous for developing the first world champion-beating Go program. But, by and large, DeepMind seems to be the exception.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Urgent intervention needed<br/><br/><br/><br/>The problem for regulators is that standard anti-monopoly frameworks do not apply in a world where the costs to consumers (mainly in the form of data and privacy) are thoroughly non-transparent. But that is a poor excuse for not challenging relatively obvious anti-competitive moves, such as when Facebook purchased Instagram (with its rapidly growing social network) or when Google bought its map competitor, Waze.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most urgent intervention is to weaken Big Tech\u2019s grip on our personal data, a grip that allows Google and Facebook to develop targeted advertising tools that are taking over the marketing business. European regulators are showing one possible path forward, even as US regulators continue to sit on their hands. The European Union\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation now requires firms to allow consumers \u2014 albeit only those in the EU \u2014 to port their data between providers.<br/><br/>In their important recent book \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d economists Glen Weyl and Eric Posner go one step further and argue that Big Tech should have to pay for your data, instead of claiming it for their own use.<br/><br/>Whereas the practicality of this remains to be seen, surely individual consumers should have a right to know which data of theirs is being collected and how it is being used.<br/><br/>Of course, the US Congress and regulators need to rein in Big Tech in many other key areas as well. For example, Congress currently gives Internet-based firms a veritable free pass in promulgating fake news.<br/><br/>Unless Big Tech platforms are held to standards that parallel those applied to print, radio, and television, in-depth reporting and fact-checking will remain dying arts. This is bad for both politics and the economy.<br/><br/>Regulators and politicians in the homeland of Big Tech need to wake up. The prosperity of the US has always depended on its ability to harness economic growth to technology-driven innovation. But right now Big Tech is as much a part of the problem as it is a part of the solution.<br/><br/>Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the IMF, is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University.

But rather than pass a generally applicable privacy statute they should explore the possibility that strong privacy rules might be one policy response to the lack of competitive alternatives in markets controlled by the dominant technology companies.     This is what the  Federal Communications Commission  did in its now-repealed 2016 privacy rules for broadband providers. It\u2019s what the German  Federal Competition Office  did in its  recently-upheld  ruling that Facebook\u2019s extraction of certain information from its users that was an infringement on their privacy rights. Both made the special marketplace position of the companies involved central to their justification for these privacy actions.    A New Privacy Law for Dominant Tech Companies    These examples suggest that Congress should pass a new national privacy law with enhanced privacy duties for dominant technology companies.  This new law should follow the lead of the European Union\u2019s  General Data Protection Regulation  by requiring dominant tech companies to have a legal basis for data processing.  In particular, the new U.S. privacy law should require a dominant technology company in the U.S. to demonstrate that its data practices have the freely given consent of its users, are necessary to provide the services that its customers want, or are in its overriding legitimate interests.      In addition, Congress should adopt the recommendation of privacy scholar  Woodrow Harztag  to prohibit dominant technology companies from using technology designs that are unreasonably deceptive, abusive or dangerous. If a dominant technology company attempts to manipulate its customers through deceptive, abusive or dangerous technology designs, there is nowhere for these customers to go, even if they see through these harmful nudges and want to avoid them.      Congress should draw from  Jack Balkin\u2019s  work on information fiduciaries the requirement that dominant technology companies should have special duties of care, loyalty and confidentiality toward their customers.   If a dominant technology company is not bound by special duties of care, loyalty and confidentiality, it can exploit its customers\u2019 vulnerabilities without fear that they will flee to viable alternative providers.    Congressional lawmakers can also adapt the privacy statutes that prohibit certain data uses entirely such as banning the  sale of student data  and prohibiting the use of  financial account information  for marketing purposes.  Congress should provide for the possibility that dominant technology companies would not be permitted to use data at all for certain purposes.     An Industry-Specialist Regulator    Congress should consider the need for an industry-specialist regulator to ensure effective implementation and enforcement of the new privacy law for dominant technology companies.  Advocates have suggested such a specialist regulator in the different context of seeking to update competition law and policy to deal with the unique problems posed by digital platforms.   Jason Furman\u2019s report  for the government of the United Kingdom argued for a new digital markets unit in the UK government empowered to create special pro-competitive rules for platforms with strategic market position.  Harold Feld\u2019s report for Public Knowledge argues for a dedicated agency to regulate dominant digital platforms with authority to establish and enforce pro-competitive and information diversity rules.  Fiona Scott Morton  authored a report for the Stigler Center urging the creation of a Digital Authority, a specialist regulator with authority over digital platforms with bottleneck power, and able to prescribe a variety of pro-competitive rules for these companies.    One task of this specialist regulator would be to determine when technology companies are dominant in their field and so covered by the new statutory privacy.  The notion of a company holding a dominant position is familiar from the provision in European competition law prohibiting  the abuse of a dominant position .  The factors an agency could consider in making a determination of dominance include firm size, market share, strategic market position, cost of exclusion, bargaining power, and barriers to entry.     The agency should have authority to write implementing privacy regulations for dominant technology companies, enforce them through fines, penalties and injunctions, and update them for changes in technology and business practices. A specialist privacy regulator with authority over technology companies would be best positioned to make the difficult decisions in interpreting, applying and enforcing the new privacy duties.     The new privacy law should not define the technology sector, since it is difficult to think of the many lines of business engaged in by companies labeled \u201cbig tech\u201d as a single sector.  Instead, the proposed new law should name the specific lines of business covered by the enhanced privacy requirements.  A partial list of the covered lines of business might include social media, search, video platforms, and electronic marketplaces, given the centrality of these services to contemporary life and the persistent failure of competition in their markets.     The regulatory agency enforcing the new privacy rules for dominant tech companies could also have the pro-competitive responsibilities advocated by Furman, Feld and Scott Morton.  This agency\u2019s goal of promoting privacy would be a separate and distinct agency objective over and above any mission to promote competition or to accomplish other public policy objectives such as to oversee social media content moderation efforts.  But a single agency might be able to do several jobs.     Congress might consider as an attractive model for tech company privacy regulation the sector-specific comprehensive regulatory approach of the Federal Communications Commission rather than the generalist enforcement approach of the Federal Trade Commission.     Congress Needs to Go Beyond Promoting Competition    In his assessment of using the antitrust laws as currently understood and practiced to hold Internet platforms accountable, antitrust practitioner  Phil Verveer  concludes \u201c[d]escribing the considerations involved in deploying the antitrust laws against internet platform power raises the question\u2014a very significant question\u2014of whether it would be better to look elsewhere for such assurances.\u201d    Jason Furman, Harold Feld and Fiona Scott Morton devised similar approaches to moving beyond the traditional antitrust objective of preserving competition to a more activist goal of promoting and fostering competitive alternatives in markets where they would never survive on their own.  Fostering entry by new competitors into markets dominated by single larger firms is the new goal of an invigorated and updated competition policy for the digital age. As Jason Furman says, \u201cEnsuring that competition is vibrant requires ensuring that there are competitors.\u201d    The effort is worthwhile and has to be undertaken.  It might even be that the right sort of data rules, as  Harold Feld  and  I  have argued (separately), are needed to promote competition in key markets such as electronic marketplaces. But it is important to be clear-eyed: competition might never arrive. The accumulated advantages of dominant technology companies might be insuperable by any reasonable expenditure of competition agency resources.  This is certainly the lesson of attempts to insert competition into the telecommunications industry.    As a result, policymakers need to go beyond promoting competition to dominant technology companies.  They need to actively regulate them to promote other policy goals in addition to competition.      This article has focused on privacy as one of those additional policy goals.  But it has absorbed the lesson that competition policy teaches, namely that dominant companies are very different from companies that seek to flourish in competitive markets. They have power over their customers that creates the opportunity for abuse.  As  Adolf A. Berle  said 70 years ago, \u201cConcentration means either no choice or a very limited choice of suppliers of such goods or services. By reason of such a limited choice, the members of the concentrate acquire power substantially to invade constitutionally-created rights of personality.\u201d  Privacy is one such non-economic right of personality. It would be foolish to assume that dominant companies would always resist the temptation to use their power to harm their customers\u2019 privacy rights.      For that reason, this article seeks to impose on these extraordinarily powerful companies some powerful privacy duties with the aim of curbing their power to extract information from their customers that they would be unable to extract under competitive market conditions.  Requiring dominant companies to demonstrate that their data practices are justified by consumer consent, contractual necessity or legitimate interest, requiring them to abide by special duties of care, loyalty and confidentiality, prohibiting them from using technology designs that are unreasonably deceptive, abusive or dangerous, and perhaps barring specific data uses - all these are needed to protect consumers when they have restricted choices of alternative providers.    Other considerations might lead to the conclusion that these privacy duties are also important to protect privacy interests under all market conditions.  The measures recommended here for dominant technology companies were developed for and in some cases are already enforced against companies generally.  Still other considerations might indicate that these extraordinary duties are appropriate only for dominant companies and have no place in privacy regulation of other companies. In this post, I stay out of those discussions, insisting only that these privacy duties are needed at least for dominant technology companies.     Tough-minded antitrust advocates like  Tim Wu  warn us against special regulations that leave monopoly power in place, saying \u201c[i]f today\u2019s privacy scandals lead us merely to install Facebook as a regulated monopolist, insulated from competition, we will have failed completely.\u201d  But the alternative might be unregulated monopolists.  While policymakers work toward the goal of more fully competitive technology markets, they should also pass a national privacy statute with enhanced privacy duties for dominant technology companies.     More detail on this proposal can be found  here  in a paper I prepared for this year\u2019s Privacy Law Scholars Conference in May.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42776831400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HX-S4N1-JCSC-J0KB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjYyRTk3QUVFRjk4NDVGMkI0REI0NDA4NTUzRDY5NDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDk0RkJCOUQ5NEFCNDE2N0EzRUE0QzU2RUFBOEEzRTI</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUMwRjNCRUQ4NUI2NEIwMkI1RTcyRUEzRDgxMEZCMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REJGNjMzRTJDMDRGNDM0Mjg3QjAxNTE2MDU2RjlDMDY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The Request for Proposals (RFP) stems from Virginia's Grid Transformation ...curity Act, which went into effect in July. In a plan tied to the law, Dominion will develop 3 gigawatts of clean energy by 2022. The RFP is the first of several expected announcements for large-scale renewable resources from the utility. </p><p>Taken together, the 3 gigawatts of renewables positions Virginia as one of the top growth markets for utility-scale solar over the next five years, according to Wood Mackenzie Power ...newables. 'This is an impressive RFP. It's not the biggest RFP that's been issued, but it's basically kicking off what is one of the more ambitious solar procurement plans that's a product of an integrated resource planning process,' said Cory Honeyman, head of solar research at WoodMac. 'It's also a product of deeming solar to be a least-cost, best-fit alternative to new-build natural gas.' The RFP follows Dominion's acquisition this summer of 240 megawatts of solar in Virginia from Urban Grid. The utility is also developing a 12-megawatt offshore wind demonstration. At the same time, Dominion's 2018 Integrated Resource Plan noted the \"continued importance\" of natural gas and included potential development of over 3.6 gigawatts of combustion turbine capacity by 2033. Virginia's Grid Transformation ...curity Act allows utilities to collect and spend ratepayer money to modernize the state's grid, including projects that focus on renewables and energy efficiency. Prior to the bill's passage, state regulators dismissed a Dominion pitch[1] to offer 100 percent renewable energy plans to large electricity offtakers like commercial and industrial customers. Third-party power purchase agreements are not fully legal in Virginia, but a 2017 ruling from the State Corporation Commission allowed Direct Energy to provide such plans until utilities in the state offer it. Because regulators shut down Dominion's attempt to offer such plans, the door remains open for third-parties to provide them. Honeyman said the state's third-party limbo could be viewed as a barrier for corporate customers who want access to large-scale, onsite solar. But he also expects Dominion to seek approval for a revamped plan. The utility has already created tariffs for companies, like Facebook and Amazon[2], with high clean energy goals and could eventually redirect its new solar capacity to serve those customers. 'It's reasonable to expect that they'll plan to make other proposals and the additional procurement of larger scale solar projects to meet their resource planning requirements,' said Honeyman. 'In the best-case scenario, [Dominion] is able to successfully repurpose a portion of those projects to market a 'green tariff' offering to corporate customers that are siting data centers and other large industrial load facilities in Dominion's territory.' Lining up renewables that could be funneled towards large corporates makes sense in a state with companies pressuring[3] the utility to offer more clean power. According toAdvanced Energy Economy[4] (AEE), Virginia ranks 12th in the nation for large C...lectricity use. Virginia's cheap rates make it a magnet for data centers. Dominion said[5] it has worked with Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon[6] to provide them the clean energy they want to power operations. Currently 260 megawatts of Dominion's total[7] 656 megawatts of solar in operation or under construction supply Amazon property. Earlier this month, Dominion also sent out a survey to 'key accounts customers' in the commercial and industrial sectors to identify what they want from an energy provider and how the utility can work with customers towards achieving clean energy goals.  \"As many businesses and organizations in Virginia establish or expand clean energy and sustainability goals, Dominion Energy is proud to be a trusted energy partner,\" said Corynne Arnett, Dominion's vice president of customer service, in a statement announcing that survey. \"This information will help us adapt renewable programs to meet customer needs as we grow our renewable generation fleet.\" In many states, clean energy tariffs like those offered in Virginia require customers to pay a premium for renewable power. Analysis from AEE shows that some Dominion offerings include a premium. Both AEE and Honeyman note that, as Dominion's investment in clean energy grows, the industry will also be watching how it structures offerings for C...ustomers. Though tech companies with big balance sheets and sustainability goals may be willing to pay extra for clean power, Honeyman said there are still questions about the economic competitiveness of green tariff programs. With this RFP, he said, Dominion has already affirmed solar is cost-competitive. It remains less clear how that will impact corporate customers, though Dominion said the 'RFP certainly is integral to our information gathering efforts' related to those customers.

La France vient d'adopter la loi Avia, qui entend privatiser la r\u00e9gulation de la libert\u00e9 d'expression sur Internet, en d\u00e9l\u00e9guant le contr\u00f4le des propos illicites aux plateformes en ligne, rompant ainsi avec plus de deux si\u00e8cles de tradition r\u00e9galienne, qui n'accordait cette pr\u00e9rogative qu'\u00e0 l'\u00c9tat et \u00e0 son autorit\u00e9 judiciaire.  L'Am\u00e9rique est aussi le th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'un combat aussi in\u00e9dit que spectaculaire entre Donald Trump et Jack Dorsey, patron de Twitter, autour de ce qui est devenu, au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, un angle mort de la d\u00e9mocratie. \u00c0 savoir, le d\u00e9placement du d\u00e9bat politique et de la lutte id\u00e9ologique sur des plateformes priv\u00e9es qui, souvent en toute impunit\u00e9, administrent, trient, promeuvent, suppriment et manipulent l'information comme bon leur semble, quand elles ne confient pas cette mission \u00e0 d'obscurs algorithmes. </p><p> Aux \u00c9tats-Unis, la multiplication de scandales visant les r\u00e9seaux sociaux n'a pas cess\u00e9 de diviser le pays. Pendant longtemps, rien n'est venu d\u00e9ranger un consensus d\u00fbment acquis sous la forme d'un pacte de non-agression tacite, bien que fragile. Trump a eu beau r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement attaquer les agissements des r\u00e9seaux sociaux en les mena\u00e7ant de renforcer leur contr\u00f4le, il utilise ces m\u00eames r\u00e9seaux sociaux sans \u00eatre censur\u00e9.  Immunit\u00e9 presque totale. Il faut rappeler qu'en 1996, lorsque le Congr\u00e8s avait adopt\u00e9 le Communications Decency Act et sa section 230 visant particuli\u00e8rement les entreprises de la \" Big Tech \", l'id\u00e9e \u00e9tait de faire peser une responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale sur les plateformes Internet et de les traiter non pas en simples h\u00e9bergeurs de contenus mais en \u00e9diteurs, afin de s'assurer que leur politique de mod\u00e9ration ne s'\u00e9loigne pas trop de l'esprit et de la lettre du premier amendement. Vingt-cinq ans plus tard, les innombrables proc\u00e8s et les centaines de millions de frais d'avocats d\u00e9bours\u00e9s par les Gafa ont eu raison de cette section 230, d\u00e9natur\u00e9e \u00e0 coups de jurisprudences, au point d'offrir une immunit\u00e9 presque totale \u00e0 toutes les plateformes.  Or, sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain, le pr\u00e9sident a le pouvoir de proposer, souvent sous la forme d'un d\u00e9cret pr\u00e9sidentiel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(executive order</emphasis>), une interpr\u00e9tation de la loi concurrente \u00e0 celle des juges, \u00e0 condition que la loi en question ne soit pas <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" claire \"</emphasis>et que l'interpr\u00e9tation du chef de l'\u00c9tat soit <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" raisonnable \"</emphasis>. Ainsi, lorsque le 26 mai 2020, pour la premi\u00e8re fois de son histoire, Twitter d\u00e9cide d'accoler un avertissement de fake news \u00e0 un tweet de Trump qui s'en prend au gouverneur d\u00e9mocrate de Californie, Jack Dorsey sait qu'il joue avec le feu. La r\u00e9ponse ne s'est pas fait attendre. Le 28 mai, Trump promulgue un d\u00e9cret qui d\u00e9nonce la <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" censure s\u00e9lective \"</emphasis>\u00e0 laquelle s'adonnent les plateformes Internet, notamment Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, au m\u00e9pris du premier amendement, il enjoint \u00e0 l'administration d'enqu\u00eater sur leurs pratiques<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" d\u00e9loyales et mensong\u00e8res \"</emphasis>et de repenser leur responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d'une r\u00e9interpr\u00e9tation de la section 230.  D\u00e9fiance pathologique envers l'\u00c9tat. Si le d\u00e9cret pr\u00e9sidentiel est valid\u00e9 par les juges, les \" Big Tech \" seront tenues l\u00e9galement responsables de tout affichage, promotion, modification ou alt\u00e9ration de contenu qu'elles pratiquent. Le lendemain, Dorsey a accol\u00e9 un nouvel avertissement pour <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" incitation \u00e0 la violence \"</emphasis>\u00e0 un tweet de Trump sur les \u00e9meutes qui embrasent l'Am\u00e9rique \u00e0 la suite du meurtre de George Floyd. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" When the looting starts, the shooting starts \"</emphasis>(D\u00e8s que le pillage commence, les tirs commencent) : il appelait l'arm\u00e9e \u00e0 intervenir.  Tandis que les \u00e9lites glorifient Jack Dorsey, promu h\u00e9ros national et rempart ultime \u00e0 l'obscurantisme, Mark Zuckerberg, le patron de Facebook, d\u00e9clare que, malgr\u00e9 les pressions ext\u00e9rieures et les d\u00e9missions en interne largement publicis\u00e9es, il se refusera \u00e0 toute forme de censure, qui contreviendrait \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e qu'il se fait de la libert\u00e9 d'expression. L'Am\u00e9rique se fissure sur un th\u00e8me qui, hier, emportait l'adh\u00e9sion de tous.  Le libre march\u00e9 des id\u00e9es, miroir du libre march\u00e9 des capitaux, \u00e9tait une partie indissociable du r\u00eave am\u00e9ricain. Il est aujourd'hui remis en question par ceux qui se veulent les \" vrais \" d\u00e9fenseurs de la d\u00e9mocratie. Ce qu'ils semblent occulter, c'est que leur d\u00e9fiance pathologique envers l'\u00c9tat en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et Trump en particulier, les condamne \u00e0 confier le d\u00e9bat politique, et donc le destin de la nation, \u00e0 des rejetons de la Silicon Valley. C'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 chose faite en France, o\u00f9 le d\u00e9sengagement de l'\u00c9tat n'est qu'une preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire de sa faillite </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LPOINT-2495361134892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LPOINT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605G-S0P1-F03G-D524-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266080</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Le Point Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Le Point</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19709\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>18 Juin 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Graham Special to the Washington Post</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problems at Facebookand others, real and perceived, at Google, Amazon and Apple have led to an easy consensus:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The large technology companies should be regulated. When Sens. <person><nameText>Ted Cruz, R-Texas, </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., </nameText></person>call for the same thing, it is possible that even in Washington - The City Where Nothing Happens - Congress will decide that technology companies must be regulated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Such an outcome would be a bad mistake - bad for the companies, of course, but also bad for us, their users, and bad for the country.</p><p> I do not pretend to be unbiased in writing this. While I am about as tech-savvy as your average 72-year-old, I met Mark Zuckerberg when he was 20, and spent six years on Facebook's board. As publisher and later chairman of The Post, I watched the rise of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, sometimes with hope, sometimes with awe and sometimes with horror for what it meant to The Post's business.</p><p> To start with the basics: The big technology companies ought to obey the laws that apply to all businesses. They should pay their taxes and comply with antitrust laws.</p><p> If they make mistakes, they should admit them quickly and act transparently to fix them. Facebook, in particular, faces a huge challenge in convincing its users that they can trust it to safeguard their data.</p><p> So why not regulate these companies more? First: Googleand Facebookare platforms where a great deal of today's political speech and reporting of news takes place, and regulation is an inherently political act.</p><p> If you want a Technology Company Regulation Commission, its chairman and its members will be appointed by presidents and will reflect their policies.</p><p> Do presidents really play a role in regulation or enforcement? Well, you can listen to the Watergate tapes and hear President <person><nameText>Richard Nixon </nameText></person>direct his advisers John Dean and H.R. Haldeman to use the Federal Communications Commission's regulatory process to take away TV stations owned by The Washington Post Co.</p><p> Challenges to stations' licenses by Nixon supporters did ensue and, had Nixon not resigned, they would have been heard by an FCC led by the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. It is difficult to convince me that regulation is apolitical.</p><p> If you want Google, Facebookand other tech companies regulated, you are asking for a system in which President Trump - or (perhaps in the future) President <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>- plays a role in deciding what goes on your Facebookpage or what flows from your Googlesearch. Is that really what you want?</p><p> And how do you argue that government should be able to regulate speech on YouTube but not your own speech, or that of The Post?</p><p> Second: I worked in regulated industries for years, and regulation can be fairly described as odd. Regulators often do not or cannot talk face-to-face with those being regulated to understand the consequences of what they are doing.</p><p> The conversation is conducted through lawyers on both sides. Is there a set of regulators in Washington who would understand how Googleor Facebookis put together?</p><p>Facebookand Googleargue they have one goal in their principal businesses: Innovating to satisfy their customers. Regulation introduces a different goal: Not offending the regulators.</p><p> Technology companies must move fast; regulation slows things down, sometimes drastically. Almost inevitably, this hurts a company's performance.</p><p> Money, time and, above all, management attention that might be focused on innovation and satisfying customers are focused elsewhere.</p><p> From the day it began accepting advertising, Facebookhas walked a line, sometimes carefully, sometimes not. It promised advertisers the ability to target ads at users who were interested in their products; it promised users that their data would be private.</p><p> Careful compromises should have been able to maintain trust with both sets of users.</p><p> The most important control over Facebook- greater than anything governments could come up with - is the ability of its users to quit.</p><p> Zuckerberg has a huge incentive to keep our data private and to prove that Facebookhas done so (the standards that permitted Cambridge Analytica to access user data were changed three years ago).</p><p>Facebookneeds to go to any possible length to convince its irritated users that it can be trusted.</p><p> Taken together, the big tech companies constitute a rare area where America leads the world. If you don't believe they are important to the country, look at how they are treated elsewhere.</p><p> In Europe, the home of many unsuccessful competitors, they are fined and regulated not because they are lawbreakers, but because they are American.</p><p> And in China, Facebookand Google- as well as Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia - are banned because they encourage free speech and free thought.</p><p> Instead, the Chinese have created massive competitors such as Tencent and Baidu, sheltered from Western competition in their enormous home market.</p><p> If Googleand Facebookslow down - remember that most of the world's users are outside the United States - these competitors will easily pass them by.</p><p> Will it be an aid to your privacy to search on Baidu or share on Tencent? I don't think so.</p><p> I hope the technology companies are wise enough to take the measures needed to convince users that they care about their privacy.</p><p> And I hope our country is wise enough not to regulate them.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald E.

And it does seem there is no limit to  this market, except that you and I have been around long enough to know  what goes up can also come crashing down.</p><p>So, is there a fundamental reason why this market, Maggie, is in fifth  gear, or should we be concerned about the sort of nasties of irrational  exuberance, as it were? </p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN MONEY:  I don't think we're at the point of irrational  exuberance, Becky, but you're right to raise that question.  And I have  been doing so with everyone I have talked  to as well.  Because listen, this has come so far so fast, and it hasn't  taken any pause, really, or any kind of consolidation.</p><p>There are some fundamental reasons behind this.  Earnings were better.   We're just coming through the tail end of the earnings season.  They were  better than expected.  The economy isn't where people want it, but it's  steady.  Consumer confidence is high, wages are increasing, the fed is  sounding more confident.  Those are all real reasons.  Do they justify this  rally?  No.  It is one that's billed on what one trader yesterday said to  me is hopium, the hope that they're going to get the fulfillment of these  promises that Donald Trump has made.</p><p>And right now, they're willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>They didn't hear a lot of details in the speech last night that guarantee  those things will happen.  It's early days.  but what they did see, and I  think this is what they're responding to today, is that change in tone.   Yes, it is just style right now, but it indicates that maybe, just maybe,  this deal making potential to bring people together in unified businessman  Donald Trump is emerging as the person who will lead the country, rather  than the divisive tweeting Donald Trump.</p><p>That made investors very uncomfortable.  This is what they like to see.  </p><p>So, I think in this case, that tone is really driving what we're seeing  today.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, when he talks fair trade, not free trade, and you consider  those companies that are in this index who will mostly be global companies,  they're not concerned about where he goes next so far as this more  protectionist stance is concerned, it's more about this sort of reduction  in regulation, is it, that will suit business going forward?</p><p>LAKE:  They're terribly concerned about free trade.  They're concerned  about free trade.  They're concerned about frankly some of the foreign  policy stances.  They're concerned about immigration.  They're concerned  about the visa programs.  There's a lot they're concerned about.</p><p>But they care about the tax reform, regulation, and I think that they are  still hanging on to the idea that these very, sort of again, inflammatory  comments coming on trade are a negotiating stance.  They're the beginning.   I had a guest on last hour saying this, and that somewhere, once that  happens, this is just his negotiating style.  And they will end up  somewhere up closer in the middle and there will be room to compromise and  do business with trading partners.</p><p>Is that realistic?  We don't know.  Again, it is the hope and the dream  that is the case.  But that seems to be what they are betting on.</p><p>A concrete indication of something otherwise would cause a lot of scare in  the market and  in the business community.  I see some reverse some of theses gains that we  have seen, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yeah, watch this space.</p><p>Always a pleasure.  Thank you.</p><p>Maggie in the house for you on what is breaking news this hour.  </p><p>21,052 is where that index stands at present.</p><p>Well, Donald Trump says from now on America will be empowered by  aspirations, not burdened by fears.  The U.S. president looked to inspire a  nation with his first address to congress, reaching beyond political  divides to call for unity.  And he left the combative rhetoric behind,  staying on script as he struck a statesmanlike tone.</p><p>Senior Washington correspondent Joe Johns begins our coverage this hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Trump striking a more  presidential and optimistic tone... </p><p>TRUMP:  I'm here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength. </p><p>JOHNS: ... in his hour-long speech to a joint session of Congress. </p><p>TRUMP:  It is a message deeply delivered from my heart. </p><p>JOHNS:  Off the top, the president condemning the surge in hate crimes  since he took office. </p><p>TRUMP:  Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of  Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind  us that, while we may be a nation divided in policies, we are a country  that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly  forms. </p><p>JOHNS: Spending much of his speech laying out an ambitious agenda. </p><p>TRUMP: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. </p><p>JOHNS: His solution: an echo from his campaign, \"America first.\" </p><p>TRUMP: Buy American and hire American. </p><p>JOHNS: And once again, using national security as the basis for his  proposed border wall with Mexico. </p><p>TRUMP: We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an  environment of lawless chaos. </p><p>We will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our  southern border. </p><p>JOHNS: The president touting his deportation efforts of undocumented people  with criminal convictions.</p><p>TRUMP: We are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that  threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. </p><p>JOHNS: And defending his controversial travel ban, halted by a federal  court weeks ago. </p><p>TRUMP: It is not compassion but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from  places where proper vetting cannot occur. </p><p>JOHNS: But signaling that he might be open to compromise on immigration. </p><p>TRUMP: I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible. </p><p>JOHNS: The president told network news anchors before the speech that he's  open to a legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants if they  never committed a crime. </p><p>TRUMP: I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an  outcome that has eluded our country for decades. </p><p>JOHNS: On health care, the president laying out five points for a plan to  replace Obamacare.</p><p>TRUMP: We should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have  access to coverage. </p><p>JOHNS: Arguing that people should be able to buy insurance across state  lines and leaning on tax credits to ensure that Americans can afford their  premiums. </p><p>TRUMP: It must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our  government.</p><p>JOHNS: The president also announcing a huge plan to boost the nation's  infrastructure. </p><p>TRUMP: I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1  trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed  through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs. </p><p>JOHNS: On the war against ISIS, the president using this controversial  reference. </p><p>TRUMP: Radical Islamic terrorism. </p><p>JOHNS: Even though sources say his new national security adviser urged him  not to use \"radical Islamic terrorism\" in his speech, because it alienates  Muslims.</p><p>TRUMP: Extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. </p><p>JOHNS: The president ending his speech with a very emotional moment,  honoring the widow of Ryan Owens, a Navy SEAL killed last month in Yemen,  saying he was part of a highly successful terror raid. </p><p>TRUMP: Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he's very happy,  because I think he just broke a record.</p><p>For the Bible teaches us there's no greater act of love than to lay down  one's life for one's friends. </p><p>JOHNS:  Joe Johns, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON:  What that emotional tribute to the Navy SEAL who was killed and  his widow was the most moving moment of the night.  Here is how a CNN  political commentator and frequent critic of president Donald Trump  described it. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  He became president of the United  States in that moment.  Period.  There are a lot of people who have a lot  of reason to be frustrated with him, to be fearful of him, to be mad at  him, but that was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen  in American politics.  Period. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, the Yemen raid had been in the works for awhile, but it  was Mr. Trump who approved it just days after taking office.</p><p>In an interview with Fox, he emphasized the roles other played in planning  the mission and appeared to put responsibility on his generals for the Navy  SEAL's death.  Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  The mission was started before I got here.  This was something that  was - you know, just - they wanted to do.  They came to see me.  They  explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected.  My  generals are the most respected than we have had in many decades, I  believe.  And they lost Ryan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON:  I'm joined now by our CNN, senior international correspondent  Clarissa Ward.  Let's talk about this speech.</p><p>As Van Jones, one of Donald Trump's most outspoken critics said this was  the moment that Donald Trump became president.  What's your perspective?</p><p>CLARISSA WARD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's so interesting  to hear people on both sides of the political divide, seemingly for the  first time in months, come together in unison and say this was a water  mark.  This was a shift.  We did hear something from President Trump last  night that we really haven't heard before.  It was much less combative in  tone.  It was much more moderate, much more sober, much more somber.  He  was apparently reaching across the aisle, talking about the need for  political cooperation between the two different parties.  He alluded to the  battle that he will face in congress when it comes to this huge amount of  money he wants to allocate to military spending, when it comes to the huge  sums that he wants to allocate to rebuilding America's infrastructure.</p><p>So I think it was really one of the first times that we have heard  President Trump really sound  like a president.  And he was sticking to that script, Becky.  He was  reading from that teleprompter.  And we did not see any of the kind of more  freewheeling shoot from the hip kind of rhetoric that has so often gotten  him into trouble in the past.</p><p>ANDERSON:  You alluded to the investment in military spending an historic,  $54 brillion, I think, if I'm correct in saying.  Clearly that money speaks  to the president counter terror efforts.  We have been promised a plane to  defeat ISIS.  Are we any clearer to knowing when that plane will be  revealed and what it might say?</p><p>WARD:  Well, we are not really closer to that.  I mean, we are sort  ardently waiting to see what  the Secretary of Defense James Mattis is waiting to propose.</p><p>We know that there are a number of different options on the table.  One of  them even includes having U.S. military troops on the ground in Syria,  which is a very controversial idea for many different reasons.  And we know  that this massive amount, as you said $54 billion, will essentially be  at  the military's disposal to try to facilitate I believe President Trump  talked about extinguishing ISIS.</p><p>In reality, any one of us who has spent a lot of time on the ground in the  Middle East, in Syria particularly and watching the battle against ISIS,  you start to understand that ISIS is a symptom.  IT's not the cause.  And  that if you are only using a military track in order to defeat ISIS and you  are kind of not paying attention to all the contributing geopolitical and  social factors that conflate together to create groups like ISIS, then you  are going to find yourself back at square one again in no time at all.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Have to spent a lot of time on the ground in the Middle East,  particularly in Syria over the last decade.  You have in the past month  also spent a considerable amount of time reporting on Mr. Trump and his  positions in regard Russia.  You've been in Moscow.  Given what we heard  last night, clearly there is, I think it would be safe to say, an effort by  the administration to move I think it would be safe to say that an effort  by the administration to move on.</p><p>Did he achieve that?  Are we over Russia at this point?</p><p>WARD:  Well, I think it's become such a political hot potato in the U.S.,  that it's difficult to talk about moving past this.  And while he did not  mention Russia in his speech last night, there was the kind of the hanging  presence of Russia all around.  </p><p>I just want to draw your attention to one thing he said, where he talked  about the importance of finding new friends and forging new partnerships  where interests align.</p><p>And he talked about being friends with former enemies.  It was hard for  anyone who covers foreign policy listening to that not to think hold on a  second he's talking about Russia here, because he does have this adamant  belief that the U.S. and Russia can forge a meaningful partnership.  </p><p>But as long as he is trying to pushing that partnership forward, he is  going to face questioning from within his own party and certainly from  within the Democratic Party about what his real ties to Russia may be and  how they possibly could have influenced the election, Becky.</p><p>[10:15:13] ANDERSON:  Always a pleasure.  Thanks.  Clarissa Ward for you.</p><p>We didn't really hear anything about the White House's plans to slash it's  foreign aid budget in last night's speech, but it is an important story  that could affect all of us, even those of us in the world's richest  countries.</p><p>In about 10 minutes, we're going to break it all down for you with a  fantastic guest in Washington.  So do stay with us for that.</p><p>Well, unrelenting violence, war crimes committed by all sides and attacks  intentionally terrorizing civilians, a new and blistering UN Human Rights  Council report blames all sides in the  Syria civil war for targeting civilians and causing widespread carnage in  Aleppo.  But it saves it's most damning accusations for Russia and Syria.   It accuses pro-government forces of carrying out daily, deadly airstrikes  using chemical weapons, summary executions of rebels, and the forced  displacement of civilians.  </p><p>Well, Nina Dos Santos is reviewing the report for us.  She is standing by  in Istanbul -- Nina.</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks so much, Becky.</p><p>Yes, well, it's a damning report.  They're trying to be balanced her.  And  they do level accusations against both sides.  Let's start with some of the  most damning accusations that you ran  through there, Becky, particularly  in eastern Aleppo.  The United States accuses the Assad regime ther  civilians will be caught up in the conflict and that they had scant access  to enough resources like food and also water.  </p><p>And then it goes on to say that daily sorties, daily bombardments by  Russian and Syrian air strikes, shattered what little infrastructure was  left there, in particular targeting things like hospitals, which the  wounded needed so badly, but also food supplies like, for instance,  bakeries that were servicing the city as well, but really most damning is  the use of banned chemical weapons, in particular chlorine bombs, which are  used as well as cluster bombs with increasing frequency during the period  of September 2016.  </p><p>I should mention that this report in particular takes a look into the use  of certain types of weapons throughout the period of summer of 2016 right  until December 2016 when eastern Aleppo, which is held by the rebels  eventually fell.</p><p>And then they go on to say that the people who were in eastern Aleppo were  then forcibly evacuated to other parts of Syria, some of the civilians to  western Aleppo, some of them to Idlib as well.</p><p>But when we're talking about also the rebels, well, they do come in for  stiff criticism as well, in particular the use of what it calls  indiscriminate shelling of western parts of Aleppo where they knew that  civilians would be there.  This was supposedly two, quote, unquote,  terrorize the local population that's killed many women and children.  And  it also says that when it comes back to eastern Aleppo.  indiscriminate  shelling of western Aleppo when the civilians tried desperately to flee.   The UN report accuses the rebels of holding them back as human shields,  Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Nina Dos Santos is reporting for you from Istanbul today.  Nina,  thank you.</p><p>Still to come, we are finding out how Donald Trump wants to spend taxpayers  dollars.  But what about the sense?  Well, we look at how some of his  biggest planned cuts could affect all of us.  The details up next.</p><p>Plus, Canada's prime minister has been known to welcome refugees  personally.  We look at how his country is also rolling out the red carpet  for foreign students.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:21:04] ANDERSON:  You're back with Connect the World.  20 past 3:00  here in London.  I'm Becky Anderson.  Welcome back to the show.</p><p>Donald Trump's first speech before congress getting the predictable mixed  reviews from politicians, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called this  speech a home run.</p><p>But in the official Democratic response, the former governor of Kentucky  slammed the president.</p><p>But let's hear from the people.  CNN's Tom Foreman has reaction from  thousands of Americans who watched the speech at home.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  More than 39,000 people cast about 15  million votes moment to moment, telling us what they thought of the speech.  The line goes up if they like it, down if they don't. Democrats in blue,  independents in purple, Republicans in red. </p><p>And the president had them all pointing the right direction early on, when  he talked about hate crimes. Watch the lines. </p><p>TRUMP: Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of  Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind  us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that  stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>FOREMAN: That is what any president would want. Look, everybody's clustered  together here, up in the positive territory. </p><p>But these moments were very hard to come by, especially when he talked  about policy. Yes, they agreed when he talked about helping out veterans.  Yes, they agreed a little bit when he talked about jobs. We saw plenty of  area where is they disagreed, particularly on policy, and particularly when  he brought up Obamacare. </p><p>Watch the lines. </p><p>TRUMP: Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace  Obamacare. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>FOREMAN: Yes, big applause line in the room. They all jump up. But, look,  Democrats hated it. Independents didn't like it. Interestingly, the  Republicans in our sample, look at that, they're falling off, too. </p><p>At no point did these lines ever cross. Democrats never liked it more than  independents. Independents never liked it more than the Republicans. And  interestingly enough, men always liked what he had to say more than women  did. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, America spends more on helping out other people than any  other country.  Its current foreign aid budget soars well above $40 billion  a year.  But that's just a tiny fraction of Washington's total spending,  just about 1 percent of it, in fact.  All that cash goes to everything from helping other country's economies, to humanitarian relief, to military  help or now a lot of it, could be about to vanish, because U.S. President  Donald Trump wants to take cash from elsewhere in America's accounts and  pump it into the country's already formidable military budget.  We have  been discussing this earlier on today.</p><p>Let's break down what all of that then could mean with Tom Hart.  He's in  charge of North America for one, an organization working to end extreme  poverty.  And he's with us now live from Washington.</p><p>And Tom, it's not clear yet how swinging (ph) these cuts will be to foreign  aid, but it does seem evident they are likely to be fairly severe.</p><p>You've been around the world of said in Africa for years.  Who and what  would suffer?</p><p>TOM HART, NORTH AMERICAN EXECTUIVE DIRECTOR, ONE:  Well, the proposed cuts  that we're hearing sort of 30 percent and 40 percent cuts to foreign said  would be devastating.  This is not a proposal rooted in what programs are  working would be about eliminating programs and really putting in jeopardy  people who depend on life saving assistance like anti-retroviral medicines  for HIV/AIDS, food assistance for people in famine, bed nets for people  fighting malaria, and anti-corruption measures.  So this would be a very,  very damaging proposal.</p><p>ANDERSON : Tom, in his book, \"The White Man's Burden,\" economist William  Easterly estimates that the west spent more than $2 trillion on aid in 50  years and that it's done little good, lambasting it as a, and I quote him,  mistaken approach to tackling world poverty.  Is there a case to answer  him, that aid, especially in Africa, promotes a perpetual dependency on  itself?</p><p>HART:  You know, I really disagree with that.  You know, extreme poverty  has been cut  around the world, in half in the last 20 years.  We've - the United States  has actually led the way in  combating preventable diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria and other  diseases.  Aid has really undergone a revolution, particularly the way the  United States does it in the lat 15, 20 years where it is driven by  results, it is transparent and it is working in partnership with African  governments and partners on the ground.  </p><p>So, I really do think that it's doing a tremendous amount of good.  And  cutting it back like this would do nothing but harm.  </p><p>ANDERSON : And let me just speak to what you have just said, because, you  know, Donald Trump's attitude, certainly suggests that he doesn't equate  foreign aid, for example, with security, who - and there are those whose  supporters of foreign aid who would say that is exactly what it is, it  helps, it's soft power to a certain extent.</p><p>You have talked about transparency and the verification of metrics and  where this money goes.  The problem has been, hasn't it, that over the  years, there has been a lack of transparency at times, programs have lacked  focus and metrics and that the argument for aid and soft power loses some  weight when that happens.</p><p>Clearly I know you don't agree with that, but you must concede that that is  the case at times over the years?</p><p>HART:  Of course.  Foreign aid programs all over the world are not always  perfect over time.  But the perception that a vast majority of foreign aid  is lost to waste and corruption is simply not true.  The vast majority of  assistance is going for a life saving programs that people all over the  world in need.  And through better transparency, through partnership with  people on the ground, through targeted goals - meeting targeted goals and  metrics, aid has him improved incredibly, and actually as you mentioned at  the top of your question, is now viewed by our military leaders as a key  tool in the toolbox for national security.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I mean, to quote Mr. Mattis, he said that foreign aid is cut -  if it is cut, he will need to buy morebullets.</p><p>Do you think in the end that congress would approve a significant and  swinging (ph) cut in foreign aid?</p><p>HART:  Well, I don't.  We've had 200 meters on Capitol Hill with our  volunteers just yesterday and the overwhelming sentiment from both sides of  the aisle is that these cuts are not wise, they're not well considered and  they are rejecting them.</p><p>ANDERSON:  With that, we're going to leave it there.  We thank you for  coming on.  Tom Hart of the North American Executive - is the North  American Executive director at ONE talking to us today.  Thank you.</p><p>HART:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Right.</p><p>That was a tough question, no doubt.  And there are important questions to  be asked about aid, but there are a lot of things you can do right now to  help our world.  We have made a list of some of  the best most effective ways for you to check them out:  CNN.com/impactyourworld is a great site.</p><p>The latest World News headlines are just ahead, as you would expect at the  bottom of the hour here, nearly half past 3:00, plus, Uber's CEO issues an  apology after Bloomberg posts an extraordinary video of him and a driver.   We'll have that for you and explain why he now says he needs to grow up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:33:27] ANDERSON: Well, the CEO of the international ride sharing  service, Uber, has  issued a remarkable apology after a confrontation with an Uber driver.   Travis Kalanick told employees in an email that he must fundamentally  change as a leader and grow up.</p><p>That came after a dashcam video Boomberg obtained from a driver showed  Kalanick arguing with the driver who said Uber's low fares are bankrupting  him.  Have a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK, CEO, UBER:  What?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  WHAT?</p><p>KALANICK:  Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KALANICK:  They blame everything in their life on somebody else?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  ...send an email for (inaudible).</p><p>KALANICK:  Good luck.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, CNN Money business and technology correspondent Samuel  Burke joining us now with more on that.</p><p>And this is one of only what would be the latest of a number of  controversies for the CEO of Uber.  Why?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY:  Becky, I would say that this could not come at a  worse time for Uber except I would be the second time I've said that in as  many weeks.</p><p>First, they had the scandal with their perceived relationship with Donald  Trump.  Many would say that was unfair, but it cost them 200,000 users.</p><p>Then, a former employee making very serious accusations of sexual  harassment and the company failing to do anything for her.</p><p>And now this, a driver merely trying to give - file a complaint, really,  with the big boss and Travis Kalanick reacting this way.</p><p>Listen, at the end of the day, it could not come at a worse time for Uber.   You don't want to have these come in one, two, or three.</p><p>Now, he's also somebody who has a reputation for being very aggressive and  we see this playing out in the video.  But, Beck, here I am at one of the  biggest tech conference in the world.  Most of the small startups would  kill just to be in a position where somebody was asking them, wanting to  tell the big boss their opinion.  </p><p>But we have big tech companies here.  And I talked to one of the biggest  tech companies in the world and they said, listen, Samuel, there are tech  CEOs who act like this all across Silicon Valley, but they do it in their  offices.</p><p>If Tim Cook is upset with an engineer, he might talk to them directly, but  you would never find a Tim Cook in one of the Apple Stores - really the  equivalent of the Uber driver making minimum wage, or just above, yelling  where he could be seen on camera and that's the real mistake here: acting  like this in public when you're worth over $6 billion.</p><p>[10:35:50] ANDERSON:  Yep.  Thank you, Samuel.</p><p>Let's get you back to our top story this hour: U.S. President Donald  Trump's address to congress on Tuesday and the new tone that we heard.  He  spoke of, quote, real and positive immigration reform that could allow  millions of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. to get legal status.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many  billions of dollars a year, switching away from this current system of  lower skilled immigration and instead of adopting a merit based system, we  will have so many more benefits, it will save countless dollars, raise  workers wages, and help struggling families, including immigrant families,  enter the middle class and they will do it quickly.  And they will be very,  very happy indeed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, two teenagers whose mom was recently deported were  listening to President Trump as he outlined his vision for immigration.   CNN's Polo Sandoval spoke to them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jackie and Angel Rayos- Garcia traveled 2300 miles from their Phoenix home to Washington to hear  the president speak after the deportation of their mother under his new  immigration policy. </p><p>JACQUELINE RAYOS-GARCIA, DAUGHTER OF DEPORTED MOTHER: It was really sad  seeing how people were blinded. It was sad seeing how people agreed with  him. </p><p>SANDOVAL: President Trump's rousing speech to Congress taking place on  their mother's 36th birthday. </p><p>J. RAYOS-GARCIA: Told her happy birthday and that I loved her a lot and  that I miss her. </p><p>ANGEL RAYOS-GARCIA, SON OF DEPORTED MOTHER: She told us that she's really  proud of us. </p><p>SANDOVAL: We first met Guadalupe Rayos-Garcia in Sonoma, Mexico earlier  this month, just after immigration officials acted on a 2013 order to  deport her. The 36-year-old was arrested in 2008 and later pleaded guilty  to making up a Social Security number on a job application. That's a non- violent felony. Immigration and Customs officials detained Rayos-Garcia. </p><p>TRUMP: We are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that  threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. </p><p>A. RAYOS-GARCIA: What he said, it was just -- it was a lie. It's not just  the bad people he's taking out, it's just everyone in general. </p><p>SANDOVAL: Arizona congressman Ruben Gallego hopes to send this message to  President Trump. </p><p>REP. RUBEN GALLEGO (D), ARIZONA: These are kids, and that his policy really  has destroyed their lives. His policy did not make, you know, this country  safer by deporting Guadalupe. </p><p>SANDOVAL: Working to get Jackie and Angel's mother back home to the U.S.,  but with a 10-year ban in place before she can legally re-enter, chances  are many more birthdays will be celebrated apart. </p><p>A. RAYOS-GARCIA: We're not afraid. We're going to stand up for our  community. </p><p>J. RAYOS-GARCIA: I won't stop fighting until things change. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, a month ago, a presidential order briefly banned anyone  from seven countries the Trump administration considered a security risk  from entering the United States.  You'll remembers that.</p><p>Well, a new order is to be rolled out soon.  But one immediate effect was  scenes like these, asylum seekers, so fearful they will be denied refuge in  the U.S., they risk dangerous crossing into Canada in mid-winter, hoping  for a better welcome there.</p><p>Well, toughened U.S. immigration law will affect industries as well as  individuals.  And there's one multi-billion dollar sector that stands to be  particularly effective.  And that is education.  Christopher Manfredi is  the provost and vice principal of McGill University in Montreal, one of the  top universities in Canada, and the country, sir, already benefiting from  the Trump effect as it were.  What are we seeing at McGill?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER P. MANFREDI, MCGILL UNIVERSITY:  well, Becky, thank you for  having me on.  First of all, Canada has always been an attractive  destination for international students in Canada.  At McGill we have almost  11,000.  We have in the past few months seen a 20 percent increase in  applications from U.S.-based students and around a 25 percent increase in  applications from other international students since the election.</p><p>[10:40:08] ANDERSON:  Now, these figures certainly look good, don't they,  for Canada right now.  From 2015, I think I'm right in saying, to 2016 -  international student population grew by 8 percent.  More than 350 odd  thousands.  Put that in perspective.  That is roughly 1 percent - 1 percent  of the population.</p><p>Those numbers rising and the government taking steps to make it easier for  those students to become citizens.  Do you see, though, any possible  pitfalls to Canada's open doors policy with regards to students?</p><p>MANFREDI:  No, I think having international students on our campuses  enriches the quality of the education that all students receive if they  find Canada an attractive place to remain, the ability to retain that  talent, the ability to make Canada stronger economic destination.  I think  it's all a positive for us.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, just to follow the money, just bear with me on this, if  Canada forecasts having some half a million foreign students in the next  decade, this isn't just about a warm welcome, is it, sir, foreign students  are big business for your universities like yours.  Just how important are  they?</p><p>MANFREDI:  Well, I think they're important in terms of the tuition they  bring.  They're important in terms of their economic impact on the places  where universities are located.  And again if we can retain that talent  that we've trained that we know are good they're an economic benefit to the  country as a whole and for the places where they stay.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Have seen a difference in the sort of applications that you've  been getting of late?</p><p>MANFREDI:  No, as I said, McGill and Canada in general, have always been  attractive destinations.  The numbers are up across the country.  We have a  fairly strong base.  We've always been an attractive destination for  American students and international students.  I don't think we have seen a  very strong shift in terms of the types of students that are applying.</p><p>ANDERSON:  OK.  We're going to leave it there.  We thank you very much  indeed for joining us.  There's a lot more on the website, including a look  on how wealthy Arabs are trying to beat an immigration crackdown the U.S.  immigration crack you were by getting investor visa's, that's an in depth  report by our Zara al-Khalisi (ph) in Dubai.  That is only on CNN.com, a  CNN Money special for you.</p><p>Live from London, today, at what is 42 minutes past the hour, you are very  welcome.  This is Connect the World.  I'm Becky Anderson.</p><p>Coming up, an emotional return to Mosul, a CNN reporter and photojournalist  who survived a terrifying ambush return to the Iraqi city, to find out what  happened after they escaped.  We are taking a very short break.  Back after  this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:45:09] ANDERSON:  You're with CNN.  This is Connect the World at 45  minutes past 3:00 in London.  I'm Becky Anderson, welcome back.</p><p>Now to a very personal journey for some of my own CNN colleagues who  survived a terrifying ordeal.  Back in November, senior international  correspondent Arwa Damon and photojournalist Bryce Lane entered Mosul with  advanced units of the Iraqi army looking to liberate the city from ISIS.</p><p>Now, their convoy was ambushed, and they spent 28 hours under siege with  wounded soldiers and frightened families.</p><p>From the day they escaped they've wanted to return.  And now they have.   Here is an excerpt from what is their special report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It's always a bit emotional  going back after such an intensive experience.  We are excited to see the  soldiers, again, but at the same time, we're a bit apprehensive, because  we're not entirely sure who survived.</p><p>Hello.</p><p>And we're looking for Major Hassan, he's Salahideen's (ph) commander, and  as we walk up to him, he breaks into this huge smile.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAMON:  He's always joking.  A classic tough Iraqi man constantly trying to  hide his emotions with dark humor.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (subtitles):  Come, come say hi to your aunt.</p><p>DAMON:  One of the first soldiers we saw was Nisam (ph) who had been  wounded in his side.</p><p>(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>UNIDENIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>DAMON:  (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>They keep asking about us and if we're okay.  And I'm like, no, we're the  ones that were worried about you, wondering if you guys were okay.</p><p>And then Ahmed walks in. He was the staff sergeant who was shot in the leg  that day.  Despite  being wounded he had taken complete control.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>DAMON:  (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>We looked at the photos on my phone of the men who were with us that day  and all four were killed.</p><p>This is Haider (ph), and he was the soldier who was killed the day He was  the soldier who was  killed the day in that first suicide car bomb that hit the back of the  convoy.  And now they carry this picture with them.</p><p>Some of the soldiers, like Wael (ph), they haven't returned.  He was  sitting up front in our armored vehicle and he got a shrapnel wound in the  eye after a grenade exploded. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I (inaudible).</p><p>DAMON:  But a lot of the other troops, they were patched up and returned to  the frontline.  They don't get a break from the war, but they still have  this determination to beat ISIS to win.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (subtitles):  The more we advanced, the weaker ISIS  became.  They were using a lot of car bombs.  Now their new tactic is to  drop explosives from drones.  </p><p>DAMON:  We were snapping selfies and laughing, and gunfire broke out a few  doors down. </p><p>ISIS is basically flying one of their drones overhead.  They were just  saying, so they were trying to shoot it down, some of the other guys are in  a different location.</p><p>But this is how unfazed everybody is, because in the middle of all of that,  they're still trying to take photographs.</p><p>These drones loaded with explosives, it's what ISIS has shifted towards.   And it's time for us to leave.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON:  That, my friends, is real life.</p><p>Return to Mosul, a CNN special report with Arwa Damon airs several times  this weekend.  And do see if you can catch it Saturday 7:00 p.m. local time  in Abu Dhabi, that's 3:00 p.m. London.  You can work out from where you are  watching what time that would be locally for you.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:50:45] ANDERSON:  For your Parting Shots, then, today picture a daring  art heist, a robber tip-towing disappearing into the night with his ill  gotten gains.  Well, it may sound like the stuff movies and myths are made  of, but it does and did actually happen over in Paris.  A Picasso, a  Matisse and a Brach, just three of the five art works stolen seven years  ago, by a thief nicknamed Spider-Man.</p><p>Well, this is the man behind the mask.  And two weeks ago, Jarin Tomich was  sentenced to eight years in jail; however, the paintings are still missing.</p><p>One man, at least, dares to dream they will be found again.</p><p>I'm joined now by Julian Radcliffe, chairman of the Art Loss Register who  are working to track  down the stolen art.</p><p>And before I talk about that art specifically, am I right in suggesting  that you conduct something like a half a million searches a year?</p><p>JULIAN RADCLIFFE, CHAIRMAN, ART LOSS REGISTER:  Yes, we conduct over  400,000  searches paid for by the art trade.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Where was all this stuff stashed?</p><p>RADCLIFFE:  Well, these all all lots going through auction houses, items  offered at fairs.  And we are searching all of them in order to try and  find some of the 500,000 stolen items registered with us.</p><p>ANDERSON : What do people steal and why?</p><p>RADCLIFFE:  They steal art because it is very easy to steal compared to  highly protected other items like jewelry and cash in banks.  It's high  value, easy to steal.  And they don't necessarily think how easily they're  going to make money out of it once they've stolen it.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, here's a good  example of one that was recovered and won't  have made much money because it's...</p><p>RADCLIFFE: What they did - this cut from its frame and then the thieves  folded it up rather than rolling it into a tube, and so they have been  effectively destroyed it.  This is not a very valuable picture.  If this  was in perfect condition, worth about 20,000, 15,000 pounds.</p><p>But they did destroy another picture, which was on a panel, an oak panel,  that was worth  probably a million pounds.</p><p>ANDERSON : So what has happened?  Tell us.  Where does your investigation  lead you to believe that this art work stolen by Spider-Man might be?</p><p>RADCLIFFE:  It is possible it's been destroyed.  If you take 100 pictures  stolen 50 years ago, only 15 or 20 of them have been recovered.  Of the  other 80, probably 20 we believe would have been destroyed, too hot to  hold, hidden, forgotten where they put them.  Another 20 or 30 are in  private hands.  They may not know what they are.  They bought them in good  faith.</p><p>And some will be held by the thieves as a negotiating chip if they are  arrested on another charge, they'll be able to get a reduced sentence.</p><p>We got one case at the moment where we helped put a man in jail in the  1990s.  At that time, he did a plea bargain and returned three pictures.   But the most valuable pictures he's still got.  And he's probably now got  Alzheimer's.  So whether we'll ever find him is a question.</p><p>ANDERSON:  That is absolutely remarkable.</p><p>I've always, this has always fascinated me.  For those who have bought in  good faith or say they have bought in good faith and you have no idea who  they are, isn't artwork these days registered?  I mean, certainly it is.   Isn't it tracked to the extent that it is almost impossible, surely, for a  piece of artwork like a Brach (ph) to just be hung in somebody's house and  sort of, you know, forgotten about, because they bought in good faith and  they don't know what they have got.</p><p>RADCLIFFE:  It's perfectly possible that these pictures have been bought in  good faith.  They don't know what they are, or they may suspect what they  are, but they won't come into our attention until they are sold.</p><p>That is the time that we can see them and recover them.  Trying to recover  them when they're in somebody's private possession is very difficult.</p><p>[10:55:07] ANDERSON:  What is -- or what's your biggest success?  What are  you most proud of  recovering?</p><p>RADCLIFFE:  Well, we did a recovery some years ago of an 18-million pound  Cezanne.  And the reason it was a very successful case, is because the  individual who was responsible for trying to sell these pictures 20 years  later, turned out to be the lawyer for the original thief.</p><p>ANDERSON: Stop it.</p><p>RADCLIFFE:  And he went to jail for seven years.  And we were the only  witnesses for the trial.</p><p>ANDERSON:  What happened to the thief?  </p><p>RADCLIFFE:  The thief was shot by another thief over a dispute of a gaming  debt and therefore he'd already given the pictures to his lawyer to defend  him and nobody in the world knew that the lawyer had the pictures so that's  why the lawyer tried to sell them later.</p><p>ANDERSON:  This is remarkable.  I mean I don't want to laugh about it,  because it's multi-million pound stuff.</p><p>But I mean, this is the stuff that films are made of.</p><p>You are a pleasure, thank you,   We'll have you again.</p><p>As always, you can gets in touch with us on Twitter or Facebook.  But for  you art lovers this Sunday, Emirati commenta Sultan al-Khasimi (ph) will be  taking over CNN Arabic's Twitter account.  He's going to be talking about  the future of art in the Middle East and much more. But that is  specifically what he's going to be doing.</p><p>Art in the Middle East it's fascinating.  So be sure to catch that at CNN  Arabic.</p><p>And before we go, don't forget to pick up your phone and tap your way on to  our Facebook page, Facebook.com/cnnconnect. Give us a like to follow all of  our stories.</p><p>That's it, I'm Becky Anderson. That was Connect the World from London for  you.

Later this hour, we speak to one man on the hunt for the missing masterpieces.</p><p>ANDERSON: A very good afternoon in London. I'm Becky Anderson with Connect the World.</p><p>Before we get to those stories, some breaking news for you. And America's most watched stock index is just smashed through a new record. The Dow topping 21,000. The first time ever. That rally coming just hours after U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>gave his first speech to congress.</p><p>Maggie Lake is in the house for you. And it does seem there is no limit to this market, except that you and I have been around long enough to know what goes up can also come crashing down.</p><p>So, is there a fundamental reason why this market, Maggie, is in fifth gear, or should we be concerned about the sort of nasties of irrational exuberance, as it were?</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN MONEY: I don't think we're at the point of irrational exuberance, Becky, but you're right to raise that question. And I have been doing so with everyone I have talked to as well. Because listen, this has come so far so fast, and it hasn't taken any pause, really, or any kind of consolidation.</p><p>There are some fundamental reasons behind this. Earnings were better. We're just coming through the tail end of the earnings season. They were better than expected. The economy isn't where people want it, but it's steady. Consumer confidence is high, wages are increasing, the fed is sounding more confident. Those are all real reasons. Do they justify this rally? No. It is one that's billed on what one trader yesterday said to me is hopium, the hope that they're going to get the fulfillment of these promises that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has made.</p><p>And right now, they're willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>They didn't hear a lot of details in the speech last night that guarantee those things will happen. It's early days. but what they did see, and I think this is what they're responding to today, is that change in tone. Yes, it is just style right now, but it indicates that maybe, just maybe, this deal making potential to bring people together in unified businessman <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is emerging as the person who will lead the country, rather than the divisive tweeting <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>That made investors very uncomfortable. This is what they like to see.</p><p>So, I think in this case, that tone is really driving what we're seeing today.</p><p>ANDERSON: So, when he talks fair trade, not free trade, and you consider those companies that are in this index who will mostly be global companies, they're not concerned about where he goes next so far as this more protectionist stance is concerned, it's more about this sort of reduction in regulation, is it, that will suit business going forward?</p><p>LAKE: They're terribly concerned about free trade. They're concerned about free trade. They're concerned about frankly some of the foreign policy stances. They're concerned about immigration. They're concerned about the visa programs. There's a lot they're concerned about.</p><p>But they care about the tax reform, regulation, and I think that they are still hanging on to the idea that these very, sort of again, inflammatory comments coming on trade are a negotiating stance. They're the beginning. I had a guest on last hour saying this, and that somewhere, once that happens, this is just his negotiating style. And they will end up somewhere up closer in the middle and there will be room to compromise and do business with trading partners.</p><p>Is that realistic? We don't know. Again, it is the hope and the dream that is the case. But that seems to be what they are betting on.</p><p>A concrete indication of something otherwise would cause a lot of scare in the market and in the business community. I see some reverse some of theses gains that we have seen, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Yeah, watch this space.</p><p>Always a pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>Maggie in the house for you on what is breaking news this hour.</p><p>21,052 is where that index stands at present.</p><p>Well, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>says from now on America will be empowered by aspirations, not burdened by fears. The U.S. president looked to inspire a nation with his first address to congress, reaching beyond political divides to call for unity. And he left the combative rhetoric behind, staying on script as he struck a statesmanlike tone.</p><p>Senior Washington correspondent Joe Johns begins our coverage this hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Trump striking a more presidential and optimistic tone...</p><p>TRUMP: I'm here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength.</p><p>JOHNS: ... in his hour-long speech to a joint session of Congress.</p><p>TRUMP: It is a message deeply delivered from my heart.</p><p>JOHNS: Off the top, the president condemning the surge in hate crimes since he took office.</p><p>TRUMP: Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that, while we may be a nation divided in policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.</p><p>JOHNS: Spending much of his speech laying out an ambitious agenda.</p><p>TRUMP: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.</p><p>JOHNS: His solution: an echo from his campaign, \"America first.\"</p><p>TRUMP: Buy American and hire American.</p><p>JOHNS: And once again, using national security as the basis for his proposed border wall with Mexico.</p><p>TRUMP: We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.</p><p>We will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.</p><p>JOHNS: The president touting his deportation efforts of undocumented people with criminal convictions.</p><p>TRUMP: We are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.</p><p>JOHNS: And defending his controversial travel ban, halted by a federal court weeks ago.</p><p>TRUMP: It is not compassion but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.</p><p>JOHNS: But signaling that he might be open to compromise on immigration.</p><p>TRUMP: I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible.</p><p>JOHNS: The president told network news anchors before the speech that he's open to a legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants if they never committed a crime.</p><p>TRUMP: I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.</p><p>JOHNS: On health care, the president laying out five points for a plan to replace Obamacare.</p><p>TRUMP: We should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage.</p><p>JOHNS: Arguing that people should be able to buy insurance across state lines and leaning on tax credits to ensure that Americans can afford their premiums.</p><p>TRUMP: It must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.</p><p>JOHNS: The president also announcing a huge plan to boost the nation's infrastructure.</p><p>TRUMP: I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.</p><p>JOHNS: On the war against ISIS, the president using this controversial reference.</p><p>TRUMP: Radical Islamic terrorism.</p><p>JOHNS: Even though sources say his new national security adviser urged him not to use \"radical Islamic terrorism\" in his speech, because it alienates Muslims.</p><p>TRUMP: Extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.</p><p>JOHNS: The president ending his speech with a very emotional moment, honoring the widow of Ryan Owens, a Navy SEAL killed last month in Yemen, saying he was part of a highly successful terror raid.</p><p>TRUMP: Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he's very happy, because I think he just broke a record.</p><p>For the Bible teaches us there's no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.</p><p>JOHNS: Joe Johns, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: What that emotional tribute to the Navy SEAL who was killed and his widow was the most moving moment of the night. Here is how a CNN political commentator and frequent critic of president <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>described it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: He became president of the United States in that moment. Period. There are a lot of people who have a lot of reason to be frustrated with him, to be fearful of him, to be mad at him, but that was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics. Period.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, the Yemen raid had been in the works for awhile, but it was Mr. Trump who approved it just days after taking office.</p><p>In an interview with Fox, he emphasized the roles other played in planning the mission and appeared to put responsibility on his generals for the Navy SEAL's death. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The mission was started before I got here. This was something that was - you know, just - they wanted to do. They came to see me. They explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected. My generals are the most respected than we have had in many decades, I believe. And they lost Ryan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: I'm joined now by our CNN, senior international correspondent Clarissa Ward. Let's talk about this speech.</p><p>As Van Jones, one of <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>most outspoken critics said this was the moment that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>became president. What's your perspective?</p><p>CLARISSA WARD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's so interesting to hear people on both sides of the political divide, seemingly for the first time in months, come together in unison and say this was a water mark. This was a shift. We did hear something from President Trump last night that we really haven't heard before. It was much less combative in tone. It was much more moderate, much more sober, much more somber. He was apparently reaching across the aisle, talking about the need for political cooperation between the two different parties. He alluded to the battle that he will face in congress when it comes to this huge amount of money he wants to allocate to military spending, when it comes to the huge sums that he wants to allocate to rebuilding America's infrastructure.</p><p>So I think it was really one of the first times that we have heard President Trump really sound like a president. And he was sticking to that script, Becky. He was reading from that teleprompter. And we did not see any of the kind of more freewheeling shoot from the hip kind of rhetoric that has so often gotten him into trouble in the past.</p><p>ANDERSON: You alluded to the investment in military spending an historic, $54 brillion, I think, if I'm correct in saying. Clearly that money speaks to the president counter terror efforts. We have been promised a plane to defeat ISIS. Are we any clearer to knowing when that plane will be revealed and what it might say?</p><p>WARD: Well, we are not really closer to that. I mean, we are sort ardently waiting to see what the Secretary of Defense James Mattis is waiting to propose.</p><p>We know that there are a number of different options on the table. One of them even includes having U.S. military troops on the ground in Syria, which is a very controversial idea for many different reasons. And we know that this massive amount, as you said $54 billion, will essentially be at the military's disposal to try to facilitate I believe President Trump talked about extinguishing ISIS.</p><p>In reality, any one of us who has spent a lot of time on the ground in the Middle East, in Syria particularly and watching the battle against ISIS, you start to understand that ISIS is a symptom. IT's not the cause. And that if you are only using a military track in order to defeat ISIS and you are kind of not paying attention to all the contributing geopolitical and social factors that conflate together to create groups like ISIS, then you are going to find yourself back at square one again in no time at all.</p><p>ANDERSON: Have to spent a lot of time on the ground in the Middle East, particularly in Syria over the last decade. You have in the past month also spent a considerable amount of time reporting on Mr. Trump and his positions in regard Russia. You've been in Moscow. Given what we heard last night, clearly there is, I think it would be safe to say, an effort by the administration to move I think it would be safe to say that an effort by the administration to move on.</p><p>Did he achieve that? Are we over Russia at this point?</p><p>WARD: Well, I think it's become such a political hot potato in the U.S., that it's difficult to talk about moving past this. And while he did not mention Russia in his speech last night, there was the kind of the hanging presence of Russia all around.</p><p>I just want to draw your attention to one thing he said, where he talked about the importance of finding new friends and forging new partnerships where interests align.</p><p>And he talked about being friends with former enemies. It was hard for anyone who covers foreign policy listening to that not to think hold on a second he's talking about Russia here, because he does have this adamant belief that the U.S. and Russia can forge a meaningful partnership.</p><p>But as long as he is trying to pushing that partnership forward, he is going to face questioning from within his own party and certainly from within the Democratic Party about what his real ties to Russia may be and how they possibly could have influenced the election, Becky.</p><p>[10:15:13] ANDERSON: Always a pleasure. Thanks. Clarissa Ward for you.</p><p>We didn't really hear anything about the White House's plans to slash it's foreign aid budget in last night's speech, but it is an important story that could affect all of us, even those of us in the world's richest countries.</p><p>In about 10 minutes, we're going to break it all down for you with a fantastic guest in Washington. So do stay with us for that.</p><p>Well, unrelenting violence, war crimes committed by all sides and attacks intentionally terrorizing civilians, a new and blistering UN Human Rights Council report blames all sides in the Syria civil war for targeting civilians and causing widespread carnage in Aleppo. But it saves it's most damning accusations for Russia and Syria. It accuses pro-government forces of carrying out daily, deadly airstrikes using chemical weapons, summary executions of rebels, and the forced displacement of civilians.</p><p>Well, Nina Dos Santos is reviewing the report for us. She is standing by in Istanbul -- Nina.</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Thanks so much, Becky.</p><p>Yes, well, it's a damning report. They're trying to be balanced her. And they do level accusations against both sides. Let's start with some of the most damning accusations that you ran through there, Becky, particularly in eastern Aleppo. The United States accuses the Assad regime ther civilians will be caught up in the conflict and that they had scant access to enough resources like food and also water.</p><p>And then it goes on to say that daily sorties, daily bombardments by Russian and Syrian air strikes, shattered what little infrastructure was left there, in particular targeting things like hospitals, which the wounded needed so badly, but also food supplies like, for instance, bakeries that were servicing the city as well, but really most damning is the use of banned chemical weapons, in particular chlorine bombs, which are used as well as cluster bombs with increasing frequency during the period of September 2016.</p><p>I should mention that this report in particular takes a look into the use of certain types of weapons throughout the period of summer of 2016 right until December 2016 when eastern Aleppo, which is held by the rebels eventually fell.</p><p>And then they go on to say that the people who were in eastern Aleppo were then forcibly evacuated to other parts of Syria, some of the civilians to western Aleppo, some of them to Idlib as well.</p><p>But when we're talking about also the rebels, well, they do come in for stiff criticism as well, in particular the use of what it calls indiscriminate shelling of western parts of Aleppo where they knew that civilians would be there. This was supposedly two, quote, unquote, terrorize the local population that's killed many women and children. And it also says that when it comes back to eastern Aleppo. indiscriminate shelling of western Aleppo when the civilians tried desperately to flee. The UN report accuses the rebels of holding them back as human shields, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Nina Dos Santos is reporting for you from Istanbul today. Nina, thank you.</p><p>Still to come, we are finding out how <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wants to spend taxpayers dollars. But what about the sense? Well, we look at how some of his biggest planned cuts could affect all of us. The details up next.</p><p>Plus, Canada's prime minister has been known to welcome refugees personally. We look at how his country is also rolling out the red carpet for foreign students.</p><p>[10:21:04] ANDERSON: You're back with Connect the World. 20 past 3:00 here in London. I'm Becky Anderson. Welcome back to the show.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>first speech before congress getting the predictable mixed reviews from politicians, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called this speech a home run.</p><p>But in the official Democratic response, the former governor of Kentucky slammed the president.</p><p>But let's hear from the people. CNN's Tom Foreman has reaction from thousands of Americans who watched the speech at home.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: More than 39,000 people cast about 15 million votes moment to moment, telling us what they thought of the speech. The line goes up if they like it, down if they don't. Democrats in blue, independents in purple, Republicans in red.</p><p>And the president had them all pointing the right direction early on, when he talked about hate crimes. Watch the lines.</p><p>TRUMP: Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>FOREMAN: That is what any president would want. Look, everybody's clustered together here, up in the positive territory.</p><p>But these moments were very hard to come by, especially when he talked about policy. Yes, they agreed when he talked about helping out veterans. Yes, they agreed a little bit when he talked about jobs. We saw plenty of area where is they disagreed, particularly on policy, and particularly when he brought up Obamacare.</p><p>Watch the lines.</p><p>TRUMP: Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>FOREMAN: Yes, big applause line in the room. They all jump up. But, look, Democrats hated it. Independents didn't like it. Interestingly, the Republicans in our sample, look at that, they're falling off, too.</p><p>At no point did these lines ever cross. Democrats never liked it more than independents. Independents never liked it more than the Republicans. And interestingly enough, men always liked what he had to say more than women did.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, America spends more on helping out other people than any other country. Its current foreign aid budget soars well above $40 billion a year. But that's just a tiny fraction of Washington's total spending, just about 1 percent of it, in fact. All that cash goes to everything from helping other country's economies, to humanitarian relief, to military help or now a lot of it, could be about to vanish, because U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wants to take cash from elsewhere in America's accounts and pump it into the country's already formidable military budget. We have been discussing this earlier on today.</p><p>Let's break down what all of that then could mean with Tom Hart. He's in charge of North America for one, an organization working to end extreme poverty. And he's with us now live from Washington.</p><p>And Tom, it's not clear yet how swinging (ph) these cuts will be to foreign aid, but it does seem evident they are likely to be fairly severe.</p><p>You've been around the world of said in Africa for years. Who and what would suffer?</p><p>TOM HART, NORTH AMERICAN EXECTUIVE DIRECTOR, ONE: Well, the proposed cuts that we're hearing sort of 30 percent and 40 percent cuts to foreign said would be devastating. This is not a proposal rooted in what programs are working would be about eliminating programs and really putting in jeopardy people who depend on life saving assistance like anti-retroviral medicines for HIV/AIDS, food assistance for people in famine, bed nets for people fighting malaria, and anti-corruption measures. So this would be a very, very damaging proposal.</p><p>ANDERSON : Tom, in his book, \"The White Man's Burden,\" economist William Easterly estimates that the west spent more than $2 trillion on aid in 50 years and that it's done little good, lambasting it as a, and I quote him, mistaken approach to tackling world poverty. Is there a case to answer him, that aid, especially in Africa, promotes a perpetual dependency on itself?</p><p>HART: You know, I really disagree with that. You know, extreme poverty has been cut around the world, in half in the last 20 years. We've - the United States has actually led the way in combating preventable diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria and other diseases. Aid has really undergone a revolution, particularly the way the United States does it in the lat 15, 20 years where it is driven by results, it is transparent and it is working in partnership with African governments and partners on the ground.</p><p>So, I really do think that it's doing a tremendous amount of good. And cutting it back like this would do nothing but harm.</p><p>ANDERSON : And let me just speak to what you have just said, because, you know, <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>attitude, certainly suggests that he doesn't equate foreign aid, for example, with security, who - and there are those whose supporters of foreign aid who would say that is exactly what it is, it helps, it's soft power to a certain extent.</p><p>You have talked about transparency and the verification of metrics and where this money goes. The problem has been, hasn't it, that over the years, there has been a lack of transparency at times, programs have lacked focus and metrics and that the argument for aid and soft power loses some weight when that happens.</p><p>Clearly I know you don't agree with that, but you must concede that that is the case at times over the years?</p><p>HART: Of course. Foreign aid programs all over the world are not always perfect over time. But the perception that a vast majority of foreign aid is lost to waste and corruption is simply not true. The vast majority of assistance is going for a life saving programs that people all over the world in need. And through better transparency, through partnership with people on the ground, through targeted goals - meeting targeted goals and metrics, aid has him improved incredibly, and actually as you mentioned at the top of your question, is now viewed by our military leaders as a key tool in the toolbox for national security.</p><p>ANDERSON: I mean, to quote Mr. Mattis, he said that foreign aid is cut - if it is cut, he will need to buy morebullets.</p><p>Do you think in the end that congress would approve a significant and swinging (ph) cut in foreign aid?</p><p>HART: Well, I don't. We've had 200 meters on Capitol Hill with our volunteers just yesterday and the overwhelming sentiment from both sides of the aisle is that these cuts are not wise, they're not well considered and they are rejecting them.</p><p>ANDERSON: With that, we're going to leave it there. We thank you for coming on. Tom Hart of the North American Executive - is the North American Executive director at ONE talking to us today. Thank you.</p><p>HART: Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON: Right.</p><p>That was a tough question, no doubt. And there are important questions to be asked about aid, but there are a lot of things you can do right now to help our world. We have made a list of some of the best most effective ways for you to check them out: CNN.com/impactyourworld is a great site.</p><p>The latest World News headlines are just ahead, as you would expect at the bottom of the hour here, nearly half past 3:00, plus, Uber's CEO issues an apology after Bloomberg posts an extraordinary video of him and a driver. We'll have that for you and explain why he now says he needs to grow up.</p><p>[10:33:27] ANDERSON: Well, the CEO of the international ride sharing service, Uber, has issued a remarkable apology after a confrontation with an Uber driver. Travis Kalanick told employees in an email that he must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.</p><p>That came after a dashcam video Boomberg obtained from a driver showed Kalanick arguing with the driver who said Uber's low fares are bankrupting him. Have a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK, CEO, UBER: What?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: WHAT?</p><p>KALANICK: Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KALANICK: They blame everything in their life on somebody else?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ...send an email for (inaudible).</p><p>KALANICK: Good luck.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, CNN Money business and technology correspondent Samuel Burke joining us now with more on that.</p><p>And this is one of only what would be the latest of a number of controversies for the CEO of Uber. Why?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY: Becky, I would say that this could not come at a worse time for Uber except I would be the second time I've said that in as many weeks.</p><p>First, they had the scandal with their perceived relationship with <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Many would say that was unfair, but it cost them 200,000 users.</p><p>Then, a former employee making very serious accusations of sexual harassment and the company failing to do anything for her.</p><p>And now this, a driver merely trying to give - file a complaint, really, with the big boss and Travis Kalanick reacting this way.</p><p>Listen, at the end of the day, it could not come at a worse time for Uber. You don't want to have these come in one, two, or three.</p><p>Now, he's also somebody who has a reputation for being very aggressive and we see this playing out in the video. But, Beck, here I am at one of the biggest tech conference in the world. Most of the small startups would kill just to be in a position where somebody was asking them, wanting to tell the big boss their opinion.</p><p>But we have big tech companies here. And I talked to one of the biggest tech companies in the world and they said, listen, Samuel, there are tech CEOs who act like this all across Silicon Valley, but they do it in their offices.</p><p>If Tim Cook is upset with an engineer, he might talk to them directly, but you would never find a Tim Cook in one of the Apple Stores - really the equivalent of the Uber driver making minimum wage, or just above, yelling where he could be seen on camera and that's the real mistake here: acting like this in public when you're worth over $6 billion.</p><p>[10:35:50] ANDERSON: Yep. Thank you, Samuel.</p><p>Let's get you back to our top story this hour: U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>address to congress on Tuesday and the new tone that we heard. He spoke of, quote, real and positive immigration reform that could allow millions of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. to get legal status.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year, switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration and instead of adopting a merit based system, we will have so many more benefits, it will save countless dollars, raise workers wages, and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class and they will do it quickly. And they will be very, very happy indeed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, two teenagers whose mom was recently deported were listening to President Trump as he outlined his vision for immigration. CNN's Polo Sandoval spoke to them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jackie and Angel Rayos- Garcia traveled 2300 miles from their Phoenix home to Washington to hear the president speak after the deportation of their mother under his new immigration policy.</p><p>JACQUELINE RAYOS-GARCIA, DAUGHTER OF DEPORTED MOTHER: It was really sad seeing how people were blinded. It was sad seeing how people agreed with him.</p><p>SANDOVAL: President Trump's rousing speech to Congress taking place on their mother's 36th birthday.</p><p>J. RAYOS-GARCIA: Told her happy birthday and that I loved her a lot and that I miss her.</p><p>ANGEL RAYOS-GARCIA, SON OF DEPORTED MOTHER: She told us that she's really proud of us.</p><p>SANDOVAL: We first met Guadalupe Rayos-Garcia in Sonoma, Mexico earlier this month, just after immigration officials acted on a 2013 order to deport her. The 36-year-old was arrested in 2008 and later pleaded guilty to making up a Social Security number on a job application. That's a non- violent felony. Immigration and Customs officials detained Rayos-Garcia.</p><p>TRUMP: We are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.</p><p>A. RAYOS-GARCIA: What he said, it was just -- it was a lie. It's not just the bad people he's taking out, it's just everyone in general.</p><p>SANDOVAL: Arizona congressman Ruben Gallego hopes to send this message to President Trump.</p><p>REP. RUBEN GALLEGO (D), ARIZONA: These are kids, and that his policy really has destroyed their lives. His policy did not make, you know, this country safer by deporting Guadalupe.</p><p>SANDOVAL: Working to get Jackie and Angel's mother back home to the U.S., but with a 10-year ban in place before she can legally re-enter, chances are many more birthdays will be celebrated apart.</p><p>A. RAYOS-GARCIA: We're not afraid. We're going to stand up for our community.</p><p>J. RAYOS-GARCIA: I won't stop fighting until things change.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, a month ago, a presidential order briefly banned anyone from seven countries the Trump administration considered a security risk from entering the United States. You'll remembers that.</p><p>Well, a new order is to be rolled out soon. But one immediate effect was scenes like these, asylum seekers, so fearful they will be denied refuge in the U.S., they risk dangerous crossing into Canada in mid-winter, hoping for a better welcome there.</p><p>Well, toughened U.S. immigration law will affect industries as well as individuals. And there's one multi-billion dollar sector that stands to be particularly effective. And that is education. Christopher Manfredi is the provost and vice principal of McGill University in Montreal, one of the top universities in Canada, and the country, sir, already benefiting from the Trump effect as it were. What are we seeing at McGill?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER P. MANFREDI, MCGILL UNIVERSITY: well, Becky, thank you for having me on. First of all, Canada has always been an attractive destination for international students in Canada. At McGill we have almost 11,000. We have in the past few months seen a 20 percent increase in applications from U.S.-based students and around a 25 percent increase in applications from other international students since the election.</p><p>[10:40:08] ANDERSON: Now, these figures certainly look good, don't they, for Canada right now. From 2015, I think I'm right in saying, to 2016 - international student population grew by 8 percent. More than 350 odd thousands. Put that in perspective. That is roughly 1 percent - 1 percent of the population.</p><p>Those numbers rising and the government taking steps to make it easier for those students to become citizens. Do you see, though, any possible pitfalls to Canada's open doors policy with regards to students?</p><p>MANFREDI: No, I think having international students on our campuses enriches the quality of the education that all students receive if they find Canada an attractive place to remain, the ability to retain that talent, the ability to make Canada stronger economic destination. I think it's all a positive for us.</p><p>ANDERSON: So, just to follow the money, just bear with me on this, if Canada forecasts having some half a million foreign students in the next decade, this isn't just about a warm welcome, is it, sir, foreign students are big business for your universities like yours. Just how important are they?</p><p>MANFREDI: Well, I think they're important in terms of the tuition they bring. They're important in terms of their economic impact on the places where universities are located. And again if we can retain that talent that we've trained that we know are good they're an economic benefit to the country as a whole and for the places where they stay.</p><p>ANDERSON: Have seen a difference in the sort of applications that you've been getting of late?</p><p>MANFREDI: No, as I said, McGill and Canada in general, have always been attractive destinations. The numbers are up across the country. We have a fairly strong base. We've always been an attractive destination for American students and international students. I don't think we have seen a very strong shift in terms of the types of students that are applying.</p><p>ANDERSON: OK. We're going to leave it there. We thank you very much indeed for joining us. There's a lot more on the website, including a look on how wealthy Arabs are trying to beat an immigration crackdown the U.S. immigration crack you were by getting investor visa's, that's an in depth report by our Zara al-Khalisi (ph) in Dubai.

And I'm like, no, we're the ones that were worried about you, wondering if you guys were okay.</p><p>And then Ahmed walks in. He was the staff sergeant who was shot in the leg that day. Despite being wounded he had taken complete control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>DAMON: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>We looked at the photos on my phone of the men who were with us that day and all four were killed.</p><p>This is Haider (ph), and he was the soldier who was killed the day He was the soldier who was killed the day in that first suicide car bomb that hit the back of the convoy. And now they carry this picture with them.</p><p>Some of the soldiers, like Wael (ph), they haven't returned. He was sitting up front in our armored vehicle and he got a shrapnel wound in the eye after a grenade exploded.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I (inaudible).</p><p>DAMON: But a lot of the other troops, they were patched up and returned to the frontline. They don't get a break from the war, but they still have this determination to beat ISIS to win.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (subtitles): The more we advanced, the weaker ISIS became. They were using a lot of car bombs. Now their new tactic is to drop explosives from drones.</p><p>DAMON: We were snapping selfies and laughing, and gunfire broke out a few doors down.</p><p>ISIS is basically flying one of their drones overhead. They were just saying, so they were trying to shoot it down, some of the other guys are in a different location.</p><p>But this is how unfazed everybody is, because in the middle of all of that, they're still trying to take photographs.</p><p>These drones loaded with explosives, it's what ISIS has shifted towards. And it's time for us to leave.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: That, my friends, is real life.</p><p>Return to Mosul, a CNN special report with Arwa Damon airs several times this weekend. And do see if you can catch it Saturday 7:00 p.m. local time in Abu Dhabi, that's 3:00 p.m. London. You can work out from where you are watching what time that would be locally for you.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>[10:50:45] ANDERSON: For your Parting Shots, then, today picture a daring art heist, a robber tip-towing disappearing into the night with his ill gotten gains. Well, it may sound like the stuff movies and myths are made of, but it does and did actually happen over in Paris. A Picasso, a Matisse and a Brach, just three of the five art works stolen seven years ago, by a thief nicknamed Spider-Man.</p><p>Well, this is the man behind the mask. And two weeks ago, Jarin Tomich was sentenced to eight years in jail; however, the paintings are still missing.</p><p>One man, at least, dares to dream they will be found again.</p><p>I'm joined now by Julian Radcliffe, chairman of the Art Loss Register who are working to track down the stolen art.</p><p>And before I talk about that art specifically, am I right in suggesting that you conduct something like a half a million searches a year?</p><p>JULIAN RADCLIFFE, CHAIRMAN, ART LOSS REGISTER: Yes, we conduct over 400,000 searches paid for by the art trade.</p><p>ANDERSON: Where was all this stuff stashed?</p><p>RADCLIFFE: Well, these all all lots going through auction houses, items offered at fairs. And we are searching all of them in order to try and find some of the 500,000 stolen items registered with us.</p><p>ANDERSON : What do people steal and why?</p><p>RADCLIFFE: They steal art because it is very easy to steal compared to highly protected other items like jewelry and cash in banks. It's high value, easy to steal. And they don't necessarily think how easily they're going to make money out of it once they've stolen it.</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, here's a good example of one that was recovered and won't have made much money because it's...</p><p>RADCLIFFE: What they did - this cut from its frame and then the thieves folded it up rather than rolling it into a tube, and so they have been effectively destroyed it. This is not a very valuable picture. If this was in perfect condition, worth about 20,000, 15,000 pounds.</p><p>But they did destroy another picture, which was on a panel, an oak panel, that was worth probably a million pounds.</p><p>ANDERSON : So what has happened? Tell us. Where does your investigation lead you to believe that this art work stolen by Spider-Man might be?</p><p>RADCLIFFE: It is possible it's been destroyed. If you take 100 pictures stolen 50 years ago, only 15 or 20 of them have been recovered. Of the other 80, probably 20 we believe would have been destroyed, too hot to hold, hidden, forgotten where they put them. Another 20 or 30 are in private hands. They may not know what they are. They bought them in good faith.</p><p>And some will be held by the thieves as a negotiating chip if they are arrested on another charge, they'll be able to get a reduced sentence.</p><p>We got one case at the moment where we helped put a man in jail in the 1990s. At that time, he did a plea bargain and returned three pictures. But the most valuable pictures he's still got. And he's probably now got Alzheimer's. So whether we'll ever find him is a question.</p><p>ANDERSON: That is absolutely remarkable.</p><p>I've always, this has always fascinated me. For those who have bought in good faith or say they have bought in good faith and you have no idea who they are, isn't artwork these days registered? I mean, certainly it is. Isn't it tracked to the extent that it is almost impossible, surely, for a piece of artwork like a Brach (ph) to just be hung in somebody's house and sort of, you know, forgotten about, because they bought in good faith and they don't know what they have got.</p><p>RADCLIFFE: It's perfectly possible that these pictures have been bought in good faith. They don't know what they are, or they may suspect what they are, but they won't come into our attention until they are sold.</p><p>That is the time that we can see them and recover them. Trying to recover them when they're in somebody's private possession is very difficult.</p><p>[10:55:07] ANDERSON: What is -- or what's your biggest success? What are you most proud of recovering?</p><p>RADCLIFFE: Well, we did a recovery some years ago of an 18-million pound Cezanne. And the reason it was a very successful case, is because the individual who was responsible for trying to sell these pictures 20 years later, turned out to be the lawyer for the original thief.</p><p>ANDERSON: Stop it.</p><p>RADCLIFFE: And he went to jail for seven years. And we were the only witnesses for the trial.</p><p>ANDERSON: What happened to the thief?</p><p>RADCLIFFE: The thief was shot by another thief over a dispute of a gaming debt and therefore he'd already given the pictures to his lawyer to defend him and nobody in the world knew that the lawyer had the pictures so that's why the lawyer tried to sell them later.</p><p>ANDERSON: This is remarkable. I mean I don't want to laugh about it, because it's multi-million pound stuff.</p><p>But I mean, this is the stuff that films are made of.</p><p>You are a pleasure, thank you, We'll have you again.</p><p>As always, you can gets in touch with us on Twitter or Facebook. But for you art lovers this Sunday, Emirati commenta Sultan al-Khasimi (ph) will be taking over CNN Arabic's Twitter account. He's going to be talking about the future of art in the Middle East and much more. But that is specifically what he's going to be doing.</p><p>Art in the Middle East it's fascinating.

'And if you look at what happened last night and the night before you see that it's very common. And that's the way that was meant.' </p><p>'But I don't know where it came from, I don't know where it originated,' the president added. </p><p>Earlier Trump had revealed that he had called the 'terrific' family of George Floyd after the 'terrible event' of his death. </p><p>He also warned protesters who have set fire to Minneapolis after Floyd, who is black, was killed by police that 'lawless chaos and anarchy' wouldn't be tolerated. </p><p>After turning his back on reporters at a Friday 'news conference' and doubling down on using the controversial phrase 'when the looting starts the shooting starts,' Trump dedicated the first few minutes of a coronavirus business roundtable event to address Floyd's death. </p><p>'It's very important that we have peaceful protesters and support the rights for peaceful protesters,' Trump said. 'We can't allow a situation like what happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos and we understand that very well.' </p><p>Meaning to say Minneapolis, it sounded like the president said Indianapolis when referencing the city where Floyd was killed that has seen four days of protests, destroying businesses across the city. </p><p>'It's very important I believe to the family to everybody that the memory of George Floyd be a perfect memory, let it be a perfect memory,' he continued. 'The looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters.' </p><p>Trump added that, 'they hurt so badly,' adding 'what is happening and it's so bad for the state and for that great city.' </p><p>The president said the White House is working with the Justice Department and local law enforcement. And he said the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, 'was in a tough position.'</p><p>'And hopefully everything can be fairly taken care of,' he said. </p><p>'I understand the hurt, I understand the pain, people have really been through a lot,' he continued. 'The family of George is entitled to justice and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,' he continued. </p><p>He added that 'law and order will prevail.' </p><p>'It's a horrible, horrible situation and so we'll be reporting back in due course and as quickly as possible,' he said beforing switching the topic to the coronavirus, as the president was hosting business leaders to talk about certain sector's reopening. </p><p>Trump's remarks came after he refused to take questions at a Rose Garden event that had been billed as a 'news conference' on the heels of repeating the incendiary phrase 'looting leads to shooting.' </p><p>In the Rose Garden, Trump announced the United States would fully cut ties with the World Health Organization and punish China in a number of ways for the spread of the coronavirus and tightening its grip on Hong Kong, but left the podium after just 10 minutes. </p><p>Reporters stood up and shouted questions at the president including whether he had spoken with George Floyd's family - as Joe Biden did - or had plans to visit Minneapolis, which has seen four days of demonstrations after Floyd's death at the hands of the police. </p><p>The 'news conference' had originally been billed for 2 p.m., but Trump was 48 minutes late. </p><p>At 2:20 p.m., Trump tried to clarify tweets both he and the official White House account tweeted out that prompted Twitter to flag the content as 'glorifying violence,' saying it went against the platform's rules. </p><p>'Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means,' Trump wrote. </p><p>Then he attempted to explain - though not walk back his tweet, which contained language revealed to have been connected to have historical connections to an infamous anti-black police chief of openly bragged about committing state violence against looters.</p><p>The late Miami police chief Walter Headley issued a 'get tough' policy on black protesters during race riots in the city in the 1960s. </p><p>'We don't mind being accused of police brutality,' Headley told the New York Times at the time. 'They haven't seen anything yet.' </p><p>The president said he was not not urging police to shoot suspects, then called out unnamed 'haters.' </p><p>'It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement. It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd! </p><p>Trump - and then the White House account - had originally tweeted, 'These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!' </p><p>There's been chaos in the Minnesota city since a white police officer took the life of a black man, George Floyd, by kneeing him in the neck until he stopped breathing. </p><p>Trump initially posted it from his @realDonaldTrump account at 1 a.m. Friday. </p><p>The company attached a warning label to the tweet saying that it violated the rules. </p><p>When the president woke up Friday morning, he began angrily attacking Twitter. </p><p>'Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies &amp; propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States,' the president wrote. 'Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated!' </p><p>He then had the official White House account repost the flagged tweet verbatim, daring the social media company to act. </p><p>                     What is Donald Trump's executive order targeting social media sites?                    </p><p>Donald Trump signed an order on Thursday seeking to make social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook liable for the content posted by their users. </p><p>If enforced, the order would overturn decades of precedent by treating the websites as 'publishers' which could be sued for user-generated content. </p><p>It could open them up to a flood of lawsuits from anyone who claims to be harmed by content posted online. </p><p>Currently, the sites are protected by a law known as Section 230 which shields them from liability. </p><p>Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services' own standards, so long as they are acting in 'good faith.'</p><p>The author of a book about Section 230 said social media firms have 'based their business models on being large platforms for user content', saying they would not 'exist in their current forms' without the legislation. </p><p>However, critics argue that Section 230 gives internet companies a free pass on things like hate speech and content that supports terror organizations. </p><p>Trump signed the order after Twitter placed fact-check warnings on two of his tweets about mail-in voting on Tuesday. </p><p>Republican senator Josh Hawley said the 'censorship' was relevant to Trump's proposal, because websites which 'editorialize and censor' as Twitter allegedly did should be 'treated like traditional publishers' in law. </p><p>However, critics saw Trump's order as an act of political revenge against websites which he has long accused of political bias. </p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order 'a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.' </p><p>One ACLU official said the measure could actually harm Trump by encouraging a more cautious Twitter to limit the president's tweets. </p><p>Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order is 'not legally enforceable'. </p><p>Twitter said the order was a political move which attacked free speech, while Facebook said the measure would 'encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone'. </p><p>The @WhiteHouse's account continued to engage in the battle, by linking to a tweet sent out by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, last week that called for #jihad against Israel. </p><p>'This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it will allow terrorists, dictators, and foreign propagandists to abuse its platform,' a tweet from the official White House account read. </p><p>On the original offending Trump tweet, Twitter put a warning on it less than three hours later, saying it had 'taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts'. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was informed in advance. </p><p>The tweet can no longer be liked or replied to and will not be recommended by Twitter's algorithm, although retweets with comment are still possible - with Trump's message initially hidden. </p><p>It is still possible to override the warning message and view the tweet, under special rules for government officials which protect the public's right to know what their politicians have said. </p><p>Trump has feuded with the social media site in recent days for fact-checking his tweets.</p><p>Also on Friday morning, he quoted Fox News' Maria Bartiromo saying, 'he President has been targeted by Twitter.' </p><p>Trump then added, 'What about all of the lies and fraudulent statements made by Adam Schiff, and so many others, on the Russian Witch Hunt Plus, Plus, Plus? What about China's propaganda? WHO's mistakes? No flags?' he asked. </p><p>He then quoted Jeanine Pirro, a pro-Trump Fox News personality, who also called for regulating Twitter. </p><p>The president had signed an executive order Thursday seeking to strip social media giants of their legal protections, potentially exposing them to a flood of lawsuits- but backed Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg who distanced himself from Twitter.</p><p>Twitter had put a fact-checking label on two of Trump's tweets on Tuesday which claimed that mail-in voting in the 2020 election would be 'substantially fraudulent.' </p><p>And then attached the warning label to his 1 a.m. Friday tweet. </p><p>That message was a reply to an initial tweet - not red-flagged by Twitter - which took aim at the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis for his handling of the crisis. </p><p>Twitter announced the 'public interest notice' on the 'shooting' tweet around three hours after Trump had sent the message.</p><p>The social media giant said Trump's tweet 'violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today'. </p><p>'As is standard with this notice, engagements with the tweet will be limited. People will be able to retweet with comment, but will not be able to like, reply or retweet it,' a statement explained. </p><p>However, Twitter said it is 'in the public interest for the tweet to remain accessible' given its 'relevance to ongoing matters of public importance'. </p><p>Tweets from elected officials are exempt from the usual rules because there is a 'significant public interest in knowing and being able to discuss their actions and statements', the company's policies say. </p><p>'As a result, in rare instances, we may choose to leave up a Tweet from an elected or government official that would otherwise be taken down.' </p><p>These exemptions are only available to accounts with more than 100,000 followers. Trump has more than 80million. </p><p>The website told Axios that 'teams within Twitter' had decided to red-flag the president's tweet and that CEO Jack Dorsey was informed before it happened. </p><p>Trump has yet to respond to the warning message, which appeared at around 4am in Washington. </p><p>The president's threat to looters came after a third night of protests in Minneapolis accompanied by further rallies around the United States. </p><p>Hundreds of National Guard soldiers were deployed to the streets of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul and Mayor Frey declared a state of emergency as rioting escalated and cars and buildings were torched across the city. </p><p>'The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!' Trump tweeted mid-morning Friday. He misspelled scene. </p><p>Minneapolis's Third Precinct police station was set on fire and evacuated amid fears it could explode after gas lines were cut.</p><p>Frey called the looting 'unacceptable' but raged at Trump for 'refusing to take responsibility for your own actions,' saying the president 'knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis.' </p><p>CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, who is black, was arrested by police in Minneapolis while doing a live-shot, adding more fuel to the racial outrage. </p><p>In New York City, NYPD officers were seen brawling on the ground with protesters as at least 70 people were arrested in the city. </p><p>Protesters in Ohio smashed the windows of the statehouse in downtown Columbus and raided the building, while demonstrators damaged a police cruiser in downtown Los Angeles. </p><p>In Kentucky, seven people were shot in downtown Louisville during a protest demanding justice for black woman Breonna Taylor who was shot dead by cops in March - a case which has returned to the spotlight after Floyd's death. </p><p>Floyd, 46, died on Monday after a white police officer pinned him down with his knee despite Floyd pleading that he could not breathe. </p><p>The latest escalation in the president's row with Twitter comes just hours after he signed an order seeking to scrap legal protections for social media firms, which he accuses of political bias. </p><p>The order could open Twitter, Facebook and Google up to lawsuits by diluting the legal protection which stops them from being liable for posts on their platforms, and which also allows them to moderate content. </p><p>Trump's executive order said websites such as Twitter and Facebook 'wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events'. Twitter said the order was a political move which attacked free speech. </p><p>Trump also praised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for his criticism of Twitter's decision to fact-check the tweets. 'CEO Mark Zuckerberg is today criticizing Twitter,' Trump wrote before sharing Zuckerberg's statement. </p><p>'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' Zuckerberg said in an interview with Fox News.</p><p>'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' he added.</p><p>'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' </p><p>Zuckerberg has been accused by Democrats of pandering to the President with his comments about censorship so that Facebook will not be targeted. </p><p>'Zuckerberg went on Fox News-a hate-for-profit machine that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracy theorists-to talk about how social media platforms should essentially allow politicians to lie without consequences. This is eroding our democracy,' said Senator Elizabeth Warren. </p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hit harder saying that Trump was using the feud as a distraction from the coronavirus outbreak. </p><p>'It's outrageous, but it's an outrageous situation,' Pelosi said at a Thursday press conference. 'While Twitter is putting up its fact-check under what the president says about voting, it still won't take off the misrepresentations the president's putting out there.'</p><p>'Facebook, all of them, they're all about making money,' she said. 'Their business model is to make money at the expense of the truth and the facts that they know. And they defend, they defend that.' </p><p>After highlighting Zuckerberg's statement, Trump asked: 'Did Twitter criticize Obama for his 'you can keep your Dr''?'</p><p>The president was referring to Obama's during assurance that 'if you like the doctor you have, you can keep your doctor' under the Affordable Care Act which he was struggling to steer through Congress at the time. </p><p>However, this promise was later abandoned and Obama conceded that some people 'might end up having to switch doctors'. </p><p>In a later tweet, Trump also renewed his dubious claims about mail-in voter fraud that had earned him the misinformation tag from Twitter in the first place. </p><p>Trump claimed that mail-in voting - which is high on the agenda because of the risks of voting in person during the pandemic - would lead to 'massive fraud and abuse' as well as the 'end of our great Republican Party'. </p><p>Twitter did not red-flag yesterday's comments as it had done for his Tuesday tweets, which now appear with a warning sign and a link to 'get the facts about mail-in ballots'. </p><p>Trump accused Twitter of becoming an 'editor with a point of view' and not a 'neutral platform' by fact-checking him. </p><p>The president also slammed one of its executives, Yoel Roth, its head of user integrity, accusing him of 'fraud' for the fact check. Twitter says he was not involved in it.</p><p>Asked if he wanted to get rid of Twitter he said: 'If it was legal, if it was able to be legally shut down, I would.' </p><p>Trump rolled out the tough language as Attorney General Bill Barr looked on and the president signed an order that could expose Twitter and other social media platforms to a barrage of lawsuits. </p><p>Barr said when firms 'curate' their collection and engage in 'censoring' content firms become 'publishers' and shouldn't be entitled to a legal 'shield.' </p><p>                     SECTION 230: THE LAW TRUMP IS TAKING AIM AT OVER CLAIMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA BIAS                    </p><p> Twenty-six words tucked into a 1996 law overhauling telecommunications have allowed companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to grow into the giants they are today.</p><p>Those are the words President Donald Trump challenged in an executive order Thursday, one that would strip those protections if online platforms engaged in 'editorial decisions' - including, in the president's view, adding a fact-check warning to one of Trump's tweets.</p><p>Under the U.S. law, internet companies are generally exempt from liability for the material users post on their networks. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act - itself part of a broader telecom law - provides a legal 'safe harbor' for internet companies.</p><p>But Trump and other politicians argue that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity - or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government.</p><p>Section 230 probably can't be easily dismantled. But if it was, the internet as we know it might cease to exist.</p><p>Just what is Section 230?</p><p>If a news site falsely calls you a swindler, you can sue the publisher for libel. But if someone posts that on Facebook, you can't sue the company - just the person who posted it.</p><p>That's thanks to Section 230, which states that 'no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.'</p><p>That legal phrase shields companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted - whether their complaint is legitimate or not.</p><p>Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services' own standards, so long as they are acting in 'good faith.'</p><p>Where did Section 230 come from?</p><p>The measure's history dates back to the 1950s, when bookstore owners were being held liable for selling books containing 'obscenity,' which is not protected by the First Amendment. One case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which held that it created a 'chilling effect' to hold someone liable for someone else\u00b4s content.</p><p>That meant plaintiffs had to prove that bookstore owners knew they were selling obscene books, said Jeff Kosseff, the author of 'The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,' a book about Section 230.</p><p>Fast-forward a few decades to when the commercial internet was taking off with services like CompuServe and Prodigy. Both offered online forums, but CompuServe chose not to moderate its, while Prodigy, seeking a family-friendly image, did.</p><p>CompuServe was sued over that, and the case was dismissed. Prodigy, however, got in trouble. The judge in their case ruled that 'they exercised editorial control - so you're more like a newspaper than a newsstand,' Kosseff said.</p><p>That didn't sit well with politicians, who worried that outcome would discourage newly forming internet companies from moderating at all. And Section 230 was born.</p><p>'Today it protects both from liability for user posts as well as liability for any clams for moderating content,' Kosseff said.</p><p>What happens if Section 230 is limited or goes away?</p><p>'I don\u00b4t think any of the social media companies would exist in their current forms without Section 230,' Kosseff said. 'They have based their business models on being large platforms for user content.'</p><p>There are two possible outcomes. Platforms might get more cautious, as Craigslist did following the 2018 passage of a sex-trafficking law that carved out an exception to Section 230 for material that 'promotes or facilitates prostitution.' Craigslist quickly removed its 'personals' section altogether, which wasn't intended to facilitate sex work. But the company didn\u00b4t want to take any chances.</p><p>This outcome could actually hurt none other than the president himself, who routinely attacks private figures, entertains conspiracy theories and accuses others of crimes.</p><p>'If platforms were not immune under the law, then they would not risk the legal liability that could come with hosting Donald Trump\u00b4s lies, defamation, and threats,' said Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>Another possibility: Facebook, Twitter and other platforms could abandon moderation altogether and let the lower common denominator prevail.</p><p>Such unmonitored services could easily end up dominated by trolls, like 8chan, which is infamous for graphic and extremist content, said Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman. Undoing Section 230 would be an 'an existential threat to the internet,' he said.</p><p>But Goldman doesn't see the White House order as that kind of threat to the internet, saying it's 'political theater' that will appeal to Trump supporters. 'The president can't override Congress,' he said. </p><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>'We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly, and you know what's going on as well as anybody. It's not good,' Trump said before inking the order, which came just days after Twitter for the first time provided what Trump's staff calls a fact-check on his own tweets.</p><p>Pressed on whether he would in fact seek to use the courts to shut down Twitter, Trump responded: 'I think this: if Twitter were not honorable, if you're going to have a guy like this be your judge and jury I think you shut it down as far as I'm concerned,' in reference to Twitter's 'head of integrity,' who has been revealed to have posted tweets highly critical of Trump and top Republicans. </p><p>Trump, a billionaire who amassed a branding and real estate empire before running for president, added: 'A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communication in the United States and we know what they are, we don't have to name them, we're going to give you a complete listing.'</p><p>He continued: 'They've had unchecked power to censure, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.'</p><p>Trump brought up the 2016 elections as he tore into Twitter - a fact lawyers might try to flag if companies try to claim in court the action is politically motivated.</p><p>'We can't allow that to happen especially when they go about doing what they're doing,' Trump said. 'Because they're doing things incorrectly. They have points of view. And if we go by that it's actually amazing that there was a success in 2016, but we can't let this continue to happen. It's very, very unfair.'</p><p>'What they're doing is tantamount to monopoly you can say,' Trump claimed. It's tantamount to taking over the airwaves. Can't let it happen. Otherwise we're not going to have a democracy. We're not going to have anything to do with a republic.'</p><p>Trump also tried to use the power of federal purse strings as pressure, saying we 'are not going in any social media company that repress[es] free speech.' </p><p>He said the government spends 'billions of dollars on giving them money' and called the firms 'rich enough,' although independent accounts put the total government ad spending far lower.</p><p>'We're going to be doing none of it or very little of it,' Trump said.</p><p>Asked if he would consider simply deleting his Twitter account given his concerns, Trump said he would 'do that in a heartbeat' if we had a 'fair press' in the U.S.</p><p>The language of the order Trump signed specifically singled out Twitter for its decision to flag two of the president's tweets. The platform provided additional information, although it did not take down the tweets. </p><p>It appeared to have been added since a draft order which was circulated widely in the run-up to the signing. </p><p>'Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias,' said the order. 'As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician's tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called 'Site Integrity' has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets.'</p><p>Schiff is the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a favorite Trump target. </p><p>Another section singled out four tech platforms - compared to a draft order which did not name Instagram and YouTube.</p><p> 'Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,' it said. </p><p>Still another describes a new government 'working group' that will, among other things, evaluate media organizations with evidence of 'bias' being used to review content. '</p><p>'Complaints described in section 4(b) of this order will be shared with the working group, consistent with applicable law. The working group shall also collect publicly available information regarding the following: (iv) reliance on third-party entities, including contractors, organizations, and individuals, with indicia of bias to review content,' it says.</p><p>At least one section that did not appear in a draft form publicly available put new authority under Barr.</p><p>A section on government expenditures on online ads states: 'The Department of Justice shall review the viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by each online platform identified in the report described in subsection (b) of this section and assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices.' </p><p> A section on the FCC considers a newly-added hedge. 'The FTC shall consider developing a report' on whether complaints alleging a violation of the law implicate its provisions. A draft said the agency would produce the report - effectively giving it an exit from actually producing one.</p><p>One section has the AG's working group probe an area with a financial angle, whether the platforms' policies act in ways 'that limit the ability of users with particular viewpoints to earn money on the platform compared with other users similarly situated.' </p><p>The crucial legal section is Trump's order to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to clarify how to enforce regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p><p>That is the federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for users' posts.</p><p>But the order says that the protection should not apply if companies are 'engaged in editorial conduct' - meaning making a judgment for themselves about how people's points of view are presented.</p><p>That is what Trump accuses Twitter of doing by fact-checking him, and what conservatives claim happens to their posts which are promoted less than those with more liberal viewpoints. </p><p>Such a move could open up Twitter, Facebook and other platforms to an avalanche of lawsuits from people claiming their views have been unfairly censored. </p><p>It also requires the agency to look at whether social media platforms are using 'deceptive' policies to moderate content by not openly declaring how they decide how viewpoints are dealt with.</p><p>Trump also set up a mechanism allowing Americans to report alleged political censorship or bias by the social media giants which will be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The White House tech bias reporting tool will collect complaints of online censorship and submit them to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). </p><p>The order was also rejected by civil liberties groups - and by the Chamber of Commerce, normally a reliable supporter of Republican policy. </p><p>                     Anti-conservative bias claims on social media                   </p><p>Facebook internal report admitted bias </p><p>Facebook last year opened itself to an independent investigation of anti-conservative bias after repeated criticism from Trump.</p><p>The audit, carried out by former Republican Senator Jon Kyl and others, found that the tech giant was still some way off eliminating its bias.</p><p>It concluded that Facebook's efforts to counter fake news had silenced conservative voices. One example, was that fact-checking sites used by the social media giant were inherently left-leaning.</p><p>In addition, it found that Facebook's ads policy could have restricted anti-abortion advocacy. </p><p>Kyl's report said: 'Facebook has recognized the importance of our assessment and has taken some steps to address the concerns we uncovered. But there is still significant work to be done to satisfy the concerns we heard from conservatives.'</p><p>Don Jr. claimed to be hit by 'Shadow banning'</p><p>A series of high-profile pro-Trump figures have claimed that Twitter and Instagram have made it harder to find their accounts or individual posts.</p><p>Among those making the claim have been Donald Trump Jr., and Mark Meadows, at the time a congressman and now Trump's White House chief of staff, and Jim Jordan, a prominent Trump defender.</p><p>Trump Jr. made the claim in his book, Triggered.</p><p>Twitter has denied that it was involved in such a practice but did update its algorithm when the controversy erupted in July 2016. Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - has said it does not alter the prominence of posts for political reasons.</p><p>James Woods is banned from Twitter</p><p>The conservative actor and prominent tweeter was locked out of his account in May 2019 for tweeting: ''If you try to kill the King, you best not miss'#HangThemAll.'</p><p>Candace Owens suspended by Twitter after criticizing lockdown</p><p>Conservative commentator Candace Owens tweeted earlier this month: 'Apparently @GovWhitmer believes she is a duly elected dictator of a socialist country. The people of Michigan need to stand up to her. Open your businesses. Go to work. The police think she's crazy too. They are not going to arrest 10,000,000 people for going to work.'</p><p>A Twitter spokesman confirmed that Owens' tweet violated its Covid-19 fake news policy. Twitter said the tweet would be deleted and Owens would serve a 'timeout' before being allowed to log back on. </p><p>Google accused of censorship of views on abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism on its YouTube platform</p><p>In February, Google persuaded a federal appeals court on Wednesday to reject claims that YouTube illegally censored Prager University, a conservative nonprofit run by radio talk show host Dennis Prager.</p><p>PragerU claimed that YouTube's opposition to its political views led it to tag dozens of videos on such topics as abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism for its 'Restricted Mode' setting, and block third parties from advertising on the videos.</p><p>Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said YouTube was a private forum despite its 'ubiquity' and public accessibility, and hosting videos did not make it a 'state actor' for purposes of the First Amendment.</p><p>Clinton scourge Tulsi Gabbard sues Google over violating free speech </p><p>Last year she announced she was suing Google for $50million after it suspended her advertising account in the hours after a Democratic debate because it was trying to silence her.</p><p>Although she's a Democrat, Gabbard's nationalist ideals have put her at odds with the Democratic party.</p><p>Hillary Clinton suggested the Iraq War veteran was a Russian asset. </p><p>Tulsi Now Inc. said in the lawsuit filed in July 2019 that Google violated her right to free speech and didn't provide 'a straight answer' for suspending her ads account.</p><p>Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify ban Infowars' Alex Jones</p><p>In 2018, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify banned pages and content from Infowars and the show's host Alex Jones. </p><p>A Facebook spokesman referred to content which it said glorified violence and the use of dehumanizing language to describe Muslims and migrants. These violated their graphic violence and hate speech policies.</p><p>The spokesman noted conspiracy theories espoused by Jones on events like the 9/11 attacks and Sandy Hook school shooting, were not the reason for his ban. </p><p>YouTube followed suit a few hours later, as did Spotify, after Apple removed Jones from its podcast directory. </p><p>Laura Loomer banned from Twitter after she claimed Ilhan Omar was 'anti Jewish' and supported Shariah law </p><p>It comes as a federal appeals court this week upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit that accused Twitter, Facebook and other tech giants of conspiring to stifle the political views of far-right activist, Laura Loomer, and a conservative nonprofit, Freedom Watch. </p><p>In November 2018, Loomer handcuffed herself to the front doors of Twitter headquarters in New York after the company banned her. The company permanently suspended Loomer's account, which had more than 260,000 followers, after she tweeted that Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, is 'anti Jewish' and supports Sharia law.</p><p>Facebook also banned Loomer, who is running for a Florida congressional seat as a Republican.</p><p>In March 2019, U.S District Judge Trevor McFadden said their suit raises 'non-trivial concerns' but didn't tie these concerns to viable legal claims. </p><p>'We believe that free speech and the right to engage in commerce are foundational to the American free enterprise system,' a Chamber official said in a statement, the New York Times reported. </p><p>'Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States. An executive order cannot be properly used to change federal law.' </p><p>'This executive order, likely unconstitutional, is also intended to distract the public's attention away from the fact that there are now over 100,000 Covid-related deaths across the country and an economy that is sinking to Great Depression levels,' said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in a statement. </p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order 'a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.'</p><p>Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was 'more about political theater than about changing the law.'</p><p>The order 'is not legally supportable - it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions,' Goldman said.</p><p>Despite Trump's approving tweet about Zuckerberg, Facebook issued a statement saying limiting the section of communications law would have the opposite effect of protecting free speech.</p><p>'Facebook is a platform for diverse views. We believe in protecting freedom of expression on our services, while protecting our community from harmful content including content designed to stop voters from exercising their right to vote,' it said, NBC news reported on Twitter. </p><p>'Those rules apply to everybody. Repealing or limiting section 230 will have the opposite effect. It will restrict more speech online, not less. </p><p>'By exposing companies to potential liability for everything that billions of people around the world say, this would penalize companies that choose to allow controversial speech and encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.'</p><p>The order says it received 16,000 responses of alleged bias and suggests that they will form part of the Federal Trade Commission's investigation. </p><p>The order also requires the attorney general to establish a working group including state attorneys general that will examine the enforcement of state laws that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair and deceptive acts. </p><p>And it says the AG's group should look into who carries out factchecks for social media platforms and whether they have 'indicia of bias.'</p><p>And federal agencies are to be told to review their advertising on social media platforms, which was worth $1.5 billion in the last decade. Trump described it as 'billions and billions of dollars.'</p><p>Section 230 of the 1996 law is a shield against social media networks being sued for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>It says: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' </p><p>It also says that: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.' </p><p>A publisher or speaker can normally be sued for defamation for the contents of their speech but by not being categorized as those, any attempt to sue social media giants for what is written on them falls at the first hurdle.</p><p>The 1996 statute has allowed Silicon Valley to make billions of dollars from their users' posts, photos and videos, with minimal legal liability, while giving them freedom to remove anything they see as 'objectionable.' </p><p>When it was written social media did not exist.</p><p>Since its explosive growth, platforms including Twitter and Facebook have changed repeatedly.</p><p>Their algorithms decide the order in which users see new posts, and can be used to make particular content more or less visible.</p><p>That has led critics to say that they are behaving as publishers - deciding what people read or see - and not simply as forums.</p><p>The rest of the act gives forums powers to set standards for content, which social media platforms have used as a basis for moderating content and to justify the existence of algorithms. </p><p>Conservatives - and many others outside mainstream thought on matters like history, climate change and even the coronavirus - have criticized the use of Section 230 claiming big tech has censored content without being subject to scrutiny. </p><p>Republican senators Marco Rubio (FL) and Josh Hawley (MO) were among those who slammed Twitter for putting its fact-checking flag on the president's tweets.</p><p>Rubio said: 'The law still protects social media companies like @Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers. </p><p>'But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher then they should no longer be shielded from liability &amp; treated as publishers under the law.' </p><p>Hawley, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it 'raises serious questions about whether Twitter targeted the President for political reasons.' </p><p>There is however zero possibility of a Democratic House passing reforms to the law itself.</p><p>That leaves Trump trying to use the powers of the executive branch.</p><p>The order also puts a prohibition on federal tax dollars going to online platforms that 'violate free speech principles.' </p><p>But a report last February showed the feds spent just $8 million on social media ads in 2018. </p><p>The idea of broadening the platforms' legal exposure carried more weight. </p><p>Under the order, the Commerce Secretary would file a petition for new FCC rule-making. It would make platforms liable when actions are 'deceptive, pretextrual, or inconsistent with a provider's terms of service,' or when taken with 'inadequate notice' or by an 'unreasoned explanation.' </p><p>Trump himself has made ample use of lawsuits and legal threats over his career. USA found in 2016 Trump and his companies had been involved in 3,500 lawsuits over three decades.</p><p>Trump's moves brought immediate pushback. </p><p>'This is simply setting the wheels of law enforcement and regulation in motion against a private company for questioning the president,' said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, according to the Washington Post. </p><p>Added former FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, 'Social media can be frustrating. But an executive order that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into the president's speech police is not the answer.' </p><p>Jesse Blumenthal, head of the Koch-backed Stand Together group, said it was 'just nonsense' to try to rewrite a clear statute through an executive order. </p><p>The rule's first section contains language that is more political than technical, following reports the administration rushed to put it out.</p><p>It calls free speech 'the bedrock of American democracy' and says having a limited number of platforms 'hand-pick' speech is 'fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.' </p><p>Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted: 'Here's the inevitable effect ... all comments sections will be taken down. No website has the resources to actively edit all comments in order to shield themselves from liability, and no website is willing to leave comments entirely standards-free.'</p><p>Pachter said that fact-checking 'is a stupid idea on Twitter's part' and that instead they should just delete tweets which are reported, warn the offender or suspend them for breaking its rules. </p><p>Trump had claimed Wednesday in a Twitter thread that conservatives are being silenced and disproportionately regulated on social media websites like Twitter and Facebook as Twitter issued 'misleading' warning labels on two of his tweets about mail-in voting on Tuesday.</p><p>'Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,' the president posted to his Twitter Wednesday morning. 'We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that happen again.'</p><p>The warning was issued after Trump reacted with fury to having two of his tweets labelled as misleading, with links to news articles suggesting they were false attached. </p><p>Responding to the 'fact checking' Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale said: 'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters.</p><p>'Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them.' </p><p>In contrast, Twitter's Jack Dorsey refused to take down the president's tweets where he touted a debunked conspiracy theory that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a staffer when he was a Republican U.S. congressman from Florida. </p><p>Twitter users, including some Republicans, did not react kindly to the president suggesting increased regulations on social media websites.</p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg goes after Twitter for its fact-checking of Trump                    </p><p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg criticized competitor Twitter on Thursday after it 'fact-checked' tweets from Donald Trump.</p><p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey immediately fired back saying that the site would continue to call out 'incorrect or disputed information' about elections shared by users. </p><p>In his interview with Fox, Facebook's Zuckerberg said that it was not the place of the company to act as an 'arbiter of truth'.</p><p>'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' he said.</p><p>'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' he added.</p><p>'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.'</p><p>Dorsey tweeted: 'Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me. Please leave our employees out of this. We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make,' he wrote. </p><p>'Per our Civic Integrity policy, the tweets yesterday may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot (only registered voters receive ballots),' he added. 'We're updating the link on @RealDonaldTrump's tweet to make this more clear.'</p><p>Michael Pachter, research analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told Fox Business: 'Twitter came up with a rule that applies to one person ...</p><p>'They're not treating (Trump) the way they treat everybody else. They came up with a separate set of rules just for him, which is fact-checking, because they're too afraid of his bullying to delete the tweet or suspend him.' </p><p>Prominent conservative Margot Cleveland, whose work has been featured in several right leaning news publications, weighed in claiming any private organization has the right to decide what speech can and cannot be featured on their platform.</p><p>'Pro Tip: Saying Twitter is violating your constitutional right to free speech or your First Amendment rights is wacko b/c Twitter ain't the government,' Cleveland wrote Wednesday morning. 'Saying Twitter is 'stifling free speech' isn't. Powerful private organizations can &amp; do stifle speech.' </p><p>Trump critic and Republican George Conway, who is married to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, reposted a message from the State Department spokeswoman that contradicted the president's tweet.</p><p>'The State Department's spokesperson, a couple of hours after the President of the United States suggested that the government may 'strongly regulate' social media platforms or 'close them down,'' Conway wrote as a lead up.</p><p>Morgan Ortagus tweeted from the official State Department spokesperson account: 'Governments that restrict internet access deprive their citizens of the information they need to stay safe. #FreedomOfExpression both online and offline is vital, especially during COVID-19. @StateDept is proud to be an active member of the @FO_Coalition.' </p><p>Kellyanne Conway criticized Twitter for flagging the tweets, lashing out at Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site Integrity, during an interview with Fox &amp; Friends Wednesday.</p><p>She even cited his Twitter handle on live television to make sure Republicans knew where to direct their complaints.</p><p>'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway lamented.</p><p>'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' </p><p>Trump also re-asserted his flagged tweets' theme in his Wednesday morning tweet: 'Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country.'</p><p>Trump views that mail-in ballots will increase the chances of voter fraud - and benefit Democrats in 2020.</p><p>'It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots,' Trump insisted. 'Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!' </p><p>On Tuesday, the president tweeted that California's mail-in balloting initiative would lead to substantial voter fraud in the November general election.</p><p>                     Biased head of Twitter's 'Site Integrity' has previously called the President 'a racist tangerine'                    </p><p> Yoel Roth, whose official title at Twitter is head of Site Integrity, faced backlash on Wednesday after his history of anti-Trump tweets emerged less than 24 hours after the social media giant put a fact-checking warning on two of the president's tweets. </p><p>In a January 2017 tweet, Roth referred to the Trump administration as 'actual Nazis in the White House' and tweeted in November 2016 that fly over states were racist.</p><p>He also compared Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway to Nazi Joseph Goebbels saying: ''Today on Meet The Press, we're speaking with Joseph Goebbels about the first 100 days...' - What I hear whenever Kellyanne is on a news show.'</p><p>The majority of Roth's tweets criticizing Trump and his administration were posted around 2017.</p><p>Roth started working at Twitter in 2015 as a product trust partner, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>He has been in his current role as head of site integrity for almost two years.</p><p>Conway, who is a counselor to Trump, lashed out at Roth in an interview with Fox &amp; Friends on Wednesday and went as far as giving out his Twitter handle on live television.</p><p>'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway said.</p><p>'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' </p><p>'There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed,' Trump wrote Tuesday morning.</p><p>He then insinuated that non-citizens would be able to obtain ballots.</p><p>'The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one,' he continued in the Twitter rant. 'That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote.'</p><p>Trump ended the two-tweet tirade by saying, 'This will be a Rigged Election.'</p><p>'No way!' said Trump, who votes in Florida absentee.</p><p>The president used a mail-in ballot to vote in the Florida primary last month - a move his administration has defended since he cannot show up for in-person voting while living in Washington, D.C.</p><p>By Tuesday afternoon, Twitter had flagged the tweets with a blue exclamation mark prompting users to 'get the facts about mail-in ballots.'</p><p>Another page on the social media site called Trump's tweets 'unsubstantiated,' according to fact-checkers from CNN, Washington Post and other news outlets.</p><p>'These tweets contain potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots,' a statement from Twitter read. </p><p>Following the move from Twitter, Trump used the social media site he is attacking to decry its decision to label his tweets 'misleading' and accused them of 'stifling free speech.' </p><p>He threatened the tech giant, stating he wouldn't allow it to continue.</p><p>'@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post,' Trump wrote Tuesday night.</p><p>'Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!' he asserted.</p><p>Trump's 2020 campaign was quick to slam the move.</p><p>'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters. Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them,' campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. </p><p>For weeks Trump has said that states, not wanting to expose the voting public to COVID-19, shouldn't be implementing full-scale mail-in balloting plans. </p><p>The president has drawn a distinction between absentee ballots, which he said can be used for special purposes, and governors sending every American voter a ballot to send back in. </p><p>'I have to do an absentee because I'm voting in Florida and I happen to be president and I live in that beautiful house over there that's painted white,' he said in the Rose Garden Tuesday. </p><p>Trump's tweets came after the Republican National Committee and two other GOP groups filed a lawsuit Sunday against California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had signed an executive order to use mail-in ballots for the November election. </p><p>'In California the governor, I hear, is sending millions of ballots all over the state. Millions, to anybody. People that aren't citizens, illegals, anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot,' Trump said at the White House Tuesday.</p><p>'We are not going to destroy this county by allowing things like that to happen. We're not destroying our country,' he added. </p><p>Republicans long have been suspicious that making voting easier would elect more Democrats. Young people, for instance, tend to tilt more Democratic, but are also less likely to vote in-person. </p><p>California was the first state in the country to commit to sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters for the November election, a move responding to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>'Democrats continue to use this pandemic as a ploy to implement their partisan election agenda, and Governor Newsom's executive order is the latest direct assault on the integrity of our elections,' Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. </p><p>'No state that conducts all-mail elections automatically mails ballots to inactive voters because it invites fraud, coercion, theft, and otherwise illegitimate voting,' it added.</p><p>The lawsuit asks for Newsom's order to be barred as unlawful and was filed by the RNC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the California Republican Party.</p><p>Numerous studies have found little evidence of voter fraud connected to voting by mail. Democrats say it is necessary to counter health risks from the coronavirus by helping to prevent crowds at polling places.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-63269433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6013-WDK1-JCJY-G382-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9340\"/><timeReceived>7:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Aides say that he will appeal forcompromise.  But how will Democrats respond with a new speaker of theHouse looking over his shoulder?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR:  A subpoena related to the president'sinaugural committee, prosecutors are probing possible conspiracy andillegal donations from abroad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SANCHEZ:  Plus, a deal is reached to keep tens of thousands of U.S.troops in South Korea, a major commitment ahead of the president'snext summit with Kim Jong-un.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS:  And significant rise in cancer among millennials.  Thereason: obesity.  This is pretty shocking this study finding thatthese younger Americans are having these rising rates of cancer.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START, everybody.  I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  And I'm Boris Sanchez, in for Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS:  Nice to see you.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Great to see you, Christine.</p><p>We're 31 minutes past the hour.  And tonight, President Trump delivershis second official State of the Union Address.  It will be his firstin this new era of divided government.</p><p>Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will sit over his shoulder afteroutmaneuvering him during the government shutdown, potentially asecond one ahead.  The speech comes in a critical time in hispresidency with a divided Congress, another shutdown looming, theborder wall issue, the Mueller investigation, the investigation in theSouthern District of New York, the list goes on and on.  Those andother issues the focus in Congress and elsewhere.</p><p>Administration officials have been previewing the president's addressand the theme tonight is supposed to be choosing greatness.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, WHITE HOUSE COUNSELOR:  This president is going tocall for an end to the politics of resistance, retribution.  He iscalling for cooperation and he's calling for comity, C-O-M-I-T-Y, andalso compromise.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  Vice President Mike Pence and Acting Chief of Staff MickMulvaney were among the officials briefing surrogates at the WhiteHouse last night, they said the speech will be about 50 percentforeign policy, it will touch on infrastructure and lowering drugcosts to areas, two areas where there might be some common ground withDemocrats.  Of course illegal immigration and the border wall stillbig issues.  They may lead to another lapse of government funding latenext week.</p><p>On that topic, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham had this message forhis colleagues.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  To every Republican, if youdon't stand behind this president, we're not going to stand behind youwhen it comes to the wall.  This is the defining moment of hispresidency.  It is not just about a wall.  It is about him beingtreated different than every other president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Sources inside the White House say that in the latest draftof the speech, the president does not declare a national emergency.Several Republican senators say they are deeply skeptical of the idea,mainly out of the worry their future Democratic president might thenuse the same excuse to fund their priorities.</p><p>The president's State of the Union guest list also highlights some ofhis key themes.  That includes family members of a couple murdered byan undocumented immigrant, survivors of the Tree of Life synagoguemassacre, a prison reform advocate, a man who benefited from tax cutsand this kid, a kid named Trump, sixth grader Joshua Trump, notrelated to the president, but the White House says he has been bulliedat school because of his last name.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the DemocraticParty, will deliver the response to the president's State of theUnion.  Abrams fell short of the 2018 Georgia governor's race, butenergized liberal voters in the South.  She will be the first African-American woman to give the Democratic response.</p><p>As for how she will prepare, Abrams says that she will hydrate first.That is a nod to Marco Rubio who awkwardly remember took sips of waterduring his response.  At least four House Democrats will not beattending tonight's State of the Union.  Fourteen Democrats skippedthe president's address last year.  SANCHEZ:  Looming over the president's speech, President Trump'sinaugural committee has been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors in NewYork.  The move escalates a wide ranging inquiry into how a record$107 million was raised and spent.  A copy of the subpoena reviewed byCNN demands documents related to donors, vendors and finances.</p><p>The investigation covers a long list of potential crimes.  Listen tothis -- they include conspiracy against the U.S., illegalcontributions from foreign nations, and contributions in the name ofanother person, a process known as straw donations.</p><p>[04:35:05] ROMANS:  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported last year, theprobe is looking at whether some donors gave money in exchange foraccess.  A spokesman for the inaugural committee says the subpoena isbeing reviewed and that it is their intention to cooperate.  It'sworth noting, much of the committee's fund raising was headed byformer Trump campaign official Rick Gates.</p><p>He pleaded guilty to a variety of felonies.  He is now cooperatingwith special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Another possibly messy confirmation ahead for the Trumpadministration, the president nominating Acting Interior SecretaryDavid Bernhardt to replace Ryan Zinke who resigned late last year amidcontroversy.  Bernhardt is a former energy lobbyist and now, he istapped to lead a department with the dual and what many say iscontradictory missions of developing and protecting America's naturalresources including oil and gas.</p><p>\"The Washington Post\" is reporting that Bernhardt lobbied for many ofthe businesses that he would now regulate.  Last year, he said he wascommitted to avoiding conflicts of interest.</p><p>ROMANS:  Dueling narratives over that racist photo that appeared onVirginia Governor Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook page.  Amember of the school's 1984 yearbook staff tells CNN the photos werechosen by each student and submitted in a sealed envelope with thestudent's name on it.  They were not chosen at random.</p><p>Governor Northam claims he never saw the photo in question before hewas confronted with it last week.  He is resisting calls to resign andsaid to be weighing his options.  And now, the lieutenant governor whowould take his place is facing a controversy of his own.</p><p>We get more from Ryan Nobles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Boris and Christine, goodmorning from Richmond, Virginia, where a lot has happened here, butnot much has changed.</p><p>The Governor Ralph Northam still in office, his Lieutenant GovernorJustin Fairfax still in that same position, but there is a lot ofuncertainty about the future of both of these men.  We know RalphNortham gathered his cabinet on Monday for a very tenuous and what wasdescribed as a solemn meeting where he essentially begged his cabinetto stick with him, to give him more time to prove that he is not theperson in this racist photo that has gotten so much attention.</p><p>In fact, Northam saying that he wants to stay in office in an effortto clear his good name because he did not want to resign and bethought of as a racist for life.  Now, all of this drama surroundingabout Northam comes at the same time that new report has emerged aboutthe Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax who would take over wereNortham were to resign.  The accusation comes from a woman who accusesthe lieutenant governor of sexual assault while they were both at theDemocratic National Convention in 2004.</p><p>Fairfax however is not backing down.  He vehemently denies this evertook place and he called and impromptu press conference yesterday toclear his name.  Take a listen.</p><p>LT. GOV. JUSTIN FAIRFAX (D), VIRGINIA:  You do now have something thatwas 15 years ago and yet you don't have a shred of corroboration,shred of evidence.  You -- it was first posed a year ago.  It went tothe \"Washington Post\" and \"Washington Post\" made the decision not torun the story because it is false, it's uncorroborated.  The reasonit's uncorroborated is because false.  You just go away until you findanother opportunity to get back in the media.</p><p>NOBLES:  Now, there is it no doubt that the new allegations againstFairfax complicate the situation here in Richmond.  There is a lot ofuncertainty about what the next 24, 48 hour or even the next weekcould bring.</p><p>For now, we know Ralph Northam has no plans to resign and that JustinFairfax is not going to back down as these accusations are leveledagainst him -- Boris and Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  RBG is back in the house, or in a concert, I should say.</p><p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spotted, making her firstpublic appearance Monday since undergoing cancer surgery in December.Ginsburg attended a performance of \"Notorious RBG in Song\" at theNational Museum of Women and the Arts.  Her daughter-in-law, sopranoPatrice Michaels released an album of songs celebrated Ginsburg'slife, and Ginsburg's son James produced the album.  A bit of anunderachieving family there.</p><p>The court has not said if she's actually going to attend tonight'sState of the Union, but it is not really expected given that Ginsburghas missed both President Trump's previous addresses to Congress.</p><p>ROMANS:  Rail accident investigators say there should be no moreextensions for railroad operators to new train safety technology.According to the NTSB, positive train control system could have saved303 lives and prevented 6,800 injuries over the last 50 years.Congress passed a law in 2008 requiring operators to install the radioand satellite-based technology by the end of the year 2015.  The railindustry has repeatedly requested and received waivers for thatdeadline because of the expense and complications of technology.  Onlyfour of 41 rail systems made that December 31st deadline.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  And the dysfunction in D.C. may have made it worse.  Thehead of the NTSB also says that life-saving information may have beenlost in the recent shutdown.</p><p>[04:40:01] Investigators are only now looking in to 97 transportationincidents that occurred during the shutdown.  In many cases, wreckagehad already been moved or altered and that impacts the ability tolearn potentially critical safety lessons.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Bud Light's Super Bowl commercial not sittingwell with corn farmers.  During the big game Sunday, Bud Lightreleased multiple commercials touting the fact that it is sweetenedwith rice rather than corn syrup.</p><p>The ad was meant to be funny.  The National Corn Growers Associationwas not laughing.  The group posted a tweet in response to the ad:American corn farmers are disappointed with you.  Thanks, Miller Lightand Coors Light for supporting our industry.</p><p>According to corn farmers group, a representative for the beer giant,e-mailed the association late Sunday asking for a meeting with farmersand Anheuser-Busch confirmed that it is in contact with the group.Corn farmers have taken a beating in the last year.  The trade war puta 25 percent tariff on U.S. corn exports which has left many farmersunable to sell their corn for what they consider a fair price.  Lastmonth's government shutdown closed the USDA offices that were incharge of processing farmers' relief payments to help offset lostrevenue because of tariffs.</p><p>Meant to be funny, corn farmers did not think that it was funny.</p><p>SANCHEZ;  Bud Light learning a lesson you know well, you're spendingtime in Iowa, you do not make fun of corn farmers.</p><p>ROMANS:  Nope.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Meantime, another major city in California could be headingfor a teacher's strike.  We'll tell you where, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[04:45:33] SANCHEZ:  Pope Francis making history, closing his historictrip to the United Arab Emirates, after celebrating mass.  He's thefirst pontiff ever to visit in Arab gulf state.</p><p>CNN's John Defterios is live in Abu Dhabi -- John.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, thanks very much, Boris.</p><p>Pope Francis finished his mass just over two hours ago and I have tosay, I've covered a lot of things in my 25 years in the business, butthis was in the category of extraordinary.  It was the first open airmass in the UAE, and therefore, in the Arabian Peninsula.  So it saysa lot.  Ten percent of the Christians in this country were in onevenue, and they are one a quarter million Christians in the UAE.  So the message overall for the UAE to have the pope here is one oftolerance, it is the year of tolerance.  But the pope carried thatmuch further, Boris, I think it is fair to say before he left theVatican, he spoke of Yemen and listening to the cries of the women andchildren in the battle of Yemen.  The UAE is involved with SaudiArabia and the coalition there.</p><p>And he said let's not make it the year of tolerance but the year ofpeace in Yemen and throughout the region.  I've been here since theArab spring in 2011 and suffering all kinds of turmoil, but I spentthe entire four hours on the ground here with parishioners fromLebanon, from the Palestinian territories, from India, the Philippinecommunity, British, and they all said the same thing.  He struck us inthe heart.</p><p>We don't know about the sex scandal in the United States and thechallenges that he has back at the Vatican, but when he did talk aboutpeace and it is possible and we can have an inner religious dialogue,it resonated with them.</p><p>He met with the grand imam of Egypt of al-Azhar University yesterdayand brought him to the service today and that was a very, very strongmessage that took place for them to see Christianity reaching out tothe Muslim community and saying we can have a dialogue that continuesafter this visit.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Yes, Pope Francis certainly not shy about reaching out toparts of the world that the church historically has not had the bestrelationship with.</p><p>John Defterios, thank you so much.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  The U.S. and South Korea are reaching apreliminary deal to keep nearly 30,000 troops in South Korea.  Themove easing fears among President Trump's advisors that he could moveto withdraw U.S. troops during his upcoming summit with North Koreanleader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>Under this agreement, South Korea would pay more, nearly a billiondollars per year, a $200 million increase.  This is not a long termfix.  It is only a one year agreement with the option of a one yearextension.  The U.S. special representative on North Korea will visitPyongyang tomorrow to prepare for that upcoming second summit betweenPresident Trump and Kim.</p><p>All right.  After some major turmoil, Apple trying to build acomeback.  CNN business is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[04:52:45] SANCHEZ:  School teachers in Oakland, California, havevoted to authorize a strike.  And according to their union, 95 percentare on board with a walkout.  The vote authorizes the OaklandEducation Association to call a strike after February 15th, that iswhen a neutral fact finder is expected to release a report designed tobridge the impasse.  The main issue is pay.  The school district is proposing a 5 percentpay raise over the next three years, the union instead asking for a 12percent increase, along with smaller class sizes and more support forstudents.</p><p>ROMANS:  In Hawaii, the victim of a possible shark attack in Kauai isin the hospital this morning.  Ocean safety officials closed theHanalei Bay where the incident took place.  They say that the victimhad been surfing had a spot commonly known as a bowl when he wasbitten by a large tiger shark.  The surfer sustained multiplelacerations to his leg.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Staying in Hawaii.  The state is considering a bill to bancigarette sales.  The measure is before the statehouse right now.  Andif it passes, it would raise the cigarette buying age to 30 by nextyear, 40 the year after that, with increases all the way up to age 100by 2024.  The staggered rollout gives the state time to adjust to lostcigarette tax revenue, about $100 million a year.  The age limitswould not apply to e-cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco andtourists of course could still Friday cigarettes with them.</p><p>Hawaii already has some of the most restricted cigarette laws in thenation.  In 2016, it became the first state in the nation to raise theage to buy cigarettes to 21.</p><p>ROMANS:  Some alarming research showing obesity related cancers arerising fast among millennials.  The American Cancer Society found thetrend among adults 24 to 49 which covers millennials and slightlyolder adults.  Six cancers showed startling increases among theyounger adults that usually show up later in life.  Overall the rateis about double of baby boomers.

Estimateof more than a billion adults are overweight.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Now, you may not know Austin Jones, but your kids might.YouTube star is facing time in prison for pressuring underage fans tosend him explicit videos.

At one point, more than 12,000 customers did not have power.</p><p>Meantime, police in Duval, Washington, took a moment to enjoy a snowday with local kids.  A serious snowball fight ensued.</p><p>Well, that system pounds the west, expect quite a warm up in the East.</p><p>CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Boris and Christine, goodmorning, guys.</p><p>Yes, the big time warmth widespread across portions of the south andworking towards the north.  The cold air beginning to seep in andenough wintry temperatures in place that at least across portions ofthe Upper Midwest, and you notice temps absolutely supportive of it aswell.  Minneapolis a high of only 16, Chicago at 31, not enough moistmakes it there in time to produce significant snow just yet, butgetting to overnight hours, you could see some of that mix in acrossthe area, but Minneapolis 6 to 8 inches is your forecast.  Just abouteveryone else gets in on decent rainfall.</p><p>But notice this, Chicago climbs up into the 40s, drops back down intothe teens by Friday.  Minneapolis down to one.  And even after theclimb in places like New York, of almost 60 degrees, we bring it backdown to reality just like that into the 40s.</p><p>And back towards the west, also watching some wintry weather into theinter-mountain west, parts of California, Washington state and Oregonhave seen significant snow, all of that shifting off toward the east.And expect decent snows into places such as Salt Lake City -- guys.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  A shocking admission to tell you about from actor LiamNeeson who says that he once contemplated racist revenge and he isexpressing regret for it.  Neeson tells the British newspaper \"TheIndependent\" that it happened years ago.  He didn't exactly say whereor when.  He says, though, that he took to the streets after learningthat loved one had been raped.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>LIAM NEESON, ACTOR:  I asked, did she know who it was?  No.  Whatcolor were they?  She said it was a black person.</p><p>I've gone up and down areas with a cosh hoping I'd be approached bysomebody.  I'm ashamed to say that.  And I did it for maybe a weekhoping some black bastard would come out of a pub and have a go at meabout something, you know?  So that I could kill him.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Neeson says it took him about a week to process what hadhappened.  When he looks back on it now, he says he is ashamed of hishorrible behavior.  The 66-year-old actor says growing up aroundviolence in Northern Ireland taught him that revenge ultimately didn'twork.</p><p>So why is he revealing this now?  Neeson gave the interview to promotehis new film \"Cold Pursuit\" in which he plays a father bent on revengeafter the death of his son.</p><p>ROMANS:  Let's go check on CNN Business this Tuesday morning.  Global stock markets are mostly higher.  Futures are slightly higherahead of the president's State of the Union Address.  The Dow gained175 points Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed up slightly, the Nasdaq closedup 1.2 percent.</p><p>It was a tech rally really yesterday.  Big tech stocks closed higher.Big gains if one day in tech.  Apple now up four days in a row,building a base after the 39 percent crash last year.</p><p>All right.

Aides say that he will appeal for compromise. But how will Democrats respond with a new speaker of the House looking over his shoulder?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: A subpoena related to the president's inaugural committee, prosecutors are probing possible conspiracy and illegal donations from abroad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SANCHEZ: Plus, a deal is reached to keep tens of thousands of U.S. troops in South Korea, a major commitment ahead of the president's next summit with Kim Jong-un.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS: And significant rise in cancer among millennials. The reason: obesity. This is pretty shocking this study finding that these younger Americans are having these rising rates of cancer.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START, everybody. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>SANCHEZ: And I'm Boris Sanchez, in for Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS: Nice to see you.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Great to see you, Christine.</p><p>We're 31 minutes past the hour. And tonight, President Trump delivers his second official State of the Union Address. It will be his first in this new era of divided government.</p><p>Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will sit over his shoulder after outmaneuvering him during the government shutdown, potentially a second one ahead. The speech comes in a critical time in his presidency with a divided Congress, another shutdown looming, the border wall issue, the Mueller investigation, the investigation in the Southern District of New York, the list goes on and on. Those and other issues the focus in Congress and elsewhere.</p><p>Administration officials have been previewing the president's address and the theme tonight is supposed to be choosing greatness.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, WHITE HOUSE COUNSELOR: This president is going to call for an end to the politics of resistance, retribution. He is calling for cooperation and he's calling for comity, C-O-M-I-T-Y, and also compromise.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Vice President Mike Pence and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney were among the officials briefing surrogates at the White House last night, they said the speech will be about 50 percent foreign policy, it will touch on infrastructure and lowering drug costs to areas, two areas where there might be some common ground with Democrats. Of course illegal immigration and the border wall still big issues. They may lead to another lapse of government funding late next week.</p><p>On that topic, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham had this message for his colleagues.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: To every Republican, if you don't stand behind this president, we're not going to stand behind you when it comes to the wall. This is the defining moment of his presidency. It is not just about a wall. It is about him being treated different than every other president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Sources inside the White House say that in the latest draft of the speech, the president does not declare a national emergency. Several Republican senators say they are deeply skeptical of the idea, mainly out of the worry their future Democratic president might then use the same excuse to fund their priorities.</p><p>The president's State of the Union guest list also highlights some of his key themes. That includes family members of a couple murdered by an undocumented immigrant, survivors of the Tree of Life synagogue massacre, a prison reform advocate, a man who benefited from tax cuts and this kid, a kid named Trump, sixth grader Joshua Trump, not related to the president, but the White House says he has been bullied at school because of his last name.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the Democratic Party, will deliver the response to the president's State of the Union. Abrams fell short of the 2018 Georgia governor's race, but energized liberal voters in the South. She will be the first African- American woman to give the Democratic response.</p><p>As for how she will prepare, Abrams says that she will hydrate first. That is a nod to Marco Rubio who awkwardly remember took sips of water during his response. At least four House Democrats will not be attending tonight's State of the Union. Fourteen Democrats skipped the president's address last year. SANCHEZ: Looming over the president's speech, President Trump's inaugural committee has been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors in New York. The move escalates a wide ranging inquiry into how a record $107 million was raised and spent. A copy of the subpoena reviewed by CNN demands documents related to donors, vendors and finances.</p><p>The investigation covers a long list of potential crimes. Listen to this -- they include conspiracy against the U.S., illegal contributions from foreign nations, and contributions in the name of another person, a process known as straw donations.</p><p>[04:35:05] ROMANS: \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported last year, the probe is looking at whether some donors gave money in exchange for access. A spokesman for the inaugural committee says the subpoena is being reviewed and that it is their intention to cooperate. It's worth noting, much of the committee's fund raising was headed by former Trump campaign official Rick Gates.</p><p>He pleaded guilty to a variety of felonies. He is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Another possibly messy confirmation ahead for the Trump administration, the president nominating Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to replace Ryan Zinke who resigned late last year amid controversy. Bernhardt is a former energy lobbyist and now, he is tapped to lead a department with the dual and what many say is contradictory missions of developing and protecting America's natural resources including oil and gas.</p><p>\"The Washington Post\" is reporting that Bernhardt lobbied for many of the businesses that he would now regulate. Last year, he said he was committed to avoiding conflicts of interest.</p><p>ROMANS: Dueling narratives over that racist photo that appeared on Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook page. A member of the school's 1984 yearbook staff tells CNN the photos were chosen by each student and submitted in a sealed envelope with the student's name on it. They were not chosen at random.</p><p>Governor Northam claims he never saw the photo in question before he was confronted with it last week. He is resisting calls to resign and said to be weighing his options. And now, the lieutenant governor who would take his place is facing a controversy of his own.</p><p>We get more from Ryan Nobles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Boris and Christine, good morning from Richmond, Virginia, where a lot has happened here, but not much has changed.</p><p>The Governor Ralph Northam still in office, his Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax still in that same position, but there is a lot of uncertainty about the future of both of these men. We know Ralph Northam gathered his cabinet on Monday for a very tenuous and what was described as a solemn meeting where he essentially begged his cabinet to stick with him, to give him more time to prove that he is not the person in this racist photo that has gotten so much attention.</p><p>In fact, Northam saying that he wants to stay in office in an effort to clear his good name because he did not want to resign and be thought of as a racist for life. Now, all of this drama surrounding about Northam comes at the same time that new report has emerged about the Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax who would take over were Northam were to resign. The accusation comes from a woman who accuses the lieutenant governor of sexual assault while they were both at the Democratic National Convention in 2004.</p><p>Fairfax however is not backing down. He vehemently denies this ever took place and he called and impromptu press conference yesterday to clear his name. Take a listen.</p><p>LT. GOV. JUSTIN FAIRFAX (D), VIRGINIA: You do now have something that was 15 years ago and yet you don't have a shred of corroboration, shred of evidence. You -- it was first posed a year ago. It went to the \"Washington Post\" and \"Washington Post\" made the decision not to run the story because it is false, it's uncorroborated. The reason it's uncorroborated is because false. You just go away until you find another opportunity to get back in the media.</p><p>NOBLES: Now, there is it no doubt that the new allegations against Fairfax complicate the situation here in Richmond. There is a lot of uncertainty about what the next 24, 48 hour or even the next week could bring.</p><p>For now, we know Ralph Northam has no plans to resign and that Justin Fairfax is not going to back down as these accusations are leveled against him -- Boris and Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANCHEZ: RBG is back in the house, or in a concert, I should say.</p><p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spotted, making her first public appearance Monday since undergoing cancer surgery in December. Ginsburg attended a performance of \"Notorious RBG in Song\" at the National Museum of Women and the Arts. Her daughter-in-law, soprano Patrice Michaels released an album of songs celebrated Ginsburg's life, and Ginsburg's son James produced the album. A bit of an underachieving family there.</p><p>The court has not said if she's actually going to attend tonight's State of the Union, but it is not really expected given that Ginsburg has missed both President Trump's previous addresses to Congress.</p><p>ROMANS: Rail accident investigators say there should be no more extensions for railroad operators to new train safety technology. According to the NTSB, positive train control system could have saved 303 lives and prevented 6,800 injuries over the last 50 years. Congress passed a law in 2008 requiring operators to install the radio and satellite-based technology by the end of the year 2015. The rail industry has repeatedly requested and received waivers for that deadline because of the expense and complications of technology. Only four of 41 rail systems made that December 31st deadline.</p><p>SANCHEZ: And the dysfunction in D.C. may have made it worse. The head of the NTSB also says that life-saving information may have been lost in the recent shutdown.</p><p>[04:40:01] Investigators are only now looking in to 97 transportation incidents that occurred during the shutdown. In many cases, wreckage had already been moved or altered and that impacts the ability to learn potentially critical safety lessons.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Bud Light's Super Bowl commercial not sitting well with corn farmers. During the big game Sunday, Bud Light released multiple commercials touting the fact that it is sweetened with rice rather than corn syrup.</p><p>The ad was meant to be funny. The National Corn Growers Association was not laughing. The group posted a tweet in response to the ad: American corn farmers are disappointed with you. Thanks, Miller Light and Coors Light for supporting our industry.</p><p>According to corn farmers group, a representative for the beer giant, e-mailed the association late Sunday asking for a meeting with farmers and Anheuser-Busch confirmed that it is in contact with the group. Corn farmers have taken a beating in the last year. The trade war put a 25 percent tariff on U.S. corn exports which has left many farmers unable to sell their corn for what they consider a fair price. Last month's government shutdown closed the USDA offices that were in charge of processing farmers' relief payments to help offset lost revenue because of tariffs.</p><p>Meant to be funny, corn farmers did not think that it was funny.</p><p>SANCHEZ; Bud Light learning a lesson you know well, you're spending time in Iowa, you do not make fun of corn farmers.</p><p>ROMANS: Nope.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Meantime, another major city in California could be heading for a teacher's strike. We'll tell you where, next.</p><p>[04:45:33] SANCHEZ: Pope Francis making history, closing his historic trip to the United Arab Emirates, after celebrating mass. He's the first pontiff ever to visit in Arab gulf state.</p><p>CNN's John Defterios is live in Abu Dhabi -- John.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, thanks very much, Boris.</p><p>Pope Francis finished his mass just over two hours ago and I have to say, I've covered a lot of things in my 25 years in the business, but this was in the category of extraordinary. It was the first open air mass in the UAE, and therefore, in the Arabian Peninsula. So it says a lot. Ten percent of the Christians in this country were in one venue, and they are one a quarter million Christians in the UAE. So the message overall for the UAE to have the pope here is one of tolerance, it is the year of tolerance. But the pope carried that much further, Boris, I think it is fair to say before he left the Vatican, he spoke of Yemen and listening to the cries of the women and children in the battle of Yemen. The UAE is involved with Saudi Arabia and the coalition there.</p><p>And he said let's not make it the year of tolerance but the year of peace in Yemen and throughout the region. I've been here since the Arab spring in 2011 and suffering all kinds of turmoil, but I spent the entire four hours on the ground here with parishioners from Lebanon, from the Palestinian territories, from India, the Philippine community, British, and they all said the same thing. He struck us in the heart.</p><p>We don't know about the sex scandal in the United States and the challenges that he has back at the Vatican, but when he did talk about peace and it is possible and we can have an inner religious dialogue, it resonated with them.</p><p>He met with the grand imam of Egypt of al-Azhar University yesterday and brought him to the service today and that was a very, very strong message that took place for them to see Christianity reaching out to the Muslim community and saying we can have a dialogue that continues after this visit.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, Pope Francis certainly not shy about reaching out to parts of the world that the church historically has not had the best relationship with.</p><p>John Defterios, thank you so much.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. The U.S. and South Korea are reaching a preliminary deal to keep nearly 30,000 troops in South Korea. The move easing fears among President Trump's advisors that he could move to withdraw U.S. troops during his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>Under this agreement, South Korea would pay more, nearly a billion dollars per year, a $200 million increase. This is not a long term fix. It is only a one year agreement with the option of a one year extension. The U.S. special representative on North Korea will visit Pyongyang tomorrow to prepare for that upcoming second summit between President Trump and Kim.</p><p>All right. After some major turmoil, Apple trying to build a comeback. CNN business is next.</p><p>[04:52:45] SANCHEZ: School teachers in Oakland, California, have voted to authorize a strike. And according to their union, 95 percent are on board with a walkout. The vote authorizes the Oakland Education Association to call a strike after February 15th, that is when a neutral fact finder is expected to release a report designed to bridge the impasse. The main issue is pay. The school district is proposing a 5 percent pay raise over the next three years, the union instead asking for a 12 percent increase, along with smaller class sizes and more support for students.</p><p>ROMANS: In Hawaii, the victim of a possible shark attack in Kauai is in the hospital this morning. Ocean safety officials closed the Hanalei Bay where the incident took place. They say that the victim had been surfing had a spot commonly known as a bowl when he was bitten by a large tiger shark. The surfer sustained multiple lacerations to his leg.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Staying in Hawaii. The state is considering a bill to ban cigarette sales. The measure is before the statehouse right now. And if it passes, it would raise the cigarette buying age to 30 by next year, 40 the year after that, with increases all the way up to age 100 by 2024. The staggered rollout gives the state time to adjust to lost cigarette tax revenue, about $100 million a year. The age limits would not apply to e-cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco and tourists of course could still Friday cigarettes with them.</p><p>Hawaii already has some of the most restricted cigarette laws in the nation. In 2016, it became the first state in the nation to raise the age to buy cigarettes to 21.</p><p>ROMANS: Some alarming research showing obesity related cancers are rising fast among millennials. The American Cancer Society found the trend among adults 24 to 49 which covers millennials and slightly older adults. Six cancers showed startling increases among the younger adults that usually show up later in life. Overall the rate is about double of baby boomers. On a global scale, the World Health Organization says obesity has reached epidemic proportions. Estimate of more than a billion adults are overweight.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Now, you may not know Austin Jones, but your kids might. YouTube star is facing time in prison for pressuring underage fans to send him explicit videos. Jones raked in millions of views with a cappella covers of hit songs. The 26-year-old who pleaded guilty to child pornography charge admits he attempted to persuade young girls to send him sexually explicit photos and videos about 30 times. Attorneys for Jones did not respond to a CNN request for a comment.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. This morning, Seattle digging out for them is a huge snowstorm, about half a foot fell, usually the amount they get all year. Schools will start two hours later today after being closed yesterday. At Sea-Tac Airport, flights were delayed after three hours. At one point, more than 12,000 customers did not have power.</p><p>Meantime, police in Duval, Washington, took a moment to enjoy a snow day with local kids. A serious snowball fight ensued.</p><p>Well, that system pounds the west, expect quite a warm up in the East.</p><p>CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Boris and Christine, good morning, guys.</p><p>Yes, the big time warmth widespread across portions of the south and working towards the north. The cold air beginning to seep in and enough wintry temperatures in place that at least across portions of the Upper Midwest, and you notice temps absolutely supportive of it as well. Minneapolis a high of only 16, Chicago at 31, not enough moist makes it there in time to produce significant snow just yet, but getting to overnight hours, you could see some of that mix in across the area, but Minneapolis 6 to 8 inches is your forecast. Just about everyone else gets in on decent rainfall.</p><p>But notice this, Chicago climbs up into the 40s, drops back down into the teens by Friday. Minneapolis down to one. And even after the climb in places like New York, of almost 60 degrees, we bring it back down to reality just like that into the 40s.</p><p>And back towards the west, also watching some wintry weather into the inter-mountain west, parts of California, Washington state and Oregon have seen significant snow, all of that shifting off toward the east. And expect decent snows into places such as Salt Lake City -- guys.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANCHEZ: A shocking admission to tell you about from actor Liam Neeson who says that he once contemplated racist revenge and he is expressing regret for it. Neeson tells the British newspaper \"The Independent\" that it happened years ago. He didn't exactly say where or when. He says, though, that he took to the streets after learning that loved one had been raped. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>LIAM NEESON, ACTOR: I asked, did she know who it was? No. What color were they? She said it was a black person.</p><p>I've gone up and down areas with a cosh hoping I'd be approached by somebody. I'm ashamed to say that. And I did it for maybe a week hoping some black bastard would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Neeson says it took him about a week to process what had happened. When he looks back on it now, he says he is ashamed of his horrible behavior. The 66-year-old actor says growing up around violence in Northern Ireland taught him that revenge ultimately didn't work.</p><p>So why is he revealing this now? Neeson gave the interview to promote his new film \"Cold Pursuit\" in which he plays a father bent on revenge after the death of his son.</p><p>ROMANS: Let's go check on CNN Business this Tuesday morning. Global stock markets are mostly higher. Futures are slightly higher ahead of the president's State of the Union Address. The Dow gained 175 points Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed up slightly, the Nasdaq closed up 1.2 percent.</p><p>It was a tech rally really yesterday. Big tech stocks closed higher. Big gains if one day in tech. Apple now up four days in a row, building a base after the 39 percent crash last year.</p><p>All right. Residents of high tax cities are heading south to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports new data suggests a jump in Florida home sales by buyers from high tax states like New York and New Jersey. According to analysis from real estate firm Zillow, home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than in high tax states like Jersey and New York where limiting the ability to deduct high state and local taxes eroded some of the savings from the federal tax reductions.</p><p>Papa John's has a plan to turn itself around with new board members and a big check. Papa John's announced that the hedge fund Starboard Value is investing $200 million in the struggling pizza chain. Papa John's also named Jeffrey Smith as its new chairman.</p><p>The change could lift them out of a year long slump. Sales have fallen takes scrambles to clean up their public relations mess.

Aides say that he will appeal forcompromise.  But how will Democrats respond with a new speaker of theHouse looking over his shoulder?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR:  A subpoena related to the president'sinaugural committee, prosecutors are probing possible conspiracy andillegal donations from abroad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SANCHEZ:  Plus, a deal is reached to keep tens of thousands of U.S.troops in South Korea, a major commitment ahead of the president'snext summit with Kim Jong-un.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS:  And significant rise in cancer among millennials.  Thereason: obesity.  This is pretty shocking this study finding thatthese younger Americans are having these rising rates of cancer.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START, everybody.  I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  And I'm Boris Sanchez, in for Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS:  Nice to see you.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Great to see you, Christine.</p><p>We're 31 minutes past the hour.  And tonight, President Trump delivershis second official State of the Union Address.  It will be his firstin this new era of divided government.</p><p>Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will sit over his shoulder afteroutmaneuvering him during the government shutdown, potentially asecond one ahead.  The speech comes in a critical time in hispresidency with a divided Congress, another shutdown looming, theborder wall issue, the Mueller investigation, the investigation in theSouthern District of New York, the list goes on and on.  Those andother issues the focus in Congress and elsewhere.</p><p>Administration officials have been previewing the president's addressand the theme tonight is supposed to be choosing greatness.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, WHITE HOUSE COUNSELOR:  This president is going tocall for an end to the politics of resistance, retribution.  He iscalling for cooperation and he's calling for comity, C-O-M-I-T-Y, andalso compromise.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  Vice President Mike Pence and Acting Chief of Staff MickMulvaney were among the officials briefing surrogates at the WhiteHouse last night, they said the speech will be about 50 percentforeign policy, it will touch on infrastructure and lowering drugcosts to areas, two areas where there might be some common ground withDemocrats.  Of course illegal immigration and the border wall stillbig issues.  They may lead to another lapse of government funding latenext week.</p><p>On that topic, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham had this message forhis colleagues.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  To every Republican, if youdon't stand behind this president, we're not going to stand behind youwhen it comes to the wall.  This is the defining moment of hispresidency.  It is not just about a wall.  It is about him beingtreated different than every other president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Sources inside the White House say that in the latest draftof the speech, the president does not declare a national emergency.Several Republican senators say they are deeply skeptical of the idea,mainly out of the worry their future Democratic president might thenuse the same excuse to fund their priorities.</p><p>The president's State of the Union guest list also highlights some ofhis key themes.  That includes family members of a couple murdered byan undocumented immigrant, survivors of the Tree of Life synagoguemassacre, a prison reform advocate, a man who benefited from tax cutsand this kid, a kid named Trump, sixth grader Joshua Trump, notrelated to the president, but the White House says he has been bulliedat school because of his last name.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the DemocraticParty, will deliver the response to the president's State of theUnion.  Abrams fell short of the 2018 Georgia governor's race, butenergized liberal voters in the South.  She will be the first African-American woman to give the Democratic response.</p><p>As for how she will prepare, Abrams says that she will hydrate first.That is a nod to Marco Rubio who awkwardly remember took sips of waterduring his response.  At least four House Democrats will not beattending tonight's State of the Union.  Fourteen Democrats skippedthe president's address last year.  SANCHEZ:  Looming over the president's speech, President Trump'sinaugural committee has been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors in NewYork.  The move escalates a wide ranging inquiry into how a record$107 million was raised and spent.  A copy of the subpoena reviewed byCNN demands documents related to donors, vendors and finances.</p><p>The investigation covers a long list of potential crimes.  Listen tothis -- they include conspiracy against the U.S., illegalcontributions from foreign nations, and contributions in the name ofanother person, a process known as straw donations.</p><p>[04:35:05] ROMANS:  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported last year, theprobe is looking at whether some donors gave money in exchange foraccess.  A spokesman for the inaugural committee says the subpoena isbeing reviewed and that it is their intention to cooperate.  It'sworth noting, much of the committee's fund raising was headed byformer Trump campaign official Rick Gates.</p><p>He pleaded guilty to a variety of felonies.  He is now cooperatingwith special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Another possibly messy confirmation ahead for the Trumpadministration, the president nominating Acting Interior SecretaryDavid Bernhardt to replace Ryan Zinke who resigned late last year amidcontroversy.  Bernhardt is a former energy lobbyist and now, he istapped to lead a department with the dual and what many say iscontradictory missions of developing and protecting America's naturalresources including oil and gas.</p><p>\"The Washington Post\" is reporting that Bernhardt lobbied for many ofthe businesses that he would now regulate.  Last year, he said he wascommitted to avoiding conflicts of interest.</p><p>ROMANS:  Dueling narratives over that racist photo that appeared onVirginia Governor Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook page.  Amember of the school's 1984 yearbook staff tells CNN the photos werechosen by each student and submitted in a sealed envelope with thestudent's name on it.  They were not chosen at random.</p><p>Governor Northam claims he never saw the photo in question before hewas confronted with it last week.  He is resisting calls to resign andsaid to be weighing his options.  And now, the lieutenant governor whowould take his place is facing a controversy of his own.</p><p>We get more from Ryan Nobles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Boris and Christine, goodmorning from Richmond, Virginia, where a lot has happened here, butnot much has changed.</p><p>The Governor Ralph Northam still in office, his Lieutenant GovernorJustin Fairfax still in that same position, but there is a lot ofuncertainty about the future of both of these men.  We know RalphNortham gathered his cabinet on Monday for a very tenuous and what wasdescribed as a solemn meeting where he essentially begged his cabinetto stick with him, to give him more time to prove that he is not theperson in this racist photo that has gotten so much attention.</p><p>In fact, Northam saying that he wants to stay in office in an effortto clear his good name because he did not want to resign and bethought of as a racist for life.  Now, all of this drama surroundingabout Northam comes at the same time that new report has emerged aboutthe Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax who would take over wereNortham were to resign.  The accusation comes from a woman who accusesthe lieutenant governor of sexual assault while they were both at theDemocratic National Convention in 2004.</p><p>Fairfax however is not backing down.  He vehemently denies this evertook place and he called and impromptu press conference yesterday toclear his name.  Take a listen.</p><p>LT. GOV. JUSTIN FAIRFAX (D), VIRGINIA:  You do now have something thatwas 15 years ago and yet you don't have a shred of corroboration,shred of evidence.  You -- it was first posed a year ago.  It went tothe \"Washington Post\" and \"Washington Post\" made the decision not torun the story because it is false, it's uncorroborated.  The reasonit's uncorroborated is because false.  You just go away until you findanother opportunity to get back in the media.</p><p>NOBLES:  Now, there is it no doubt that the new allegations againstFairfax complicate the situation here in Richmond.  There is a lot ofuncertainty about what the next 24, 48 hour or even the next weekcould bring.</p><p>For now, we know Ralph Northam has no plans to resign and that JustinFairfax is not going to back down as these accusations are leveledagainst him -- Boris and Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  RBG is back in the house, or in a concert, I should say.</p><p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spotted, making her firstpublic appearance Monday since undergoing cancer surgery in December.Ginsburg attended a performance of \"Notorious RBG in Song\" at theNational Museum of Women and the Arts.  Her daughter-in-law, sopranoPatrice Michaels released an album of songs celebrated Ginsburg'slife, and Ginsburg's son James produced the album.  A bit of anunderachieving family there.</p><p>The court has not said if she's actually going to attend tonight'sState of the Union, but it is not really expected given that Ginsburghas missed both President Trump's previous addresses to Congress.</p><p>ROMANS:  Rail accident investigators say there should be no moreextensions for railroad operators to new train safety technology.According to the NTSB, positive train control system could have saved303 lives and prevented 6,800 injuries over the last 50 years.Congress passed a law in 2008 requiring operators to install the radioand satellite-based technology by the end of the year 2015.  The railindustry has repeatedly requested and received waivers for thatdeadline because of the expense and complications of technology.  Onlyfour of 41 rail systems made that December 31st deadline.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  And the dysfunction in D.C. may have made it worse.  Thehead of the NTSB also says that life-saving information may have beenlost in the recent shutdown.</p><p>[04:40:01] Investigators are only now looking in to 97 transportationincidents that occurred during the shutdown.  In many cases, wreckagehad already been moved or altered and that impacts the ability tolearn potentially critical safety lessons.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Bud Light's Super Bowl commercial not sittingwell with corn farmers.  During the big game Sunday, Bud Lightreleased multiple commercials touting the fact that it is sweetenedwith rice rather than corn syrup.</p><p>The ad was meant to be funny.  The National Corn Growers Associationwas not laughing.  The group posted a tweet in response to the ad:American corn farmers are disappointed with you.  Thanks, Miller Lightand Coors Light for supporting our industry.</p><p>According to corn farmers group, a representative for the beer giant,e-mailed the association late Sunday asking for a meeting with farmersand Anheuser-Busch confirmed that it is in contact with the group.Corn farmers have taken a beating in the last year.  The trade war puta 25 percent tariff on U.S. corn exports which has left many farmersunable to sell their corn for what they consider a fair price.  Lastmonth's government shutdown closed the USDA offices that were incharge of processing farmers' relief payments to help offset lostrevenue because of tariffs.</p><p>Meant to be funny, corn farmers did not think that it was funny.</p><p>SANCHEZ;  Bud Light learning a lesson you know well, you're spendingtime in Iowa, you do not make fun of corn farmers.</p><p>ROMANS:  Nope.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Meantime, another major city in California could be headingfor a teacher's strike.  We'll tell you where, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[04:45:33] SANCHEZ:  Pope Francis making history, closing his historictrip to the United Arab Emirates, after celebrating mass.  He's thefirst pontiff ever to visit in Arab gulf state.</p><p>CNN's John Defterios is live in Abu Dhabi -- John.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, thanks very much, Boris.</p><p>Pope Francis finished his mass just over two hours ago and I have tosay, I've covered a lot of things in my 25 years in the business, butthis was in the category of extraordinary.  It was the first open airmass in the UAE, and therefore, in the Arabian Peninsula.  So it saysa lot.  Ten percent of the Christians in this country were in onevenue, and they are one a quarter million Christians in the UAE.  So the message overall for the UAE to have the pope here is one oftolerance, it is the year of tolerance.  But the pope carried thatmuch further, Boris, I think it is fair to say before he left theVatican, he spoke of Yemen and listening to the cries of the women andchildren in the battle of Yemen.  The UAE is involved with SaudiArabia and the coalition there.</p><p>And he said let's not make it the year of tolerance but the year ofpeace in Yemen and throughout the region.  I've been here since theArab spring in 2011 and suffering all kinds of turmoil, but I spentthe entire four hours on the ground here with parishioners fromLebanon, from the Palestinian territories, from India, the Philippinecommunity, British, and they all said the same thing.  He struck us inthe heart.</p><p>We don't know about the sex scandal in the United States and thechallenges that he has back at the Vatican, but when he did talk aboutpeace and it is possible and we can have an inner religious dialogue,it resonated with them.</p><p>He met with the grand imam of Egypt of al-Azhar University yesterdayand brought him to the service today and that was a very, very strongmessage that took place for them to see Christianity reaching out tothe Muslim community and saying we can have a dialogue that continuesafter this visit.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Yes, Pope Francis certainly not shy about reaching out toparts of the world that the church historically has not had the bestrelationship with.</p><p>John Defterios, thank you so much.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  The U.S. and South Korea are reaching apreliminary deal to keep nearly 30,000 troops in South Korea.

Piling on top of US lawmakers initiating anti-trust hearings, inquiries, and legislation against the Big Five, Trump on Tuesday warned \"we are watching Google very closely,\" while endorsing right-wing conspiracy theories that the tech major was attempting to thwart him from getting a second term in the White House.Two of the Big Five are led by Indian-Americans, and several PIOs are high executives in the other three, including half-a-dozen vice-presidents in Amazon. Trump specifically referred to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, tweeting \" @sundarpichai of Google was in the Oval Office working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China's military, that they didn't help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election, and that they are NOT planning to illegally subvert the 2020 Election despite all that has been said to the contrary.\" \"It all sounded good until I watched Kevin Cernekee, a Google engineer, say terrible things about what they did in 2016 and that they want to \"Make sure that Trump losses \" in 2020.\" Lou Dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the American public. </p><p>@peterschweizer stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on Hillary Clinton, and boosted negative stories on Donald Trump. All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!\" he added. The U.S President appeared to be referring to stories in the right-wing media, promoted assiduously by some Fox News anchors, that Google is fiddling with search results to suppress conservative views. One such story featuring Cernekee, a Google engineer who was fired for purportedly promoting alt-right, white supremacist views, was aired on Tuesday morning, triggering off a furious Trump Tweetstorm, which one tech site snarkily reported said was so great that the President misspelt his name (Trump instead of Trump). Peter Schweizer, the other person referred to in Trump's tweet, is a right-wing journalist who wrote Clinton Cash, a 2015 book that claimed donations made to the Clinton Foundation by foreign entities influenced them, including how they changed their views on India's nuclear tests after contributions from Indian interests. Trump's teeing off at Pichai, including suggesting he grovelled in the Oval Office, came even as ten U.S Senators, including White House aspirants Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, piled on to the Google CEO in a letter, calling on him to convert the vast ranks of temporary and contract workers in the company into full-time employees, while describing Google's current practice as an \"abuse\" of worker classifications. Google is reported to have 121,000 contractors compared to 102,000 full-time employees, and the former are typically paid less (approx. $ 90,000 per year compared to $ 128,000 for full-time workers) and have fewer benefits, which the company says is part of the standard industry practice. \"Google is valued at more than $100 billion, and your compensation topped $400 million in 2018, which makes it that much more difficult to stomach the mistreatment of these workers,\" the Senators' letter to Pichai said. \"It is not enough to insist that contracting and staffing companies pay at least $15 an hour and provide health care and paid parental leave because that standard is well below that set for Google's full-time employees. Google should convert contractors and temporary workers to full-time employees.\"Beyond the gripe about electoral manipulation and fair wages, Trump and the political establishment are increasingly coming to the view that big technology companies have become monopolies that need to be regulated or even broken up. \"Google has too much power, and they're using that power to hurt small businesses, stifle innovation, and tilt the playing field against everyone else,\" Elizabeth Warren said recently. \"It's time to fight back. That's why I have a plan to break up Google and the other big tech companies.\" Trump, on his part, has railed against Amazon, whose CEO Jeff Bezos owns Washington Post, which has been excoriating the President for his racist views.

A strong economy is central argument for his November re-election campaign. </p><p>'The market is setting a record. We set another record today,' Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. 'It will be the 144th time in a three-year period that I'm President.' </p><p>'And we have four trillion-dollar companies. One is Microsoft, one is Apple, one is Google, one is Amazon. So you have Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. And so, you have an M, you have an A, you have a G, and you have an A. You have MAGA,' he added. </p><p>He held up a sheet of paper showing how the first letters spelled out the initials of his campaign slogan: Make America Great Again.</p><p>The president, however, has a tense relationship with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post.</p><p>Trump routinely criticizes the Post for its coverage of his administration and labels stories he doesn't like 'fake news.'</p><p>Additionally Bezos is seeking testimony from President Trump and other top administration officials about how the tech giant was shut out of a $10billion military cloud computing contract, according to court documents made public on Monday.</p><p>As part of an evidence gathering phase of an appeal on the awarding of the 'JEDI' contract to upgrade the US military's computing networks, Amazon asked a judge to call for depositions of Trump and other administration figures including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and his predecessor, James Mattis.</p><p>'President Trump has unique knowledge about his involvement in the bid process, including private conversations with and instructions to others about the process and the award,' the filing read. </p><p>Amazon has alleged that Trump improperly intervened in the procurement process to deny the company the massive contract in late October. </p><p>The president does have better relations with Apple CEO Tim Cook, who he has met with at the White House. </p><p>The four stocks - Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, along with Apple and Microsoft - accounted for two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500's gain so far in 2020, DataTrek Research said in a note on Monday. The index is up 4.4% year-to-date.</p><p>Apple and Microsoft also account for 5% of the weight in MSCI's all-country world index, a closely-watched barometer of global stocks, according to Ned Davis Research. That amounts to a larger market value than 47 of the 48 non-U.S. country markets in the index, all but Japan, according to Ned Davis.</p><p>'It's just not sustainable,' said Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research.</p><p>The risk, Hayes said, is 'that at some point these stocks are no longer going to be propping up the market but instead weighing it down.'</p><p>'And that would happen in the U.S. and then the U.S. would weigh down the global trend,' Hayes said.</p><p>Trump's praise of the companies comes as US federal regulators are stepping up their investigation of the market dominance of five giant tech companies - the four the president mentioned plus Facebook - demanding detailed information on their acquisitions back to 2010.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued orders to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google's parent firm Alphabet.</p><p>The FTC, the Justice Department and a House committee have been investigating the conduct of big tech companies and whether they aggressively bought potential rivals to suppress competition and hurt consumers.</p><p>Some critics have pointed to Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, for example, as deals that should be questioned.</p><p>The popular messaging services are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has enabled it to snuff out competition.</p><p>The regulators' action could fuel expectations that as a result of the investigations, the government may require tech giants to unwind earlier acquisitions and divest companies. </p><p>'This initiative will enable the (FTC) to take a closer look at acquisitions in this important sector, and also to evaluate whether the federal agencies are getting adequate notice of transactions that might harm competition,' FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said in a statement.</p><p>The agency is asking the companies for information and documents on the terms, scope, structure and purpose of acquisitions made between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019.</p><p>Google faced antitrust scrutiny more than a decade ago over its acquisition of DoubleClick, a competitor in digital advertising.</p><p>Apart from the government and congressional investigations, state attorneys general from both political parties are conducting antitrust probes of Google and Facebook.</p><p>In the Google investigation, the attorneys general have asked the company for internal documents related to how it sells ads and tracks the behaviour of people who use its search engine and other products.</p><p>Spokespeople for the companies could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Rep David Cicilline, the chair of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust who is leading the panel's probe, has said that Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed the big tech companies to regulate themselves, enabling them to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><p>He has suggested that legislative changes may be needed, though he has called breaking up the companies a last resort.</p><p>'It is far too common to hear horror stories from startups and other small businesses about how a dominant platform's abrupt changes have destroyed their business,' Mr Cicilline said at a hearing last month at which executives from small and medium-sized tech companies testified.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-60225529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y69-5N71-JCJY-G3WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1100\"/><timeReceived>4:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The effort will touch on web search and other parts of Google, the report said. </p><p>The report comes amid discussion from politicians and the public about whether large technology companies should be broken up. The Justice Department launched a major antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998 that led to several rules the company had to follow for years. That's not the genius part. Justice Department Is Preparing Antitrust Investigation of Google - WSJ[2] The department's antitrust division in recent weeks has been laying the groundwork for the probe, the people said. The Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust authority with the department, previously conducted a broad antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action, though Google made some voluntary changes to certain business practices. The FTC and the department have been in talks recently on who would oversee any new antitrust investigation of a leading U.S. tech giant, and the commission agreed to give the Justice Department jurisdiction over Google, the people said. Getting this out of the clutches of a regulatory agency already captured by the industries it regulates, and handing it to the DOJ isn't the genius part, either.Sen. Elizabeth Warren has pressed for breaking up tech companies like Google, and the message has become a cornerstone of her presidential candidacy.He's going to bludgeon his enemies in Big Tech and at the same time peel votes away from the socialist left.

Experts poured scorn on the executive order Donald Trump signed on May 28th in reaction to a decision by Twitter, a microblogging service, to flag one of his tweets as unsubstantiated. The company had put warnings on a pair of tweets in which the president said: \"There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent\". Social-media firms are not liable in America for the content published on them, thanks to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). Mr Trump seems to be arguing that if they do not remain\u2014at least in his view\u2014politically neutral, they should lose that protection.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To many, the document seemed like a blatant attempt to bully Twitter, Facebook and other big tech firms into abandoning any efforts to fact-check the president's online utterances ahead of the election in November. In this, if nothing else, the executive order may succeed. But it will not end the debate over how to regulate speech in the virtual realm.</p><p>Section 230 and its analogues elsewhere were crafted to solve what might be called the \"moderator's dilemma\". In the mid-1990s regulators worried that online firms would refrain from policing their services for fear this would make them liable for the content and open them up to costly lawsuits. To solve this problem, section 230 stipulated that, even if firms moderated content, they could not be held liable for it. It does not, however, eliminate all liability for online content. Material that is copyrighted or violates federal criminal law must still be taken down. And those posting offending content can be sued, though this is often difficult and costly.</p><p>Much has changed since the CDA was passed in 1996. Few predicted back then the flood of invective and misinformation that now sloshes around online. Nor did they guess that social-media firms, fixated on growth and profitability, would do little to stem the tide until the negative effects became too egregious to deny. Big tech firms now employ armies of moderators and use artificial intelligence to police their services, but governments, particularly in Europe, want them to do more. Meanwhile, civil libertarians worry about the stifling impact on free speech. (And so, he claims, does Mr Trump.)</p><p>Section 230 and similar regulations have already gone through one round of mini-reforms. In May 2016 the European Union (EU) agreed to a \"Code of Conduct\" with Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube to counter online hate speech. It includes a commitment to deal with most offensive content within 24 hours. In 2017 Germany made compliance with such rules mandatory, while giving firms some leeway in how they apply them. And in 2018 Congress added communications that promote sex-trafficking to the list of content that is exempt from immunity.</p><p>A second round of reforms has now begun. The EU intends to follow the example of Germany, which itself is in the process of tightening its law, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz. Britain may soon get similar legislation. In America calls are growing to scrap section 230\u2014on the left as well as the right. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, is not a fan. But without such legislation social-media firms will probably err on the side of caution and become the \"ministries of truth\" that so many fear.</p><p>Governments, particularly in Europe, where limits on free speech are more acceptable, seem to be urging online firms to police their platforms more. Tech titans are unlikely to put up much resistance, since they have already begun monitoring more content in the wake of the pandemic (see Business section). Groups charged with overseeing the companies' decisions will become more common. They may be public agencies, as is planned in Britain, or semi-independent self-regulatory groups, such as Facebook's \"oversight board\", also known as its \"supreme court\", which in early May welcomed its first batch of judges. Perhaps one day Mr Trump can look forward to their rulings.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-FS8JOM6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602C-X281-DY2R-201H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

The market turned turtle in the afternoon when shop is out, I'll show you the numbers in a moment. A lot of nearly 200 points having been ducked - one, two, three, thank you very much. The market is now closed. The day is over, probably for the best, it is Tuesday, it is May the 23rd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, Donald Trump is accused of letting China take them to the cleaners on ZTE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mark Zuckerberg, again, says sorry this time to a different set of law makers. Tonight, they tell us they are not satisfied.</p><p>And never mind the Brexit, British stocks - it's another all time high.</p><p>I am Richard Quest, live in London, where of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. We have two stories that dominate the agenda tonight. Donald Trump under fire on Capitol Hill over his trade deal with China. The deal we have very few details about. And in Europe, in Brussels, Mark Zuckerberg apologizes to European law makers over Facebook's data policies and breaches.</p><p>And yet, Zuckerberg insists he is ready to make tough changes.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I expect that this increased investments in security will significantly impact our profitability, but I want to be clear, keeping people safe will always be more important than maximizing our profits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, you're going to hear a lot more from that hearing in just a moment. However, we begin tonight with ZTE.</p><p>They are three small letters, and they are now at the center of tensions in the hall of power. It's no longer just a source of trouble brewing between Beijing and Washington, now ZTE is pitting Republican versus Republican in the United States.</p><p>Remember, Donald Trump wants to save the Chinese company from going under. It's a massive U-turn for the Washington administration. They were the ones that sent it under in the first place when they refused it access to U.S. technology, but this is now angering his own party.</p><p>And Donald Trump is bullish about the deal with China.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you're losing $500 billion a year, you can't lose in terms of a negotiation, it's really easy to win, but I want this to be a great deal for the United States and I want it to be a very good deal for China, too, if that's possible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The President built himself as the ultimate deal maker. Some members of Congress from his own Party using that image to make that point.</p><p>Marco Rubio, there's no love lost really between the two men, a Republican senator, he says, China is out negotiating the U.S.. Rubio's claims this is not winning. On the Democrats side, the Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer says the administration proposals to punish ZTE do not go far enough.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATOR MINORITY LEADER, DEMOCRAT: The penalties that are proposed by Secretary Mnuchin are penalties in name only. They are a diversion from the fact that it seems President Xi has outmaneuvered President Trump and Secretary Mnuchin. The art of the deal, it should be President Xi who writes the book because he has taken us to the cleaners on ZTE.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Here is why this issue is complex and contentious. ZTE is known for its smart phones. Its technology powers cell networks around the world. The U.S. says it illegally shipped ZTE - illegally shipped equipment through Iran and North Korea, which is in breach of sanctions, and those regimes could use American technology against U.S. interest and their own people.</p><p>ZTE lied about whether it had punished employees involved, and on top of that, American intelligence says ZTE devices pose a security threat to their users.</p><p>So, that is why the American government cares or at least part of the American government. It has leverage because Chinese technology is powered by American components, more than a quarter of the device, some estimates.</p><p>What are we talking about? Well, let's just now look at this. You've got processes from Qualcomm, storage from SanDisk, glass from Corning, and the android operating system from Google.</p><p>American jobs will be affected if ZTE goes under, and the President says he is trying to balance everyone's interests.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: As far as ZTE is concerned, the President asked me to look into it and I am doing that, and don't forget for the ones that say, \"Oh, gee, maybe Trump is getting a little bit easy.\" ZTE, we closed it. It wasn't another administration. It was this administration that closed it. It's a phone company for those that don't know, a very large phone company. But it's also a phone company that buys a large portion of its parts...</p><p>[16:05:16]</p><p>TRUMP: ... that make up these phones and are sold all over the world from American companies. So, when you do that, you're really hurting American companies also. So, I am looking at it, but we were the ones that closed it. It wasn't done by previous administration. It was done by us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: CNN's Congressional Correspondent, Phil Mattingly is with me. And that's the problem. The President says, \"We were the ones that closed it.\" But it begs the question, why, if you're only going to reopen it again?</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, and I think the biggest issue right now, Richard, that you're hearing on Capitol Hill, you're hearing frankly from intelligence officials as well is that the President kind of how he views. The prism through which he views this, and that is as a trade negotiation. Obviously, talking about U.S. jobs, talking about how President Xi has repeatedly come to him and personally asked him to address this issue.</p><p>That is not the prism by which people in Capitol Hill and people in the intelligence committee view this issue. They view it as a national security issue and those are two things that they should believe, trade and national security should be separated.</p><p>Richard, just three or four minutes ago, a group of 25 senators including big names like you mentioned, Chuck Schumer, but also Republican leaders like John Cornyn, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton - these are hawkish Republicans, a lot of them close allies of the President just sending a letter to the administration saying, \"Export control and sanctions laws should not be negotiable because fidelity to the rule of law is a key part of what distinguishes the U.S. from a country like China.\"</p><p>Richard, this is escalating on Capitol Hill, and as you know, one of the big issues here is it's being escalated by some of the President's closest allies who were in sharp disagreement with the strategy here.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but ZTE has been around a long time. Is there concern on Capitol Hill, the sanctions busting enforcement for Iran and elsewhere, on North Korea or is it about the devices where it's claimed there is a national security threat by having just so many Chinese devices.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes, it's much more the latter than the former. I think every Republican Senator, even Democrats that I have talked to are talking about the intelligence concerns more so than the sanctions. They view the sanctions as a pathway to address the intelligence concerns, which is why they are very supportive of what the actions of the commerce department took earlier this year, but they don't believe that that's the biggest issue.</p><p>They believe it's the intel concerns, and Richard, you could see it hearing after hearing after hearing when you have national security officials up here being questioned by these senators, they ask every single one of them, would you personally use a ZTE phone? Would you allow anybody in your institution or in government to use it? Every single time, that national security official says, no, these senators are trying to make the case that this is an intel issue far more than a sanctions issue.</p><p>QUEST: Phil Mattingly, thank you, sir. Thank you for putting it in perspective. Mark Zuckerberg was already persona non grata amongst Europe's political elite. His testimony on Tuesday in Brussels apparently did not help his case.</p><p>The Facebook Chief Executive apologized to members to the European Parliament for Facebook's recent scandals, then he drew their anger by giving general answers to specific questions and ended the hearing before responding to all of their questions.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I'll make sure that we follow up with each of you afterwards to make sure that your specific questions get addressed and we are going to have someone come to do a full hearing soon to answer more of the technical questions as well, so thank you again, for inviting me and for having me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Zuckerberg, I think there was one question raised by Gifa Huset (ph) and that linked to my question and that's the separation of different services and I think it's a very important question in this round, the market power of Facebook and the question if you cross use for example data between Facebook and WhatsApp, so it would be good if you say at least one word to that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you allow users to escape targeted advertising? I mean, I asked you six yes and no questions, I got not a single answer, and of course, when you asked for this format, well, for a reason.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Okay, I will make sure we follow up and get you answers to those.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: When Zuckerberg appeared in front of the U.S. Congress last month, some American lawmakers asked confusing questions and didn't grasp the basics at hand. Europeans made it clear, they were coming prepared.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are here in terms of regulation and the United States is here. You've come here not to Congress, but to the European Union and we'd have expectations.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How many data categories do you store? Does Facebook store on the categories that you collect?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I am not actually sure what that is referring to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And what do you do with the non-Facebook data? Do you commercialize it and getting you to do that, is it morally acceptable, do you think in your opinion to collect non-Facebook user's data without them knowing what you do with it?</p><p>[16:10:16]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could somebody call you up and say, I want to see John Kennedy's file?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Absolutely not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could you not - would you do it? Could you do it?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: In theory - and we do not sell data to advertisers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You clearly rent it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have to ask yourself what - how you will be remembered as one of the three big internet giants together with Steve Jobs, I should say and Bill Gates who have enriched our world and our society, or the other hand, the fact that a genius will create a digital monster.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Can you top that with a telling and very deep question to Mark Zuckerberg. Samuel Burke is with me in Brussels. I know you were to talking to Guy afterwards, and that failure to answer all the questions in a format where they were all put together and he wasn't really forensically challenged. Did he do himself more harm than good?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A major missed opportunity on the European Parliament's part, and I don't think they could have foreseen the frustration that they would have with this format and therefore, Mr. Zuckerberg - though we have to clarify, Richard, this is the traditional format that is used in this type of hearing, in this institution. Now, the questions were very poignant, what really caught my attention is how they were tag-teaming with their U.S. counterparts, following up on questions from U.S. senators that Mark Zuckerberg was able to evade with his famous, \"I'll follow up with you. My team will follow up with you later.\"</p><p>The questions were - but this format of doing all of the questions first and then having Zuckerberg answer later was really just a futile experience in its totality, but I did get a chance to follow up with the former Prime Minister of Belgium, Guy Verhofstadt, who is the current MUP and asked about the frustrations not just with this format, but with Mr. Zuckerberg's response.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUY VERHOFSTADT, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF BELGIUM: On the very precise questions, he didn't give an accurate answer. For example, on GDPR, so the new European privacy rules. There is already proof of the fact that he doesn't apply it since the outbreak of Cambridge Analytica that EU data of non-EU citizens has been moved outside Europe, away from the Europeans that this is against European rules</p><p>BURKE: But do you really think that you're going to get those answers followed up in writing the way that you could have gone back and forth the way you and I are doing right now.</p><p>VERHOFSTADT: Exactly what I did at the end, but the question is the following - if they don't respond to the questions in a written form, it is clear what we are going to do as European Parliament and we are competent for that.</p><p>BURKE: What are you going to do?</p><p>VERHOFSTADT: First, strengthen the rules on the privacy...</p><p>BURKE: Stronger than GDPR.</p><p>VERHOFSTADT: Stronger than GDPR because it's clear that some of these rules need to be strengthened. For example, compensation, if there is an abuse of use of data, of Facebook users, they have a right on compensation...</p><p>BURKE: For the users, not just a fine because right now, you guys can fine Facebook $1.5 billion...</p><p>VERHOFSTADT: Exactly, but I think it's more important for the users that they have a compensation and not only...</p><p>BURKE: What do you do?</p><p>VERHOFSTADT: And secondly, it is to activate the European antitrust authorities because, in my opinion, it is clear that Facebook is a monopoly, a monopoly organizing all of social context on the internet, certainly after the takeover of Instagram.</p><p>So, there is no competition at all, and what scares me more is the fact that the explained and that was interesting, that is the only point that was interesting in this hearing. He explained how they scrutinized with several tens of thousands scrutinies, everything what you or I am boasting and deciding we are going to take it away, this is fake news. This is not fake news. This is hate speech. This is not hate speech.</p><p>In my opinion, that has to be done under the control of a public authority. We cannot outsource the protection of our citizens, their privacy, the rule of law, the fight against criminality, we cannot outsource it to a private company that has monopoly.</p><p>BURKE: But with all due respect, given how passionate you are about this issue, should this format be changed in the future if you have other social media executives in front of you?</p><p>VERHOFSTADT: Exactly. And that's the reason why we sent now these questions in a written procedure because that's the only way to have accurate answers on this. I have done a lot of hearings and any (inaudible) what they put on paper, that will count.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: Now, Richard, we know that Mark Zuckerberg's team at Facebook does follow up with the members of Parliament because we saw that happen with the U.S. Congress, but hard to see how they are going to get meatier answers than they could have in the back and forth.</p><p>You and I were live on air, and I could feel your frustration with the format, Richard...</p><p>[16:15:16]</p><p>BURKE: ... and we're feeling that frustration from the politicians already, so if you are watching this, you may have thought, well, it's going to be Mark Zuckerberg - easy for Mark Zuckerberg to pick and choose which questions he wants to answer, which is what he did. He answered a few tough ones, but in recycled bullet points.</p><p>But now, this frustration is spilling over to the UK where you are, where the member of Parliament, Damien Collins who has been very aggressive about Facebook is saying, \"This wasn't enough.\" He wants to have a try and I think before this, you could have said, \"Well, Mark Zuckerberg is coming to the European Parliament, you get all the European Parliament in one when you do this, but because there were so many questions left unanswered, maybe Damien Collins will get his opportunity in the UK Parliament.</p><p>QUEST: All right, Samuel Burke, stay with me for one second while we talk about one of the bigger issues at the moment.</p><p>As Facebook is grilled on privacy, European Union's sweeping data law, GDPR comes into effect on Friday. Now, GDPR as it's called, comes all sorts of personal information from bank details to social media posts, to medical information online.</p><p>Here is how it works. Anybody who is a European citizen, in fact, all companies now who do business with European citizens are sending e-mails to everybody saying that they now have to opt in. There will be no longer - it's a sort of a double opt-in process now involves ticking a box to accept marketing e-mails and to confirm.</p><p>You, me, we've all been swamped with e-mails at the moment asking us to opt-in. No more pre-ticked boxes. So opt-in is the first big thing. The second one is, there is now a right to be forgotten. If you ask your personal data must be erased and search engines like Google must be told as well so they can delete their records, too.</p><p>And finally, the burden, the burden is on the firms to prove they're handing data correctly and that might mean appointing a data protection officer and if a data breach does occur, and rules are broken, it must be reported within 72 hours. Fine us of up to 4% of global annual sales could be involved.</p><p>Pull all of these together and you see GDPR is the biggest change to hit data, not just in Europe, but in the world in the last 10 years. Samuel, is this workable?</p><p>BURKE: It's definitely workable and Mark Zuckerberg even said that they will already be in compliance by the time this goes into effect on Friday. What's incredible for me, Richard, is the fact that this was not done in response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Looking at it, you might guess that, but this was done two years ago, so it shows the foresight that the Europeans have and it shows really how Europe is setting the agenda here because even though as you just said, this is required for any company regardless of their base, if they have clients in the European Union, this is a standard that most of the tech companies, the big tech companies are going to adopt for people worldwide.</p><p>QUEST: Samuel Burke in Brussels, thank you. As we continue tonight on \"Quest Means Business\" regulation rolls back. U.S. lawmakers are about to vote on whether to throw out the banking rules put in place, the Dodd-Frank rules after the global financial crisis.</p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>QUEST: In a few minutes, Congress is expected to vote on whether to roll back some of the banking rules known as the Dodd-Frank. CNN's Clare Sebastian reports on the rules and how we got to this position.</p><p>(START VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is an indisputable fact that one of the most significant contributors to our economic downturn was an unraveling of major financial institutions and the lack of adequate regulatory structures.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In the turmoil that followed the 2008 financial crisis, the Obama administration set about rewriting the rules of Wall Street.</p><p>OBAMA: Today, my administration is proposing a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system. A transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that followed the Great Depression.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: In 2010, that transformation became law, the Dodd-Frank Act. Dodd-Frank was comprehensive. It required big banks to keep more capsule in reserve and it stopped them from trading using their own money.</p><p>It also set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau designed to protect consumers from risky lending practices, and above all, it tried to end the whole idea that some banks were too big to fail.</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMICS ANALYST: If you look at what causes financial crisis, it is always a fast run up in debt. It's always more leverage on the part of these large institutions, and Dodd-Frank did help them curb that.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Dodd-Frank was complicated though with 2,300 pages of regulations, and it was divisive and it passed Congress with almost no Republican support and that didn't change.</p><p>RICHARD SHELBY, U.S. SENATOR, ALABAMA, REPUBLICAN: Dodd-Frank legislation undermines the effectiveness of our regulators by asking them to do too much.</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The banks that had become bigger under Dodd-Frank are the big banks.</p><p>TRUMP: These regulations enshrine too big to fail and encourage risky behavior.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And its efforts to rein in the big banks, some argue Dodd-Frank hurts small community banks.</p><p>PAUL MERSKI, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY BANKERS OF AMERICA: Because of the over regulation, many banks have been merged up, consolidated and you have fewer and fewer choices for consumers and even greater concentration of assets in just a handful of banks.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: America's biggest banks are bigger now than before Dodd-Frank but they are also more stable.</p><p>Last year, for the first time, all of them passed the Federal Reserve's stress test.</p><p>MERSKI: It's really a smart time to look at what works, what doesn't work, what could be done better.</p><p>FOROOHAR: We're in a recovery. We're in the late stages of recovery. This is a time when we should be actually preparing for a rainy day, rather than trying to put more kerosene on the economy.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Clare Sebastian, CNNMoney, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Now, in that report, you saw Congressman Gregory Meeks standing beside President Obama when he signed Dodd-Frank into law. The Congressman joined me a short time ago, and he is concerned about what he calls the poison pills in the banking bill that could bring back discriminatory lending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D), NEW YORK: I would hope and we need to make sure that we put in place something strong and be able to watch with the regulators et cetera that we don't have redlining in the United States again that is very harmful and dangerous.</p><p>I grew up in a time where I saw a redlining, I saw what took place in 2008. I don't want that to happen again, but I want to banks to be able to - the community banks, the credit unions et cetera to be able to serve the communities in which they work in.</p><p>QUEST: If we look at the China trade deal that is now being put forth, admittedly, we have very few details about that. We have almost none whatsoever, but this linking to ZTE where even Senator Schumer has said ZTE is a national risk or a security risk. Do you have concerns?</p><p>MEEKS: Yes, I do. And I am you know, shocked that this President, I mean, I shouldn't say I am shocking this President because he flip flops all over the place. He, at one time had another position with regards to China, he was doing these dreadful tariffs. That is not the way to go with China.</p><p>And now, it seems as though he is trying to get something from China or China, so therefore, he has equivocated his position. In my estimation, the best way to deal with China is to have a rules based system that China and everyone else has to follow, and so by the President pulling out of TPP - the Transpacific Partnership, that is the best way to deal with China and to deal with trade in a collective basis in my estimation.</p><p>QUEST: So, what do you think is behind the ZTE --</p><p>[16:25:16]</p><p>QUEST: -- business? First commerce said it's going to go for enforcement, then President Xi steps in, then Donald Trump says, no, let's keep the thing going. Then you have a trade agreement or at least, the start. What's going on in your view, Congressman?</p><p>MEEKS: Well, let me tell you something, I've got a problem with our President of the United States. In fact, it wasn't me who said it. If you look at Mitt Romney and/or Ted Cruz and/or Marco Rubio, they all call him a con man, and so it is difficult to understand what the con is because it's wait and see and look, and trying to make sure you don't fall apart, but that's what it seems like to me.</p><p>He's juggling all up and to me, there is something nefarious that's going on behind the scenes whether it benefits his business or not, I don't know, but clearly, in my estimation, it's not helpful for the United States of America or any of our allies.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: In its 226-year history, never has the New York Stock Exchange had a day quite like today. A woman has been named President of the NYSE.</p><p>Stacey Cunningham was on the balcony for today's, Tuesday's, opening bell. She was formerly the Stock Exchange's Chief Operating Officer. She is also a familiar face on Quest Express. She joined us for example during Spotify's IPO last month, and she started as an intern and a market trader at this exchange.</p><p>Her ability to break that financial ceiling was paved by the women who came before that, such as Muriel Siebert. She was the first woman to hold a seat at the New York Stock Exchange. Maggie Lakes spoke to Stacey about Siebert's influence last year.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STACEY CUNNINGHAM, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE: If you look at the New York Stock Exchange, in itself can be a little larger than life sometimes, and so for Muriel Siebert to walk into an entirely male trading floor and say, I have the right to be here, and you're going to welcome me with open arms, and then have them turn around and do it, I think is such an accomplishment, not just for Muriel but for women throughout the world.</p><p>For me, personally and I started my career on the trading floor and I didn't give a single thought to whether or not I should be allowed to be there, and I didn't give that thought because we already did it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Stacey Cunningham's appointment comes at a time when corporate culture towards women is in a transformation. She won't be alone in the exchange, she will soon be joined by the famous, fearless girl statue.</p><p>As we continue, U.S. lawmakers say, President Trump isn't getting enough from China in trade negotiations. American and European automakers are finding plenty to like, in a moment.</p><p>[16:30:00] QUEST: Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. British stocks are knocking over record after record at an all time high for the FTSE, Sir Peter Westmacott will be with me in just a moment.</p><p>And I'll ask chief executive of Carnival Cruise, what it's like to sail toward an exploding volcano or maybe not the case maybe. As we continue, this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>During talks with South Korea's president, Donald Trump said the summit with North Korea's leader may not happen in June or indeed at all. They're scheduled for three weeks from today. Donald Trump's remarks are the strongest indication yet that the meetings at risk after the North threatened to pull out last week.</p><p>Thousands of rail workers, teachers, hospital staff and air traffic controllers are on strike across France, some clash with police's trade unions and more than a 100 cities protested against President Macron's economic reforms.</p><p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made their first official royal appearance as husband and wife on Tuesday. It was the 70th birthday party for Prince Charles. The newlyweds helped celebrate his charity work in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.</p><p>President Trump says he's not satisfied with trade talks, and investors weren't satisfied with that. Look at the numbers, the Dow gained vanished, it closed up -- I mean, it was from 2:30 in the afternoon, the market just went steadily lower and it closed off 179 points and now well back in the 25,000.</p><p>Car makers in the U.S. and Europe were however satisfied, shares of Ford, G.M., Chrysler, they were all high, not huge, but they were higher, particularly Ford, Chrysler. China says it will cut tariffs on imported cars from 25 percent to 15 percent.</p><p>Michael Hirson served as the U.S. Treasury's chief representative to Beijing. He's now the Asia director at the Eurasia Group. The issue with these tariffs, these car tariffs is China is sort of being intending to do something along these lines.</p><p>Anyway, we can't necessarily say this is as a result of these trade talks or can we?</p><p>MICHAEL HIRSON, ASIA DIRECTOR, EURASIA GROUP: Well, I think that's a very good point, and the agreement that the Chinese worked out with the Trump administration really is significant because it goes in the direction that China was largely already trying to go.</p><p>What China managed to do is put the hard issues and particularly those related to technology and industrial policy to the side for now.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but if we assume the president is not a fool and he's a deal maker that he says he is, he will be aware that if he -- if China is just stringing him along, not giving him a decent deal.</p><p>HIRSON: Well, that's right. It's not necessarily that the president didn't get anything from this agreement or really, it's just steps towards an agreement. It's a matter of priorities. The president sided with his camp in particular led by Secretary Mnuchin, the pragmatic camp that is looking to sell a deal based on China importing more from the U.S.</p><p>The camp that lost out led by U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer was pushing China to make deep changes to its economy, in particular, the set of concerns and policies related to technology and intellectual property.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>HIRSON: That's the side that lost out from the framework of an agreement that was agreed recently.</p><p>QUEST: Sir, you're the former Treasury expert on China. Is it your view that -- and I'm trying not to take you into just a sort of a political decision or you know, was the president led, was the president not, who won, who lost?</p><p>But is it your view that really China -- this is a missed opportunity, it is not the deal that everybody thinks it is.</p><p>HIRSON: I think yes, without making a political judgment, it is fair to say that because we can measure it against the objectives that the Trump administration has set for itself. And again, the objective was not just to have China commit to buy more from the U.S., but to make changes to really deep structural policies on market access, on the trade deficits and on industrial policies --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>HIRSON: With technology. And by that measure, this agreement and it's not a full agreement yet, we should just say, it's a framework of an agreement. It is really now going to enter into serious discussions. But based on what we know so far, it is fallen short of the benchmark that the administration had set.</p><p>[16:35:00] QUEST: Do you believe there was a quid pro quo over ZTA?</p><p>HIRSON: Well, I think quid pro quo is maybe ascribing nefarious purposes to some extent. The way that I would frame it is, President Trump clearly understood from Beijing that putting out of business, China's second largest telecom firm was going to be very difficult for the relationship.</p><p>He needs President Xi for a number of reasons, but in particular, to have the North Korea summit go well. And he made the judgment that the enforcement action that the Commerce Department had dialed up was too harsh in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>So was there a quid pro quo? In some sense, yes, it was to preserve the relationship, and clearly at the beginning stages of this discussion, there were some specific trade measures that China had agreed to.</p><p>But I think that the difficult part of the arrangement is that it puts in play the notion that a law enforcement action --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>HIRSON: It is subject to trade negotiations, and that's a difficult precedent to set.</p><p>QUEST: Michael Hirson, thank you for joining us, appreciate it. I'm told we're about to go on to get more details of this particular deal. As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live tonight from London, the FTSE here in Britain is at a record high, I wonder because we're in London, it's possible.</p><p>They like to deal with it whatsoever, the FTSE is at a record high, but we do need to understand why, particularly if the British economy is in such post-Brexit trouble.</p><p>QUEST: Back-to-back records on the London FTSE, the ninth record so far this year, that's definitely worth about -- if I was in New York by the way, we would be having the trading posts open it out and we will be notching them up for the FTSE.</p><p>It's closed up 1 percent higher and it's flirting with 8,000. Look at the way it all goes so far, market records in 2018, the NASDAQ is the number one, the FTSE easily handily beats out Germany's Dax which only had one, it's all probably thanks to the weaker dollar.</p><p>Investors are enjoying a trade war, and now ignoring the recent big dip has been on a tear, largely ignoring exactly the elephant in the room which is Brexit, which uniquely brings me to Sir Peter Westmacott, former U.K. ambassador to the U.S., Turkey and France. That's a nice collection, U.S., Turkey and France.</p><p>The FTSE, you're not a market economist as such, but the FTSE is doing very well when people like me tell me that the economy potentially could be in terrible trouble in the future and that the whole Brexit thing is an almighty mess. Square the circle for me.</p><p>PETER WESTMACOTT, FORMER U.K. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., TURKEY &amp; FRANCE: I would say a couple of things expertly. One, of course, the currency going right down which we did of the referendum means that the British exports are more competitive than it would be otherwise.</p><p>So we've had a fillip to our external trade. Secondly, there's very high levels of employment which just surprise people, but we're doing pretty well.</p><p>[16:40:00] Thirdly, I think the markets are beginning to say the risks are a really hard Brexit on a bus stop later this year are receding.</p><p>And the chances are probably that we spend a bit more time in a transitional arrangement which has calmed the markets down. And fourthly, this is what's happening in America, the risk of a trade war with China looks much more serious -- much less serious and much less even than we did before.</p><p>He still -- self together and he begins to reassure the markets for the time being.</p><p>QUEST: You had to -- you qualify it for the time being because you probably don't think it's going to last on this. We need to talk about Iran.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: We need to talk about Iran and the way in which the U.S. is promising -- Mike Pompeo just a day again, threatening to ratchet up the heaviest harsher sanctions ever.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: The secondary sanctions on European companies could be devastating.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: I think so too. It's a bit bizarre because there he is threatening Armageddon strike on Iran, at the same time as he wants to do a deal on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, you know, the sort of mismatch there.</p><p>QUEST: Why is that a mismatch?</p><p>WESTMACOTT: It's mismatch in view because on the one hand America hasn't reached the deal which is now torn off and says we want a better deal which isn't about that.</p><p>And on the other hand, he's saying to the Koreans, why don't you do a deal and trust us to mend it, and here's the evidence that America doesn't stick to its word if it does do a nuclear deal.</p><p>So it seems to me that on the one hand he wants diplomacy, on the other hand he's ripped up and the president is ripped up a bit of -- the one bit of successful diplomacy we've had on dealing with Iran's nuclear program in recent years.</p><p>QUEST: The president says -- on this argument, the president says though that the U.S. president -- no, that's not the case, we will do a deal with North Korea that he will be able to rely on.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: Yes, well, he says that. Let's see, I noticed the president today is not too sure whether the meeting is going to take place. Because quite rightly, they're going to have to make sure that this is going to be a substantive meeting which makes progress rather than pointless meeting.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Over the years, he's played a lot of games with the United States.</p><p>QUEST: But I -- because you're an expert on all of these. You've been to more summits than there are probably honest or decent. And but does it matter if you have a meeting that doesn't have a fruition.</p><p>Can you not say we got together and we built a relationship, it's the first step on a road to a greater thing. Are you not -- are you not putting too much pressure on this meeting?</p><p>WESTMACOTT: I don't think I am or we are. I think the point is, what is the level of expectation that is raised by that meeting. If you say there's going to be a big, beautiful, huge deal, and that's going to be the end of nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and then you achieve nothing at all, then I think that is a disappointment.</p><p>If you know the expectation, you say, we're just going to get to know each other, and that's fine and we'll see where that takes us.</p><p>QUEST: It's not exactly what Donald Trump has cleverly done. He said a couple of weeks ago standing with Angela Merkel, we will have a meeting, if it works, that's good, that's fine, and if it doesn't, that's fine too.</p><p>So he is managing expectations.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: I think there's a little element of realism here.</p><p>QUEST: Really?</p><p>WESTMACOTT: Because he's also saying we're going to have a nice meeting if we reach an agreement, North Korea is going to be fantastic, it's going to be rich, prosperous, great, successful country.</p><p>North Korea is never going to rich, prosperous, successful country, not in our life time as we should. So I think there's an element here of I may say it's a make belief, I'd be delighted if it works, but I think we have to be a little realistic.</p><p>And back to your point about Iran where diplomacy which was the key point of the Obama administration's approach to Iran and did produce a deal which Donald Trump doesn't like at all, you asked about the sanctions effect, you asked me about where that takes us all, and the answer is, it's extremely serious because although the European elements and the Russians and the Chinese would (INAUDIBLE) which is that deal do not want to go along with destroying that deal.</p><p>And do not want to go along with additional sanctions, there's going to be a big impact because of the importance of the all powerful dollar on global business that seeks to do what business with Iran.</p><p>So this is a big deal, you put a finger on something very important.</p><p>QUEST: OK, but if we don't look at anybody doing business with Donald Trump globally --</p><p>WESTMACOTT: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Always has to bear in mind that the man is a maverick and he might actually do what he says he's going to do.</p><p>WESTMACOTT: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: That has brought North Korea to the table. It has perhaps destroyed the Americans ability to be an honest broker in the Middle East. It brought South Korea to do a trade deal. It brought China to do a mercantilist trade deal.</p><p>Humor me if you will, Peter, is it not just possible that his strategy is bearing fruit?</p><p>WESTMACOTT: I think it is certainly possible, but by making a lot of noise, something on the table, using unconventional language and so on, you get the attention of the other side, you threaten them with Armageddon and they fight back and they say we're not going to do that.</p><p>And he says OK, let's sit down and see what we can do together. I think this unconventional approach does seem to be making some progress on some issues. I would add one, on China, yes, they reduced the automobile tariffs, but they were probably going to do that in any case.</p><p>They have not addressed the other issues like stealing the intellectual property at every single foreign investor in that country or the industrial policy issues which we all find offensive.</p><p>[16:45:00] But there's a movement and there's a mess of a risk of a big trade war, that is true.</p><p>And on the Korean Peninsula, let's see, I'm not saying it's a complete farce, it's absolutely not, and if it works, I shall be, you know, a cheerleader like everybody else, and delighted to wait.</p><p>The point I'm trying to make is that on the one hand with Iran, we've decided diplomacy doesn't work, and on the other hand in North Korea, we're saying let's give diplomacy a chance, there's a bit of a mismatch there.</p><p>QUEST: Delighted that you came and to help us understand it all. Thank you very much indeed --</p><p>WESTMACOTT: Thank you --</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, Peter. As we continue tonight, meter by meter alluvial(ph), the scale of devastation slowly grows. The lava from the volcano in Hawaii is close to claiming a power plant, and the extraordinary thing about this is there's nothing anybody can do about it.</p><p>QUEST: It is hypnotic, you cannot take your eyes off it. I could watch this for hours and hours. Slowly, but surely, the lava is coming out of the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii. And it's now approaching a geothermal power plant.</p><p>Stephanie Elam is in Niihau (ph) joins me now. I can only imagine what the power of this thing must feel like as you get there -- what is it? What is it actually like when you get close to this lava, this noise, this fire and fury coming from the ground?</p><p>STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I love all of your excitement, Richard, because you're right. It is mesmerizing and when you're here, all you want to do is get closer to it, even though those gases are toxic and they burn your eyes and your throat, you've got to wear gas masks to get anywhere near it.</p><p>But there's nothing like it. The orange of the magma coming out of the earth is such an intense orange, it almost looks like it's been digitally revived, even though you're looking at it with your own eyes.</p><p>There's that aspect of it, the gas is, there's a fact that it is now reached the ocean and it is now sending up a massive plume because when lava mixes with ocean water, it creates hydrochloric acid and there's even little particles of glass that are in there in that steam in that cloud that is consistently been lifting up.</p><p>But it's rivers of lava, and we were out here overnight, and you can see in the darkness that river of lava is making its way down the hill side. All of it like you said is mesmerizing, but it is --</p><p>QUEST: Stephanie?</p><p>ELAM: Also deadly in its beauty, and that's a huge part of it, what people here are concerned about.</p><p>QUEST: Stephanie, is there a feeling of helplessness in the sense that, you know, I mean, if there's a flood, you can build barriers, if there's a fire, you can try and put it out. But this is mother nature, this is doing what it wants to do and it seems as if there's nothing that we can do about it.</p><p>ELAM: It's pretty much true, there's no way to stop 2,000 degree lava that is rolling down a hill, there's nothing you can put in front of it, it was raining on and off pretty heavily yesterday, lava does not care.</p><p>[16:50:00] And so you talk to the people who have been displaced by this emergency and one woman -- she actually said -- a young woman, she just move here from California literally three months ago --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ELAM: Right before this happened, and she said, you know, it's like an ongoing drama and you can't just move on with your life. If you have a hurricane, a storm comes through, you clean up. With lava like this, you don't know how long it's going to go on, how long is eruptions going to happen, and for them, that is a very hard situation --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ELAM: And reality to live in.</p><p>QUEST: Stephanie Elam, thank you. Stephanie Elam joining us from there. And when I next see you, I need to have all the stories of what it was actually like to be there. This is one extraordinary.</p><p>Now, earlier this month, the Carnival Cruise has announced a cruise itinerary crossing the Pacific to Asia. It was going to go via Hawaii, and the Chief Executive Arnold Donald joins me from New York.</p><p>First of all, my apologies sir, I was meant to be with you, of course, live in the studio but the royal wedding got in the way and I'm still here in London, so my apologies that I'm not actually face-to-face with you.</p><p>But listen -- and you've had to reschedule or how are you handling the question of the Cruise and the Volcano?</p><p>ARNOLD DONALD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CARNIVAL CRUISE: Yes, first of all, greetings to you, Richard, I enjoyed some coverage that I saw of you on the royal wedding --</p><p>QUEST: Thank you --</p><p>DONALD: So thank you for that, you did a great job. You know, for us, we have very limited itineraries going there, so luckily there have been no injuries or anything like that --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DONALD: Period, which is great. It is a captivating natural thing to see of course some people have been displaced from their homes which is always kind of disturbing --</p><p>QUEST: Sure --</p><p>DONALD: But it is a wonderful, natural event -- nature event. And so at any event, I think on the Hilo side of the island, I think -- I get them confused to saying Hilo and Koloa, but one side is --</p><p>QUEST: Good point --</p><p>DONALD: Still receiving, the other side is not. So mobile, weak, move around and so it hasn't been an issue for us.</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk about the Carnival Horizon which arrives in New York, and it does so at the same time as you've got five years under your belt as chief executive which congratulations because most CEOs are gone in the company's average tenure.</p><p>The average tenure as you know is about two to three years, so you do it better than most. But listen, what do you see as your greatest achievement? Sounds a bit pompous but you know what I mean.</p><p>What are you most proud of what you've done to try and put Carnival back onto -- into its profitable forecasts?</p><p>DONALD: Well, I think I've been fortunate to lead a great team of 120,000- plus employees with some great travel partners in terms of travel professionals. And basically, you know, we're in the golden age of cruising. Cruising has expanded, our business has done very well all those five years, we mould and doubled our share price more than doubled our earnings, more than doubled our return on investor capital, all while exceeding guests expectations.</p><p>Like with the Carnival Horizon which we're going to name here in New York - -</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DONALD: As you mentioned, tomorrow, Queen Latifah will be the godmother, she's going to do a lip sync battle with the Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl --</p><p>QUEST: Movie --</p><p>DONALD: Kicker, and so that would be fun. But the ship has lots of features --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DONALD: But most importantly, it's engineered to exhibit the spirit of Carnival and to elevate the human spirit --</p><p>QUEST: So --</p><p>DONALD: It's all about people connecting.</p><p>QUEST: So what's your priority? I mean, I look at what you're doing at the moment, whether it's China, obviously you have to be there and you have to be there in larger numbers and larger ships. Dubai, you've got the deal over there --</p><p>DONALD: Right --</p><p>QUEST: Caribbean continues, you're just cruising. I mean, you've got lots of ships, you've got lots of potential and investment. What is your priority?</p><p>DONALD: My priority is exceeding our guests expectations. But in the last two weeks, I've been in Barcelona for the new terminal we opened there, I was in Dubai, spent a few minutes with the ruler of Dubai over the terminal work we're doing there.</p><p>Obviously, we were in Venice and I'm here in New York for the naming of the Carnival Horizon. I was in Malta for the naming of the Seabourn Ovation, as you know, we have nine, well, in cruise line brands and Seabourns are ultra luxury brand.</p><p>So I'm busy, and I move around a lot, but the number one priority is exceeding our guests expectations --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>DONALD: If we do that, everything else works.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, five years down, how many -- all right, come on, everybody asked you this, what you've got in five years, five years down, how many to go?</p><p>DONALD: Well, we'll see how long, the shadows want to keep me around the board, but what I can tell you is I'm in the vacation business, and so it's fun to be in the vacation business and it's certainly to be at Carnival Corporation.</p><p>So we're enjoying it and we hope we're making a difference.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir --</p><p>DONALD: Good to see you --</p><p>QUEST: Thank you for joining us, sir --</p><p>DONALD: Thank you --</p><p>QUEST: Always lovely to have you on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, thank you very much.</p><p>DONALD: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Let me just remind you the way the markets are looking at the moment and the way they're closed in New York as we hang the book over to Asia. The Dow Jones Industrials -- I mean, it's worth looking at because for no obvious reason, it felt quite sharply.</p><p>[16:55:00] And as you can see the reason, it's Boeing, Caterpillar, the big numbers of the Dow, even Home Depot, 3M, they were all sharply lower, and it is on the back of trade concerns about China.</p><p>This deal that the U.S. has done or that Donald Trump has done, the framework agreement that now has to be flashed out, the market is basically saying it is not -- it is skeptical about the ability to do so.</p><p>And with that, we'll have our profitable moment after the break -- now, where's the ship? Where is the ship?</p><p>QUEST: Profitable moment, really could just look at that, absolutely as the volcano in Hawaii continuing to spew out tons and tons of molten lava for hours and hours. Why are we telling you and talking about this tonight, because in a world where everything is certain, we need to know the results of the economy.</p><p>What will GDP growth be next year, next quarter, what will the companies' forecast be? How many jobs will be created? What will be the result of Brexit? The U.S.-China trade talks, how will they be resolved? And yet, you have this going on at the moment.</p><p>And thank God there has been no serious loss of lives as a result, on only one or two injuries as such. But this lava, there's nothing we can do about it. You've got that? Nothing. The earth is going to throw this up and yes, people will lose homes and there will be some people who will be injured and businesses will fail as a result.</p><p>That can be dealt with in some shape for form, at least economic damage. But this is all inspiring because this means we have no control. It's a reminder we ain't in charge. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.</p><p>Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable, I will see you tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018052201cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SCW-V641-DXH2-645W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 22, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The market  turned turtle in the afternoon when shop is out, I'll show you the numbers  in a moment.  A lot of nearly 200 points having been ducked - one, two,  three, thank you very much.  The market is now closed.  The day is over,  probably for the best, it is Tuesday, it is May the 23rd.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, Donald Trump is accused of letting China take them to the cleaners  on ZTE.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Mark Zuckerberg, again, says sorry this time to a different set of law  makers.  Tonight, they tell us they are not satisfied.  </p><p> And never mind the Brexit, British stocks - it's another all time high.  </p><p> I am Richard Quest, live in London, where of course, I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening.  We have two stories that dominate the agenda tonight.   Donald Trump under fire on Capitol Hill over his trade deal with China.   The deal we have very few details about.  And in Europe, in Brussels, Mark  Zuckerberg apologizes to European law makers over Facebook's data policies  and breaches.  </p><p> And yet, Zuckerberg insists he is ready to make tough changes.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I expect that this increased investments  in security will significantly impact our profitability, but I want to be  clear, keeping people safe will always be more important than maximizing  our profits.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, you're going to hear a lot more from that hearing in just a  moment.  However, we begin tonight with ZTE.  </p><p> They are three small letters, and they are now at the center of tensions in  the hall of power.  It's no longer just a source of trouble brewing between  Beijing and Washington, now ZTE is pitting Republican versus Republican in  the United States.  </p><p> Remember, Donald Trump wants to save the Chinese company from going under.   It's a massive U-turn for the Washington administration.  They were the  ones that sent it under in the first place when they refused it access to  U.S. technology, but this is now angering his own party.  </p><p> And Donald Trump is bullish about the deal with China.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  When you're losing $500  billion a year, you can't lose in terms of a negotiation, it's really easy  to win, but I want this to be a great deal for the United States and I want  it to be a very good deal for China, too, if that's possible.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  The President built himself as the ultimate deal maker.  Some  members of Congress from his own Party using that image to make that point.  </p><p> Marco Rubio, there's no love lost really between the two men, a Republican  senator, he says, China is out negotiating the U.S..  Rubio's claims this  is not winning.  On the Democrats side, the Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer  says the administration proposals to punish ZTE do not go far enough.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATOR MINORITY LEADER, DEMOCRAT:  The penalties that are  proposed by Secretary Mnuchin are penalties in name only.  They are a  diversion from the fact that it seems President Xi has outmaneuvered  President Trump and Secretary Mnuchin.  The art of the deal, it should be  President Xi who writes the book because he has taken us to the cleaners on  ZTE.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Here is why this issue is complex and contentious.  ZTE is known  for its smart phones.  Its technology powers cell networks around the  world.  The U.S. says it illegally shipped ZTE - illegally shipped  equipment through Iran and North Korea, which is in breach of sanctions,  and those regimes could use American technology against U.S. interest and  their own people.  </p><p> ZTE lied about whether it had punished employees involved, and on top of  that, American intelligence says ZTE devices pose a security threat to  their users.  </p><p> So, that is why the American government cares or at least part of the  American government.  It has leverage because Chinese technology is powered  by American components, more than a quarter of the device, some estimates.  </p><p> What are we talking about?  Well, let's just now look at this.  You've got  processes from Qualcomm, storage from SanDisk, glass from Corning, and the  android operating system from Google.  </p><p> American jobs will be affected if ZTE goes under, and the President says he  is trying to balance everyone's interests.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  As far as ZTE is concerned, the President asked me to look into it  and I am doing that, and don't forget for the ones that say, \"Oh, gee,  maybe Trump is getting a little bit easy.\"  ZTE, we closed it.  It wasn't  another administration.  It was this administration that closed it.  It's a  phone company for those that don't know, a very large phone company.  But  it's also a phone company that buys a large portion of its parts...  </p><p> [16:05:16]  </p><p> TRUMP:  ... that make up these phones and are sold all over the world from  American companies.  So, when you do that, you're really hurting American  companies also.  So, I am looking at it, but we were the ones that closed  it.  It wasn't done by previous administration.  It was done by us.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  CNN's Congressional Correspondent, Phil Mattingly is with me.  And  that's the problem.  The President says, \"We were the ones that closed it.\"   But it begs the question, why, if you're only going to reopen it again?  </p><p> PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right, and I think the  biggest issue right now, Richard, that you're hearing on Capitol Hill,  you're hearing frankly from intelligence officials as well is that the  President kind of how he views.  The prism through which he views this, and  that is as a trade negotiation.  Obviously, talking about U.S. jobs,  talking about how President Xi has repeatedly come to him and personally  asked him to address this issue.  </p><p> That is not the prism by which people in Capitol Hill and people in the  intelligence committee view this issue.  They view it as a national  security issue and those are two things that they should believe, trade and  national security should be separated.  </p><p> Richard, just three or four minutes ago, a group of 25 senators including  big names like you mentioned, Chuck Schumer, but also Republican leaders  like John Cornyn, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton - these are hawkish Republicans,  a lot of them close allies of the President just sending a letter to the  administration saying, \"Export control and sanctions laws should not be  negotiable because fidelity to the rule of law is a key part of what  distinguishes the U.S. from a country like China.\"  </p><p> Richard, this is escalating on Capitol Hill, and as you know, one of the  big issues here is it's being escalated by some of the President's closest  allies who were in sharp disagreement with the strategy here.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but ZTE has been around a long time.  Is there concern on  Capitol Hill, the sanctions busting enforcement for Iran and elsewhere, on  North Korea or is it about the devices where it's claimed there is a  national security threat by having just so many Chinese devices.  </p><p> MATTINGLY:  Yes, it's much more the latter than the former.  I think every  Republican Senator, even Democrats that I have talked to are talking about  the intelligence concerns more so than the sanctions.  They view the  sanctions as a pathway to address the intelligence concerns, which is why  they are very supportive of what the actions of the commerce department  took earlier this year, but they don't believe that that's the biggest  issue.  </p><p> They believe it's the intel concerns, and Richard, you could see it hearing  after hearing after hearing when you have national security officials up  here being questioned by these senators, they ask every single one of them,  would you personally use a ZTE phone?  Would you allow anybody in your  institution or in government to use it?  Every single time, that national  security official says, no, these senators are trying to make the case that  this is an intel issue far more than a sanctions issue.  </p><p> QUEST:  Phil Mattingly, thank you, sir.  Thank you for putting it in  perspective.  Mark Zuckerberg was already persona non grata amongst  Europe's political elite.  His testimony on Tuesday in Brussels apparently  did not help his case.  </p><p> The Facebook Chief Executive apologized to members to the European  Parliament for Facebook's recent scandals, then he drew their anger by  giving general answers to specific questions and ended the hearing before  responding to all of their questions.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  I'll make sure that we follow up with each of you afterwards  to make sure that your specific questions get addressed and we are going to  have someone come to do a full hearing soon to answer more of the technical  questions as well, so thank you again, for inviting me and for having me.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. Zuckerberg, I think there was one question raised  by Gifa Huset (ph) and that linked to my question and that's the separation  of different services and I think it's a very important question in this  round, the market power of Facebook and the question if you cross use for  example data between Facebook and WhatsApp, so it would be good if you say  at least one word to that?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Would you allow users to escape targeted advertising?   I mean, I asked you six yes and no questions, I got not a single answer,  and of course, when you asked for this format, well, for a reason.  </p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Okay, I will make sure we follow up and get you answers to  those.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  When Zuckerberg appeared in front of the U.S. Congress last month,  some American lawmakers asked confusing questions and didn't grasp the  basics at hand.  Europeans made it clear, they were coming prepared.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are here in terms of regulation and the United  States is here.  You've come here not to Congress, but to the European  Union and we'd have expectations.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many data categories do you store?  Does Facebook  store on the categories that you collect?  </p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I am not actually sure what that is referring to.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And what do you do with the non-Facebook data?  Do  you commercialize it and getting you to do that, is it morally acceptable,  do you think in your opinion to collect non-Facebook user's data without  them knowing what you do with it?  </p><p> [16:10:16]  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could somebody call you up and say, I want to see John  Kennedy's file?  </p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Absolutely not.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could you not - would you do it?  Could you do it?  </p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  In theory - and we do not sell data to advertisers.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You clearly rent it.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have to ask yourself what - how you will be  remembered as one of the three big internet giants together with Steve  Jobs, I should say and Bill Gates who have enriched our world and our  society, or the other hand, the fact that a genius will create a digital  monster.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Can you top that with a telling and very deep question to Mark  Zuckerberg.  Samuel Burke is with me in Brussels.  I know you were to  talking to Guy afterwards, and that failure to answer all the questions in  a format where they were all put together and he wasn't really forensically  challenged.  Did he do himself more harm than good?  </p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A major missed opportunity on the  European Parliament's part, and I don't think they could have foreseen the  frustration that they would have with this format and therefore, Mr.  Zuckerberg - though we have to clarify, Richard, this is the traditional  format that is used in this type of hearing, in this institution.  Now, the  questions were very poignant, what really caught my attention is how they  were tag-teaming with their U.S. counterparts, following up on questions  from U.S. senators that Mark Zuckerberg was able to evade with his famous,  \"I'll follow up with you.  My team will follow up with you later.\"  </p><p> The questions were - but this format of doing all of the questions first  and then having Zuckerberg answer later was really just a futile experience  in its totality, but I did get a chance to follow up with the former Prime  Minister of Belgium, Guy Verhofstadt, who is the current MUP and asked  about the frustrations not just with this format, but with Mr. Zuckerberg's  response.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> GUY VERHOFSTADT, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF BELGIUM:  On the very precise  questions, he didn't give an accurate answer.  For example, on GDPR, so the  new European privacy rules.  There is already proof of the fact that he  doesn't apply it since the outbreak of Cambridge Analytica that EU data of  non-EU citizens has been moved outside Europe, away from the Europeans that  this is against European rules  </p><p> BURKE:  But do you really think that you're going to get those answers  followed up in writing the way that you could have gone back and forth the  way you and I are doing right now.  </p><p> VERHOFSTADT:  Exactly what I did at the end, but the question is the  following - if they don't respond to the questions in a written form, it is  clear what we are going to do as European Parliament and we are competent  for that.  </p><p> BURKE:  What are you going to do?  </p><p> VERHOFSTADT:  First, strengthen the rules on the privacy...  </p><p> BURKE:  Stronger than GDPR.  </p><p> VERHOFSTADT:  Stronger than GDPR because it's clear that some of these  rules need to be strengthened.  For example, compensation, if there is an  abuse of use of data, of Facebook users, they have a right on  compensation...  </p><p> BURKE:  For the users, not just a fine because right now, you guys can fine  Facebook $1.5 billion...  </p><p> VERHOFSTADT:  Exactly, but I think it's more important for the users that  they have a compensation and not only...  </p><p> BURKE:  What do you do?  </p><p> VERHOFSTADT:  And secondly, it is to activate the European antitrust  authorities because, in my opinion, it is clear that Facebook is a  monopoly, a monopoly organizing all of social context on the internet,  certainly after the takeover of Instagram.  </p><p> So, there is no competition at all, and what scares me more is the fact  that the explained and that was interesting, that is the only point that  was interesting in this hearing.  He explained how they scrutinized with  several tens of thousands scrutinies, everything what you or I am boasting  and deciding we are going to take it away, this is fake news.  This is not  fake news.  This is hate speech.  This is not hate speech.  </p><p> In my opinion, that has to be done under the control of a public authority.   We cannot outsource the protection of our citizens, their privacy, the rule  of law, the fight against criminality, we cannot outsource it to a private  company that has monopoly.  </p><p> BURKE:  But with all due respect, given how passionate you are about this  issue, should this format be changed in the future if you have other social  media executives in front of you?  </p><p> VERHOFSTADT:  Exactly.  And that's the reason why we sent now these  questions in a written procedure because that's the only way to have  accurate answers on this.  I have done a lot of hearings and any  (inaudible) what they put on paper, that will count.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BURKE:  Now, Richard, we know that Mark Zuckerberg's team at Facebook does  follow up with the members of Parliament because we saw that happen with  the U.S. Congress, but hard to see how they are going to get meatier  answers than they could have in the back and forth.  </p><p> You and I were live on air, and I could feel your frustration with the  format, Richard...  </p><p> [16:15:16]  </p><p> BURKE:  ... and we're feeling that frustration from the politicians  already, so if you are watching this, you may have thought, well, it's  going to be Mark Zuckerberg - easy for Mark Zuckerberg to pick and choose  which questions he wants to answer, which is what he did.  He answered a  few tough ones, but in recycled bullet points.  </p><p> But now, this frustration is spilling over to the UK where you are, where  the member of Parliament, Damien Collins who has been very aggressive about  Facebook is saying, \"This wasn't enough.\"  He wants to have a try and I  think before this, you could have said, \"Well, Mark Zuckerberg is coming to  the European Parliament, you get all the European Parliament in one when  you do this, but because there were so many questions left unanswered,  maybe Damien Collins will get his opportunity in the UK Parliament.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, Samuel Burke, stay with me for one second while we talk  about one of the bigger issues at the moment.  </p><p> As Facebook is grilled on privacy, European Union's sweeping data law, GDPR  comes into effect on Friday.  Now, GDPR as it's called, comes all sorts of  personal information from bank details to social media posts, to medical  information online.  </p><p> Here is how it works.  Anybody who is a European citizen, in fact, all  companies now who do business with European citizens are sending e-mails to  everybody saying that they now have to opt in.  There will be no longer -  it's a sort of a double opt-in process now involves ticking a box to accept  marketing e-mails and to confirm.  </p><p> You, me, we've all been swamped with e-mails at the moment asking us to  opt-in.  No more pre-ticked boxes.  So opt-in is the first big thing.  The  second one is, there is now a right to be forgotten.  If you ask your  personal data must be erased and search engines like Google must be told as  well so they can delete their records, too.  </p><p> And finally, the burden, the burden is on the firms to prove they're  handing data correctly and that might mean appointing a data protection  officer and if a data breach does occur, and rules are broken, it must be  reported within 72 hours.  Fine us of up to 4% of global annual sales could  be involved.  </p><p> Pull all of these together and you see GDPR is the biggest change to hit  data, not just in Europe, but in the world in the last 10 years.  Samuel,  is this workable?  </p><p> BURKE:  It's definitely workable and Mark Zuckerberg even said that they  will already be in compliance by the time this goes into effect on Friday.   What's incredible for me, Richard, is the fact that this was not done in  response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Looking at it, you might  guess that, but this was done two years ago, so it shows the foresight that  the Europeans have and it shows really how Europe is setting the agenda  here because even though as you just said, this is required for any company  regardless of their base, if they have clients in the European Union, this  is a standard that most of the tech companies, the big tech companies are  going to adopt for people worldwide.  </p><p> QUEST:  Samuel Burke in Brussels, thank you.  As we continue tonight on  \"Quest Means Business\" regulation rolls back.  U.S. lawmakers are about to  vote on whether to throw out the banking rules put in place, the Dodd-Frank  rules after the global financial crisis.  </p><p> [16:20:00]  </p><p> QUEST:  In a few minutes, Congress is expected to vote on whether to roll  back some of the banking rules known as the Dodd-Frank.  CNN's Clare  Sebastian reports on the rules and how we got to this position.  </p><p> (START VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It is an indisputable  fact that one of the most significant contributors to our economic downturn  was an unraveling of major financial institutions and the lack of adequate  regulatory structures.  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  In the turmoil that followed the 2008  financial crisis, the Obama administration set about rewriting the rules of  Wall Street.  </p><p> OBAMA:  Today, my administration is proposing a sweeping overhaul of the  financial regulatory system.  A transformation on a scale not seen since  the reforms that followed the Great Depression.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  In 2010, that transformation became law, the Dodd-Frank Act.   Dodd-Frank was comprehensive.  It required big banks to keep more capsule  in reserve and it stopped them from trading using their own money.  </p><p> It also set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau designed to protect  consumers from risky lending practices, and above all, it tried to end the  whole idea that some banks were too big to fail.  </p><p> RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMICS ANALYST:  If you look at what causes  financial crisis, it is always a fast run up in debt.  It's always more  leverage on the part of these large institutions, and Dodd-Frank did help  them curb that.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Dodd-Frank was complicated though with 2,300 pages of  regulations, and it was divisive and it passed Congress with almost no  Republican support and that didn't change.  </p><p> RICHARD SHELBY, U.S. SENATOR, ALABAMA, REPUBLICAN:  Dodd-Frank legislation  undermines the effectiveness of our regulators by asking them to do too  much.  </p><p> MITT ROMNEY, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The banks that had become bigger  under Dodd-Frank are the big banks.  </p><p> TRUMP:  These regulations enshrine too big to fail and encourage risky  behavior.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  And its efforts to rein in the big banks, some argue Dodd-Frank  hurts small community banks.  </p><p> PAUL MERSKI, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY BANKERS OF  AMERICA:  Because of the over regulation, many banks have been merged up,  consolidated and you have fewer and fewer choices for consumers and even  greater concentration of assets in just a handful of banks.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  America's biggest banks are bigger now than before Dodd-Frank  but they are also more stable.  </p><p> Last year, for the first time, all of them passed the Federal Reserve's  stress test.  </p><p> MERSKI:  It's really a smart time to look at what works, what doesn't work,  what could be done better.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  We're in a recovery.  We're in the late stages of recovery.   This is a time when we should be actually preparing for a rainy day, rather  than trying to put more kerosene on the economy.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Clare Sebastian, CNNMoney, New York.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, in that report, you saw Congressman Gregory Meeks standing  beside President Obama when he signed Dodd-Frank into law.  The Congressman  joined me a short time ago, and he is concerned about what he calls the  poison pills in the banking bill that could bring back discriminatory  lending.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D), NEW YORK:  I would hope and we need to make sure  that we put in place something strong and be able to watch with the  regulators et cetera that we don't have redlining in the United States  again that is very harmful and dangerous.  </p><p> I grew up in a time where I saw a redlining, I saw what took place in 2008.   I don't want that to happen again, but I want to banks to be able to - the  community banks, the credit unions et cetera to be able to serve the  communities in which they work in.  </p><p> QUEST:  If we look at the China trade deal that is now being put forth,  admittedly, we have very few details about that.  We have almost none  whatsoever, but this linking to ZTE where even Senator Schumer has said ZTE  is a national risk or a security risk.  Do you have concerns?  </p><p> MEEKS:  Yes, I do.  And I am you know, shocked that this President, I mean,  I shouldn't say I am shocking this President because he flip flops all over  the place.  He, at one time had another position with regards to China, he  was doing these dreadful tariffs.  That is not the way to go with China.  </p><p> And now, it seems as though he is trying to get something from China or  China, so therefore, he has equivocated his position.  In my estimation,  the best way to deal with China is to have a rules based system that China  and everyone else has to follow, and so by the President pulling out of TPP  - the Transpacific Partnership, that is the best way to deal with China and  to deal with trade in a collective basis in my estimation.  </p><p> QUEST:  So, what do you think is behind the ZTE --</p><p> [16:25:16]  </p><p> QUEST:  -- business?  First commerce said it's going to go for enforcement,  then President Xi steps in, then Donald Trump says, no, let's keep the  thing going.  Then you have a trade agreement or at least, the start.   What's going on in your view, Congressman?  </p><p> MEEKS:  Well, let me tell you something, I've got a problem with our  President of the United States.  In fact, it wasn't me who said it.  If you  look at Mitt Romney and/or Ted Cruz and/or Marco Rubio, they all call him a  con man, and so it is difficult to understand what the con is because it's  wait and see and look, and trying to make sure you don't fall apart, but  that's what it seems like to me.  </p><p> He's juggling all up and to me, there is something nefarious that's going  on behind the scenes whether it benefits his business or not, I don't know,  but clearly, in my estimation, it's not helpful for the United States of  America or any of our allies.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> QUEST:  In its 226-year history, never has the New York Stock Exchange had  a day quite like today.  A woman has been named President of the NYSE.  </p><p> Stacey Cunningham was on the balcony for today's, Tuesday's, opening bell.   She was formerly the Stock Exchange's Chief Operating Officer.  She is also  a familiar face on Quest Express.  She joined us for example during  Spotify's IPO last month, and she started as an intern and a market trader  at this exchange.  </p><p> Her ability to break that financial ceiling was paved by the women who came  before that, such as Muriel Siebert.  She was the first woman to hold a  seat at the New York Stock Exchange.  Maggie Lakes spoke to Stacey about  Siebert's influence last year.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> STACEY CUNNINGHAM, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  If you look  at the New York Stock Exchange, in itself can be a little larger than life  sometimes, and so for Muriel Siebert to walk into an entirely male trading  floor and say, I have the right to be here, and you're going to welcome me  with open arms, and then have them turn around and do it, I think is such  an accomplishment, not just for Muriel but for women throughout the world.  </p><p> For me, personally and I started my career on the trading floor and I  didn't give a single thought to whether or not I should be allowed to be  there, and I didn't give that thought because we already did it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Stacey Cunningham's appointment comes at a time when corporate  culture towards women is in a transformation.  She won't be alone in the  exchange, she will soon be joined by the famous, fearless girl statue.  </p><p> As we continue, U.S. lawmakers say, President Trump isn't getting enough  from China in trade negotiations.  American and European automakers are  finding plenty to like, in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> [16:30:00] QUEST:  Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS in just a moment.  British stocks are knocking over record after  record at an all time high for the FTSE, Sir Peter Westmacott will be with  me in just a moment.</p><p> And I'll ask chief executive of Carnival Cruise, what it's like to sail  toward an exploding volcano or maybe not the case maybe.  As we continue,  this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first. </p><p> During talks with South Korea's president, Donald Trump said the summit  with North Korea's leader may not happen in June or indeed at all.  They're  scheduled for three weeks from today.  Donald Trump's remarks are the  strongest indication yet that the meetings at risk after the North  threatened to pull out last week.</p><p> Thousands of rail workers, teachers, hospital staff and air traffic  controllers are on strike across France, some clash with police's trade  unions and more than a 100 cities protested against President Macron's  economic reforms.</p><p> The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made their first official royal  appearance as husband and wife on Tuesday.  It was the 70th birthday party  for Prince Charles.  The newlyweds helped celebrate his charity work in the  gardens of Buckingham Palace.</p><p> President Trump says he's not satisfied with trade talks, and investors  weren't satisfied with that.  Look at the numbers, the Dow gained vanished,  it closed up -- I mean, it was from 2:30 in the afternoon, the market just  went steadily lower and it closed off 179 points and now well back in the  25,000. </p><p>Car makers in the U.S. and Europe were however satisfied, shares of Ford,  G.M., Chrysler, they were all high, not huge, but they were higher,  particularly Ford, Chrysler.  China says it will cut tariffs on imported  cars from 25 percent to 15 percent. </p><p> Michael Hirson served as the U.S. Treasury's chief representative to  Beijing.  He's now the Asia director at the Eurasia Group.  The issue with  these tariffs, these car tariffs is China is sort of being intending to do  something along these lines. </p><p> Anyway, we can't necessarily say this is as a result of these trade talks  or can we? </p><p> MICHAEL HIRSON, ASIA DIRECTOR, EURASIA GROUP:  Well, I think that's a very  good point, and the agreement that the Chinese worked out with the Trump  administration really is significant because it goes in the direction that  China was largely already trying to go. </p><p> What China managed to do is put the hard issues and particularly those  related to technology and industrial policy to the side for now.</p><p> QUEST:  Right, but if we assume the president is not a fool and he's a deal  maker that he says he is, he will be aware that if he -- if China is just  stringing him along, not giving him a decent deal. </p><p> HIRSON:  Well, that's right.  It's not necessarily that the president  didn't get anything from this agreement or really, it's just steps towards  an agreement.  It's a matter of priorities.  The president sided with his  camp in particular led by Secretary Mnuchin, the pragmatic camp that is  looking to sell a deal based on China importing more from the U.S.</p><p> The camp that lost out led by U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer  was pushing China to make deep changes to its economy, in particular, the  set of concerns and policies related to technology and intellectual  property. </p><p> QUEST:  Right. </p><p> HIRSON:  That's the side that lost out from the framework of an agreement  that was agreed recently. </p><p> QUEST:  Sir, you're the former Treasury expert on China.  Is it your view  that -- and I'm trying not to take you into just a sort of a political  decision or you know, was the president led, was the president not, who  won, who lost?</p><p> But is it your view that really China -- this is a missed opportunity, it  is not the deal that everybody thinks it is. </p><p> HIRSON:  I think yes, without making a political judgment, it is fair to  say that because we can measure it against the objectives that the Trump  administration has set for itself.  And again, the objective was not just  to have China commit to buy more from the U.S., but to make changes to  really deep structural policies on market access, on the trade deficits and  on industrial policies -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> HIRSON:  With technology.  And by that measure, this agreement and it's not  a full agreement yet, we should just say, it's a framework of an agreement.   It is really now going to enter into serious discussions.  But based on  what we know so far, it is fallen short of the benchmark that the  administration had set. </p><p> [16:35:00] QUEST:  Do you believe there was a quid pro quo over ZTA? </p><p> HIRSON:  Well, I think quid pro quo is maybe ascribing nefarious purposes  to some extent.  The way that I would frame it is, President Trump clearly  understood from Beijing that putting out of business, China's second  largest telecom firm was going to be very difficult for the relationship. </p><p> He needs President Xi for a number of reasons, but in particular, to have  the North Korea summit go well.  And he made the judgment that the  enforcement action that the Commerce Department had dialed up was too harsh  in the grand scheme of things. </p><p> So was there a quid pro quo? In some sense, yes, it was to preserve the  relationship, and clearly at the beginning stages of this discussion, there  were some specific trade measures that China had agreed to.</p><p> But I think that the difficult part of the arrangement is that it puts in  play the notion that a law enforcement action -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> HIRSON:  It is subject to trade negotiations, and that's a difficult  precedent to set. </p><p> QUEST:  Michael Hirson, thank you for joining us, appreciate it.  I'm told  we're about to go on to get more details of this particular deal.  As we  continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live tonight from London, the FTSE  here in Britain is at a record high, I wonder because we're in London, it's  possible. </p><p> They like to deal with it whatsoever, the FTSE is at a record high, but we  do need to understand why, particularly if the British economy is in such  post-Brexit trouble. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Back-to-back records on the London FTSE, the ninth record so far  this year, that's definitely worth about -- if I was in New York by the  way, we would be having the trading posts open it out and we will be  notching them up for the FTSE. </p><p> It's closed up 1 percent higher and it's flirting with 8,000.  Look at the  way it all goes so far, market records in 2018, the NASDAQ is the number  one, the FTSE easily handily beats out Germany's Dax which only had one,  it's all probably thanks to the weaker dollar. </p><p> Investors are enjoying a trade war, and now ignoring the recent big dip has  been on a tear, largely ignoring exactly the elephant in the room which is  Brexit, which uniquely brings me to Sir Peter Westmacott, former U.K.  ambassador to the U.S., Turkey and France.  That's a nice collection, U.S.,  Turkey and France. </p><p> The FTSE, you're not a market economist as such, but the FTSE is doing very  well when people like me tell me that the economy potentially could be in  terrible trouble in the future and that the whole Brexit thing is an  almighty mess.  Square the circle for me. </p><p> PETER WESTMACOTT, FORMER U.K. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., TURKEY &amp; FRANCE:  I  would say a couple of things expertly.  One, of course, the currency going  right down which we did of the referendum means that the British exports  are more competitive than it would be otherwise.</p><p> So we've had a fillip to our external trade.  Secondly, there's very high  levels of employment which just surprise people, but we're doing pretty  well.  </p><p> [16:40:00] Thirdly, I think the markets are beginning to say the risks are  a really hard Brexit on a bus stop later this year are receding.</p><p> And the chances are probably that we spend a bit more time in a  transitional arrangement which has calmed the markets down.  And fourthly,  this is what's happening in America, the risk of a trade war with China  looks much more serious -- much less serious and much less even than we did  before.</p><p> He still -- self together and he begins to reassure the markets for the  time being. </p><p> QUEST:  You had to -- you qualify it for the time being because you  probably don't think it's going to last on this.  We need to talk about  Iran.</p><p> WESTMACOTT:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  We need to talk about Iran and the way in which the U.S. is  promising -- Mike Pompeo just a day again, threatening to ratchet up the  heaviest harsher sanctions ever. </p><p> WESTMACOTT:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  The secondary sanctions on European companies could be devastating. </p><p> WESTMACOTT:  I think so too.  It's a bit bizarre because there he is  threatening Armageddon strike on Iran, at the same time as he wants to do a  deal on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, you know, the sort of  mismatch there. </p><p> QUEST:  Why is that a mismatch? </p><p> WESTMACOTT:  It's mismatch in view because on the one hand America hasn't  reached the deal which is now torn off and says we want a better deal which  isn't about that.  </p><p> And on the other hand, he's saying to the Koreans, why don't you do a deal  and trust us to mend it, and here's the evidence that America doesn't stick  to its word if it does do a nuclear deal. </p><p> So it seems to me that on the one hand he wants diplomacy, on the other  hand he's ripped up and the president is ripped up a bit of -- the one bit  of successful diplomacy we've had on dealing with Iran's nuclear program in  recent years.</p><p> QUEST:  The president says -- on this argument, the president says though  that the U.S. president -- no, that's not the case, we will do a deal with  North Korea that he will be able to rely on.</p><p> WESTMACOTT:  Yes, well, he says that.  Let's see, I noticed the president  today is not too sure whether the meeting is going to take place.  Because  quite rightly, they're going to have to make sure that this is going to be  a substantive meeting which makes progress rather than pointless meeting.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> Over the years, he's played a lot of games with the United States. </p><p> QUEST:  But I -- because you're an expert on all of these.  You've been to  more summits than there are probably honest or decent.  And but does it  matter if you have a meeting that doesn't have a fruition. </p><p> Can you not say we got together and we built a relationship, it's the first  step on a road to a greater thing.  Are you not -- are you not putting too  much pressure on this meeting? </p><p> WESTMACOTT:  I don't think I am or we are.  I think the point is, what is  the level of expectation that is raised by that meeting.  If you say  there's going to be a big, beautiful, huge deal, and that's going to be the  end of nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and then you achieve nothing  at all, then I think that is a disappointment. </p><p> If you know the expectation, you say, we're just going to get to know each  other, and that's fine and we'll see where that takes us.</p><p> QUEST:  It's not exactly what Donald Trump has cleverly done.  He said a  couple of weeks ago standing with Angela Merkel, we will have a meeting, if  it works, that's good, that's fine, and if it doesn't, that's fine too. </p><p> So he is managing expectations.</p><p> WESTMACOTT:  I think there's a little element of realism here.</p><p> QUEST:  Really? </p><p> WESTMACOTT:  Because he's also saying we're going to have a nice meeting if  we reach an agreement, North Korea is going to be fantastic, it's going to  be rich, prosperous, great, successful country.</p><p>North Korea is never going to rich, prosperous, successful country, not in  our life time as we should.  So I think there's an element here of I may  say it's a make belief, I'd be delighted if it works, but I think we have  to be a little realistic. </p><p> And back to your point about Iran where diplomacy which was the key point  of the Obama administration's approach to Iran and did produce a deal which  Donald Trump doesn't like at all, you asked about the sanctions effect, you  asked me about where that takes us all, and the answer is, it's extremely  serious because although the European elements and the Russians and the  Chinese would (INAUDIBLE) which is that deal do not want to go along with  destroying that deal.</p><p> And do not want to go along with additional sanctions, there's going to be  a big impact because of the importance of the all powerful dollar on global  business that seeks to do what business with Iran. </p><p> So this is a big deal, you put a finger on something very important. </p><p> QUEST:  OK, but if we don't look at anybody doing business with Donald  Trump globally -- </p><p> WESTMACOTT:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  Always has to bear in mind that the man is a maverick and he might  actually do what he says he's going to do.</p><p> WESTMACOTT:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  That has brought North Korea to the table.  It has perhaps  destroyed the Americans ability to be an honest broker in the Middle East.   It brought South Korea to do a trade deal.  It brought China to do a  mercantilist trade deal. </p><p> Humor me if you will, Peter, is it not just possible that his strategy is  bearing fruit? </p><p> WESTMACOTT:  I think it is certainly possible, but by making a lot of  noise, something on the table, using unconventional language and so on, you  get the attention of the other side, you threaten them with Armageddon and  they fight back and they say we're not going to do that. </p><p> And he says OK, let's sit down and see what we can do together.  I think  this unconventional approach does seem to be making some progress on some  issues.  I would add one, on China, yes, they reduced the automobile  tariffs, but they were probably going to do that in any case. </p><p> They have not addressed the other issues like stealing the intellectual  property at every single foreign investor in that country or the industrial  policy issues which we all find offensive.  </p><p> [16:45:00] But there's a movement and there's a mess of a risk of a big  trade war, that is true.</p><p> And on the Korean Peninsula, let's see, I'm not saying it's a complete  farce, it's absolutely not, and if it works, I shall be, you know, a  cheerleader like everybody else, and delighted to wait. </p><p> The point I'm trying to make is that on the one hand with Iran, we've  decided diplomacy doesn't work, and on the other hand in North Korea, we're  saying let's give diplomacy a chance, there's a bit of a mismatch there. </p><p> QUEST:  Delighted that you came and to help us understand it all.  Thank  you very much indeed -- </p><p> WESTMACOTT:  Thank you -- </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, Peter.  As we continue tonight, meter by meter  alluvial(ph), the scale of devastation slowly grows.  The lava from the  volcano in Hawaii is close to claiming a power plant, and the extraordinary  thing about this is there's nothing anybody can do about it. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  It is hypnotic, you cannot take your eyes off it.  I could watch  this for hours and hours.  Slowly, but surely, the lava is coming out of  the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii.  And it's now approaching a geothermal power  plant. </p><p> Stephanie Elam is in Niihau (ph) joins me now.  I can only imagine what the  power of this thing must feel like as you get there -- what is it? What is  it actually like when you get close to this lava, this noise, this fire and  fury coming from the ground? </p><p> STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I love all of your excitement, Richard,  because you're right.  It is mesmerizing and when you're here, all you want  to do is get closer to it, even though those gases are toxic and they burn  your eyes and your throat, you've got to wear gas masks to get anywhere  near it. </p><p> But there's nothing like it.  The orange of the magma coming out of the  earth is such an intense orange, it almost looks like it's been digitally  revived, even though you're looking at it with your own eyes. </p><p> There's that aspect of it, the gas is, there's a fact that it is now  reached the ocean and it is now sending up a massive plume because when  lava mixes with ocean water, it creates hydrochloric acid and there's even  little particles of glass that are in there in that steam in that cloud  that is consistently been lifting up. </p><p> But it's rivers of lava, and we were out here overnight, and you can see in  the darkness that river of lava is making its way down the hill side.  All  of it like you said is mesmerizing, but it is -- </p><p> QUEST:  Stephanie? </p><p> ELAM:  Also deadly in its beauty, and that's a huge part of it, what people  here are concerned about. </p><p> QUEST:  Stephanie, is there a feeling of helplessness in the sense that,  you know, I mean, if there's a flood, you can build barriers, if there's a  fire, you can try and put it out.  But this is mother nature, this is doing  what it wants to do and it seems as if there's nothing that we can do about  it.</p><p> ELAM:  It's pretty much true, there's no way to stop 2,000 degree lava that  is rolling down a hill, there's nothing you can put in front of it, it was  raining on and off pretty heavily yesterday, lava does not care.</p><p> [16:50:00] And so you talk to the people who have been displaced by this  emergency and one woman -- she actually said -- a young woman, she just  move here from California literally three months ago -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> ELAM:  Right before this happened, and she said, you know, it's like an  ongoing drama and you can't just move on with your life.  If you have a  hurricane, a storm comes through, you clean up.  With lava like this, you  don't know how long it's going to go on, how long is eruptions going to  happen, and for them, that is a very hard situation -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> ELAM:  And reality to live in. </p><p> QUEST:  Stephanie Elam, thank you.  Stephanie Elam joining us from there.   And when I next see you, I need to have all the stories of what it was  actually like to be there.  This is one extraordinary. </p><p> Now, earlier this month, the Carnival Cruise has announced a cruise  itinerary crossing the Pacific to Asia.  It was going to go via Hawaii, and  the Chief Executive Arnold Donald joins me from New York. </p><p> First of all, my apologies sir, I was meant to be with you, of course, live  in the studio but the royal wedding got in the way and I'm still here in  London, so my apologies that I'm not actually face-to-face with you. </p><p> But listen -- and you've had to reschedule or how are you handling the  question of the Cruise and the Volcano? </p><p> ARNOLD DONALD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CARNIVAL CRUISE:  Yes, first of  all, greetings to you, Richard, I enjoyed some coverage that I saw of you  on the royal wedding -- </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you -- </p><p> DONALD:  So thank you for that, you did a great job.  You know, for us, we  have very limited itineraries going there, so luckily there have been no  injuries or anything like that -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DONALD:  Period, which is great.  It is a captivating natural thing to see  of course some people have been displaced from their homes which is always  kind of disturbing -- </p><p> QUEST:  Sure -- </p><p> DONALD:  But it is a wonderful, natural event -- nature event.  And so at  any event, I think on the Hilo side of the island, I think -- I get them  confused to saying Hilo and Koloa, but one side is -- </p><p> QUEST:  Good point -- </p><p> DONALD:  Still receiving, the other side is not.  So mobile, weak, move  around and so it hasn't been an issue for us. </p><p> QUEST:  Let's talk about the Carnival Horizon which arrives in New York,  and it does so at the same time as you've got five years under your belt as  chief executive which congratulations because most CEOs are gone in the  company's average tenure. </p><p> The average tenure as you know is about two to three years, so you do it  better than most.  But listen, what do you see as your greatest  achievement? Sounds a bit pompous but you know what I mean.</p><p> What are you most proud of what you've done to try and put Carnival back  onto -- into its profitable forecasts? </p><p> DONALD:  Well, I think I've been fortunate to lead a great team of 120,000- plus employees with some great travel partners in terms of travel  professionals.  And basically, you know, we're in the golden age of  cruising.  Cruising has expanded, our business has done very well all those  five years, we mould and doubled our share price more than doubled our  earnings, more than doubled our return on investor capital, all while  exceeding guests expectations. </p><p> Like with the Carnival Horizon which we're going to name here in New York - - </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DONALD:  As you mentioned, tomorrow, Queen Latifah will be the godmother,  she's going to do a lip sync battle with the Philadelphia Eagles' Super  Bowl -- </p><p> QUEST:  Movie -- </p><p> DONALD:  Kicker, and so that would be fun.  But the ship has lots of  features -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DONALD:  But most importantly, it's engineered to exhibit the spirit of  Carnival and to elevate the human spirit -- </p><p> QUEST:  So -- </p><p> DONALD:  It's all about people connecting. </p><p> QUEST:  So what's your priority? I mean, I look at what you're doing at the  moment, whether it's China, obviously you have to be there and you have to  be there in larger numbers and larger ships.  Dubai, you've got the deal  over there -- </p><p> DONALD:  Right -- </p><p> QUEST:  Caribbean continues, you're just cruising.  I mean, you've got lots  of ships, you've got lots of potential and investment.  What is your  priority? </p><p> DONALD:  My priority is exceeding our guests expectations.  But in the last  two weeks, I've been in Barcelona for the new terminal we opened there, I  was in Dubai, spent a few minutes with the ruler of Dubai over the   terminal work we're doing there.</p><p> Obviously, we were in Venice and I'm here in New York for the naming of the  Carnival Horizon.  I was in Malta for the naming of the Seabourn Ovation,  as you know, we have nine, well, in cruise line brands and Seabourns are  ultra luxury brand.</p><p> So I'm busy, and I move around a lot, but the number one priority is  exceeding our guests expectations -- </p><p> QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p> DONALD:  If we do that, everything else works. </p><p> QUEST:  Finally, five years down, how many -- all right, come on, everybody  asked you this, what you've got in five years, five years down, how many to  go? </p><p> DONALD:  Well, we'll see how long, the shadows want to keep me around the  board, but what I can tell you is I'm in the vacation business, and so it's  fun to be in the vacation business and it's certainly to be at Carnival  Corporation. </p><p> So we're enjoying it and we hope we're making a difference. </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir -- </p><p> DONALD:  Good to see you -- </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you for joining us, sir -- </p><p> DONALD:  Thank you -- </p><p> QUEST:  Always lovely to have you on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, thank you very  much.</p><p> DONALD:  Thank you, Richard. </p><p> QUEST:  Let me just remind you the way the markets are looking at the  moment and the way they're closed in New York as we hang the book over to  Asia.  The Dow Jones Industrials -- I mean, it's worth looking at because  for no obvious reason, it felt quite sharply. </p><p> [16:55:00] And as you can see the reason, it's Boeing, Caterpillar, the big  numbers of the Dow, even Home Depot, 3M, they were all sharply lower, and  it is on the back of trade concerns about China. </p><p> This deal that the U.S. has done or that Donald Trump has done, the  framework agreement that now has to be flashed out, the market is basically  saying it is not -- it is skeptical about the ability to do so. </p><p> And with that, we'll have our profitable moment after the break -- now,  where's the ship? Where is the ship? </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Profitable moment, really could just look at that, absolutely as  the volcano in Hawaii continuing to spew out tons and tons of molten lava  for hours and hours.  Why are we telling you and talking about this  tonight, because in a world where everything is certain, we need to know  the results of the economy. </p><p> What will GDP growth be next year, next quarter, what will the companies'  forecast be? How many jobs will be created? What will be the result of  Brexit? The U.S.-China trade talks, how will they be resolved? And yet, you  have this going on at the moment. </p><p> And thank God there has been no serious loss of lives as a result, on only  one or two injuries as such.  But this lava, there's nothing we can do  about it.  You've got that? Nothing.  The earth is going to throw this up  and yes, people will lose homes and there will be some people who will be  injured and businesses will fail as a result. </p><p> That can be dealt with in some shape for form, at least economic damage.   But this is all inspiring because this means we have no control.  It's a  reminder we ain't in charge.  And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight,  I am Richard Quest in London.</p><p> Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable, I will  see you tomorrow. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

The market  turned turtle in the afternoon when shop is out, I'll show you the numbers  in a moment.  A lot of nearly 200 points having been ducked - one, two,  three, thank you very much.  The market is now closed.  The day is over,  probably for the best, it is Tuesday, it is May the 23rd.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, Donald Trump is accused of letting China take them to the cleaners  on ZTE.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mark Zuckerberg, again, says sorry this time to a different set of law  makers.  Tonight, they tell us they are not satisfied.  </p><p>And never mind the Brexit, British stocks - it's another all time high.  </p><p>I am Richard Quest, live in London, where of course, I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  We have two stories that dominate the agenda tonight.   Donald Trump under fire on Capitol Hill over his trade deal with China.   The deal we have very few details about.  And in Europe, in Brussels, Mark  Zuckerberg apologizes to European law makers over Facebook's data policies  and breaches.  </p><p>And yet, Zuckerberg insists he is ready to make tough changes.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I expect that this increased investments  in security will significantly impact our profitability, but I want to be  clear, keeping people safe will always be more important than maximizing  our profits.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, you're going to hear a lot more from that hearing in just a  moment.  However, we begin tonight with ZTE.  </p><p>They are three small letters, and they are now at the center of tensions in  the hall of power.  It's no longer just a source of trouble brewing between  Beijing and Washington, now ZTE is pitting Republican versus Republican in  the United States.  </p><p>Remember, Donald Trump wants to save the Chinese company from going under.   It's a massive U-turn for the Washington administration.  They were the  ones that sent it under in the first place when they refused it access to  U.S. technology, but this is now angering his own party.  </p><p>And Donald Trump is bullish about the deal with China.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  When you're losing $500  billion a year, you can't lose in terms of a negotiation, it's really easy  to win, but I want this to be a great deal for the United States and I want  it to be a very good deal for China, too, if that's possible.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  The President built himself as the ultimate deal maker.  Some  members of Congress from his own Party using that image to make that point.  </p><p>Marco Rubio, there's no love lost really between the two men, a Republican  senator, he says, China is out negotiating the U.S..  Rubio's claims this  is not winning.  On the Democrats side, the Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer  says the administration proposals to punish ZTE do not go far enough.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATOR MINORITY LEADER, DEMOCRAT:  The penalties that are  proposed by Secretary Mnuchin are penalties in name only.  They are a  diversion from the fact that it seems President Xi has outmaneuvered  President Trump and Secretary Mnuchin.  The art of the deal, it should be  President Xi who writes the book because he has taken us to the cleaners on  ZTE.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Here is why this issue is complex and contentious.  ZTE is known  for its smart phones.  Its technology powers cell networks around the  world.  The U.S. says it illegally shipped ZTE - illegally shipped  equipment through Iran and North Korea, which is in breach of sanctions,  and those regimes could use American technology against U.S. interest and  their own people.  </p><p>ZTE lied about whether it had punished employees involved, and on top of  that, American intelligence says ZTE devices pose a security threat to  their users.  </p><p>So, that is why the American government cares or at least part of the  American government.  It has leverage because Chinese technology is powered  by American components, more than a quarter of the device, some estimates.  </p><p>What are we talking about?  Well, let's just now look at this.  You've got  processes from Qualcomm, storage from SanDisk, glass from Corning, and the  android operating system from Google.  </p><p>American jobs will be affected if ZTE goes under, and the President says he  is trying to balance everyone's interests.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  As far as ZTE is concerned, the President asked me to look into it  and I am doing that, and don't forget for the ones that say, \"Oh, gee,  maybe Trump is getting a little bit easy.\"  ZTE, we closed it.  It wasn't  another administration.  It was this administration that closed it.  It's a  phone company for those that don't know, a very large phone company.  But  it's also a phone company that buys a large portion of its parts...  </p><p>[16:05:16]  </p><p>TRUMP:  ... that make up these phones and are sold all over the world from  American companies.  So, when you do that, you're really hurting American  companies also.  So, I am looking at it, but we were the ones that closed  it.  It wasn't done by previous administration.  It was done by us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  CNN's Congressional Correspondent, Phil Mattingly is with me.  And  that's the problem.  The President says, \"We were the ones that closed it.\"   But it begs the question, why, if you're only going to reopen it again?  </p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right, and I think the  biggest issue right now, Richard, that you're hearing on Capitol Hill,  you're hearing frankly from intelligence officials as well is that the  President kind of how he views.  The prism through which he views this, and  that is as a trade negotiation.  Obviously, talking about U.S. jobs,  talking about how President Xi has repeatedly come to him and personally  asked him to address this issue.  </p><p>That is not the prism by which people in Capitol Hill and people in the  intelligence committee view this issue.  They view it as a national  security issue and those are two things that they should believe, trade and  national security should be separated.  </p><p>Richard, just three or four minutes ago, a group of 25 senators including  big names like you mentioned, Chuck Schumer, but also Republican leaders  like John Cornyn, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton - these are hawkish Republicans,  a lot of them close allies of the President just sending a letter to the  administration saying, \"Export control and sanctions laws should not be  negotiable because fidelity to the rule of law is a key part of what  distinguishes the U.S. from a country like China.\"  </p><p>Richard, this is escalating on Capitol Hill, and as you know, one of the  big issues here is it's being escalated by some of the President's closest  allies who were in sharp disagreement with the strategy here.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but ZTE has been around a long time.  Is there concern on  Capitol Hill, the sanctions busting enforcement for Iran and elsewhere, on  North Korea or is it about the devices where it's claimed there is a  national security threat by having just so many Chinese devices.  </p><p>MATTINGLY:  Yes, it's much more the latter than the former.  I think every  Republican Senator, even Democrats that I have talked to are talking about  the intelligence concerns more so than the sanctions.  They view the  sanctions as a pathway to address the intelligence concerns, which is why  they are very supportive of what the actions of the commerce department  took earlier this year, but they don't believe that that's the biggest  issue.  </p><p>They believe it's the intel concerns, and Richard, you could see it hearing  after hearing after hearing when you have national security officials up  here being questioned by these senators, they ask every single one of them,  would you personally use a ZTE phone?  Would you allow anybody in your  institution or in government to use it?  Every single time, that national  security official says, no, these senators are trying to make the case that  this is an intel issue far more than a sanctions issue.  </p><p>QUEST:  Phil Mattingly, thank you, sir.  Thank you for putting it in  perspective.  Mark Zuckerberg was already persona non grata amongst  Europe's political elite.  His testimony on Tuesday in Brussels apparently  did not help his case.  </p><p>The Facebook Chief Executive apologized to members to the European  Parliament for Facebook's recent scandals, then he drew their anger by  giving general answers to specific questions and ended the hearing before  responding to all of their questions.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I'll make sure that we follow up with each of you afterwards  to make sure that your specific questions get addressed and we are going to  have someone come to do a full hearing soon to answer more of the technical  questions as well, so thank you again, for inviting me and for having me.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. Zuckerberg, I think there was one question raised  by Gifa Huset (ph) and that linked to my question and that's the separation  of different services and I think it's a very important question in this  round, the market power of Facebook and the question if you cross use for  example data between Facebook and WhatsApp, so it would be good if you say  at least one word to that?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Would you allow users to escape targeted advertising?   I mean, I asked you six yes and no questions, I got not a single answer,  and of course, when you asked for this format, well, for a reason.  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Okay, I will make sure we follow up and get you answers to  those.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  When Zuckerberg appeared in front of the U.S. Congress last month,  some American lawmakers asked confusing questions and didn't grasp the  basics at hand.  Europeans made it clear, they were coming prepared.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are here in terms of regulation and the United  States is here.  You've come here not to Congress, but to the European  Union and we'd have expectations.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many data categories do you store?  Does Facebook  store on the categories that you collect?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I am not actually sure what that is referring to.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And what do you do with the non-Facebook data?  Do  you commercialize it and getting you to do that, is it morally acceptable,  do you think in your opinion to collect non-Facebook user's data without  them knowing what you do with it?  </p><p>[16:10:16]  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could somebody call you up and say, I want to see John  Kennedy's file?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Absolutely not.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could you not - would you do it?  Could you do it?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  In theory - and we do not sell data to advertisers.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You clearly rent it.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have to ask yourself what - how you will be  remembered as one of the three big internet giants together with Steve  Jobs, I should say and Bill Gates who have enriched our world and our  society, or the other hand, the fact that a genius will create a digital  monster.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Can you top that with a telling and very deep question to Mark  Zuckerberg.  Samuel Burke is with me in Brussels.  I know you were to  talking to Guy afterwards, and that failure to answer all the questions in  a format where they were all put together and he wasn't really forensically  challenged.  Did he do himself more harm than good?  </p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A major missed opportunity on the  European Parliament's part, and I don't think they could have foreseen the  frustration that they would have with this format and therefore, Mr.  Zuckerberg - though we have to clarify, Richard, this is the traditional  format that is used in this type of hearing, in this institution.  Now, the  questions were very poignant, what really caught my attention is how they  were tag-teaming with their U.S. counterparts, following up on questions  from U.S. senators that Mark Zuckerberg was able to evade with his famous,  \"I'll follow up with you.  My team will follow up with you later.\"  </p><p>The questions were - but this format of doing all of the questions first  and then having Zuckerberg answer later was really just a futile experience  in its totality, but I did get a chance to follow up with the former Prime  Minister of Belgium, Guy Verhofstadt, who is the current MUP and asked  about the frustrations not just with this format, but with Mr. Zuckerberg's  response.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GUY VERHOFSTADT, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF BELGIUM:  On the very precise  questions, he didn't give an accurate answer.  For example, on GDPR, so the  new European privacy rules.  There is already proof of the fact that he  doesn't apply it since the outbreak of Cambridge Analytica that EU data of  non-EU citizens has been moved outside Europe, away from the Europeans that  this is against European rules  </p><p>BURKE:  But do you really think that you're going to get those answers  followed up in writing the way that you could have gone back and forth the  way you and I are doing right now.  </p><p>VERHOFSTADT:  Exactly what I did at the end, but the question is the  following - if they don't respond to the questions in a written form, it is  clear what we are going to do as European Parliament and we are competent  for that.  </p><p>BURKE:  What are you going to do?  </p><p>VERHOFSTADT:  First, strengthen the rules on the privacy...  </p><p>BURKE:  Stronger than GDPR.  </p><p>VERHOFSTADT:  Stronger than GDPR because it's clear that some of these  rules need to be strengthened.  For example, compensation, if there is an  abuse of use of data, of Facebook users, they have a right on  compensation...  </p><p>BURKE:  For the users, not just a fine because right now, you guys can fine  Facebook $1.5 billion...  </p><p>VERHOFSTADT:  Exactly, but I think it's more important for the users that  they have a compensation and not only...  </p><p>BURKE:  What do you do?  </p><p>VERHOFSTADT:  And secondly, it is to activate the European antitrust  authorities because, in my opinion, it is clear that Facebook is a  monopoly, a monopoly organizing all of social context on the internet,  certainly after the takeover of Instagram.  </p><p>So, there is no competition at all, and what scares me more is the fact  that the explained and that was interesting, that is the only point that  was interesting in this hearing.  He explained how they scrutinized with  several tens of thousands scrutinies, everything what you or I am boasting  and deciding we are going to take it away, this is fake news.  This is not  fake news.  This is hate speech.  This is not hate speech.  </p><p>In my opinion, that has to be done under the control of a public authority.   We cannot outsource the protection of our citizens, their privacy, the rule  of law, the fight against criminality, we cannot outsource it to a private  company that has monopoly.  </p><p>BURKE:  But with all due respect, given how passionate you are about this  issue, should this format be changed in the future if you have other social  media executives in front of you?  </p><p>VERHOFSTADT:  Exactly.  And that's the reason why we sent now these  questions in a written procedure because that's the only way to have  accurate answers on this.  I have done a lot of hearings and any  (inaudible) what they put on paper, that will count.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BURKE:  Now, Richard, we know that Mark Zuckerberg's team at Facebook does  follow up with the members of Parliament because we saw that happen with  the U.S. Congress, but hard to see how they are going to get meatier  answers than they could have in the back and forth.  </p><p>You and I were live on air, and I could feel your frustration with the  format, Richard...  </p><p>[16:15:16]  </p><p>BURKE:  ... and we're feeling that frustration from the politicians  already, so if you are watching this, you may have thought, well, it's  going to be Mark Zuckerberg - easy for Mark Zuckerberg to pick and choose  which questions he wants to answer, which is what he did.  He answered a  few tough ones, but in recycled bullet points.  </p><p>But now, this frustration is spilling over to the UK where you are, where  the member of Parliament, Damien Collins who has been very aggressive about  Facebook is saying, \"This wasn't enough.\"  He wants to have a try and I  think before this, you could have said, \"Well, Mark Zuckerberg is coming to  the European Parliament, you get all the European Parliament in one when  you do this, but because there were so many questions left unanswered,  maybe Damien Collins will get his opportunity in the UK Parliament.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, Samuel Burke, stay with me for one second while we talk  about one of the bigger issues at the moment.  </p><p>As Facebook is grilled on privacy, European Union's sweeping data law, GDPR  comes into effect on Friday.  Now, GDPR as it's called, comes all sorts of  personal information from bank details to social media posts, to medical  information online.  </p><p>Here is how it works.  Anybody who is a European citizen, in fact, all  companies now who do business with European citizens are sending e-mails to  everybody saying that they now have to opt in.  There will be no longer -  it's a sort of a double opt-in process now involves ticking a box to accept  marketing e-mails and to confirm.  </p><p>You, me, we've all been swamped with e-mails at the moment asking us to  opt-in.  No more pre-ticked boxes.  So opt-in is the first big thing.  The  second one is, there is now a right to be forgotten.  If you ask your  personal data must be erased and search engines like Google must be told as  well so they can delete their records, too.  </p><p>And finally, the burden, the burden is on the firms to prove they're  handing data correctly and that might mean appointing a data protection  officer and if a data breach does occur, and rules are broken, it must be  reported within 72 hours.  Fine us of up to 4% of global annual sales could  be involved.  </p><p>Pull all of these together and you see GDPR is the biggest change to hit  data, not just in Europe, but in the world in the last 10 years.  Samuel,  is this workable?  </p><p>BURKE:  It's definitely workable and Mark Zuckerberg even said that they  will already be in compliance by the time this goes into effect on Friday.   What's incredible for me, Richard, is the fact that this was not done in  response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Looking at it, you might  guess that, but this was done two years ago, so it shows the foresight that  the Europeans have and it shows really how Europe is setting the agenda  here because even though as you just said, this is required for any company  regardless of their base, if they have clients in the European Union, this  is a standard that most of the tech companies, the big tech companies are  going to adopt for people worldwide.  </p><p>QUEST:  Samuel Burke in Brussels, thank you.  As we continue tonight on  \"Quest Means Business\" regulation rolls back.  U.S. lawmakers are about to  vote on whether to throw out the banking rules put in place, the Dodd-Frank  rules after the global financial crisis.  </p><p>[16:20:00]  </p><p>QUEST:  In a few minutes, Congress is expected to vote on whether to roll  back some of the banking rules known as the Dodd-Frank.  CNN's Clare  Sebastian reports on the rules and how we got to this position.  </p><p>(START VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It is an indisputable  fact that one of the most significant contributors to our economic downturn  was an unraveling of major financial institutions and the lack of adequate  regulatory structures.  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  In the turmoil that followed the 2008  financial crisis, the Obama administration set about rewriting the rules of  Wall Street.  </p><p>OBAMA:  Today, my administration is proposing a sweeping overhaul of the  financial regulatory system.  A transformation on a scale not seen since  the reforms that followed the Great Depression.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  In 2010, that transformation became law, the Dodd-Frank Act.   Dodd-Frank was comprehensive.  It required big banks to keep more capsule  in reserve and it stopped them from trading using their own money.  </p><p>It also set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau designed to protect  consumers from risky lending practices, and above all, it tried to end the  whole idea that some banks were too big to fail.  </p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMICS ANALYST:  If you look at what causes  financial crisis, it is always a fast run up in debt.  It's always more  leverage on the part of these large institutions, and Dodd-Frank did help  them curb that.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Dodd-Frank was complicated though with 2,300 pages of  regulations, and it was divisive and it passed Congress with almost no  Republican support and that didn't change.  </p><p>RICHARD SHELBY, U.S. SENATOR, ALABAMA, REPUBLICAN:  Dodd-Frank legislation  undermines the effectiveness of our regulators by asking them to do too  much.  </p><p>MITT ROMNEY, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The banks that had become bigger  under Dodd-Frank are the big banks.  </p><p>TRUMP:  These regulations enshrine too big to fail and encourage risky  behavior.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  And its efforts to rein in the big banks, some argue Dodd-Frank  hurts small community banks.  </p><p>PAUL MERSKI, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY BANKERS OF  AMERICA:  Because of the over regulation, many banks have been merged up,  consolidated and you have fewer and fewer choices for consumers and even  greater concentration of assets in just a handful of banks.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  America's biggest banks are bigger now than before Dodd-Frank  but they are also more stable.  </p><p>Last year, for the first time, all of them passed the Federal Reserve's  stress test.  </p><p>MERSKI:  It's really a smart time to look at what works, what doesn't work,  what could be done better.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  We're in a recovery.  We're in the late stages of recovery.   This is a time when we should be actually preparing for a rainy day, rather  than trying to put more kerosene on the economy.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Clare Sebastian, CNNMoney, New York.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, in that report, you saw Congressman Gregory Meeks standing  beside President Obama when he signed Dodd-Frank into law.  The Congressman  joined me a short time ago, and he is concerned about what he calls the  poison pills in the banking bill that could bring back discriminatory  lending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D), NEW YORK:  I would hope and we need to make sure  that we put in place something strong and be able to watch with the  regulators et cetera that we don't have redlining in the United States  again that is very harmful and dangerous.  </p><p>I grew up in a time where I saw a redlining, I saw what took place in 2008.   I don't want that to happen again, but I want to banks to be able to - the  community banks, the credit unions et cetera to be able to serve the  communities in which they work in.  </p><p>QUEST:  If we look at the China trade deal that is now being put forth,  admittedly, we have very few details about that.  We have almost none  whatsoever, but this linking to ZTE where even Senator Schumer has said ZTE  is a national risk or a security risk.  Do you have concerns?  </p><p>MEEKS:  Yes, I do.  And I am you know, shocked that this President, I mean,  I shouldn't say I am shocking this President because he flip flops all over  the place.  He, at one time had another position with regards to China, he  was doing these dreadful tariffs.  That is not the way to go with China.  </p><p>And now, it seems as though he is trying to get something from China or  China, so therefore, he has equivocated his position.  In my estimation,  the best way to deal with China is to have a rules based system that China  and everyone else has to follow, and so by the President pulling out of TPP  - the Transpacific Partnership, that is the best way to deal with China and  to deal with trade in a collective basis in my estimation.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, what do you think is behind the ZTE --</p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>QUEST:  -- business?  First commerce said it's going to go for enforcement,  then President Xi steps in, then Donald Trump says, no, let's keep the  thing going.  Then you have a trade agreement or at least, the start.   What's going on in your view, Congressman?  </p><p>MEEKS:  Well, let me tell you something, I've got a problem with our  President of the United States.  In fact, it wasn't me who said it.  If you  look at Mitt Romney and/or Ted Cruz and/or Marco Rubio, they all call him a  con man, and so it is difficult to understand what the con is because it's  wait and see and look, and trying to make sure you don't fall apart, but  that's what it seems like to me.  </p><p>He's juggling all up and to me, there is something nefarious that's going  on behind the scenes whether it benefits his business or not, I don't know,  but clearly, in my estimation, it's not helpful for the United States of  America or any of our allies.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>QUEST:  In its 226-year history, never has the New York Stock Exchange had  a day quite like today.  A woman has been named President of the NYSE.  </p><p>Stacey Cunningham was on the balcony for today's, Tuesday's, opening bell.   She was formerly the Stock Exchange's Chief Operating Officer.  She is also  a familiar face on Quest Express.  She joined us for example during  Spotify's IPO last month, and she started as an intern and a market trader  at this exchange.  </p><p>Her ability to break that financial ceiling was paved by the women who came  before that, such as Muriel Siebert.  She was the first woman to hold a  seat at the New York Stock Exchange.  Maggie Lakes spoke to Stacey about  Siebert's influence last year.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>STACEY CUNNINGHAM, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  If you look  at the New York Stock Exchange, in itself can be a little larger than life  sometimes, and so for Muriel Siebert to walk into an entirely male trading  floor and say, I have the right to be here, and you're going to welcome me  with open arms, and then have them turn around and do it, I think is such  an accomplishment, not just for Muriel but for women throughout the world.  </p><p>For me, personally and I started my career on the trading floor and I  didn't give a single thought to whether or not I should be allowed to be  there, and I didn't give that thought because we already did it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Stacey Cunningham's appointment comes at a time when corporate  culture towards women is in a transformation.  She won't be alone in the  exchange, she will soon be joined by the famous, fearless girl statue.  </p><p>As we continue, U.S. lawmakers say, President Trump isn't getting enough  from China in trade negotiations.  American and European automakers are  finding plenty to like, in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>[16:30:00] QUEST:  Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS in just a moment.  British stocks are knocking over record after  record at an all time high for the FTSE, Sir Peter Westmacott will be with  me in just a moment.</p><p>And I'll ask chief executive of Carnival Cruise, what it's like to sail  toward an exploding volcano or maybe not the case maybe.  As we continue,  this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first. </p><p>During talks with South Korea's president, Donald Trump said the summit  with North Korea's leader may not happen in June or indeed at all.  They're  scheduled for three weeks from today.  Donald Trump's remarks are the  strongest indication yet that the meetings at risk after the North  threatened to pull out last week.</p><p>Thousands of rail workers, teachers, hospital staff and air traffic  controllers are on strike across France, some clash with police's trade  unions and more than a 100 cities protested against President Macron's  economic reforms.</p><p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made their first official royal  appearance as husband and wife on Tuesday.  It was the 70th birthday party  for Prince Charles.  The newlyweds helped celebrate his charity work in the  gardens of Buckingham Palace.</p><p>President Trump says he's not satisfied with trade talks, and investors  weren't satisfied with that.  Look at the numbers, the Dow gained vanished,  it closed up -- I mean, it was from 2:30 in the afternoon, the market just  went steadily lower and it closed off 179 points and now well back in the  25,000. </p><p>Car makers in the U.S. and Europe were however satisfied, shares of Ford,  G.M., Chrysler, they were all high, not huge, but they were higher,  particularly Ford, Chrysler.  China says it will cut tariffs on imported  cars from 25 percent to 15 percent. </p><p>Michael Hirson served as the U.S. Treasury's chief representative to  Beijing.  He's now the Asia director at the Eurasia Group.  The issue with  these tariffs, these car tariffs is China is sort of being intending to do  something along these lines. </p><p>Anyway, we can't necessarily say this is as a result of these trade talks  or can we? </p><p>MICHAEL HIRSON, ASIA DIRECTOR, EURASIA GROUP:  Well, I think that's a very  good point, and the agreement that the Chinese worked out with the Trump  administration really is significant because it goes in the direction that  China was largely already trying to go. </p><p>What China managed to do is put the hard issues and particularly those  related to technology and industrial policy to the side for now.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, but if we assume the president is not a fool and he's a deal  maker that he says he is, he will be aware that if he -- if China is just  stringing him along, not giving him a decent deal. </p><p>HIRSON:  Well, that's right.  It's not necessarily that the president  didn't get anything from this agreement or really, it's just steps towards  an agreement.  It's a matter of priorities.  The president sided with his  camp in particular led by Secretary Mnuchin, the pragmatic camp that is  looking to sell a deal based on China importing more from the U.S.</p><p>The camp that lost out led by U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer  was pushing China to make deep changes to its economy, in particular, the  set of concerns and policies related to technology and intellectual  property. </p><p>QUEST:  Right. </p><p>HIRSON:  That's the side that lost out from the framework of an agreement  that was agreed recently. </p><p>QUEST:  Sir, you're the former Treasury expert on China.  Is it your view  that -- and I'm trying not to take you into just a sort of a political  decision or you know, was the president led, was the president not, who  won, who lost?</p><p>But is it your view that really China -- this is a missed opportunity, it  is not the deal that everybody thinks it is. </p><p>HIRSON:  I think yes, without making a political judgment, it is fair to  say that because we can measure it against the objectives that the Trump  administration has set for itself.  And again, the objective was not just  to have China commit to buy more from the U.S., but to make changes to  really deep structural policies on market access, on the trade deficits and  on industrial policies -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>HIRSON:  With technology.  And by that measure, this agreement and it's not  a full agreement yet, we should just say, it's a framework of an agreement.   It is really now going to enter into serious discussions.  But based on  what we know so far, it is fallen short of the benchmark that the  administration had set. </p><p>[16:35:00] QUEST:  Do you believe there was a quid pro quo over ZTA? </p><p>HIRSON:  Well, I think quid pro quo is maybe ascribing nefarious purposes  to some extent.  The way that I would frame it is, President Trump clearly  understood from Beijing that putting out of business, China's second  largest telecom firm was going to be very difficult for the relationship. </p><p>He needs President Xi for a number of reasons, but in particular, to have  the North Korea summit go well.  And he made the judgment that the  enforcement action that the Commerce Department had dialed up was too harsh  in the grand scheme of things. </p><p>So was there a quid pro quo? In some sense, yes, it was to preserve the  relationship, and clearly at the beginning stages of this discussion, there  were some specific trade measures that China had agreed to.</p><p>But I think that the difficult part of the arrangement is that it puts in  play the notion that a law enforcement action -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>HIRSON:  It is subject to trade negotiations, and that's a difficult  precedent to set. </p><p>QUEST:  Michael Hirson, thank you for joining us, appreciate it.  I'm told  we're about to go on to get more details of this particular deal.  As we  continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live tonight from London, the FTSE  here in Britain is at a record high, I wonder because we're in London, it's  possible. </p><p>They like to deal with it whatsoever, the FTSE is at a record high, but we  do need to understand why, particularly if the British economy is in such  post-Brexit trouble. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Back-to-back records on the London FTSE, the ninth record so far  this year, that's definitely worth about -- if I was in New York by the  way, we would be having the trading posts open it out and we will be  notching them up for the FTSE. </p><p>It's closed up 1 percent higher and it's flirting with 8,000.  Look at the  way it all goes so far, market records in 2018, the NASDAQ is the number  one, the FTSE easily handily beats out Germany's Dax which only had one,  it's all probably thanks to the weaker dollar. </p><p>Investors are enjoying a trade war, and now ignoring the recent big dip has  been on a tear, largely ignoring exactly the elephant in the room which is  Brexit, which uniquely brings me to Sir Peter Westmacott, former U.K.  ambassador to the U.S., Turkey and France.  That's a nice collection, U.S.,  Turkey and France. </p><p>The FTSE, you're not a market economist as such, but the FTSE is doing very  well when people like me tell me that the economy potentially could be in  terrible trouble in the future and that the whole Brexit thing is an  almighty mess.  Square the circle for me. </p><p>PETER WESTMACOTT, FORMER U.K. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., TURKEY &amp; FRANCE:  I  would say a couple of things expertly.  One, of course, the currency going  right down which we did of the referendum means that the British exports  are more competitive than it would be otherwise.</p><p>So we've had a fillip to our external trade.  Secondly, there's very high  levels of employment which just surprise people, but we're doing pretty  well.  </p><p>[16:40:00] Thirdly, I think the markets are beginning to say the risks are  a really hard Brexit on a bus stop later this year are receding.</p><p>And the chances are probably that we spend a bit more time in a  transitional arrangement which has calmed the markets down.  And fourthly,  this is what's happening in America, the risk of a trade war with China  looks much more serious -- much less serious and much less even than we did  before.</p><p>He still -- self together and he begins to reassure the markets for the  time being. </p><p>QUEST:  You had to -- you qualify it for the time being because you  probably don't think it's going to last on this.  We need to talk about  Iran.</p><p>WESTMACOTT:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  We need to talk about Iran and the way in which the U.S. is  promising -- Mike Pompeo just a day again, threatening to ratchet up the  heaviest harsher sanctions ever. </p><p>WESTMACOTT:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  The secondary sanctions on European companies could be devastating. </p><p>WESTMACOTT:  I think so too.  It's a bit bizarre because there he is  threatening Armageddon strike on Iran, at the same time as he wants to do a  deal on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, you know, the sort of  mismatch there. </p><p>QUEST:  Why is that a mismatch? </p><p>WESTMACOTT:  It's mismatch in view because on the one hand America hasn't  reached the deal which is now torn off and says we want a better deal which  isn't about that.  </p><p>And on the other hand, he's saying to the Koreans, why don't you do a deal  and trust us to mend it, and here's the evidence that America doesn't stick  to its word if it does do a nuclear deal. </p><p>So it seems to me that on the one hand he wants diplomacy, on the other  hand he's ripped up and the president is ripped up a bit of -- the one bit  of successful diplomacy we've had on dealing with Iran's nuclear program in  recent years.</p><p>QUEST:  The president says -- on this argument, the president says though  that the U.S. president -- no, that's not the case, we will do a deal with  North Korea that he will be able to rely on.</p><p>WESTMACOTT:  Yes, well, he says that.  Let's see, I noticed the president  today is not too sure whether the meeting is going to take place.  Because  quite rightly, they're going to have to make sure that this is going to be  a substantive meeting which makes progress rather than pointless meeting.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Over the years, he's played a lot of games with the United States. </p><p>QUEST:  But I -- because you're an expert on all of these.  You've been to  more summits than there are probably honest or decent.  And but does it  matter if you have a meeting that doesn't have a fruition. </p><p>Can you not say we got together and we built a relationship, it's the first  step on a road to a greater thing.  Are you not -- are you not putting too  much pressure on this meeting? </p><p>WESTMACOTT:  I don't think I am or we are.  I think the point is, what is  the level of expectation that is raised by that meeting.  If you say  there's going to be a big, beautiful, huge deal, and that's going to be the  end of nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and then you achieve nothing  at all, then I think that is a disappointment. </p><p>If you know the expectation, you say, we're just going to get to know each  other, and that's fine and we'll see where that takes us.</p><p>QUEST:  It's not exactly what Donald Trump has cleverly done.  He said a  couple of weeks ago standing with Angela Merkel, we will have a meeting, if  it works, that's good, that's fine, and if it doesn't, that's fine too. </p><p>So he is managing expectations.</p><p>WESTMACOTT:  I think there's a little element of realism here.</p><p>QUEST:  Really? </p><p>WESTMACOTT:  Because he's also saying we're going to have a nice meeting if  we reach an agreement, North Korea is going to be fantastic, it's going to  be rich, prosperous, great, successful country.</p><p>North Korea is never going to rich, prosperous, successful country, not in  our life time as we should.  So I think there's an element here of I may  say it's a make belief, I'd be delighted if it works, but I think we have  to be a little realistic. </p><p>And back to your point about Iran where diplomacy which was the key point  of the Obama administration's approach to Iran and did produce a deal which  Donald Trump doesn't like at all, you asked about the sanctions effect, you  asked me about where that takes us all, and the answer is, it's extremely  serious because although the European elements and the Russians and the  Chinese would (INAUDIBLE) which is that deal do not want to go along with  destroying that deal.</p><p>And do not want to go along with additional sanctions, there's going to be  a big impact because of the importance of the all powerful dollar on global  business that seeks to do what business with Iran. </p><p>So this is a big deal, you put a finger on something very important. </p><p>QUEST:  OK, but if we don't look at anybody doing business with Donald  Trump globally -- </p><p>WESTMACOTT:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Always has to bear in mind that the man is a maverick and he might  actually do what he says he's going to do.</p><p>WESTMACOTT:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  That has brought North Korea to the table.  It has perhaps  destroyed the Americans ability to be an honest broker in the Middle East.   It brought South Korea to do a trade deal.  It brought China to do a  mercantilist trade deal. </p><p>Humor me if you will, Peter, is it not just possible that his strategy is  bearing fruit? </p><p>WESTMACOTT:  I think it is certainly possible, but by making a lot of  noise, something on the table, using unconventional language and so on, you  get the attention of the other side, you threaten them with Armageddon and  they fight back and they say we're not going to do that. </p><p>And he says OK, let's sit down and see what we can do together.  I think  this unconventional approach does seem to be making some progress on some  issues.  I would add one, on China, yes, they reduced the automobile  tariffs, but they were probably going to do that in any case. </p><p>They have not addressed the other issues like stealing the intellectual  property at every single foreign investor in that country or the industrial  policy issues which we all find offensive.  </p><p>[16:45:00] But there's a movement and there's a mess of a risk of a big  trade war, that is true.</p><p>And on the Korean Peninsula, let's see, I'm not saying it's a complete  farce, it's absolutely not, and if it works, I shall be, you know, a  cheerleader like everybody else, and delighted to wait. </p><p>The point I'm trying to make is that on the one hand with Iran, we've  decided diplomacy doesn't work, and on the other hand in North Korea, we're  saying let's give diplomacy a chance, there's a bit of a mismatch there. </p><p>QUEST:  Delighted that you came and to help us understand it all.  Thank  you very much indeed -- </p><p>WESTMACOTT:  Thank you -- </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, Peter.  As we continue tonight, meter by meter  alluvial(ph), the scale of devastation slowly grows.  The lava from the  volcano in Hawaii is close to claiming a power plant, and the extraordinary  thing about this is there's nothing anybody can do about it. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  It is hypnotic, you cannot take your eyes off it.  I could watch  this for hours and hours.  Slowly, but surely, the lava is coming out of  the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii.  And it's now approaching a geothermal power  plant. </p><p>Stephanie Elam is in Niihau (ph) joins me now.  I can only imagine what the  power of this thing must feel like as you get there -- what is it? What is  it actually like when you get close to this lava, this noise, this fire and  fury coming from the ground? </p><p>STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I love all of your excitement, Richard,  because you're right.  It is mesmerizing and when you're here, all you want  to do is get closer to it, even though those gases are toxic and they burn  your eyes and your throat, you've got to wear gas masks to get anywhere  near it. </p><p>But there's nothing like it.  The orange of the magma coming out of the  earth is such an intense orange, it almost looks like it's been digitally  revived, even though you're looking at it with your own eyes. </p><p>There's that aspect of it, the gas is, there's a fact that it is now  reached the ocean and it is now sending up a massive plume because when  lava mixes with ocean water, it creates hydrochloric acid and there's even  little particles of glass that are in there in that steam in that cloud  that is consistently been lifting up. </p><p>But it's rivers of lava, and we were out here overnight, and you can see in  the darkness that river of lava is making its way down the hill side.  All  of it like you said is mesmerizing, but it is -- </p><p>QUEST:  Stephanie? </p><p>ELAM:  Also deadly in its beauty, and that's a huge part of it, what people  here are concerned about. </p><p>QUEST:  Stephanie, is there a feeling of helplessness in the sense that,  you know, I mean, if there's a flood, you can build barriers, if there's a  fire, you can try and put it out.  But this is mother nature, this is doing  what it wants to do and it seems as if there's nothing that we can do about  it.</p><p>ELAM:  It's pretty much true, there's no way to stop 2,000 degree lava that  is rolling down a hill, there's nothing you can put in front of it, it was  raining on and off pretty heavily yesterday, lava does not care.</p><p>[16:50:00] And so you talk to the people who have been displaced by this  emergency and one woman -- she actually said -- a young woman, she just  move here from California literally three months ago -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>ELAM:  Right before this happened, and she said, you know, it's like an  ongoing drama and you can't just move on with your life.  If you have a  hurricane, a storm comes through, you clean up.  With lava like this, you  don't know how long it's going to go on, how long is eruptions going to  happen, and for them, that is a very hard situation -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>ELAM:  And reality to live in. </p><p>QUEST:  Stephanie Elam, thank you.  Stephanie Elam joining us from there.   And when I next see you, I need to have all the stories of what it was  actually like to be there.  This is one extraordinary. </p><p>Now, earlier this month, the Carnival Cruise has announced a cruise  itinerary crossing the Pacific to Asia.  It was going to go via Hawaii, and  the Chief Executive Arnold Donald joins me from New York. </p><p>First of all, my apologies sir, I was meant to be with you, of course, live  in the studio but the royal wedding got in the way and I'm still here in  London, so my apologies that I'm not actually face-to-face with you. </p><p>But listen -- and you've had to reschedule or how are you handling the  question of the Cruise and the Volcano? </p><p>ARNOLD DONALD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CARNIVAL CRUISE:  Yes, first of  all, greetings to you, Richard, I enjoyed some coverage that I saw of you  on the royal wedding -- </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you -- </p><p>DONALD:  So thank you for that, you did a great job.  You know, for us, we  have very limited itineraries going there, so luckily there have been no  injuries or anything like that -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>DONALD:  Period, which is great.  It is a captivating natural thing to see  of course some people have been displaced from their homes which is always  kind of disturbing -- </p><p>QUEST:  Sure -- </p><p>DONALD:  But it is a wonderful, natural event -- nature event.  And so at  any event, I think on the Hilo side of the island, I think -- I get them  confused to saying Hilo and Koloa, but one side is -- </p><p>QUEST:  Good point -- </p><p>DONALD:  Still receiving, the other side is not.  So mobile, weak, move  around and so it hasn't been an issue for us. </p><p>QUEST:  Let's talk about the Carnival Horizon which arrives in New York,  and it does so at the same time as you've got five years under your belt as  chief executive which congratulations because most CEOs are gone in the  company's average tenure. </p><p>The average tenure as you know is about two to three years, so you do it  better than most.  But listen, what do you see as your greatest  achievement? Sounds a bit pompous but you know what I mean.</p><p>What are you most proud of what you've done to try and put Carnival back  onto -- into its profitable forecasts? </p><p>DONALD:  Well, I think I've been fortunate to lead a great team of 120,000- plus employees with some great travel partners in terms of travel  professionals.  And basically, you know, we're in the golden age of  cruising.  Cruising has expanded, our business has done very well all those  five years, we mould and doubled our share price more than doubled our  earnings, more than doubled our return on investor capital, all while  exceeding guests expectations. </p><p>Like with the Carnival Horizon which we're going to name here in New York - - </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>DONALD:  As you mentioned, tomorrow, Queen Latifah will be the godmother,  she's going to do a lip sync battle with the Philadelphia Eagles' Super  Bowl -- </p><p>QUEST:  Movie -- </p><p>DONALD:  Kicker, and so that would be fun.  But the ship has lots of  features -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>DONALD:  But most importantly, it's engineered to exhibit the spirit of  Carnival and to elevate the human spirit -- </p><p>QUEST:  So -- </p><p>DONALD:  It's all about people connecting. </p><p>QUEST:  So what's your priority? I mean, I look at what you're doing at the  moment, whether it's China, obviously you have to be there and you have to  be there in larger numbers and larger ships.  Dubai, you've got the deal  over there -- </p><p>DONALD:  Right -- </p><p>QUEST:  Caribbean continues, you're just cruising.  I mean, you've got lots  of ships, you've got lots of potential and investment.  What is your  priority? </p><p>DONALD:  My priority is exceeding our guests expectations.  But in the last  two weeks, I've been in Barcelona for the new terminal we opened there, I  was in Dubai, spent a few minutes with the ruler of Dubai over the   terminal work we're doing there.</p><p>Obviously, we were in Venice and I'm here in New York for the naming of the  Carnival Horizon.  I was in Malta for the naming of the Seabourn Ovation,  as you know, we have nine, well, in cruise line brands and Seabourns are  ultra luxury brand.</p><p>So I'm busy, and I move around a lot, but the number one priority is  exceeding our guests expectations -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>DONALD:  If we do that, everything else works. </p><p>QUEST:  Finally, five years down, how many -- all right, come on, everybody  asked you this, what you've got in five years, five years down, how many to  go? </p><p>DONALD:  Well, we'll see how long, the shadows want to keep me around the  board, but what I can tell you is I'm in the vacation business, and so it's  fun to be in the vacation business and it's certainly to be at Carnival  Corporation. </p><p>So we're enjoying it and we hope we're making a difference. </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir -- </p><p>DONALD:  Good to see you -- </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you for joining us, sir -- </p><p>DONALD:  Thank you -- </p><p>QUEST:  Always lovely to have you on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, thank you very  much.</p><p>DONALD:  Thank you, Richard. </p><p>QUEST:  Let me just remind you the way the markets are looking at the  moment and the way they're closed in New York as we hang the book over to  Asia.  The Dow Jones Industrials -- I mean, it's worth looking at because  for no obvious reason, it felt quite sharply. </p><p>[16:55:00] And as you can see the reason, it's Boeing, Caterpillar, the big  numbers of the Dow, even Home Depot, 3M, they were all sharply lower, and  it is on the back of trade concerns about China. </p><p>This deal that the U.S. has done or that Donald Trump has done, the  framework agreement that now has to be flashed out, the market is basically  saying it is not -- it is skeptical about the ability to do so. </p><p>And with that, we'll have our profitable moment after the break -- now,  where's the ship? Where is the ship? </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Profitable moment, really could just look at that, absolutely as  the volcano in Hawaii continuing to spew out tons and tons of molten lava  for hours and hours.  Why are we telling you and talking about this  tonight, because in a world where everything is certain, we need to know  the results of the economy. </p><p>What will GDP growth be next year, next quarter, what will the companies'  forecast be? How many jobs will be created? What will be the result of  Brexit? The U.S.-China trade talks, how will they be resolved? And yet, you  have this going on at the moment. </p><p>And thank God there has been no serious loss of lives as a result, on only  one or two injuries as such.  But this lava, there's nothing we can do  about it.  You've got that? Nothing.  The earth is going to throw this up  and yes, people will lose homes and there will be some people who will be  injured and businesses will fail as a result. </p><p>That can be dealt with in some shape for form, at least economic damage.   But this is all inspiring because this means we have no control.  It's a  reminder we ain't in charge.  And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight,  I am Richard Quest in London.</p><p>Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable, I will  see you tomorrow. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Can you hear me?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION (via phone):  Yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  First, I've got to -- good. I want to ask you, first of all, your reaction to being suspended by Twitter for effectively promoting that video extolling the benefits of hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Well, I didn't even say anything about it. What was interesting about it, Lou, I think we're having a little technical difficulties because I'm in the van. I'm actually doing this now in the vehicle because the satellite feed isn't working.</p><p>But I simply said, this is an interesting counterpoint to what you're hearing and the narrative that you're getting every day from Democrats. And, you know, and/or the mainstream media.</p><p>It was a group of doctors, about a dozen of them and they were talking about, hey, we've treated real patients with it. We've seen this, why is that there? So I said, this is interesting. People should listen to this. People should hear and hear a dissenting opinion.</p><p>I didn't say it was right or wrong, and for that, I got thrown off of Twitter for 12 hours. It happened to numerous other people as well, and it's amazing that the doctors at Twitter apparently know more than actual life medical professional, dozens of them that were standing on the steps of Congress with some congressmen.</p><p>DOBBS:  Mark Zuckerberg today obviously making it very clear to the assembled congressmen that he didn't have anything to do with your suspension or Sidney Powell, General Flynn's defense attorney, her account, but saying at the same time that he didn't want to be an arbiter of truth that his company was doing precisely that, that Twitter, he acknowledged was doing exactly that deciding what is valid, what is invalid, what is true and that isn't their role nor is it their prerogative under our Constitution to do so.</p><p>What are -- what are we going to do? We are watching this hearing today, but I don't know it's going to solve much.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  I don't know that it's going to solve much because Republicans have to wake up to this problem and then obviously, Mark Zuckeberg is Facebook, the issue I had was with Twitter.</p><p>But you know, they all do the same thing. I see it, Instagram which is owned by Facebook did the same thing to me last year when I called out the Jussie Smollett hoax before everyone because I just said, hey, this is ridiculous and I got thrown off Instagram for a while with my post taken down for apparently perpetuating hate speech.</p><p>I didn't say anything. I actually said, has anyone even bothered to look into this story because it seems really, really, really ridiculously farfetched.</p><p>It turns out, I was right, but that didn't stop them from labeling me as someone who provoked hate speech, that didn't stop then the media from taking that and running with it that I'm promoting conspiracy theories.</p><p>You know, it's not -- it's only a conspiracy theory until you're proven right, which I obviously was. That said, it didn't change anything.</p><p>So the problem we have in Congress is that many Republicans, they don't know anything about social media. They're not on it. Some young staffer is doing it. They don't see these things.</p><p>And more importantly, they're not in touch with their base, who is just deplatformed (ph), who is censored. Anyone who is religious, anyone who is a Second Amendment supporter, anyone who is pro-life, all of those things are just destroyed and decimated in the algorithms of social media.</p><p>And frankly, even in the search engines like Google, look at what Google did to Breitbart. It doesn't end and Republicans are not aware of it. They keep saying it is nonsense, that it's a free market principle. It's not a free market when you're getting government protection.</p><p>These companies get billions of dollars' worth of free liability protections from the government. They cannot then function as publishers deciding what you and the American people get to see and what they don't, pushing their liberal, California bordering on communist agenda to the American people because they're attempting to sway in the election.</p><p>They're attempting to sway in the way that people think, and it's very effective when people -- ordinary people who don't see what's going on are bombarded with a one-sided, incredibly biased, left-wing, talking point memo on a daily basis on these platforms.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's truly stunning, the awesome power that these giant tech companies, social media companies with them are exerting on American society right now. It is -- it's stunning.</p><p>It is also un-American for this to continue under our antitrust laws, and yet, as you say the Republicans act like scared children when you mention regulating what is obviously monopolistic and anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>It is absolutely a juvenile response on the part of Republicans who should know something about economics and politics. Let's talk about politics real quickly. It looks to me like a number of the polls are turning in your father's direction. The President is looking, I think, significantly stronger, despite the polling biases of most of these organizations, your thoughts?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Listen, I think you're right. Again, there's a lot for us to overcome when you talk about that bias. You know, Lou, you and I do this stuff every day. We're watching it 2/7, but for the average person who is, you know, working hard to put food on their table, you know, they're consuming five minutes of news a day and it's 96 percent negative against Donald Trump.</p><p>There are people, you know, quote-unquote \"professional journalists,\" who are still perpetrating the Russia hoax nonsense and everything. I mean, it's very hard to overcome that. People have to understand what's going on. People have to understand Joe Biden's path because of quarantine.</p><p>I had a few months off. I wrote another book called \"Liberal Privilege.\" It's available on donjr.com, you know, you know, D-O-N-J-R dot com because I basically had four months to look into the background of this 50-year career swamp creature, and he is not the guy that the mainstream media is pushing. He is not the moderate that you think he is.</p><p>He is not this reasonable guy, and honestly, if you want Joe Biden and you see the way he behaves, you see how he can't remember where he is. He's just a pawn for the radical left and all you have to do is look on his website and see these Biden standards, communist manifesto joint unity plan to realize that this is a radical guy who is not in charge.</p><p>The radical left will be in charge of this Biden presidency, if that ever, God forbid happens, and it will be the end of America as we know it, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Donald Trump Jr., good to have you with us. Come back soon. All the best and we'll get to these technology problems sorted out between you and us. Thanks a lot, Don.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I wrote another book called \"Liberal Privilege.\" It's available on donjr.com, you know, you know, D-O-N-J-R dot com because I basically had four months to look into the background of this 50-year career swamp creature, and he is not the guy that the mainstream media is pushing. He is not the moderate that you think he is.   </p><p>      He is not this reasonable guy, and honestly, if you want Joe Biden and you see the way he behaves, you see how he can't remember where he is. He's just a pawn for the radical left and all you have to do is look on his website and see these Biden standards, communist manifesto joint unity plan to realize that this is a radical guy who is not in charge.   </p><p>      The radical left will be in charge of this Biden presidency, if that ever, God forbid happens, and it will be the end of America as we know it, Lou.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOBBS</emphasis>:  Donald Trump Jr., good to have you with us. Come back soon. All the best and we'll get to these technology problems sorted out between you and us. Thanks a lot, Don.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-6DB1-F15W-H02Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Good morning to you, Don.  </p><p>      DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ORGANIZATION</emphasis>:  Good morning, guys. How are you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EARHARDT</emphasis>:  We're doing well.  </p><p>      I know that your Twitter account -- you posted that hydroxychloroquine video and your account was suspended.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EARHARDT</emphasis>:  So what's your reaction to what happened yesterday with these big-tech CEOs?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Well, listen, there's no question that there's bias. Ainsley, if you're religious, if you're pro-life, if you're pro-Second Amendment, you watch your metrics and you watch them get destroyed.  </p><p>      Conservatives and people who believe in conservative values have been targeted by these people who have no problem allowing a platform of free speech to the Ayatollah, to Communist China, to people who are committing genocide. That's not a problem.  </p><p>      But I post a video that's just an alternative thought -- a different viewpoint by actual doctors -- doctors -- not some kooks. These were a dozen doctors on the Capitol steps with a congressman -- and that was spreading misinformation.  </p><p>      But when the Chinese Communist government literally spread disinformation about coronavirus, they literally said -- Twitter said that is not a violation of their rules. The Chinese government spreading disinformation is not a violation of their rules.  </p><p>      But me saying hey, this is interesting, it's very different than the narrative that they've been cramming down our throats -- maybe you should watch it and make up your own minds -- that was enough to get thrown off the platform.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS HOST</emphasis>:  And, Twitter tells us they're an American company, Don. But you mentioned China. You also briefly mentioned Iran.  </p><p>      Well, Twitter didn't find time to go to Capitol Hill. I think they probably knew they would get the most scrutiny of any organization. But a representative for Twitter did tell the IsraeliCongress that Iran's supreme leader is not in violation of Twitter rules but your father, the president, is.  </p><p>      Take a listen to this.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARSEN OSTROVSKY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, JEWISH-ISRAELI CONGRESS</emphasis>: You have recently started flagging the tweets of President Trump. Why have you not flagged the tweets of Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei, who has literally called for genocide of Israel and the Jewish people?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWITTER SPOKESWOMAN</emphasis>:  Well, we have an approach to world leaders that presently say that direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on military-economic issues are generally not in violation of our Twitter rules.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICHAL COTLER-WUNSH, MEMBER, KNESSET, BLUE AND WHITE ALLIANCE</emphasis>: And calling for genocide is OK, but commenting on politics --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWITTER SPOKESWOMAN</emphasis>:  However --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COTLER-WUNSH</emphasis>:  -- is not? Just so we understand. Just so -- I just want to fine-tune the question. Calling for genocide on Twitter is OK, but commenting on political situations in certain countries is not OK?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWITTER SPOKESWOMAN</emphasis>:  Well, if a world leader violates our rules, but it is a clear interest in keeping that up on the servers, we may place it behind a notice that provides some more context.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEGSETH</emphasis>:  So, Don, it seems like Twitter is America first, it's just blame America first and the rest of the world gets a pass.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Yes. I mean, it's truly disgusting. I mean -- and again, you don't have to be a genius to see it. I see what they've done to my analytics. Every time I push a button, I know what it's going to do. I do enough of this stuff.  </p><p>      And my numbers, my retweets, my likes -- you know, they're cut in half or even in third compared to what I was probably doing six months ago. You see that this is a ramp-up for an election.  </p><p>      But more importantly, you hear that response. How insane is this? I mean, there really is a word for what these people are full of, I just can't say it on the air. And it's time to end it.  </p><p>      Republicans have to wake up also because they're not even aware most of the time. Their staffers are online doing these things. The average Republican in Congress --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEGSETH</emphasis>:  That's true.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  -- has no idea what's actually happening on these platforms. And so, they don't even realize a) what's going on, and b) how important it is for their base who is being totally suppressed, their free speech wiped away while these companies get a lot of protections from the government.  </p><p>      And that's the key. If they're getting these liability protections -- these companies are getting probably the equivalent of billions of dollars of protections from lawsuits, from this -- then they can't act as publishers and decide what --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEGSETH</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  -- the American people will see based on their opinions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST</emphasis>:  See, Don, there's two things. I actually believe both Republicans and Democrats are alarmed about the power, for different reasons, of those behemoths that were there yesterday.  </p><p>      But I would need -- there needs to be some action before November third. It's not good to rant to people who understand what you're going through. Somehow, they've got to get into their algorithm and change things. And we seem to be saying the same thing for the last three years.  </p><p>      Meanwhile, the president is fight -- he's got to fight for Texas. It's pretty close. Loses Texas, Republicans are not going to win for a generation.  </p><p>      And there, he was tapping into exactly what fuels Texas and that's oil and gas. He believes that if Joe Biden's elected president, we'll go back into the Paris Accord and eventually, fracking's gone.  </p><p>      Although, Joe -- although, Joe Biden says oh, fracking's fine with me.  </p><p>      What are we to believe?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Well, it's not what he's said in the past, first and foremost.  </p><p>      But if you look at the sort of Green New Deal in another name only, Joe Biden, on his Web site, is basically saying hey, we're going all to clean energy. We're getting rid of fossil fuels. We're doing this all in the next few years. I think it was by 2030 that all of this stuff was gone.  </p><p>      That would destroy the economy in Texas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Ohio. There's numerous states that are getting the benefits of being able to do this. And as Americans, the reality is we're still going to be reliant on those natural resources from other countries.  </p><p>      Why not do it better, cleaner, more environmentally-friendly while also employing Americans -- putting them to work and generating something for the economy? I mean, this is the notion of what Donald Trump did over the last four years -- cut the nonsense regulations, did things responsibly, allowed the free markets to work. And that's why you had the greatest economy in the history of modern America because of those policies.  </p><p>      Joe Biden doesn't know where he is 50 percent of the time, Pete. Joe Biden is a puppet of the left. You can see that with this -- you know, Biden standards, joint unity, communist manifesto plan. It's really scary because they're going to send America into the dark ages.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EARHARDT</emphasis>:  So you wrote this op-ed on foxnews.com and it's titled \"Biden wouldn't reduce rioting and crime -- he's controlled by left-wing puppet masters\"  </p><p>      So when he does say he's for something, do you think that it doesn't matter what his opinions are, he's controlled by the other people -- by the progressives in the party -- and he's going to do whatever they ask him to do?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  One hundred percent. Listen, you see the videos of him. He can't get to a podium. He can't answer a question with 10 people.  </p><p>      You would think that if you were a D.C. swamp creature, Ainsley, you'd be able to talk to a group of 10 to 20 people without a teleprompter. He's not able to do that.  </p><p>      So, the media is trying to do what they do best, which is show up for the Democrats by running Joe Biden as a moderate. You'll hear he's a moderate -- you'll hear he's a moderate.  </p><p>      But all you have to do is actually look at the positions he's taken. These are on his Web sites. It's, by far, the most radical agenda in modern history. It's not even questioned. It's on his Web site.  </p><p>      But the media is going to try to get him the best of both worlds. They're going to try to run him as a moderate to people who may be watching this station and others, and then they're going to let him run as a radical to those who have lost their minds in America.  </p><p>      The reality is he hasn't come out against defund the police. He's all for the integration of the suburbs with the big cities so that you have high volume zonings that would destroy the American suburbs.  </p><p>      These are not things that we think he's going to do, Ainsley. These are things that are literally on his Web site. And that's just the beginning of it.  </p><p>      Free health care for illegal immigrants -- free. I'd love that, myself. I'd love free health care but I pay for it, OK?  </p><p>      Free housing for criminals coming out of prison. It seems like an incentive to create crime.  </p><p>      The list goes on and on. It's insanity.  </p><p>      But again, the media will do what the big tech companies are trying to do. They will try to cover. They will try to shave off some of the message so it's not getting out there, so it doesn't have the same efficacy when it gets to the people.  </p><p>      And they are all in this together working for the Democrats. It's not even pretend anymore. They're just doing it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMEADE</emphasis>:  Yes. And you saw a bit of a campaign -- it looked a little like a campaign yesterday. But everything's going to be so different than any campaign that we've seen.  </p><p>      So we'll see where this goes because the president has got to get -- find some way to get Joe Biden out of his basement regularly and maybe that's closing the gap in the polls.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EARHARDT</emphasis>:  Yes, can I ask about that? How are they going to handle the debates?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  There's no incentive for him to come out of his basement. He does better when America doesn't see him.  </p><p>      When America doesn't see him forget where he is every other time. Where America doesn't see him forget who's his wife and who's his sister. Forget the office that he's running for. Needs someone to guide him through a crowd. Cut him off in an interview.  </p><p>      Joe Biden -- this is his dream and the Democrats' dream because you can cover up who Joe Biden is.  </p><p>      I actually -- you know, when I started looking at it in the beginning of quarantine, I had four months. I actually wrote a second book about it called \"Liberal Privilege.\" Because if you look into the history of Joe Biden, what you see there is not what you're being sold today.  </p><p>      And that's the hypocrisy of the media and the left. It's absolutely disgusting and people really have to inform themselves before November.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEGSETH</emphasis>:  Yes. This will be a contrast election, no doubt.  </p><p>      Don Jr., thank you so much for joining us this morning.

Good morning to you, Don.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION:  Good morning, guys. How are you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EARHARDT:  We're doing well.</p><p>I know that your Twitter account -- you posted that hydroxychloroquine video and your account was suspended.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Yes.</p><p>EARHARDT:  So what's your reaction to what happened yesterday with these big-tech CEOs?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Well, listen, there's no question that there's bias. Ainsley, if you're religious, if you're pro-life, if you're pro-Second Amendment, you watch your metrics and you watch them get destroyed.</p><p>Conservatives and people who believe in conservative values have been targeted by these people who have no problem allowing a platform of free speech to the Ayatollah, to Communist China, to people who are committing genocide. That's not a problem.</p><p>But I post a video that's just an alternative thought -- a different viewpoint by actual doctors -- doctors -- not some kooks. These were a dozen doctors on the Capitol steps with a congressman -- and that was spreading misinformation.</p><p>But when the Chinese Communist government literally spread disinformation about coronavirus, they literally said -- Twitter said that is not a violation of their rules. The Chinese government spreading disinformation is not a violation of their rules.</p><p>But me saying hey, this is interesting, it's very different than the narrative that they've been cramming down our throats -- maybe you should watch it and make up your own minds -- that was enough to get thrown off the platform.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS HOST:  And, Twitter tells us they're an American company, Don. But you mentioned China. You also briefly mentioned Iran.</p><p>Well, Twitter didn't find time to go to Capitol Hill. I think they probably knew they would get the most scrutiny of any organization. But a representative for Twitter did tell the IsraeliCongress that Iran's supreme leader is not in violation of Twitter rules but your father, the president, is.</p><p>Take a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARSEN OSTROVSKY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, JEWISH-ISRAELI CONGRESS: You have recently started flagging the tweets of President Trump. Why have you not flagged the tweets of Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei, who has literally called for genocide of Israel and the Jewish people?</p><p>TWITTER SPOKESWOMAN:  Well, we have an approach to world leaders that presently say that direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on military-economic issues are generally not in violation of our Twitter rules.</p><p>MICHAL COTLER-WUNSH, MEMBER, KNESSET, BLUE AND WHITE ALLIANCE: And calling for genocide is OK, but commenting on politics --</p><p>TWITTER SPOKESWOMAN:  However --</p><p>COTLER-WUNSH:  -- is not? Just so we understand. Just so -- I just want to fine-tune the question. Calling for genocide on Twitter is OK, but commenting on political situations in certain countries is not OK?</p><p>TWITTER SPOKESWOMAN:  Well, if a world leader violates our rules, but it is a clear interest in keeping that up on the servers, we may place it behind a notice that provides some more context.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH:  So, Don, it seems like Twitter is America first, it's just blame America first and the rest of the world gets a pass.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Yes. I mean, it's truly disgusting. I mean -- and again, you don't have to be a genius to see it. I see what they've done to my analytics. Every time I push a button, I know what it's going to do. I do enough of this stuff.</p><p>And my numbers, my retweets, my likes -- you know, they're cut in half or even in third compared to what I was probably doing six months ago. You see that this is a ramp-up for an election.</p><p>But more importantly, you hear that response. How insane is this? I mean, there really is a word for what these people are full of, I just can't say it on the air. And it's time to end it.</p><p>Republicans have to wake up also because they're not even aware most of the time. Their staffers are online doing these things. The average Republican in Congress --</p><p>HEGSETH:  That's true.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  -- has no idea what's actually happening on these platforms. And so, they don't even realize a) what's going on, and b) how important it is for their base who is being totally suppressed, their free speech wiped away while these companies get a lot of protections from the government.</p><p>And that's the key. If they're getting these liability protections -- these companies are getting probably the equivalent of billions of dollars of protections from lawsuits, from this -- then they can't act as publishers and decide what --</p><p>HEGSETH:  Right.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  -- the American people will see based on their opinions.</p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:  See, Don, there's two things. I actually believe both Republicans and Democrats are alarmed about the power, for different reasons, of those behemoths that were there yesterday.</p><p>But I would need -- there needs to be some action before November third. It's not good to rant to people who understand what you're going through. Somehow, they've got to get into their algorithm and change things. And we seem to be saying the same thing for the last three years.</p><p>Meanwhile, the president is fight -- he's got to fight for Texas. It's pretty close. Loses Texas, Republicans are not going to win for a generation.</p><p>And there, he was tapping into exactly what fuels Texas and that's oil and gas. He believes that if Joe Biden's elected president, we'll go back into the Paris Accord and eventually, fracking's gone.</p><p>Although, Joe -- although, Joe Biden says oh, fracking's fine with me.</p><p>What are we to believe?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Well, it's not what he's said in the past, first and foremost.</p><p>But if you look at the sort of Green New Deal in another name only, Joe Biden, on his Web site, is basically saying hey, we're going all to clean energy. We're getting rid of fossil fuels. We're doing this all in the next few years. I think it was by 2030 that all of this stuff was gone.</p><p>That would destroy the economy in Texas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Ohio. There's numerous states that are getting the benefits of being able to do this. And as Americans, the reality is we're still going to be reliant on those natural resources from other countries.</p><p>Why not do it better, cleaner, more environmentally-friendly while also employing Americans -- putting them to work and generating something for the economy? I mean, this is the notion of what Donald Trump did over the last four years -- cut the nonsense regulations, did things responsibly, allowed the free markets to work. And that's why you had the greatest economy in the history of modern America because of those policies.</p><p>Joe Biden doesn't know where he is 50 percent of the time, Pete. Joe Biden is a puppet of the left. You can see that with this -- you know, Biden standards, joint unity, communist manifesto plan. It's really scary because they're going to send America into the dark ages.</p><p>EARHARDT:  So you wrote this op-ed on foxnews.com and it's titled \"Biden wouldn't reduce rioting and crime -- he's controlled by left-wing puppet masters\"</p><p>So when he does say he's for something, do you think that it doesn't matter what his opinions are, he's controlled by the other people -- by the progressives in the party -- and he's going to do whatever they ask him to do?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  One hundred percent. Listen, you see the videos of him. He can't get to a podium. He can't answer a question with 10 people.</p><p>You would think that if you were a D.C. swamp creature, Ainsley, you'd be able to talk to a group of 10 to 20 people without a teleprompter. He's not able to do that.</p><p>So, the media is trying to do what they do best, which is show up for the Democrats by running Joe Biden as a moderate. You'll hear he's a moderate -- you'll hear he's a moderate.</p><p>But all you have to do is actually look at the positions he's taken. These are on his Web sites. It's, by far, the most radical agenda in modern history. It's not even questioned. It's on his Web site.</p><p>But the media is going to try to get him the best of both worlds. They're going to try to run him as a moderate to people who may be watching this station and others, and then they're going to let him run as a radical to those who have lost their minds in America.</p><p>The reality is he hasn't come out against defund the police. He's all for the integration of the suburbs with the big cities so that you have high volume zonings that would destroy the American suburbs.</p><p>These are not things that we think he's going to do, Ainsley. These are things that are literally on his Web site. And that's just the beginning of it.</p><p>Free health care for illegal immigrants -- free. I'd love that, myself. I'd love free health care but I pay for it, OK?</p><p>Free housing for criminals coming out of prison. It seems like an incentive to create crime.</p><p>The list goes on and on. It's insanity.</p><p>But again, the media will do what the big tech companies are trying to do. They will try to cover. They will try to shave off some of the message so it's not getting out there, so it doesn't have the same efficacy when it gets to the people.</p><p>And they are all in this together working for the Democrats. It's not even pretend anymore. They're just doing it.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Yes. And you saw a bit of a campaign -- it looked a little like a campaign yesterday. But everything's going to be so different than any campaign that we've seen.</p><p>So we'll see where this goes because the president has got to get -- find some way to get Joe Biden out of his basement regularly and maybe that's closing the gap in the polls.</p><p>EARHARDT:  Yes, can I ask about that? How are they going to handle the debates?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  There's no incentive for him to come out of his basement. He does better when America doesn't see him.</p><p>When America doesn't see him forget where he is every other time. Where America doesn't see him forget who's his wife and who's his sister. Forget the office that he's running for. Needs someone to guide him through a crowd. Cut him off in an interview.</p><p>Joe Biden -- this is his dream and the Democrats' dream because you can cover up who Joe Biden is.</p><p>I actually -- you know, when I started looking at it in the beginning of quarantine, I had four months. I actually wrote a second book about it called \"Liberal Privilege.\" Because if you look into the history of Joe Biden, what you see there is not what you're being sold today.</p><p>And that's the hypocrisy of the media and the left. It's absolutely disgusting and people really have to inform themselves before November.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes. This will be a contrast election, no doubt.</p><p>Don Jr., thank you so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it.</p><p>EARHARDT:  Thank you.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Thank you, guys.</p><p>HEGSETH:  You got it.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

So if you retweet a doctor who agrees with the Yale guy, how is that misinformation? Isn't that just a second opinion?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION:  Well, I think that's what's called science, right? Science -- certain things aren't definitive. They argue back and forth, and I thought as an American, that that kind of discourse is what actually makes us American, to be able to have a dissenting opinion.</p><p>Twitter -- the great doctors at Twitter of which I believe there are none have decided that one doctor is more right than another group of doctors. I want to hear all sides, and that was what was interesting about my tweet, which is, I didn't say, everyone else was wrong. This is right.</p><p>I just go. Wow. You know, Jesse, this is really interesting. This is so different than the narrative that they've been jamming down my throat for the last three months. We should probably hear that. That was enough to get me thrown off Twitter.</p><p>Now, they didn't have a problem. Twitter did not have a problem with the Chinese government literally spreading coronavirus disinformation. There's an article in \"The Hill\" where they say no, the Chinese government spreading coronavirus disinformation, which by the way probably cost millions of people's their lives over the course of the world. Right? That does not violate their rules.</p><p>The Ayatollah Khomeini talking about death to Israel, you know, and genocide, that doesn't violate the rules. Me saying, I don't know, maybe you should hear from a couple of doctors who have a disagreement on this that are actually treating patients in the field. My father retweeting a meme. You know, that's enough to get us thrown off of these platforms. And that's the problem.</p><p>Big Tech is activist liberal. They are out there putting their hand and it's a very powerful hand, more powerful probably than any hand in modern history, weighing the scales down in favor of the left.</p><p>You notice, you've not heard of a single leftist, no matter whether it is moderate left or some of the radical, you know, crazy people you're seeing so much of these days on the left. You've never seen them thrown off the platform. You've never seen them suspended. You've never seen them demonetized.</p><p>WATTERS:  Right.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  You don't -- you know, they don't have the same in-boxing problems.</p><p>WATTERS:  Well, Don, that's because they believe --</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  The Gmail and Google.</p><p>WATTERS:  That you, Donald Trump Jr., are more dangerous than the Ayatollah and the Communist Chinese. Everyone -- everyone is scared of Donald Trump Jr. and you're right, because here's the deal. It's about censorship.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  I think that's a little bit of a compliment.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, I know. You are that powerful.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  ... that much power in my fingers. It's truly --</p><p>WATTERS:  You really are that big of a threat with your fingers and you don't have a finger on any nuclear buttons. It's just a retweet and retweets --</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  I know. I've got nothing.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, right. Retweets are not endorsements. That's what they tell you. You know, and this way -- you can plot Antifa riots on Twitter. They don't do anything about that. You can accuse the President of treason, the Russia collusion. That's misinformation.</p><p>You can call someone a rapist, a white supremacist. That's not hate speech at all. It's all going one way.</p><p>It's a blitzkrieg of regulation against conservative speech because they don't trust the American people to make up their own minds because if there are both sides out there and they can decide, based on the facts, you'll always choose against the totalitarian left.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  They will do whatever they can.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  They will do whatever they can to push the voter to believe the radical left and to vote accordingly. That is their job in this. They've been doing it for a while. I mean, it's no secret. I've been on your show talking about, you know, social media censorship, what they're doing.</p><p>I've said in the past that everything I've seen from '16 on has been a dry run for 2020. They're not even hiding anymore. They're just doing it.</p><p>Again, if literal disinformation -- information put out by the Chinese government that places like the World Health Organization and others relied upon, that is not enough to get you thrown off of Twitter, deplatformed or censored, but me being like, I don't know, maybe you should watch this. We like to believe in free speech. Let's hear what they have to say. That's a problem.</p><p>You know, that's what we are up against, Jesse.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, I think honestly -- yes, I think the Republicans need to threaten to break up these monopolies if they're not treated fairly.</p><p>All right, so you have Joe Biden out there. He is running for President. He is walking for President, whatever you want to call it. He's gone far left. I don't know where his brain has gone. It might just be gone.</p><p>Here he is walking to the podium the other day. I don't know if he knows where he is. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome at Kingswood Community Center. Actually, that's the one down I used to work -- that's a joke. You know where we are anyway. It's great to be here and back in a place where, you know --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS:  Where am I?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Jesse, what I want to know is, when does this -- when does this start being considered elder abuse? I mean, it's really not fair.</p><p>I mean, honestly, it wouldn't be truly sad if it wasn't so scary that this guy could be in charge of the nuclear football. You see it every day.</p><p>WATTERS:  He fumbles.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  He doesn't remember where he is. He forgets who his wife is. He forgets what office he is running for. He gets in front of a crowd -- and don't forget Joe Biden is a 50-year swamp creature, right?</p><p>If you've been a politician for 50 years, you should be able to get in front of a whopping crowd of seven people and be able to do it without a teleprompter.</p><p>WATTERS:  You're right. It should come naturally.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  He can't do that. His team pulls him off any interview, because you see him start to go off the rails and most notably, was sort of during the debates.</p><p>Notice how -- I don't think he ever completed a question without going, well, I don't want to take up any more of your time. So I'll give my time so everyone else can speak.</p><p>He is literally the first politician in the history of politics to not go over his time in a debate and it's because he didn't remember where he was going.</p><p>He spoke for 45 seconds, forgot the point he was trying to make, forgot the question, and now he is ceding back the time because he is this magnanimous guy.</p><p>I mean, give me a break. It's not funny. I mean, we're laughing because this is the people we are, right?</p><p>WATTERS:  No, I know we're laughing at it now, but it's scary.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  And I am like, this guy could be in charge.</p><p>WATTERS:  And it looks like he's going to put Kamala Harris on the ticket, which is even more of a scarier idea. Not as scary as Donald Trump Jr., who everybody believes is scarier than the Iranians and the Chinese communists.</p><p>All right. Check out his book. You can order right now. Donald Trump Jr. There he is. Thanks.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Thank you, Jesse.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

So if you retweet a doctor who agrees with the Yale guy, how is that misinformation? Isn't that just a second opinion?   </p><p>      DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ORGANIZATION</emphasis>:  Well, I think that's what's called science, right? Science -- certain things aren't definitive. They argue back and forth, and I thought as an American, that that kind of discourse is what actually makes us American, to be able to have a dissenting opinion.   </p><p>Twitter -- the great doctors at Twitter of which I believe there are none have decided that one doctor is more right than another group of doctors. I want to hear all sides, and that was what was interesting about my tweet, which is, I didn't say, everyone else was wrong. This is right.   </p><p>      I just go. Wow. You know, Jesse, this is really interesting. This is so different than the narrative that they've been jamming down my throat for the last three months. We should probably hear that. That was enough to get me thrown off Twitter.   </p><p>      Now, they didn't have a problem. Twitter did not have a problem with the Chinese government literally spreading coronavirus disinformation. There's an article in \"The Hill\" where they say no, the Chinese government spreading coronavirus disinformation, which by the way probably cost millions of people's their lives over the course of the world. Right? That does not violate their rules.   </p><p>      The Ayatollah Khomeini talking about death to Israel, you know, and genocide, that doesn't violate the rules. Me saying, I don't know, maybe you should hear from a couple of doctors who have a disagreement on this that are actually treating patients in the field. My father retweeting a meme. You know, that's enough to get us thrown off of these platforms. And that's the problem.   </p><p>      Big Tech is activist liberal. They are out there putting their hand and it's a very powerful hand, more powerful probably than any hand in modern history, weighing the scales down in favor of the left.   </p><p>      You notice, you've not heard of a single leftist, no matter whether it is moderate left or some of the radical, you know, crazy people you're seeing so much of these days on the left. You've never seen them thrown off the platform. You've never seen them suspended. You've never seen them demonetized.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  You don't -- you know, they don't have the same in-boxing problems.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  Well, Don, that's because they believe --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  The Gmail and Google.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  That you, Donald Trump Jr., are more dangerous than the Ayatollah and the Communist Chinese. Everyone -- everyone is scared of Donald Trump Jr. and you're right, because here's the deal. It's about censorship.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  I think that's a little bit of a compliment.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  Yes, I know. You are that powerful.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  ... that much power in my fingers. It's truly --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  You really are that big of a threat with your fingers and you don't have a finger on any nuclear buttons. It's just a retweet and retweets --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  I know. I've got nothing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  Yes, right. Retweets are not endorsements. That's what they tell you. You know, and this way -- you can plot Antifa riots on Twitter. They don't do anything about that. You can accuse the President of treason, the Russia collusion. That's misinformation.   </p><p>      You can call someone a rapist, a white supremacist. That's not hate speech at all. It's all going one way.   </p><p>      It's a blitzkrieg of regulation against conservative speech because they don't trust the American people to make up their own minds because if there are both sides out there and they can decide, based on the facts, you'll always choose against the totalitarian left.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  They will do whatever they can.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  They will do whatever they can to push the voter to believe the radical left and to vote accordingly. That is their job in this. They've been doing it for a while. I mean, it's no secret. I've been on your show talking about, you know, social media censorship, what they're doing.   </p><p>      I've said in the past that everything I've seen from '16 on has been a dry run for 2020. They're not even hiding anymore. They're just doing it.   </p><p>      Again, if literal disinformation -- information put out by the Chinese government that places like the World Health Organization and others relied upon, that is not enough to get you thrown off of Twitter, deplatformed or censored, but me being like, I don't know, maybe you should watch this. We like to believe in free speech. Let's hear what they have to say. That's a problem.   </p><p>      You know, that's what we are up against, Jesse.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  Yes, I think honestly -- yes, I think the Republicans need to threaten to break up these monopolies if they're not treated fairly.   </p><p>      All right, so you have Joe Biden out there. He is running for President. He is walking for President, whatever you want to call it. He's gone far left. I don't know where his brain has gone. It might just be gone.   </p><p>      Here he is walking to the podium the other day. I don't know if he knows where he is. Listen.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome at Kingswood Community Center. Actually, that's the one down I used to work -- that's a joke. You know where we are anyway. It's great to be here and back in a place where, you know --   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  Where am I?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Jesse, what I want to know is, when does this -- when does this start being considered elder abuse? I mean, it's really not fair.   </p><p>      I mean, honestly, it wouldn't be truly sad if it wasn't so scary that this guy could be in charge of the nuclear football. You see it every day.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  He fumbles.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  He doesn't remember where he is. He forgets who his wife is. He forgets what office he is running for. He gets in front of a crowd -- and don't forget Joe Biden is a 50-year swamp creature, right?   </p><p>      If you've been a politician for 50 years, you should be able to get in front of a whopping crowd of seven people and be able to do it without a teleprompter.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  You're right. It should come naturally.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  He can't do that. His team pulls him off any interview, because you see him start to go off the rails and most notably, was sort of during the debates.   </p><p>      Notice how -- I don't think he ever completed a question without going, well, I don't want to take up any more of your time. So I'll give my time so everyone else can speak.   </p><p>      He is literally the first politician in the history of politics to not go over his time in a debate and it's because he didn't remember where he was going.   </p><p>      He spoke for 45 seconds, forgot the point he was trying to make, forgot the question, and now he is ceding back the time because he is this magnanimous guy.   </p><p>      I mean, give me a break. It's not funny. I mean, we're laughing because this is the people we are, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  No, I know we're laughing at it now, but it's scary.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  And I am like, this guy could be in charge.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATTERS</emphasis>:  And it looks like he's going to put Kamala Harris on the ticket, which is even more of a scarier idea. Not as scary as Donald Trump Jr., who everybody believes is scarier than the Iranians and the Chinese communists.   </p><p>      All right. Check out his book. You can order right now. Donald Trump Jr. There he is. Thanks.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Thank you, Jesse.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H3-41H1-F15W-H1C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

See you next time on LIFE, LIBERTY &amp; LEVIN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome to WATTERS' WORLD. I'm Jesse Watterse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The wheels of justice, that's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats couldn't impeach Trump, so now they're trying to impeach Bill Barr as Attorney General.</p><p>I told you last week these people weren't going to stop. A week after Trump was acquitted, the left already has this huge news scandal that's very similar to the last so-called scandal in this way. It was set up and nothing illegal happened.</p><p>Here's how it all starts. Mueller in the F.B.I. raid Roger Stone's house at the crack of dawn -- very, very heavy handed. CNN gets tipped off. Very suspicious with that.</p><p>Now Trump's old buddy, Roger Stone, he gets interrogated. He's tried and convicted by a jury. Nothing to do with Russia, by the way. Nothing to do with collusion at all -- all process crimes.</p><p>Now, I'm not excusing what Stone did, but he is only charged because of the hoax. There's no Russia hoax. There's no charges. He is basically just paying a price because Hillary and her fake dossier polluted the system and because John Podesta let himself get hacked.</p><p>So all of these prosecutors who used to work for Mueller's little witch hunt, they are still at the Department of Justice, and they're still prosecuting Roger Stone. So they go to Bill Barr's team and say, hey, we're not going to recommend that much prison time for Stone. That was the setup.</p><p>Now the next day, they go into court and they recommend seven to nine years in prison. Now, Roger is almost like 70. He has got a clean record. He is a non-violent offender. And the average sentence for rape is like four years and they want Stone to serve nine because he lied to Congress.</p><p>You know how many people have lied to Congress? You'd have to lock up everybody.</p><p>Donald Trump wasn't happy about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Roger Stone was treated horribly, and so were many of the people. Their lives were destroyed. People were hurt viciously and badly by these corrupt people.</p><p>I want to thank the Justice Department for seeing this horrible thing and I didn't speak to them by the way, just so you understand. They saw the horribleness of a nine-year sentence for doing nothing. You have murderers and drug addicts, and he will get nine years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So Bill Barr gets wind of this crazy overcharging and he realizes these dirty prosecutors had lied to his team and he is thinking, this is way out of line. So he lowers the seven to nine-year recommendation.</p><p>It's the judge's call anyway. Judge Amy Berman Jackson is the name. So when Barr changes the sentence recommendation, these four ex-Mueller prosecutors, they quit in this big huff.</p><p>Now, it's like they overcharge this guy to justify the hoax in the first place and they set Bill Barr up so he has to step in, and then so they can resign with all this drama and tee the Democrats up for this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should all be calling for the resignation of the Attorney General. If he won't resign, remember the Attorney General can be impeached.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Attorney General William Barr ought to be ashamed and embarrassed and resign.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): This is an abuse of power that the President is again trying to manipulate Federal law enforcement to serve his political interest. But where are the Republicans to speak out? This one must be investigated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: This is dumber than the Ukraine scandal and here's how NBC spun it.</p><p>\"A.G. Barr interfering in legal cases tied to Trump.\" Now the Attorney General can't interfere in the Department of Justice. It's his Department. The prosecutors work for him, it's like saying a boss is interfering in his own company. It doesn't make sense. Don't buy that lingo from the left.</p><p>It gets worse though. Investigative journalist, Mike Cernovich discovered the Stone jury is totally tainted. The jury foreman is a Democratic activist.</p><p>This woman ran for Congress as a Democrat. She traffics in Trump-Russia conspiracy theories. She is posting anti-Trump messages on social media before and during the trial. And she is the jury foreman?</p><p>How did the judge let this happen? Judge Jackson. Now, the whole case may have to get tossed. It's a total joke. The good news though, is this.</p><p>The wheels of justice are starting to move forward again in America. Rudy Giuliani was on WATTERS' WORLD last week, and he brought documents that he claims show Obama's people colluded with the Ukrainians against Trump and then Hunter allegedly laundered millions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, PERSONAL ATTORNEY OF DONALD TRUMP: Three witnesses who are willing to get up on the witness stand and say that in January 2016, members of Obama's N.S.C. violated the law Mueller was investigating Trump for violating.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you have any Hunter Biden documentation?</p><p>GIULIANI: This is a money laundering transaction. $14.8 million goes from Ukraine to a company in Latvia, disguised as a loan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: And this is now being investigated. People aren't getting away with what they used to. Trump is cleaning house at the National Security Council. He is getting rid of leakers like Vindman. Remember the Covington boys? The kid who was smeared just for smiling. He settled with CNN for what I assume is a pretty hefty sum.</p><p>Remember Jussie Smollett? Just got indicted for lying and filing false police reports. And where's Michael Avenatti? He is behind bars awaiting trial. That's why Bill Barr is under attack.</p><p>The left knows what's coming and we'll see what happens.</p><p>Here with reaction, the President's son and Executive VP at the Trump Organization, Donald Trump, Jr. You must agree with everything I just said there.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: A hundred percent, Jesse. It was a very astute legal dissertation there.</p><p>WATTERS: Thank you very much.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: But it's true. This is the insanity. I mean, watching you this week as it is playing out, they are saying, well, what Trump -- Trump tweeted about it -- meaning to his millions of followers all over the world. He tweeted about something that already happened, meaning the verdict against Stone, right?</p><p>They're trying to say that that is the same as when the right was outraged that Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton on a private plane on a tarmac in Arizona to talk about golf and grandkids.</p><p>Let's not pretend they're the same thing. We have no idea what they discussed. We do know that charges were dropped and things weren't pursued after that Bill Clinton meeting.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: But we have no idea. Trump sends a tweet to billions of people around the world after the fact and he is somehow getting in there and he is meddling with what's going on.</p><p>I mean, this is the sickness and of course, they can't get Trump, they've been trying for three years. They can't do the Russia hoax. They can't do the impeachment, so now they're going to impeach Bill Barr.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, this is the next thing. And you know what's going to happen. He is going to go out there and testify. He is going to run circles around them and then they're going to move on to the next thing.</p><p>But I think what your father has done, he is very focused on the issue of fairness.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: Correct.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, Hillary deletes 30,000 e-mails, nothing. You know, and Trump gets in.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: If Trump deleted 30,000 e-mails, he'd be in jail right now.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: There's a double standard --</p><p>WATTERS: Like Bloomberg gets the box.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: Roger stone and McCabe, they both lied to Congress.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: But McCabe, he is a CNN contributor. He gets -- he actually gets airtime on TV to talk about the injustices that he actually committed about --</p><p>The double standard is what's sickening, and I think that's what's so frustrating to us. Like, I don't care if we play hardball or if we play t- ball. But we've got to be playing the same game, and we're not.</p><p>WATTERS: Right. I mean, it's like you and Hunter, people say.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: Yes. They still do this thing. I mean, the left is sort of outraged because Joe Biden is all of the things they say Trump is, but isn't.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: Corrupt, slow, not particularly bright, you know, corrupt family and kids. I mean, these are what they tried to do to me. Again, you think that if I would have lied to Congress, you think I'd be here right now? I'd be in jail.</p><p>WATTERS: No, you would have been sharing a cell with Avenatti.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: And that's the reality. Unlike Hunter, I actually did 30 hours of testimony. Now, the difference is, I took a 20-minute unsolicited meeting set up and paid for by the D.N.C.</p><p>Okay, Hunter takes millions from a corrupt Ukrainian oil company. He doesn't speak Ukrainian. He knows nothing about oil or gas.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: But like, that's okay. They don't even need to hear from him, let alone get in trouble for it. And you know, that's what's disgusting to the American people.</p><p>It's like, there is not equal justice under the law. If you're one of them, you're good. You can get away with any of these things. If you are one of the Trump people, but flip on Trump, you're also good.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: If you're a Trump guy, it's over.</p><p>WATTERS: Like Bolton, now all of a sudden he is here -- now, we just mentioned ...</p><p>TRUMP, JR: It will last about two more days.</p><p>WATTERS: ... Joe Biden. I mean, the guy looks like a beaten down ghost and he really limped out in New Hampshire. What do you think's next for Sleepy Joe?</p><p>TRUMP, JR: Retirement.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: Come on. The whole thing has been a joke. I mean, Joe Biden, for the last six months, we've been watching him say like, well, it's really beautiful here in Florida. Oh, Joe, you're in Iowa, buddy. Like, oh, well, it's -- if Trump did that once, he's got -- he would have dementia. He is -- there is something wrong. He is losing it.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I mean, it's like I am very surprised this guy lasted this long.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: Joe Biden doesn't know where he is.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: Fifty percent of the time, and it's like, no, no, he is the presumptive nominee.</p><p>WATTERS: So what do you think is going to happen? I mean, Bernie looks like he's got a lot of them.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: I think they are going to do whatever they can to screw Bernie.</p><p>WATTERS: You think Bernie is going to get screwed? You think he's going to get screwed by Bloomberg or someone else?</p><p>TRUMP, JR: I think a combination of both. I think Elizabeth Warren is over. I mean, you know, she's got, you know, one in one thousand and twenty fourth of a campaign left, but she's going to sit there because she is going to play, you know, let's break up Bernie for the D.N.C. and they'll take care of her with some sort of other, you know, quid pro quo later like they will keep that voter away from him so he can't win.</p><p>WATTERS: She will figure it out at the convention.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: So they are all working together against Bernie, which is sort of amazing to see because honestly, the last time the D.N.C. used their brilliant, you know, tactics to rig a primary, they gave us Hillary Clinton.</p><p>WATTERS: It backfired.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: And I thank them for it. Guys, thank you so much.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, usually it does backfire.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: It was a great result.</p><p>WATTERS: You were out in New Hampshire the other day and the crowd started, I think they were chanting something. Let's listen what they were chanting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AUDIENCE: Forty six. Forty six. Forty six.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Number 45, forty six is next. Now was Ivanka jealous? Or were they chanting for Ivanka or you? Was it you?</p><p>TRUMP, JR: I got it a little bit after my speech, too, so that was like the third time I heard that one. Honestly. Listen, it's a great honor. It's incredibly humbling. You know, there's no greater compliment than having that many real Americans just being into you.</p><p>WATTERS: Pence is mad at you by the way. He didn't like those chants.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: Listen --</p><p>WATTERS: You can tell.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: My only focus is 2020.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: It's -- I want to see this winning continue. You're seeing the results. The people there are seeing the results. The people at the little stores and places that we stopped in like 20 stops throughout New Hampshire along the way the other day, they're all coming up to me. Everyone sees it.</p><p>WATTERS: You went to a lot of diners up there.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: I want to keep that going. I did do a lot of diners.</p><p>WATTERS: A lot of maple syrup up there. All right, throw that in some of your hair right there. That's how it gets so sleek.</p><p>TRUMP, JR: What do you think this is? This is 100 percent New Hampshire maple syrup. I totally get it somewhere else where we're primary-ing.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, thanks, Don.</p><p>Joining me now, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. So Senator, you heard at the top of the show. I believe now the wheels of justice are turning in the right direction. You're seeing people held accountable, whether it's celebrities, whether it's bureaucrats, whether it's prosecutors, if you do something wrong, I think now the American people are feeling a little more confident that they could pay a price. Do you see it that way, too?</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Yes. And I would go one step further, it's not only about punishing those people who are bad actors and may have manipulated government and used government to go after the President.</p><p>But it's also about reforming the system so this doesn't happen again.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>PAUL: I like it when I hear President Trump say, this should never happen to another President. This isn't just about President Trump.</p><p>I'm going to be introducing legislation saying that the FISA Court should never be used on a political campaign. It should never be used on an issue group, right or left. We can't allow political speech to be stymied by a secret court. This just should never happen again.</p><p>WATTERS: That's interesting, because Bill Barr says now everybody has to, I guess contact him before they start initiating a counterintelligence investigation into a political campaign or any sort of politically charged operation.</p><p>I think that's maybe a good first step. But you want to take that a step further. Let me just ask you now that we've had the trial in the Senate, and the President's been acquitted, what's the temperature like in the Senate.</p><p>Is Romney being treated well? When you walk by Chuck Schumer, do you guys - - do you guys stare daggers at each other? What's the mood like now?</p><p>PAUL: You know, I think people are fairly mature about this and there's always less contention than you actually think there is. People do act civilly to each other.</p><p>You know, I work with people across the aisle on a variety of issues. So I think it actually isn't as bad as it's made out to be. And the reason I mention that is, there isn't this seething anger whereas on the internet, you know, if you want to see anger, get on Twitter, get on Facebook, there's so much anger out there and we do need to defuse it some because we have, you know, people being attacked in restaurants.</p><p>You know, I know Steve Scalise well from the baseball team, and he almost died from an angry Bernie Sanders supporter, so we need to not let it spread out to people that were so angry, we can't talk to each other.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. We have a guy later in the show who almost was hit by a van in Florida by a deranged anti-Trump radical. So you're saying that Romney is allowed to sit at the Senate lunch table with you guys.</p><p>PAUL: Oh, and I'm not divulging whether he's allowed to sit at the table or not. But no, I think the thing is, I've told him, I disagreed with the vote, but you know, I've been an outlier. I've been against war, sometimes when my caucus is for war.</p><p>WATTERS: That's a good point.</p><p>PAUL: I've been for privacy sometimes when my caucus hasn't been.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>PAUL: And the thing is, is even the President when I talk to President Trump, he's like, I know you believe that. I know you believe that. But the thing is, I support the President, I think on the important things. When there are partisan attacks on the President, I'm 110 percent in his corner.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. That makes sense.</p><p>PAUL: But when we have a policy difference, I think he appreciates it, because I'm not afraid to stand up and give him my opinion.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, one of the things that happened in that Senate trial is that you went up there. I guess, you may have named the whistleblower, you named a name that many people believe is the whistleblower and that video got out there.</p><p>PAUL: Nobody knows. Nobody knows who the whistleblower is.</p><p>WATTERS: No one knows -- no one knows for sure. Right? Yes. It's all over the place, but no one knows for sure. Not only the Chief Justice Roberts shut you down once or twice, but the video of a sitting U.S. Senator on the Senate floor was censored by a big tech company in California, YouTube.</p><p>How dangerous do you think that is? And what are you going to do about it, if anything?</p><p>PAUL: I'm going to give them a whole heaping full of criticism. I'm going to lay into them and say, YouTube, if you want to act as if you're not biased, if you want to act as if you want conservatives to use your portal and be part of it, you better treat people fairly, because this looks like you've chosen sides.</p><p>I did not call anybody the whistleblower in my speech on the floor. I named two names, but I didn't say either one of them were a whistleblower. I just said they worked together and there were reports that they were plotting the impeachment years in advance.</p><p>I think they ought to know, was it legal what they were doing? At the very least, they should not work for the President or in the Executive Branch if they're trying to undermine the President. That would sound not just disloyal, but perhaps unlawful.</p><p>WATTERS: Right. But we're not saying that the names of the alleged whistleblower here on Fox or on WATTERS' WORLD, but I appreciate your honesty, Senator. And maybe one day Romney can come back and sit at the lunch table. Thank you very much.</p><p>PAUL: Thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: Still ahead. A President's Day history quiz. This is a good one.</p><p>Plus, as I said, a victim from last weekend's vicious van attack on Trump supporters is here exclusively.</p><p>WATTERS: The American economy keeps on getting better and better. Breaking records on jobs and in the stock market. In a recent Gallup poll showing 63 percent of voters approve of the way the President is handling the economy. So why do Democrats keep on talking about doom and gloom?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Here is the reality. Half of the American people today are living paycheck to paycheck. Today, you've got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets.</p><p>TOM STEYER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: His economy isn't delivering for working people. The jobs don't pay enough for people to live on. We've got to take him down on the economy.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The problem is we've had an economy grow and not being to lift up those most in need.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Here with more, Director of the White House National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, who when the President says he hears speak, he says he thinks of money.</p><p>Larry, when you hear the Democrats talk about how bad things are for regular working class people, it's just not true. We know they're going to lie, we know they're going to spend, but how do you at the same time tout the great economic achievements for the middle class, but at the same time, acknowledge that paychecks have to get bigger, and that you hear the concerns of working class Americans?</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Well, listen, we've always heard the concerns of working class Americans. Actually, the President's whole campaign in 2016 was about lowering tax burdens for middle class Americans and small businesses, getting rid of needless and costly regulations that have damaged small businesses, who are the biggest job hirers in the country, creating millions of jobs with our energy packages that has made us independent.</p><p>And maybe most of all, to renegotiate bad trade deals, which permitted unfair trading practices, and which damaged middle class jobs and manufacturing and farming and elsewhere.</p><p>I mean, look, this riff that I'm hearing from the other side of the aisle is a great example, Jesse of cognitive dissonance. All right?</p><p>Now, I know you're not really in the economic game. You know what I mean, when I say cognitive dissonance?</p><p>WATTERS: It's true.</p><p>KUDLOW: You know what that is, okay, buddy.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: Now, I'm just saying that because as, you know, in Washington, no one lies. So it's just a bit of cognitive dissonance.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>KUDLOW: Here's a deal. When you see middle income wages for production workers rising faster than their managers significantly faster, I make weekly wages for middle income and lower wage earners are rising five percent. The manager's wages are rising about two percent, that's one point. The bottom 10 percent of the workforce is getting the largest gains substantially faster.</p><p>Now, these are gains. These are growth.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>KUDLOW: Substantially faster than the top one percent. This old saw that I'm hearing that the middle class lives paycheck to paycheck. Well, I don't know exactly what that means. I mean, I believe certain presidential candidates probably live paycheck to paycheck. That's beside the point if the paycheck is fatter, which is exactly what is happening here and they will not acknowledge that.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, I mean, I think Larry you've done very well in your illustrious career. People do live paycheck to paycheck, you know, they string out things and they and they have to really budget, but I think the President has a firm grip on those realities.</p><p>KUDLOW: But that point is, Jesse -- here's the point.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW: The paychecks are getting fatter -- so here's the stat. This is not our stat. You know, this comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau. We don't control those agencies, all right.</p><p>They're the ones that are telling us after tax, after inflation, the average family in the United States, about $66,000.00 a year has increased their take home pay to use Ronald Reagan's phrase by $5,000.00 in three years.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. And I use that statistic on WATTERS' WORLD. I'm very familiar with it, Larry, even with my very limited grasp of economics. That makes sense to me.</p><p>KUDLOW: Actually, you can reduce it all to cognitive dissonance. Look, the prior 16 years, Jesse, under Republicans and Democrats -- that after tax take home pay stuff was basically flat. We're up $5,000.00. That is a direct consequence of lower taxes and regulations and better trade deals and better energy for example.</p><p>Look, at some point, the cognitive dissonance has to give way to the actual facts and like I say, we don't control the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We don't control the Census Bureau, and not only is this a blue collar boom. This is a women's boom. Okay?</p><p>I don't know if you saw Ivanka Trump's event we had at the State Department yesterday. Women are among the best beneficiaries of this. It is women now who dominate the labor force. It is women who have had a huge increase in participation rates and wages.</p><p>It is women at the margin who are coming back into the labor force. Women have power. They have economic power.</p><p>WATTERS: There is no doubt about it. Women are winning.</p><p>KUDLOW: I don't hear the other side talking about that and let's go in African-American unemployment, okay, in fact, overall unemployment 3.6 percent. Let's look at the African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian women. How about the snowflakes? The millennials, Jesse. Are you a -- Jesse Watters, are you a millennial?</p><p>WATTERS: No, but thank you. I appreciate that.</p><p>KUDLOW: All right. It's put you in that category because I want to say that the young millennials who are far too much maligned, they've gone back to work. Their participation rate has skyrocketed.</p><p>WATTERS: Wow. They are moving out of their parents' basement. I love it.</p><p>Everybody. If you don't know what cognitive dissonance is, go Google it. Larry, thank you very much.</p><p>KUDLOW: Thanks, Jesse. Appreciate it.</p><p>WATTERS: All right. Still ahead. Ron Paul is going to grade Donald Trump's presidency. Can't wait for that.</p><p>But first Biden falling apart. And Bernie on the run with Bloomberg looming. Lou Dobbs reacts to all of that next.</p><p>AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Aishah Hasnie. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves has declared a state of emergency after some historic flooding there. Parts of Jackson and outlying areas are under evacuation orders and officials say more than 2,000 homes could be in danger.</p><p>The river is expected to crest at nearly 38 feet on Sunday and it could remain at dangerously high levels for the next several days.</p><p>Meantime, a Turkish delegation is set to travel to Russia on Monday amid some growing international criticism that the situation in Syria is an urgent humanitarian crisis. Hundreds of thousands are without homes after being forced to flee following the Turkish invasion.</p><p>Earlier today, Turkish President Erdogan called President Trump to say there were simply too many refugees for him to take care of. I'm Aishah Hasnie, now back to WATTERS' WORLD.</p><p>WATTERS: Bernie Sanders may have come out on top of New Hampshire, but he's got Democrats rattled, and some of them are saying he may take down the entire party. Here's Carville.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I'm scared to death. I really am.</p><p>I'm not about a revolution. I'm not an ideologue. Politics means building coalitions. It means listening to people. It means shaping a message that you can do.</p><p>There is a certain part of the Democratic Party that wants us to be a cult. I'm not interested in being in a cult. I'm 75 years old. I'm just not a -- I am not a very culty person.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Joining us now, host of \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" on Fox Business Channel, Lou Dobbs, you're not a culty person.</p><p>LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Never.</p><p>WATTERS: Never been.</p><p>DOBBS: As a matter of fact, I'm not a joiner and I wouldn't join a club that would have me.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right. Do you think Bernie Sanders could just wreck the Democrats if he gets the nomination?</p><p>DOBBS: If he gets the nomination, I think he'll be formidable. He will lose badly to the President. But he will be formidable. Look at all those candidates that he is already -- he has got the fear of God and all of them except for Elizabeth Warren. Because he is so far to the left and he his -- brother, he is pushing hard.</p><p>WATTERS: She played the gender card on him.</p><p>DOBBS: Sure.</p><p>WATTERS: I think that might have been part of her downfall.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: They had kind of had that agreement where they weren't going to attack each other. Then she went after Bernie and the Bernie Bros and woop, she hits the basement.</p><p>Biden -- what happened to him? Here he is trying to act tough on \"The View.\" Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY BEHAR, ABC HOST: People wanted really to see you get mad when Trump started lying about Hunter and saying things about Hunter. I don't know that you got mad or not?</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, you know, I would like to be able to be back in high school and just have he and I in a room.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, sure. Is he over?</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, he's over.</p><p>WATTERS: It's over.</p><p>DOBBS: When he starts wishing for beat downs like that, he is in real trouble. He has lost his way. And I think his time is past. It's the kindest way I can say it.</p><p>He is -- you know, I salute what he's done for the country. But he is so -- I am astonished, frankly, that the party has not said as President Obama said, Joe, you don't have to do this, because it has not been pretty to watch.</p><p>And I'm even uncomfortable as people laugh at his gaffes and his faux pas and just plain awkward dumb mistakes. It's sad to watch.</p><p>WATTERS: I mean, he has got -- what two weeks -- until South Carolina.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>WATTERS: And if he doesn't finish first there, I mean, does he go to Super Tuesday? Or does he bow out gracefully?</p><p>DOBBS: No, he is meeting with 250 of the biggest donors in Democratic politics. They may give him money, but I hope that they'll give him a heartfelt statement of how they really feel about his prospects.</p><p>Because -- and frankly, I don't care what they do. I'm for President Trump. I am for everything he stands for. And -- but Biden is just such a sad, tragic human story that you can't help but worry about what the Democrats are doing to him and he to himself.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, that's the whole strategy behind Mini Mike looming with billions and billions of dollars. Here was the President when he was asked about facing off against Bloomberg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: He's a lightweight, you're going to find that out. He's also one of the worst debaters I've ever seen and his presence is zero.</p><p>Frankly, I'd rather run against Bloomberg than Bernie Sanders because Sanders has real followers. Whether you like him or not, whether you agree with him on that, I happen to think it's terrible what he says, but he has followers.</p><p>Bloomberg is just buying his way in.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think Bloomberg can buy votes during the primary?</p><p>DOBBS: Well, he's bought 15 percent in one poll of that support, 15 percent. It's a lot different to buy those votes as you suggest, and I don't think he can buy enough to be a factor.</p><p>At least externally, he can be a major factor in that convention and in the campaign and the General Election.</p><p>WATTERS: We'll see when he steps up on his little box and debates. This guy is pretty slick.</p><p>DOBBS: What's his name again that the President gave him?</p><p>WATTERS: That's super. Mini Mike. All right. Still ahead, a victim of last weekend's van attack on Trump supporters. He speaks out exclusively on WATTERS' WORLD.</p><p>Plus, Senator Rand Paul was already here, now his father, Ron Paul is going to come on and he is going to grade the President's first term.</p><p>WATTERS: President Trump now well into his third year in office, and he's got a lot done -- booming economy, lot of terrorists killed, illegal immigration down.</p><p>So we decided there's no better time to grade his presidency so far than now.</p><p>So here with us to do that, Ron Paul, former presidential candidate, and host of \"The Ron Paul Liberty Report.\"</p><p>Okay, Congressman, let's begin with immigration policy. What grade would you give the President there?</p><p>RON PAUL, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It depends on what day of the week it is. It's up and down.</p><p>I don't -- he doesn't get an A plus from me. I don't like walls and fences and things like that. But actually, immigration is down. I don't know whether that's because of Trump or whether he has helped do that.</p><p>You know, so illegal immigration is done. So I'd give him a low C. He doesn't get a high A and I don't think he's completely failed, because he does talk a little bit about my theory about what we do, it if you don't subsidize something, it will help. And if you do subsidize something, you get more of it.</p><p>I think the subsidies for illegally entering this country is the main motivating factor for us to have our problem.</p><p>WATTERS: So are you talking about benefits in terms of entitlements or in state tuition, things like that? Driver's licenses like they're doing here in New York?</p><p>R. PAUL: Yes. All of that for a starter, but it's also a special way to become a citizen, easy road to citizenship, jumping in front of the line and getting free education. I mean, it makes no sense at all.</p><p>All I can say is, if most Americans were put in the same situation, they'd probably be praying or hoping they could, you know, get some of that, but I just think it's divisive to do -- to take from --</p><p>WATTERS: Low C minus is a tough grade, Congressman. I mean, I would give them maybe a B plus. But you know, we just have word right now that the Pentagon -- here it is -- just transferred close to $4 billion to fund the border wall construction. So I think it's moving in the right direction. But you know, we can disagree on that.</p><p>Tell me about his economic policy. Where do you stand on that in terms of a grade?</p><p>R. PAUL: Partially I endorse, you know, most conservatives, and you don't even have to be a libertarian Austrian economist to say, lowering taxes and lowering the regulations is a good idea.</p><p>But, no, he's a long way from what Austrian economics teaches what free markets are all about. And that is, it deals with the monetary policy, it deals with the Federal Reserve. You want to have interest rates designed by the marketplace, not by putting pressure on the Federal Reserve and say get those rates down.</p><p>And on the short run, it is sort of like, you know, if people need to get ahead and they can hold somebody up, steal some money and live beyond their means or borrow the money, you know, from the Federal Reserve, you can have an appearance of a pretty good prosperity. But it will always end.</p><p>So the zero rate interest rate, it's the craziest thing ever. It's not going to work. The biggest problem with that overall is what a lot of people are admitting now, it creates a lot of debt. It's huge.</p><p>Just this week, what was it? $14 trillion per household. You know, all household debt. This is unsustainable and it could distort things --</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I mean, but we've been saying that for what? Decades. The debt is out of control, and it just keeps on getting bigger and bigger and neither party is going to do anything about that.</p><p>Finally, so you never gave me a grade. What was the grade for economic policy? You've got to admit, you know, it's a job.</p><p>R. PAUL: C minus for tax and regulators --</p><p>WATTERS: You are a tough grader. C minus again? Wow. Geez.</p><p>R. PAUL: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: I'd like to see your grades with Barack Obama.</p><p>R. PAUL: Somebody -- if you care about the economy, you've got to care about those people who had secretly manipulated interest rates in the money supply. They're the bosses of this whole economy and Trump knows it and he has to handle it.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, that's a longer discussion. Finally, foreign policy. I mean, I just have to step in. He is probably someone that's right up your alley. I mean, he's not starting a lot of new wars. He wants to get out of the Middle East. Clearly, you have to give him better than a C minus Congressman Paul.</p><p>R. PAUL: Well, I think we're in the same category. Let me give that some thought. But no, if we go by what he says and what he said in the campaign, you know, he deserves a B plus. I'm coming home. I'm stopping these wars.</p><p>But you know, take Syria for instance, he said that what we need to do is come home and he makes that announcement, the next day sends more troops over there.</p><p>WATTERS: There is always the second terms, you know and that's a guarantee almost.</p><p>R. PAUL: It's too much intervention for me.</p><p>WATTERS: All right. Well, I think any intervention is too much for you, but Congressman, wait, did I hear any final grade? Last on foreign policy?</p><p>R. PAUL: On foreign policy is another C minus.</p><p>WATTERS: Okay. C minus across the board.</p><p>R. PAUL: What he says though, I'd give him a B, but what happens is we're doing the same old things. We're intervening when we shouldn't be and we should be taking care of ourselves.</p><p>WATTERS: Thank you. Thank you very much, Professor. I mean, Congressman.</p><p>R. PAUL: Thank you, Jesse. Nice to talk to you.</p><p>WATTERS: Some crazy anti-Trump guy drove his van into a bunch of Trump supporters down in Florida. One of the victims of that van attack speaks out exclusively next on WATTERS' WORLD.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All of a sudden, he hit the gas and plowed into us.</p><p>QUESTION: How close did he come to hitting people?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Probably maybe about half a foot.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Twenty-seven-year-old Gregory Timm is sitting in jail after police say he ran into a Republican voter registration tent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This individual drove up to a tent that was clearly registering voters with Donald Trump's name and attire around them.</p><p>It looks like political attack to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Last weekend's van attack in Florida was politically motivated and it's been barely covered by the media.</p><p>Joining me now with this reaction, one of the victims of the attack, Mark Alfieri. So Mark, did you get the sense that he was trying to plow the van into you or just trying to kind of crash into the tent?</p><p>MARK ALFIERI, VAN ATTACK VICTIM: Well, initially, you know, the -- you know, the shock of it, he approached us kind of about a 45-degree angle. He was waving at us. He was smiling, making it appear like he was going to stop the van, get out and start talking with us, as many, many people had done that afternoon, when he just accelerated and plowed right into the tent, overturning the tent, our tables, all of our equipment and the volunteers, including myself, having to scatter.</p><p>WATTERS: Wow, he almost kind of set you up, made you feel at ease by waving and smiling and then accelerated. How close did he come to you guys?</p><p>ALFIERI: He came very close, you know, especially to the two women -- the two female volunteers that were with me. He came very close to them, and that resulted in two of the felony criminal accounts that are pending now against him.</p><p>WATTERS: How fast was he going about?</p><p>ALFIERI: Gosh. Difficult to say. It was just, you know, it was so quick him plowing into the tent to overturning tables, cell phones flying everywhere. It was pretty shocking.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. So he gets out of there according to all of you and the witnesses. He flips you off. I guess he gets back in the van and drives away. Now, he told police that he did this because he does not like Donald Trump and he wanted to take a stand. He said, \"Someone had to take a stand.\" Is this a hate crime in your opinion?</p><p>ALFIERI: I believe it would be a hate crime. I mean, it was just -- it was a very deliberate act, and like I was mentioning before, there was, you know, a fair amount of deception in it before he actually rammed the van into our tent and tables.</p><p>So, you know, I believe it was a hate crime and definitely politically motivated. Some pretty intense feelings against President Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: How do you feel about the fact that this has barely been touched by the media? I think, CBS, ABC, they never even covered it. I think NBC touched on it for a few seconds. How does that make you feel?</p><p>ALFIERI: I think it's pretty incredible actually and just you know, it's kind of outrageous that the most of the national media did not cover it, because we had, you know, people, myself doing a civic duty and this this crime -- this felony crime that was committed pretty, pretty outrageous that it was not covered.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, Mark I'm glad you're okay. I'm glad everybody else is okay and I hope this guy is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Thanks for joining WATTERS' WORLD.</p><p>ALFIERI: Thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: Up next, a very special Presidents Day Last Call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: The big war under his presidency --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: World War?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: President's Day is Monday, so what better way to honor those who have held office then with a look back at how much people really know about these leaders?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: What are you doing today to commemorate the Presidents?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Basically, I'm trying to earn some dead Presidents.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't do the President thing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM MOVIE \"NACHO LIBRE.\")</p><p>JACK BLACK, ACTOR, PLAYING \"NACHO\": You've got to be kidding me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: I'm going to hold up some pictures of some of the Presidents.

Our right to freely engage in public discourse through speech is under sustained attack, necessitating a vigorous defense against the major social media and internet platforms. From 'shadowbans' onFacebook[1]andTwitter[2], todemonetization of YouTube videos[3], topulled[4]ads for Republican candidates at the critical junctures of election campaigns, the list ofviolations against the online practices and speech of conservatives[5]is long. I certainly had my suspicions confirmed when Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, 'accidentally' censored[6] a post I made regarding the Jussie Smollett hoax, which consequently led to me hearing from hundreds of my followers about how they've been having problems seeing, liking or being able to interact with my posts. </p><p>Many of them even claimed that they've had to repeatedly refollow me, as Instagram keeps unfollowing me on their accounts.ADVERTISEMENTWhile nothing about Big Tech's censorship of conservatives truly surprises me anymore, it's still chilling to see the proof for yourself. If it can happen to me, the son of the president, with millions of followers on social media, just think about how bad it must be for conservatives with smaller followings and those who don't have the soapbox or media reach to push back when they're being targeted? Thanks to a brave Facebook whistleblower whoapproached[7]James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, we now know that Mark Zuckerberg[8]Mark Elliot Zuckerberg[9]Conservatives face a tough fight as Big Tech's censorship expands[10] Actually, consumers love Big Tech, even if they say they don't[11] Top Instagram communications staffer leaves for Michelle Obama's staff[12] MORE[13]'s social media giant developed algorithms to 'deboost' certain content, limiting its distribution and appearance in news feeds. As you probably guessed, this stealth censorship was specifically aimed at conservatives. Facebook appears to have deliberatelytailored[14]its algorithm to recognize the syntax and style popular among conservatives in order to 'deboost' that content. 'Mainstream media,' 'SJW\" (Social Justice Warrior) and 'red pill' \u2014 all terms that conservatives often use to express themselves \u2014 were listed as red flags, according to the former Facebook insider. Facebook engineers even cited BlazeTV host Lauren Chen's video criticizing the social justice movement as an example of the kind of 'red pills' that users just aren't allowed to drop anymore. Mainstream conservative content wasstrangled[15]in real time, yet fringe leftists such as the Young Turks enjoy free rein on the social media platform. Despite the occasionalbrave gesture[16], politicians have been far too sluggish in recognizing the extent of the problem. But the Republican Party and the conservative movement are becoming more vigilant against the suppression of our speech, as we saw at last weekend'sConservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)[17].ADVERTISEMENTSilicon Valley lobbyists have splashedmillions of dollars[18]all over the Washington swamp to play on conservatives' innate faith in the free-market system and respect for private property. Even as Big Tech companies work to exclude us from the town square of the 21st century, they've been able to rely on misguided conservatives tocarry water[19]for them with irrelevant pedantry about whether the First Amendmentapplies[20]in cases of social media censorship. Sen. Josh Hawley[21]Joshua (Josh) David Hawley[22]Trio of NFL players intern on Capitol Hill as part of league program[23] Conservatives face a tough fight as Big Tech's censorship expands[24] Hirono calls out Trump for 'appalling' comments she says encourage violence[25] MORE[26] (R-Mo.) has beenmaking[27]a name for himself as a Republican prepared to stand up to Big Tech malfeasance since his time as Missouri's attorney general. Hedelivered[28]a tour de force interview with The Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel in front of the CPAC crowd, one that provided a clear-eyed assessment of the ongoing affront to the freedoms of conservative speech and expression. Hawley demolished the absurd notion that 'conservative principles' preclude taking action to ensure free debate online simply because Big Tech firms \u2014 the most powerful corporations in the world \u2014 are private companies. Hawley pointed out that Big Tech companies already enjoy 'sweetheart deals' under current regulations that make their malfeasance a matter of public concern. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, for instance, allows them to avoid liability for the content that users post to their platforms. To address this problem, Hawley proposed adding a viewpoint neutrality requirement for platforms that benefit from Section 230's protections, which were originallyenacted[29]to protect the internet as 'a forum for a true diversity of political discourse.' 'Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,' Hawley declared. 'They should not be able to discriminate against conservatives. They should not be able to tell us we need to sit down and shut up!' It's high time other conservative politicians started heeding Hawley's warnings, because the logical endpoint of Big Tech's free rein is far more troubling than conservative meme warriors losing their Twitter accounts. As we're alreadystarting to see[30], what starts with social media censorship can quickly lead to banishment from such fundamental services as transportation, online payments and banking. Left unchecked, Big Tech and liberal activists could construct a private 'social credit' system \u2014 not unlike what the communists have nightmarishlyimplemented[31]in China \u2014 that excludes outspoken conservatives from wide swaths of American life simply because their political views differ from those of tech executives. There is no conservative principle that even remotely suggests we are obligated to adopt a laissez-faire attitude while the richest companies on earth abuse the power we give them to put a thumb on the scale for our political enemies. If anything, our love of the free market dictates that we must do whatever is necessary to ensure that the free marketplace of ideas remains open to all.

That price is surely to be steeper than that.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>losing considerable ground in Iowa while making more controversial comments in a New Hampshire town hall meeting. Blake Burman has the latest from Washington for us this morning.</p><p>Blake, good morning.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Sandra. Good morning to you.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>still holds commanding leads nationally and in a couple of the early voting states, but there's a growing trend in Iowa according to the polls taken there over the last week. <person><nameText>Dr. Ben Carson </nameText></person>has supplanted Trump in the first caucus state. Carson has won four of the last five polls, as you can see here, with the fifth being a tie. They are all fairly sizable spreads, with the most recent from Monmouth University showing Carson with a 14 point lead.</p><p>In the meantime, Trump is facing some scrutiny now for a couple of comments he made yesterday in New Hampshire. In one of them, Trump said it's easy for women to wear burkas because they don't have to wear makeup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In fact, it's easier. You don't have to put on make-up. Look how beautiful everyone looks. Wouldn't it be easier? Wha (ph). Right? Wouldn't that be easy? I'll tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want to - wha, I'm ready, darling, let's go. It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: And, separately, Trump also took credit for Ford's decision to halt truck production plans in Mexico and stay in Ohio. However, Sandra, that was strongly disputed by both Ford and the Ohio Governor and Presidential Candidate John Kasich.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Blake, thank you.</p><p>BURMAN: Thanks.</p><p>SMITH: Dagen, we're going to ask you for your comments on Trump's comments, about women in burkas and -</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Where did he - where was he giving that speech? Checky's (ph) Shack (ph) down in Boca Raton. Hey, I'll be here all week, try the veal. That's what it was like. That's - it's not president but I don't think anybody who's a fan of his really cares, do they?</p><p>SMITH: Well, it's interesting because here we're talking about how Dr. Carson in now - he's now won three of the last four major polls in Iowa and, Jon, one of the biggest demographics that he is successful with right now and gaining ground with is women.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, you know, I think - listening to Trump there, I think he really runs the risk of wearing out his welcome. I mean like you say, Dagen, this - he sounds like a bad stand- up comedian. Is that really what we want for the presidency? As far as Carson goes, you have to wonder, I mean America doesn't really know him. You have to wonder what kind of staying power he's going to have as people get to know him a little bit better.</p><p>SMITH: Well, the race is surely changing. <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>gaining some steam, as you pointed out last hour. Marco Rubio at 10 percent. Is the playing field changing?</p><p>HILSENRATH: It does look like - I think it is changing. I think you see people like Cruz coming up and you have to keep an eye on him. As - as - as -</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Carly is - <person><nameText>Carly Fiorina </nameText></person>has kind of lost her appeal to voters out -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes, that's - I was wondering about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That she had that incredible debate performance but she's kind of receded a little bit and I wonder what it would take to move her back up.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You have to wonder is, these Fox Business debates come up in a couple weeks, if that's going to be a stage for her to reassert herself, because that's going to be all of that business in the economy.</p><p>SMITH: Well, a GOP debate tomorrow night as well on the economy.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>SMITH: So that would be an opportunity, obviously, for her to shine. We'll see if that happens. But, yes, <person><nameText>Carly Fiorina </nameText></person>not on the top five in that most recent poll. So, all right, guys, thank you.</p><p>Big day for tech earnings with Apple and Twitter set to release quarterly numbers after today's close. Jo Ling Kent is here and joins us on set. She's talking Ali Baba.</p><p>JO LING KENT: Yes. We are seeing some big mobile revenue jumps, which is always good news for an ecommerce company. A huge earnings day. Ali Baba beat on the top and bottom just a few minutes ago. Revenue came in at $3.49 billion, beating that $3.35 billion the street was looking for. Plus, EPS of $0.57 a share, beating that expected $0.54 estimate. Gross merchandize volume was up 28 percent, revenue was up 32 percent, so some very big moves there for Ali Baba, especially as they go into singles day, their biggest sales day of the year, which comes up in November.</p><p>And T-Mobile earnings out later this hour. Expectations of $8.28 billion in revenue with $0.30 on EPS.</p><p>Ford also just out moments ago posting mixed results, $38.1 billion in revenue. That's a beat of the $35.07 billion the street was looking for. But adjusted EPS coming in just shy at $0.45, of that $0.46 estimate.</p><p>And then after the bell today, two big name in tech, of course. Apple's fiscal fourth quarter expected to post revenue of $1.11 billion with $1.88 in EPS. And the pressure really is on here for iPhone sales, Apple Watch, also looking at China as that slows down, if they're able to sustain momentum there.</p><p>And we're also going to be watching Twitter as well. This is the first earnings report since Jack Dorsey was named the permanent CEO. EPS expected of $0.05 a share. Revenue expected at $560 million. Now, that one is all about monthly active user growth plus these new products. Twitter Moments, is it resonating? Our users actually picking up and changing their behavior and sticking around on Twitter?</p><p>SMITH: So do you expect some good news for - for Twitter then?</p><p>KENT: It could be better but it may not get better for a while in terms of permanent growth in the positive direction. Jack Dorsey has a lot of work to do, even though everyone's pretty glad that he's back.</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will say the delivery of ads on Instagram is top notch compared to all other social media applications.</p><p>KENT: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this - so targeted. Interesting ads, video -</p><p>KENT: Seamless.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Seamless. And -</p><p>KENT: And you've seen that in FaceBook earnings, too, it's really working.</p><p>SMITH: Right. He's - he's sitting right next to me. I want to bring him in. Russell Investments chief market strategist Stephen Wood.</p><p>What do you expect out of these big tech giant, Apple, Twitter, optimism?</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS: I think so. I think there's going to be a bright spot in earnings in the Q3 and it's not going to come from much of the S&amp;P 500. So I think where we're going to get firmer earnings is going to be in tech. I think we need to look at Apple and kind of back that out. I can't comment on a specific company, when will you back out Apple earnings. I think it's going to be a challenged third quarter and one of the - the less dim spots is going to be in tech.</p><p>SMITH: Less dim spot is going to be in tech. OK. So you kind of, sort of like technology I guess at this point.</p><p>WOOD: Yes. Yes. And as -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Steve -</p><p>WOOD: Yes, sir.</p><p>HILSENRATH: What are you getting from the conference calls that you're listening in on? We had a story in the paper yesterday that pointed to dimming expectations among CEOs for the outlook for growth in the U.S. and overseas. Are you picking up on any of that yourself?</p><p>WOOD: I think we are. We - it's - well, this has been a top line challenge environment for a long time. Companies have been pretty good at hitting their earnings numbers for a large number of quarters, you know, pushing half a decade, but we really haven't seen any movement in revenue and sales and I think that's really starting to push into the front quarter. But I think what - one of the bigger stories is going to be what happens in December with the Fed and our job is not to be like a total nerd fest here talking about the Fed.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, actually, that is what his job is -</p><p>WOOD: I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is (INAUDIBLE) Fed nerd.</p><p>KENT: I like it.</p><p>WOOD: Fed nerd. And I'm with you. No -</p><p>SMITH: I just tweeted out, hash tag nerds on set with us.</p><p>WOOD: Nerds on set.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>WOOD: Book-ended by nerds here. But I think the oil story, which has really challenged not only debt and equity space for the first week quarters as we go into 2016, some of the benefits from oil come into the economy and I think that's going to be a little bit of a lift.</p><p>SMITH: Do you think we're going to see it?</p><p>WOOD: I think so. Well, if you're an energy company, you've got to recognize all those losses in the first and second quarter. But if you're a consumer, you're not going to buy 12 months of gasoline in the first week of January. It takes you 12 months to pay 12 electric bills, to pay 12 energy bills. So I think as we move into this quarter, the fourth quarter, and the first quarter of next year, you begin to see some modest improvement based upon the drop in energy prices.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I thought Jo - so Jo Ling just reported all these earnings numbers. What - what you reported, the one that I found most interesting was Ford's top line. That Ford beat expectations on its revenue growth.</p><p>KENT: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We have a car sales boom going on in this country right now.</p><p>WOOD: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: People are - they - they haven't recognized it.</p><p>WOOD: Unreported, yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But - well, actually, we had a front-page story about it before the last Fed meeting. But I think that's an example of consumers finally starting to kick in and driving growth. It will be interesting to see what the other automakers have.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>WOOD: And that's an interesting - if you look at China too, the consumer story, the industrial story is well known in China, but the consumer story, and it's positive in China is probably less well covered, and I think you get some of that effect in the United States as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, speaking of -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you really believe that they're making that transition in China or -</p><p>WOOD: No, I do believe that they're making that transition. No matter what, they will make that transition. That's a government policy -</p><p>KENT: But do you believe the numbers behind that transition right now?</p><p>WOOD: I think believe in numbers is a strong statement.</p><p>KENT: OK.</p><p>WOOD: Coming out of China.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So are you buying emerging markets? Are you buying China?</p><p>WOOD: I would not say buying Chinese right now. I think that the - the Chinese government is going to transition from that export-oriented, more consumers based economy and that is going to create challenges and commodity based emerging market. So it might be a little bit early on emerging market, but valuations are starting to look attractive. They're beginning to bottom out in the cycle. We know that China's a 7 percent, 6.5 percent grower. That's going to happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can I -</p><p>WOOD: And the question is, whether it is priced in, in emerging markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm trying to promote Jon's story, because he's got a story on the front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today, and the central issue this week and this year will be the Federal Reserve. And I read every word in your story and it was - it basically shows a Fed that's a mess.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, Janet Yellen has a hard job on her hands on two fronts. One is that the economy is hard to read right now. You would expect inflation to be kicking in with unemployment coming down and it hasn't been. So she's got a hard decision to make on the economy. A harder decision - or a harder job is getting her 16 colleagues to agree with her. And as we lay out in this story, there's just a lot of people with different opinions.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Jon, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll tell people to read it because it's great.</p><p>SMITH: And Stephen Wood, thank you. And Jo Ling Kent, thank you.</p><p>WOOD: Thank you.</p><p>KENT: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: We've got Walmart's new delivery service coming up next, about to lift off, putting the retail giant in the same new space has Amazon. And, by the way, a new poll out putting Dr. Carson at the top of the GOP candidates nationally. We're going to talk about that as well.</p><p>First, here are a few of the top headlines that we're watching in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning, including BP profit falling on weaker oil prices. Health insurance premiums set to climb in 2016. And that NASA spacecraft set for historic fly-by of one of Saturn's moons. We're coming right back. Stay with us.</p><p>SMITH: All right, we've got some new poll numbers just out giving <person><nameText>Ben Carson </nameText></person>a national lead. Cheryl Casone has this story and more.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Sandra, good morning.</p><p><person><nameText>Ben Carson </nameText></person>edging <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in a national poll for the first time. The latest CBS/\"New York Times\" poll gives Carson a four point lead over Trump, holding 26 percent of the vote. But, by the way, Iowa, we've been seeing Mr. Carson leading in Iowa. So big news, big news on this national scale today.</p><p>We've also got this for you. Another headache for the fantasy sports world. Legislation to regulate daily fantasy sports is expected to be introduced in Illinois today. This bill aims to protect consumers from draining - quote, \"draining their bank accounts,\" as well as make sure they have a legitimate shot at winning on these sites.</p><p>And finally the battle of the drones heating up, this time with Walmart. The retailer applying for permission to test drones for home delivery, curbside pickup, checking warehouse inventories and this could be a sign that the retailer plans to go head to head with Amazon. Amazon's been very vocal, Sandra, obviously, about trying to get drones into the skies for delivery service and things.</p><p>Here's my question, do you want groceries delivered at your home via drone? Are you OK with that, comfortable with that?</p><p>SMITH: No.</p><p>CASONE: No? Interesting. Wow.</p><p>Well, Dagen, I know you -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I - I think that there are some credible applications for drones, law enforcement -</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You surveying land, even, you know, firefighting. But I just - I can't picture mass execution of drone delivery.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, so you talk about law enforcement. I think drones have a bad name because we've been using them for the last decade to shoot people from the sky. And - but you have to look at how this technology could get applied commercially. And if Amazon and Walmart think they can do it for logistics purposes, then more power to them. Let them try it.</p><p>CASONE: Let me ask you something, though. What happens when a drone that's delivering a package at 2 Cedar Street in Iowa hits a small child on a bike and there's a massive lawsuit. It - you know what I mean, like if you're Amazon or you're Walmart, they've got - their lawyers have to be thinking about this kind -</p><p>SMITH: Wait, wait, wait, wait but a FedEx truck could do the same thing.</p><p>CASONE: It could.</p><p>SMITH: Or a Walmart truck could do the same thing. So I don't know if that's -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Exactly.</p><p>CASONE: But drones make me - like I said earlier, drones make me so much more nervous.</p><p>SMITH: But, wait, did you just say that they're considering the drones for curbside pickup?</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: Because I'm thinking that sounds even funnier.</p><p>CASONE: And (ph) delivery.</p><p>SMITH: Like you drive up to the store and a drone flies out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I'm too lazy to get out of my car and actually go - go into the store.</p><p>SMITH: Fly out (ph).</p><p>HILSENRATH: But we - but we are. That's right. We have - that's why drive- through exists.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm not. I'm not.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But we - most Americans are. There would not be a thriving drive-through, you know, fast-food industry if we weren't all -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, I love getting out of my car and going in the McD's and socializing.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, now you can just -</p><p>SMITH: What are you -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Now you can just pull into the McD's parking lot and your Big Mac will come to you.</p><p>SMITH: Cheryl, good stuff. Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: All right, after years of decline, U.S. imports of foreign oil are on the rise in the U.S. What does this mean for dropping gasoline prices here at home? We'll head to the CME for an answer, next.</p><p>SMITH: A top headline in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning. After years of decline, U.S. imports are on the rise. This as low oil prices force domestic producers to scale back supply.</p><p>Phil Flynn is at the CME Group in Chicago.</p><p>Will this push our crude oil prices higher, Phil?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CME GROUP: Well, right now they're pushing them lower. You know, it's put a lot of pressure on the market. You know, we're seeing these imports rise at a time when usually we see imports start to fall a little bit towards the end of the year. This is adding to the oil glut in the Gulf of Mexico where all that oil is. And it's also a sign that the U.S. oil producers are really losing the production war with the OPEC producers. Their production continues to stay strong, ours continue to fall. So this isn't really good news for the U.S. energy producer.</p><p>SMITH: All right. So, hey, by the way, we're looking at $43 for a barrel of crude.</p><p>FLYNN: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: What's the - what's consensus right now? What's - I mean the trend, obviously, as we look at a one week chart, has been down, Phil. But what are we looking at as far as price movement.</p><p>FLYNN: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: I know you watch the trend, the overall trend.</p><p>FLYNN: Right. Well, the mood is definitely negative, you know, and it's across the entire commodity complex. There's a lot of concern in the heart (ph) (INAUDIBLE) season. We're going to see that glut continue to build. You know, last week, you know, refinery runs were continuing to be below 90 percent as refiners are in maintenance (ph). So the demand for oil just isn't very strong. Now the good news is for gasoline prices, they have fallen 17 days in a row according to AAA.</p><p>SMITH: Wow.</p><p>FLYNN: The national average at $2.20. So if you want the bright side of the story, if you're not an oil producer, if you're a driver, you've got to love these prices.</p><p>SMITH: Well, Dagan, that would normally be the bright side of the story because that would mean that we could see a jump in consumer spending. That's extra cash in the pocket of the American consumer. But that hasn't happened yet, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It has happened somewhat. You wouldn't have record - a record holiday season at Amazon if it wasn't at least I think on the margins helping. And throughout the entire summer, you saw increases in small but nevertheless increases in consumer spending.</p><p>SMITH: To the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I mean I don't -</p><p>HILSENRATH: And a boom - and a boom in car sales.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I - helped by extremely low interest rates for sure.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But there's a major auto boom going on and that - a lot of that has to do with the - the low energy prices.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But these - you know, these falling gasoline prices are happening at a great time because it's - it's happening going into the holiday shopping season.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So maybe we're going to see it this year.</p><p>SMITH: FedEx just reported yesterday, they expect record shipments. So at the same time they're expecting record shipments, up 12 percent they're saying year over year for this holiday season, they're also paying a heck of a lot more for the gasoline to get those boxes to the door.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is Phil still standing there? I have a question for him.</p><p>SMITH: He is. Phil.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey, Phil.</p><p>FLYNN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In terms of the production - any production pullback here in the United States with the frackers, is that destroyed forever or can they ramp production up assuming that these companies are healthy financially?</p><p>FLYNN: I think that - I think your final statement is the most important thing, how financially viable are these companies? In a perfect world, yes, they could turn the - turn it on very quickly. The problem is, where are they going to get the capital? A lot of these small - smaller fracking firms just don't have the capital to produce, so they're under a lot of pressure.</p><p>You know, the first time prices went up, we saw rig counts come back up. That's not going to happen again because the capital isn't going to be there.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But, Phil, I thought the private equity guys are standing on the sidelines ready to jump in because prices are so low and feed capital into the industry if it looks like there's a demand pickup.</p><p>FLYNN: Well, I think there was definitely money on the sidelines it's going to (INAUDIBLE) on the street. That doesn't mean it's going to, you know, save the entire industry. But there was another story that was really interest as well, is that China, one of the big real estate people in China, is buying up all the Texas oil fields.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Phil Flynn, always love having you. Thank you.</p><p>FLYNN: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Coming up, two D.C. outsider saying exactly what's on their minds despite the repercussions. Is the same brash style that's suddenly hurting Trump helping Carson? Have you seen the new national poll? That's next.</p><p>SMITH: Good morning. I'm Sandra Smith. Maria Bartiromo is off this morning. It is Tuesday, October 27th. And with me this hour, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell and \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>Here are your top stories at 6:30 a.m., sorry, 7:30 a.m. Wow, time is flying when you're having fun</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>falling to second place now in a new national poll. It's the first time that we've seen him in this position. The latest CBS News/\"New York Times\" poll showing <person><nameText>Ben Carson </nameText></person>has the lead with 26 percent support. He has a four-point lead now over Trump, who has 22 percent. The rest of the field lagging far behind in the single digits. This after Trump's latest controversial comments on women, makeup and burqas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: In fact, it's easier. You don't have to put up makeup. Look how beautiful everyone looks. Wouldn't it be easier - wha - right, Wouldn't that be easy? I'll tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want to - wha, I'm ready, darling, let's go. It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: All right, breaking overnight: a debt deal -- we will get go that in a second. A debt deal on Capitol Hill. Congressional leaders and the White House reaching an agreement on a two year budget deal that also extends the debt limit. This marks one of the final acts for House Speaker, John Boehner, who is set to leave office on Friday.</p><p>And a quick look at those markets this morning; not a lot of movement, as my father always used to say, sharply unchanged. It's been a busy day for earnings and we've got economic data on tap later this morning. Futures right now are edging lower.

He has a 4- point lead over Trump. Joining me now is Nkama --</p><p>DAVID MALPASS, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, ENCIMA GLOBAL: Encima.</p><p>SMITH: I'm sorry; I'm out of it this morning. I think its 6:30 in the morning too, by the way, former Deputy Assistant Secretary, David Malpass, by the way. David, great to have you here. I want to get to breaking news right away. What do you make of <person><nameText>Dr. Ben Carson </nameText></person>taking over Trump in the polls?</p><p>MALPASS: Yeah, hi Sandra, good morning; and Dagen. Look, it's huge because you know, momentum builds, fund-raising builds. Trump is having the problem of having his foot in his mouth quite often; so people are having to evaluate, would you rather have a president with humanity or a president that doesn't have humanity?</p><p>SMITH: It is interesting you point that out because this is -- I want go through this here, because he's Dr. Carson, four point lead over <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>This poll just out, single digests for Marco Rubio, <person><nameText>Jeb Bush, </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Carly Fiorina, </nameText></person>still in the top five there, but Carson and Trump seem to be pulling away the field, that the margins are still pretty big there, Carson/Trump, over the rest of the other candidates.</p><p>MALPASS: Right, but these are national polls. The primary is state-by- state, and so, I don't think they mean a whole lot now, other than this concept of momentum. It causes people to take a look at the -- at the new guys. So each of the lower ranked ones want to be in the public eye, let people look at them.</p><p>SMITH: You mentioned the primary state-by-state, well, I'll point out Trump holds second place in Iowa. <person><nameText>Dr. Ben Carson </nameText></person>has now won three of the last four major polls in the state of Iowa, this coming on the heels of these controversial comments that we aired going into this clip. You were there for reaction of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and his comments about women and burqas, saying they are easier the wear aren't they.</p><p>MALPASS: He really has to stop talking about women and their looks. Also, you know, in Iowa he has been talking about corn, and that is a really dangerous topic. So this is -- I think, you know, candidates need to stay on their message and he is not doing it. Jeb's message, you know, is four- percent growth --</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think his message is, look at me. I am <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>--</p><p>MALPASS: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- and what I wondered is, what is this guy going to say when he starts feeling threatened? When he starts looking like a loser and falls to second, third and fourth place?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: We've heard that.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think he's going to say even more outrageous things.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We've already you heard when he feels threatened -</p><p>SMITH: He'll pull out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- because he referred to the media as horrible scum because people have been reporting on polls where he isn't leading. So that is how - I mean, it's easy to make fun of the media and less easy with women. But I think he is actually being hurt by the epic amount of media coverage, when it earlier it was helping him greatly.</p><p>MALPASS: Right; I think Jon has got it. He just wants people to look at him. So here we are talking about him rather than, and the nation has this giant debt problem, spending problem --</p><p>SMITH: And you talk about the money angle of this, in one of most recent tweets, in the past last 24 hours <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>tweeted out, \"All presidential candidates should immediately disavow their superpacs. They are not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself.\"</p><p>MALPASS: Well that works for him because he made a lot of money. You know, he was lucky when he was born, with a father that made him a big loan, and then he's made a lot of luck. So he's got the money to do it; the others probably don't.</p><p>SMITH: So how come -</p><p>HILSENRATH: We also had a -- we had a story in the paper the other day saying that he's done his own share of fund-raising. So, he's not pure on that front either.</p><p>SMITH: And we've got this debate coming up tomorrow night that will be focused on the ec -- do you think that's an opportunity for <person><nameText>Carly Fiorina </nameText></person>to get back her mojo?</p><p>MALPASS: Sure, and she comes across well on the national stage, as we saw in the last debate. So they all have a chance, now, to stand up to Trump, give their message, and see what he's got. Now, one issue is, he's, on certain issues, been pretty good. I've been happy to see him saying that the Fed should not be zero percent interest rate. You know, it is a good one because it is a rich guy saying, look, it benefits me. I'm, rich. The Fed has the rates set for my benefit. They should stop. So that's a pretty good line for him.</p><p>SMITH: And, real quick, your reaction to the White House and congressional leaders reaching this tentative budget deal?</p><p>MALPASS: Yes, I wanted them to use debt limit, and I've wanted this for some years, to actually restrain spending. The concern here is that their basically having a blowout. Each -</p><p>HILSENRATH: They're breaking the budget cap.</p><p>MALPASS: They're breaking the caps. Each part of congress gets the spending that they want and they all agree to add it to the national --</p><p>MCDOWELL: They all like to spend, don't they -</p><p>MALPASS: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- as long as it is in their interests.</p><p>MALPASS: Very -- I think there is only one-way forward for them to see debt limit works to make more debt. So they really need to rewrite it. They keep avoiding that. You know, the Debt Limit was written in World War I, when the government wanted much more debt that is the purpose of the Debt Limit.</p><p>HILSENRATH: The message today is, see you after the election. No one wants to deal but it before election.</p><p>SMITH: David Malpass, really great getting your perspective this morning.</p><p>MALPASS: Good to see you, Sandra.</p><p>SMITH: Thanks for being here, bright and early.</p><p>MALPASS: Thanks.</p><p>SMITH: Well, a quick reminder, Fox Business will be teaming up with \"The Wall Street Journal\" to give you a Republican Debate focused on your money, the economy, business.

While HBO and other streaming video providers might not encourage password sharing, they also don't track it. The survey says most users don't care if they are responsible for profit loss for a corporation. Sandra back to you.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Cheryl; thank you. Do you share any of your passwords?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. Never. No, don't ask me for my password.</p><p>SMITH: Look, honestly, it doesn't make me feel bad for the company because you haven't figured out your business model if this is possible; right? You have to allow for that margin of -</p><p>HILSENRATH: I mean, we were arguing about this before. I think people share their stuff. We share our newspapers. You know, back in the day, we would share our cassettes -</p><p>SMITH: Where are you going -</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- with some song that we took off the radio. So people share stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But there's a - the issue with this - there was an article that I was reading this morning about when couples break up that you have your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend or even spouse, who is still Jonesing off of your -- Bogarding your password.</p><p>SMITH: Moving on.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So change your password.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I agree with that, but this sounds like an issue that will come up in the court of \"Judge Judy\" and she will scold everybody and say, unless you are married, don't share your password.</p><p>SMITH: There you have it, never get divorced, Dagen, also gave that advice yesterday, as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, never get mar -- no you can -- it is not don't get divorced, it's just never get married. If you think there's a shot --</p><p>SMITH: Okay. The bulls are out this morning. Deal making is making a comeback on Wall Street. A record number of executives say they are planning some kind of M&amp;A in the next 12 months, that's according to a new report from EY. Let's bring in Rich Jeanneret of EY Transaction Services. Rich, good morning to you.</p><p>RICH JEANNERET, AMERICAS VICE CHAIR, EY TRANSACTION SERVICES: Good morning.</p><p>SMITH: All right, so -</p><p>GENERATE: Great to be back.</p><p>SMITH: -- what do we need to do about the deal-making coming back because that's generally associated with a bullish market; is it?</p><p>JEANNERET: they -- the deal market has been back and the story has been the big deal but what is exciting about our 13th annual, -- our 13th Semiannual Capital Conference Barometer is the exuberance around deal- making as high as its been in the last couple years. More than 75-percent saying they want to do details. Companies with more than $5 billion of market cap. That rate of response for deal making the next year was up over 90-percent. Pipelines are strong, and I think the slow growth environment is sending a signal to the c-suite (ps) keep growing. We are going to reward inorganic growth. Watch how stocks trade up after deals are announced.</p><p>SMITH: All right, so what about sectors are you seeing most deals in right now?</p><p>JEANNERET: Well, you know, there has been a lot of great news in technology, consumer products. There is business model disruption occurring throughout corporate America. The changes in customer preference is driving the consumer products industry and you are seeing blurring occurring between sectors. More than 90-percent of companies who said they were going to do deals in the next-year plan to do deals outside their sector. I think it's a reflection of that a blurring occurring in a rapid way. As business models transform, people acquire technology and intellectual capital in places other than their own.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Rich, to what extent is this being driven by low interest rates? To what extent is this just another artificial impact that the Fed is having on markets, by allowing companies to just take out a lot of debt to go out and buy another company?</p><p>JEANNERET: Jon, I think low rate environment clearly is an element, but I don't think it is a major element here. I don't think the Fed move is going to disrupt this M&amp;A market, should they decide to move soon. I think this is driven by the desire to create top-line growth, to continue business model transformation. Record amounts of capital and liquidity available, most of it is corporate cash sitting on the balance sheet that is being unused. So I don't think there is a lot of debt being taken on to do these deals. If you look at debt to capitalization ratios, they're the lowest they have been in almost a decade. So this is strategic. I think companies are transacting for strategic growth, business model transformation and to create shareholder value.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Are these smart deals, if they're doing them in sectors that they have no experience in?</p><p>JEANNERET: Well I think people are being proactive about business model transformation. You're seeing business models disrupted overnight. I think companies are being smart about acquiring technologies, intellectual capital, workforce in places that are relative of the evolving technological transformation, business model transformation that's occurring around the world today.</p><p>SMITH: Rich, this is a really interesting stat: 86-percent see cyber- attacks as a high level threat to the deal making process. That is probably the highest that it has ever been, in history, I would take?</p><p>JEANNERET: It is. I think people are concerned about two things, one, could their actual deal process be hacked and competitive information about their deal making, you know, be exposed to others; and then, two, just looking at the cyber-risk within a deal, if you're buying a business today, you've got to look what risk that business has with respect to it's IT and cyber-exposure.</p><p>SMITH: All right, great stuff. Rich Jeanneret, thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>JEANNERET: Thanks.</p><p>SMITH: Coming up, a brand-new report making the case that eating bacon and hotdogs could be just as bad for you are as smoking cigarettes? We are going to show you why, next.</p><p>SMITH: Ham, bacon, sausage can cause cancer, that's according to the World Health Organization. Experts say sufficient evidence that eating processed meats is \"Carcinogenic to humans.\" Joining us now is Dr. Devi. Maybe you could bring calm to this situation.</p><p>DR. DEVI NAMPIAPARAMPIL, NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Sure.</p><p>SMITH: Should we just stop eating bacon and hotdogs altogether?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: I don't think we need to stop eating those things. I mean, I, myself, don't even want to give up eating bacon; but we do have to worry about eating it every single day. So in this report they were looking at people who were having a lot of red meat and processed meats on a daily basis. So what they are talking about is about two slices of bacon per day. Then there are a couple things to think about.</p><p>SMITH: Hold on. First off, I always call pork white meat. I don't call it red meat.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: That's true, I know. I do too, but it's sort of in that gray area, right, where it kind of has some overlap. It depends on the cuts, and probably for the purposes of this study, the processing, you know, itself.</p><p>SMITH: Okay.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Dr. Devi, what is the problem here? Is it the red meat or the processing? I get concerned about any kind of processed food these days. Is that where the potential problem is?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well this study looked at both things, right. So for red meat they didn't have as much evidence as they did for processing. So seems like if you had to pick between two, the processing might be what you have to be more concerned about. But there are a couple other things to think about in the study; right. So generally, I mean, this is a synthesis of a bunch of different studies. So what we do, let's say there is a pharmaceutical trial, we usually take people who have never had the drug in the first place and then split it up into two groups. One group gets the drug and then you compare to it see what the results are. But in this case you're not really comparing people; you are not giving one group of people hot dogs or red meats every day and then checking to see what happens. You are just letting people kind of follow their usual patterns, which people who eat hot dogs every day might be very different than a vegetarian.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the World Health Organization put processed meat bacon, hot dogs, into the same risk category as smoking and diesel engine exhaust. That is how they view people who -</p><p>HILSENRATH: They put it a little bit lower. They put it right next to herbicide, I think.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well there is some confusion because of the wording, right. So they put it in \"Sufficient Evidence\", but it doesn't mean that your actually risk factors are as high. So what they said is that based on reviewing all these studies that your risk of developing, let's say colon cancer, goes up by 18-percent. Now that is confusing because it's not going -- it is not going up by that absolute percentage. So if your risk of having colon cancer is about 5-percent to begin with, and it goes up by 18-percent, it is still a little bit less than 6-percent --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have a really -</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: -- which is still very low.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- basic question.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Other than potentially making you overweight and obese, if you eat too much bacon or hotdogs or whatever, what is it about eating these foods causes the cancer?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well, we don't know. So that is part of the problem, that we don't know what is involved. I mean, they took a lot of different processing and put it together. These were 800 papers, approximately, that they (inaudible) together -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: -- and sometimes that can be, you know, kind of like comparing apples and oranges. So I think the general, take home message is, of course, if you are eating red meat or processed foods, try to limit it. Try to live a healthy lifestyle; right? I don't think this is so shocking.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Didn't we already know that hotdogs and bacon were bad for you? I feel like I grew up hearing that.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: There's a little bit of that.</p><p>SMITH: I mean, no, I didn't grow up hearing that. I mean, bacon, what's wrong with it?</p><p>HILSENRATH: You mean you could eat all the hot dogs you wanted?</p><p>SMITH: No, but I think that's harsh and especially to the agriculture industry, to say that they are bad for you when Dr. Devi will be first to point out that everything in moderation. Meat suppliers, by the way, processors, they have spoken out about this. They're arguing meat is essential for protein and vitamins.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well, that's true. It depends also on your cut of meat. So if you are talking about a filet mignon that is going to be a little bit different because that's very lean beef, for example. People also use that for --</p><p>HILSENRATH: So the industry also called into question the findings here. Is there anything that raises questions for you about how the studies were done?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well, like we were talking about, right, so the fact that it's observational, so you're not really separating the people into these different groups and testing them. Then, also, putting together so many studies is difficult. So I think that is another factor that we have to consider. But, like you said, you know, I think this is still something people should be a little bit concerned about, in the sense that, eating processed foods every day could add to your risk; but also, you know, to be fair, just back, I mean, about 100 years ago people won the Nobel prize for processing food.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Dr. Devi, thank you for clearing it up and bringing some calm to the situation.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Especially during breakfast. All right, next hour, \"Duck Dynasty\" star Willie Robertson; author and columnist, Monica Crowley; and Charles Schwab's Liz Ann Sonders. They're all here, this all-star cast. We're back in a moment.</p><p>SMITH: Good morning, everyone; I'm Sandra Smith, in for Maria Bartiromo this morning. It's is Tuesday, October 27th.

Story of the can-do American spirit in  action is ahead. </p><p> Plus, were anti-Trump forces inside GOP leadership responsible for the  dirty dossier being spread throughout the media? An investigation with  Peter Schweizer is ahead. </p><p> And as 2018 comes to a close, we'll bring you the highlights of the worse  media offenses of the year. Governor Mike Huckabee, Howie Kurtz break down  the videotape. And also tonight, the Christmas police are back. We just  have an excuse to use our Christmas police little video thing, which I  really love. But how the U.S. Postal Service canceled one family stamp over  a claim that the stamp was too religious at Christmas. Why don't you see  this? You will not believe it. </p><p> But we begin tonight with this. Donald Trump making a stand for his wall.  It's what voters wanted, but leadership stood in his way. Trump is now  forcing the hand of Democrats, threatening a shutdown.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've made my position very  clear. Any measure that funds the government must include border security.  Has to. It is the solemn promise to protect and defend the United States of  America, and it is our sacred obligation. We have no choice.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM: Joining me now are two Republicans engaged in this fight. House  Majority Whip Steve Scalise, he's in charge of wrangling these votes, and  Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. Plus Fox's Chief Political  Correspondent Ed Henry joins us too. He's been following all the  developments. </p><p> Congressman Scalise, let's start with you. You have the votes, but the  Senate looks shaky, to say the least. Are we headed for a shutdown  tomorrow? </p><p> STEVE SCALISE, HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: First of all, Laura, I think it was a  really important day today. When Nancy Pelosi last week was in the Oval  Office with the President, Chuck Schumer, and she said, \"Mr. President, you  don't have the votes of the House to fund the wall.\" </p><p> And today we've put up a massive vote with a large margin of Republicans  that said we're going to stand with this President, we're going to fund the  wall. And we just gave him serious leverage in whatever negotiations he's  going to have with the Senate. They have to confront this issue knowing we  have the President's back in the House.</p><p> INGRAHAM: Sean, a lot of my listeners on radio today and then tonight,  they're watching, and they're thinking, how are we always in this position?  It's the end of the year, no one is rushing to get out of town. Like, no  traffic in D.C. Everyone has already gone. </p><p> SEAN DUFFY, REPUBLICAN, WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN: Yep. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Except you guys are there. We're here. But everyone has already  gone. And their mind they're gone. And Paul Ryan said, we're going to fight  - we're going to have a fight, we're going to have a conversation about the  border wall. Two years in the House Majority, two years at Senate Majority,  we wait until the end of December to deal with an issue that the American  people want dealt with.</p><p> DUFFY: Yes. I mean - first of all, I think we're set up to lose here. We  were not set up to win. We should have had this budget fight last week on  Friday. We could have--</p><p> INGRAHAM: How about last spring? </p><p> DUFFY: No, but - but still as we come to the end of the year, we could have  done it last week, or better yet, we could have even done it this Tuesday  where we would have passed a bill that funded the border wall before the  Senate acted. But we were going to act it today, Thursday, the 20th of  December, right before the end of the year, two weeks before Nancy Pelosi  takes over and think that we have leverage. This is idiotic. </p><p> What we should have done, Laura, is we just passed a bill on criminal  justice reform. Why did we negotiate criminal justice reform, which  Democrats want, which will get no credit for? Why don't we negotiate in  exchange for criminal justice reform, give us $5 billion in border  security? No one negotiated that deal. So we have--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> INGRAHAM: Why--</p><p> DUFFY: --we're probably going to lose. </p><p> INGRAHAM: I mean, until you raise that tonight, we were talking earlier,  I've not even thought about that. I mean, the President did not run on  criminal justice reform.</p><p> DUFFY: No. </p><p> INGRAHAM: I'm personally glad it passed. I'm going to be really anxious to  see how it works out. </p><p> DUFFY: I'm not. </p><p> INGRAHAM: You're not. That's fine. But he isn't getting credit for. </p><p> DUFFY: No. </p><p> INGRAHAM: He won't get credit for it. But if you want to use it, use it in  a way that advances the Trump agenda. Ed Henry - hold on. Ed Henry has  information now for us about where things stand in the Senate. Ed, I've tweeted earlier. Everyone's going to follow my tweets all  throughout the next 48 hours. I said earlier that Mitch McConnell should  fight for this wall as hard as he fought for Cavanaugh. And actually, it's  probably more important in the long-term survival of the country.</p><p> ED HENRY, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, remember, he only  needs 51 votes. I've been talking to Senate Republicans in private. What  they are saying is they're hopeful they can get to 51 votes to pass what  the House Republican leaders there are talking about, Congressman Scalise  and Congressman Duffy as well. But the challenge I'm being told is that you  have Republicans like Bob Corker. You mentioned there's not a lot of  traffic. Some of them have gone home already. Bob Corker told Fox tonight--</p><p> INGRAHAM: Disgraceful. </p><p> HENRY: --he's retiring from Tennessee. He's already driving home to  Tennessee. That's his planning anyway. </p><p> INGRAHAM: A disgrace. </p><p> HENRY: Because--</p><p> INGRAHAM: It's a disgrace. </p><p> HENRY: --they're not planning to stick around. Now, will they be pulled  back because of the wall funding? We'll see. But I've talked to sources  inside the White House, by the way, who tell me, think about it, put  yourself in the shoes of President Trump. He was told that we're going to  repeal and replace Obamacare. He was told we're going to have wall funding.  He was told that we'd eventually get out of Afghanistan and Syria once we  defeated ISIS. </p><p> And you go down the list, and a lot of these priorities that he didn't just  campaign on in promise, but he actually won on in 2016, he hasn't been able  to follow up on. Look at the tariffs. Established Republicans, time and  time again, people inside the White House remind me, told the President  \"don't do it.\" And Congressman Duffy will be the first to tell you that bud  (ph) for President Trump standing up against Canada, the dairy farmers in  Congressman Duffy's district--</p><p> DUFFY: Right. </p><p> HENRY: --wouldn't have been helped there in Wisconsin.</p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. So time and again, the President's instincts on these  issues, edges took us through a couple of them. We're spot on. He was  pulled back from his instincts by the experts. I think some of them were  foreign policy experts that are now thankfully gone or treasury experts.  His instincts on this are right. And I want to play something for  everybody. You've got to watch Chuck Schumer. They're playing a big game  there on Capitol Hill today. This is what he said about the shutdown.  Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: President Trump is plunging the  country into chaos. And he said in front of us he'd be proud to shut down  the government. It is nothing to be proud of. The bottom line is simple.  The Trump  will shut down the government, but it will not get him his  wall. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM: Congressman Scalise, temper tantrum. I don't think so. I mean, he  campaigned on (inaudible) on this. He deserves the Republicans to get  behind him and also put the Democrats back on their heels. OK. You stay for  border security, $5 billion? </p><p> SCALISE: Yes. </p><p> INGRAHAM: That - really that's what we're arguing about, $5 billion? </p><p> SCALISE: Laura, this looks like another Schumer shutdown. And think about  this. A few years ago, Chuck Schumer voted for a border wall. He's going to  have a hard time reconciling that. If you listen to what he's saying, he is  making it personal. He doesn't want Donald Trump to get money for the wall  because he doesn't want Donald Trump to get to win. </p><p> The American people see Donald Trump fighting for them to secure the  border. It's about border security. It's been about this throughout his  campaign. He won on this issue as one of the front and center issues. And  so now he's actually doing it. </p><p> If Chuck Schumer wants to sit there and say we're going to have a shut  down, try to blame somebody else for it. The American people know this is  about border security. You're for it or you're against it. We have people  in the caravan who are known criminals, they're attacking our border patrol  agents at the border. Let's actually stand up for them. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. He says that we're worried about chaos. Oh, it's - spend  real-time. Not just the photo ops they do when they go up to the border  patrol people and try to usher in migrants - real chaos. The Tijuana  government knows what chaos is, Mexico has seen the chaos. The cartels are  being enriched by others. Chuck Schumer chaos, that line is so tired and  old. I want you to chime in here though because Nancy Pelosi said this  earlier today and I got you to respond. Last week--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: There are no votes in the House, the  majority of votes, for a wall, no matter where you start. </p><p> UNKNOWN: That's exactly right. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM: You proved her wrong?</p><p> DUFFY: I think it is when I checked the vote list. We just passed $5  billion--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. You proved her wrong. Could Schumer be wrong?</p><p> DUFFY: Steve Scalise did a great job counting the votes. </p><p> INGRAHAM: You whipped it. Yes. Could Schumer be wrong as well? </p><p> DUFFY: He could be wrong. But - Nancy Pelosi is more concerned about her  votes to become the Speaker as opposed to the votes to do what's right for  America and secure the border. But think of this, Laura. We have agreement  on all the funding but for the $5 billion for the wall. That's the only  thing that's holding up funding the government versus shutting the  government down.</p><p> But I look at Chuck Schumer out there talking to the American people and  Nancy talking to the American people today. Donald Trump has to do an Oval  Office address. He has to frame--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> INGRAHAM: I've said this for a year. </p><p> DUFFY: --and he has to talk about - we have to talk about the families that  have lost loved ones to the drug abuse that comes--</p><p> INGRAHAM: One year. </p><p> DUFFY: --off of southern border, meth and - in my community, we've - all  our counties don't have money because they're spending so much money for  out-of-home placement for kids who've lost their parents because of drug  abuse, or the parents who've lost a loved one at the hands of an illegal  immigrant. Frame the issue of America. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p> DUFFY: Take away the photos of the kids at the border with the (inaudible). </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> INGRAHAM: Personalize it. We don't - they personalize it. They say the  death of a seven-year-old girl is on your shoulders--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DUFFY: On average, every single day, we stop 10 known or suspected  terrorists from coming into America. Last year alone, our ICE agents, who  are in the middle of this too, saved over 900 kids from human trafficking.  Those are real kids who are safe today because of what we're doing to  secure our border. Who knows how many got in that we didn't catch. So,  thank, God, we have President Trump fighting to secure the border. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes, he has to give an--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DUFFY: That's what this fight is going to be about. Him having an address  (ph) would be great. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Sean is absolutely right. I've begged him to do this for a year,  on air. I'd say this is the most important issue for the American people  today. It's the government and immigration. Those two issues are the top of  the list for the people. The government, meaning, working against the  people and immigration. That's it. Got to address the country on this. </p><p> DUFFY: And this is the--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> INGRAHAM: Not tweets. Address the country, lay it out. I'm sorry, I know  I'm going to reign (ph) on this, but it's really important. I want to get  to some other big news of the day, the Mattis resignation, because by the  reaction in the hours following, you would have thought that we just  decided on an imprudent ground invasion into a foreign land. For instance,  here was Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SCHUMER: Everything that indicates stability, everything that indicates  strength, everything that indicates knowledge is leaving this  administration. General Kelly, General Mattis, so many others--</p><p> UNKNOWN: McMaster. </p><p> SCHUMER: McMaster, exactly. There is chaos now in this administration. </p><p> PELOSI] I am shaken by the resignation of General Mattis for what it means  to our country, for the message it sends to our troops, and for the  indication of what his view is of the Commander in Chief.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM: Here's a message that sends to our troops you're coming home. OK.  That's a message that sends to your troops. The days of Bush  interventionism is over. That's where the President ran. And Obama went  through four secretaries of defense. I do not remember the freak-out. And I  thought Pelosi and company were for pulling troops back--</p><p> HENRY: Right. </p><p> INGRAHAM: --once we actually have victory. Now they're the  interventionists. I'm really confused--</p><p> HENRY: Right. </p><p> INGRAHAM: --about where they are. </p><p> HENRY: When the President is for something they've been for a long time--</p><p> INGRAHAM: It's unbelievable. </p><p> HENRY: --they don't want to admit it, on trade and other issues as well. I  think you made a really important point a moment ago about Senator Schumer  as well, in pushing the chaos narrative. It's sort of like every time  there's development in the Mueller investigation, we here \"The walls are  closing in, this is it.\"</p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p> HENRY: And then it's sort of fizzles out. Here's the bottom line though. I  don't think you can sugarcoat the fact that Mattis leaving is a big  development because his letter was pretty blistering in terms of his  differences with the President on Syria, for example. </p><p> Here's my bigger point. Watch what Lindsey Graham is saying tonight. He has  been an ally to the President, as you know, in recent days on a whole range  of issues, and he's warning, don't make the same mistake that Barack Obama  made in terms of pulling out of Iraq that you could have a terrorist safe- haven in Afghanistan. But I also hear your point, Laura, which is - it gets  back to what he said at the top. The President campaigned directly in 2016,  not just on repeal and replace, in trade--</p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p> HENRY: --and the tariffs. But he also said, we're not the world's  policeman. He was honest about that in terms of Syria and Afghanistan,  which is now by the way the longest war ever. It just - right.</p><p> INGRAHAM: 17 years. We still have men and women--</p><p> HENRY: And so he campaigned in one on that. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Guys, everyone has to re-frame (ph). OK? It's because we're  watching Schumer with his glasses down on the end of his nose, where  something (ph) is really serious about this. OK? But remember what Donald  Trump campaigned on. Let's watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP: We're getting out of the nation-building business. Our moments of  greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge. </p><p> We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. </p><p> I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions  of dollars. We cannot be the policeman of the world.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM: He won in part on a non-interventionist platform. Obama beat Bush  on a non-interventionist platform. It had been like Adam Kinzinger run  around town acting like - it's like 2003 all over again. </p><p> Steve Scalise, Mattis has a different point of view than the President on  this? Well, that's why Donald Trump is elected President. If Mattis wants  to run for President, go run for President. I found that letter to be  surprising coming from him--</p><p> SCALISE: Ultimately--</p><p> INGRAHAM: --and a little dismissive. I didn't like it. </p><p> SCALISE: Ultimately, you only have one Commander in Chief. And look, the  President and Secretary of State Tillerson had some differences on foreign  policy, and so Rex Tillerson left. Mike Pompeo came in. and he's doing a  great job representing our country and the President. He'll find somebody  else to serve in this role. It's an important role. Secretary Mattis did a  great job of helping (inaudible) ISIS, and they're not going all the way--</p><p> INGRAHAM: They want to stay. </p><p> SCALISE: --but he did a great job--</p><p> INGRAHAM: They don't want to leave. </p><p> SCALISE: But he's--</p><p> INGRAHAM: But when we go, they don't want--</p><p> SCALISE: He's going to be able to find another general who's going to be  able to--</p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p> SCALISE: --serve this country well as his defense secretary. </p><p> INGRAHAM: The line is always, if we leave, chaos will ensue, which means we  can never leave, because we're in these countries that are by their very  constitution very chaotic.</p><p> DUFFY: There is a life footprint there. 2,000 troops not engaged in battle  but give you more advice to the--</p><p> INGRAHAM: Why we're there? What is it a national security interest--?</p><p> DUFFY: Because I think if we leave, I think - or you can--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> INGRAHAM: OK. So we're going to be there for everywhere. And let's take a  poll--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DUFFY: But what--</p><p> INGRAHAM: --American people right now. </p><p> DUFFY: But what happens with Russia? What happens with Iran? I mean--</p><p> INGRAHAM: What happened to Russia? Economy is smaller than France's. Right.  What are - what are we worried about Russia for? </p><p> DUFFY: Did you see the territory to them? Do you see the territory to Iran  who wants to kill the big Satan America or the little Satan Israel? I think  that's a mistake. </p><p> INGRAHAM: How much money did China spend in Iraq and Afghanistan? </p><p> DUFFY: Yes. I don't know. </p><p> INGRAHAM: None. </p><p> DUFFY: Probably none. Right. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. And we're $20 trillion on that. </p><p> DUFFY: But are at the point that the President is the Commander in Chief.  He gets to call the ball and he has - he deserves a staff around and that  supports him. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p> DUFFY: So--</p><p> INGRAHAM: It seemed unnecessarily petty of an American hero, Mattis. And I  thought that was surprising.</p><p> DUFFY: But you know what? I think that we have the right to disagree. And  in our party-- </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p> DUFFY: --we don't all fall in line. We can have different--</p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p> DUFFY: --opinions and we can debate it and we can agree (inaudible)  President--</p><p> INGRAHAM: We'll see if Bush-ism works in 2020.</p><p> SCALISE: Yes, we'll see.</p><p> INGRAHAM: We're going to see if we can go back to Bush-ism, and that's  going to sell the American people--</p><p> DUFFY: No, no, we don't want to go to--</p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. We're going to see if that--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SCALISE: President Trump is rebuilding our military, and that's something  he campaigned on. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. He's not squandering-</p><p> SCALISE: He's--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> INGRAHAM: --the military either. </p><p> SCALISE: --on that promise as well. </p><p> DUFFY: Yes. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes, he's not squandering the military. </p><p> Guys, thank you so much. </p><p> SCALISE: All right. Thank you. </p><p> INGRAHAM: And I want to get to a tragic but important story outside of  Washington. It relates to what we're talking about. And we have to tie this  all together for the American people. A community ravaged by the lack of  action on the part of our government and local government, state  government, who just turned their backs on them. What are we talking about? </p><p>Visalia, California, it sits between LA and San Francisco. And in that  town, over the course of two heroin days earlier this week, Gustavo Garcia,  he's a man twice removed from this country, went on what authorities call a  reign of terror. It's a 24-hour shooting spree, killing at least two and  injuring many more. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNKNOWN (voice-over): Deputies taking gunfire from this man, 36-year-old  Gustavo Garcia. It all went down on Road 140 and Avenue 256 early Monday  morning. You can hear the officer reloading his gun as the bullets ring  out. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM: Now, while the circumstances of this are tragic on their own, the  run-up to it is even more so. Two days before this reign of terror, he was  arrested by the Tulare County Sheriff's deputies for being under the  influence of a controlled substance. He was held in the county jail for  about 10 hours before being released even though ICE officials had issued  an immigration-hold on him. You see this arrest wasn't Garcia's first rush  of the law. He has a violent criminal past.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNKNOWN (voice-over): Immigration and Customs Enforcement tells FOX 26  News, Garcia had been deported twice. In the past, the Sheriff's office  could have alerted immigration because of Garcia's extensive rap sheet,  which includes armed robbery more than 15 years ago.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM: Now, you might be asking yourself, why did the cops let him go  despite the ICE hold, especially given his past? So, was it the police's  fault?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNKNOWN (voice-over): ICE did follow a detainer as soon as it learned of  Garcia's arrest Friday. And this would be enough to keep him in custody in  other states. But Sheriff Boudreaux says his office no longer recognizes  those detainers and it can't reach out to ICE for misdemeanor crimes. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM: So Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said, \"Before SB 54,\"  which is the Sanctuary State Bill, \"Gustavo Garcia would have been turned  over to ICE officials. That's how we've always done it. After SB 54,  though, we no longer have the power to do that.\"</p><p> We should know the Tulare County Board of Supervisors voted to adopt a  resolution opposing California sanctuary state law in May of this year. And  even though it's kind of symbolic, it does show a citizenry standing up for  common sense. </p><p> Joining me now is Tulare County Sheriff, Mike Boudreaux. Sheriff, I know  our viewers across the country are watching this and are shaking their  heads going, how would - how can this happen in the United States of  America? Will we emote morning, noon and night about the tragic  circumstances of people who are trying to come into the country? And I get  it. They're tragic circumstances. It's tough. But yet, the politicians -  did you get a call from Pelosi? Did you get a call from Gavin Newsom? Any  other officials in California concerned about what's happening there?</p><p> MIKE BOUDREAUX, TULARE COUNTY SHERIFF: You know, the only phone call that I  got was from the ACLU demonizing the actions that we took, which is really  unfortunate. Tulare County is how it's pronounced actually, but--</p><p> INGRAHAM: Sorry. </p><p> BOUDREAUX: --in Tulare County, we are - that's fine - we're an agricultural  community. We produce multi-billion dollars worth of agriculture that's  sent all over the world. And we have a large undocumented community. But we  also have a large group of people who don't commit these types of crimes on  a daily basis. </p><p> I think what our focus is on is the criminal. The criminal element that  ends up in my jail that I no longer have the tools to reach out to ICE, my  counterpart, my law enforcement partners, and I'm no longer able to  recognize the detainer through the sanctuary state law as well as the Ninth  Court Circuit indicating that the detainers don't meet due process. So,  because of those two combined efforts, we no longer can telephone ICE and  even ask the question why is this detainer placed nor can we recognize the  detainer itself. And I think--</p><p> INGRAHAM: Can you--</p><p> BOUDREAUX: --that I need to--</p><p> INGRAHAM: Wait, wait. Hold on. </p><p> BOUDREAUX: --make myself very clear is that-</p><p> INGRAHAM: Sheriff, Sheriff, Sheriff, hold on, hold on. Can you give a heads  up--</p><p> BOUDREAUX: Yes. </p><p> INGRAHAM: --to ICE? Can you give them a heads up? </p><p> BOUDREAUX: I'm sorry?</p><p> INGRAHAM: Can you give them a heads up? Can you call and say, we're about  to release this individual or we have this individual in custody even if  they can't come and interview him or examine him? Is there any notification  at all you could give to ICE? </p><p> BOUDREAUX: We're not allowed to - we're not allowed to talk to our  counterparts under these laws--</p><p> INGRAHAM: What is the conservative lawsuit against this? </p><p> BOUDREAUX: --especially with--</p><p> INGRAHAM: This is just an outrage. Hold on. I got to play something for  you, Sheriff. This was Nancy Pelosi's claim about what sanctuary policies  actually accomplish. Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PELOSI: Our City of San Francisco is a sanctuary city. And we see it as a  place where it makes us safer. It makes us safer because people can go to  school, they can get driver's license, they can be witnesses against other  violence that they see in the community. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM: Is your community feeling safer tonight?</p><p> BOUDREAUX: They're not feeling safer. But I will say that we don't - we're  not against our undocumented community. We're not against immigrants. We  don't - we're not against Dreamers or DACA. And I think that it needs to be  very clear our community as a whole - even our undocumented community - I  sat with a large group of people, and they're not afraid of their law  enforcement. They're not even afraid-</p><p> INGRAHAM: So that's a lie? </p><p> BOUDREAUX: --of being deported. What they're--</p><p> INGRAHAM: So that's a lie, Sheriff. That argument that I hear parroted to  me morning, noon and night, every time we deal with one of these sanctuary  policy cases. We did this in New Jersey a couple of weeks ago. The advocate  that came on said, \"Oh, no, we're not going to have immigrants cooperating  with authorities. We're not going to show up and testify in cases.\" That's  just bunk. But this is the--</p><p> BOUDREAUX: That is bunk. </p><p> INGRAHAM: --the parroted line. So you don't see that at all in your  community? </p><p> BOUDREAUX: Yes. That's not true. We don't see that. We see our community  reaching out to us. What they're afraid of? What they're afraid of is that  the criminal will return to their community because we can't report them to  ICE.</p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. And commit domestic violence, rape, burglary, robbery, other  offenses against property and people. </p><p> Sheriff, thank you for the heads up and for speaking out on what we are  going to be following all throughout the next year because so many people  won't do it. We're going to do it. </p><p> All right. Coming up, when our leaders fail, Americans begin to take action  into their own hands in a good way. An Air Force veteran and triple amputee  is finding his own way to pay for the border wall. He's going to tell us  about it, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM: Now, this really is a story about America's quintessential can-do  attitude. Whether their leaders fail them, our citizens take matters into  their own hands. I know Brian Kolfage is a triple amputee Air Force vet who  started the GoFundMe page for the wall - \"the wall\" that the politicians  don't want to fund, and he started this just three days ago. In that short  time, he has already raised more than $9.7 million. Now, here to tell us  why he did this, what he hopes to achieve is Brian himself. </p><p> All right, Brian. Now, the critics will say that this is just a publicity  stunt. It's not going to even make a dent in the total cost, which should  be at least around $20 billion. I'm not great at math, but that's a pretty  - that's a pretty tough hill to climb. So what do you say to those critics? </p><p> BRIAN KOLFAGE, VET RAISING MONEY FOR BORDER WALL: I'd say they're full of  crap. And this is the United States and we can do anything we want. And if  people want to donate to that wall and give their money, they can do it. I  mean, what's 80 bucks for 60 million people. The common person can give  that kind of money. </p><p> And this is not just about Republicans and conservatives. There is  outpouring of Democrats that are messaging me and giving to this wall fund.  It's from both sides of the aisle, but you don't hear the liberal media  saying that. This is America coming together. They want the wall, and  they're putting their money where their mouth is and they're funding it. </p><p> INGRAHAM: You've had some run-ins before with Facebook, I know, on blocking  various accounts you've had, even a military beer business you had that  gave 10 percent of your profits to military charities. </p><p> You're a triple amputee Air Force veteran. And yet Facebook has had like  kind of an aggressive attitude towards you. I know you've had counsel  trying to fight them on this. Are you seeing any resistance to your  postings? I've got a lot on my Facebook page. And I've sent them out to my  friends. But are you getting any resistance at all in the social media  community? </p><p> KOLFAGE: Well, I'm - I'm not allowed on Facebook anymore. My company,  military grade coffee company was outright banned. And Facebook executives  told me I'm not allowed to do use it. And they threatened my wife they'd  delete her account if they catch me on Facebook. So I don't use Facebook  anymore. I've gone to Twitter and that's where people can find me. </p><p> And it just - it's ridiculous the way that these companies treat people.  And Americans are just pissed off. They're pissed off in general and  they're mad with the way politics and politicians are handling things and  big tech and - it just - it's a lot of problems that are bubbling up right  now. And it's just a culmination of things. And everyone is - Americans are  just not happy. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Now, why - why the wall? Why is this an issue for you? </p><p> KOLFAGE: Well - I mean, the wall is an important thing for me. I feel it's  near and dear to my heart. And it was a promise that was made to the  Americans. And this is a very important part of our nation, our country. We  need security. We're a nation of laws. We need to enforce these laws. We  can't have people coming across our border who are unchecked that don't  know who they are. </p><p> I mean, we can have another terrorist attack tomorrow. It doesn't take many  people to stage an attack. We need to know who's coming across that border  and we need to keep it in check. And this - like I said, this wall is in  our constitution. We need to have the wall, and the Americans want the  wall. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Wait. What do you mean the wall is in our constitution? Where in  the constitution? </p><p> KOLFAGE: Well, it just - it's part of our nation. It's part of our lives. </p><p> INGRAHAM: I mean, you're talking about--</p><p> KOLFAGE: We are a nation--</p><p> INGRAHAM: --our sovereignty. Our sovereignty. </p><p> KOLFAGE: Yes, sovereignty. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Right. Yes--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KOLFAGE: We're a nation of walls. And--</p><p> INGRAHAM: --the wall itself is not in the constitution--</p><p> KOLFAGE: The Trump wall is not in the constitution. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. But the--</p><p> KOLFAGE: Let's clarify that. </p><p> INGRAHAM: Yes. I get what your point is. He made the promise. </p><p> KOLFAGE: Yes. </p><p> INGRAHAM: And if that wall doesn't get built, it's hard to see - it's hard  to see Trump winning in 2020. I'm just going to - I know people like  hearing that. But if this wall doesn't get built, I think it's going to  demoralize a lot of people. We're going to have more problems. We got to  get the same built. </p><p> But Mikel Jollett - I don't know who this person is, but it's some singer I  guess a lot of people follow - was hitting you pretty hard on Twitter  saying the following. \"Right now in America people are donating money they  don't have to build a wall they don't need to solve a problem that doesn't  exist.\" And I guess the band, airborne toxic effect, basically saying  you're bad at math because it would take till 2086 - yes, you're racist,  bad at math. I mean, there's no real substantive argument against why a  wall may or may not work. But I'm sure you're getting - get a lot of that. </p><p> KOLFAGE: Maybe that's just the liberal tactics in the liberal media.  They're going to come out and attack my family.  And they can go ahead and  do what they want, but we are not stopping.  We are going to keep on  pushing through.  No matter what Congress does, if they pass this through,  we're not stopping.  We're going to keep pushing this through.  We're going  to see what the Senate does.  We're going to see how this plays out.  And  Americans aren't happy and they're going to keep giving to this GoFundMe,  and we're going to keep pushing it.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  It's $9.7 million, it's one of the top GoFundMe efforts in just  three days in the United States for the whole year.  Brian, we're going to  following this.  Thank you for your service to this country.  You suffered  greatly for our freedom and you continue to inspire so many people.  Thank  you so much.  We really appreciate it.  And merry Christmas to your family.  </p><p> Now on to some troubling revelations inside a Florida court.  Documents  filed yesterday show us the publication \"Buzzfeed\" was sued after they  published the bogus dossier on President Trump.  But they won in court.   But that's not actually the interesting part of the story.  Inside the  filing were revelations about certain Republicans that will shock a lot of  you.  </p><p> First, a longtime associate of the late Republican from Arizona Senator  John McCain initially provided a copy of that infamous Steele dossier to  \"Buzzfeed\" in the first place.  And second, a Paul Ryan aide and  Congressman Adam Kinzinger were given an early look at the dossier before  others even became aware of it.  </p><p> Here now is Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability  Institute.  So Peter, why does this not surprise me, that when someone is  trying to shop an anti-Trump document as salacious and as ridiculous as  that was, they went to two big-time neoconservatives who are diametrically  opposed to Trump on things like the wall, speaking of the wall, his  noninterventionist philosophy and his economic nationalism, go down the  line.  McCain and Kinzinger, and I guess Paul Ryan had some access to it as  well.  </p><p> PETER SCHWEIZER, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE:  Yes, you're right,  Laura.  This speaks to something profound about Washington's political  culture.  Think about this for a second.  If McCain's office or Ryan's  office had been given a salacious, unverified dossier about one of their  colleagues, do you think they would have been leaking it around to the  press corps?  I really doubt it.  </p><p> This speaks to the fact that Donald Trump is a disruptor.  There is a deep  cultural clash between him and the Washington establishment.  And it speaks  to the fact that they do not like the fact that he is disrupting the way  things are done in Washington, D.C., the same way that on the political  left Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman-elect Ocasio-Cortez is doing on the  left of the political spectrum.  </p><p> And I think it speaks to the fact that, what Donald Trump represents, it's  those policies you talked about, but it's about changing the dynamics of  how Washington works.  And they do not like it and they want to stop it.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  They want the status quo.  Let's face it, a lot of people make a  lot of money.  Regular folks out there, they see what people make as  lobbyists or consultants, and these are people who haven't won elections in  a decade.  And yet they still make tens of millions of dollars with ad buys  and ad design and placement and consulting contracts.  So they like the  status quo.</p><p> Trump comes in like a wrecking ball and says this whole town stinks to high  heaven, and it makes them really nervous.  They are freaking out about this  Syria withdrawal.  I bet most Americans don't even know we are in Syria,  because they're thinking, wait a second, don't we have problems in  Cincinnati to deal with, but we're in Syria with 2,000 after we've already  decimated ISIS.</p><p> So I think he has held up a mirror to the corruption in Washington, and  they don't like what they are seeing.  So it has got to be Trump is the  problem and Trump is the corrupt one.  </p><p> SCHWEIZER:  Right, exactly.  And consider just something like deregulation.   Everybody thinks it's great because it frees up American businesses, makes  them more competitive.  But it costs a lot of people in Washington, D.C.,  money.  Here's why.  The reason why regulations, whether it's environmental  or financial, are so complicated and complex is they are designed that way,  because you've got an entire industry in Washington, D.C., that is  interpreting rules and laws that nobody else understands.  </p><p> If you come in and say, you know what, we are getting rid of these  thousands of pages of regulations, now suddenly that is a huge revenue  stream for Washington consultants that's gone.  That's just one of the ways  in which the swamp is being changed in Washington, D.C.</p><p> So what I say to people is agree with Trump on certain policies or not,  there is no disputing the fact that he is a disruptor.  We love disruptors  in Silicon Valley, we like them in the entertainment business.  I think  it's good to have them in American politics too, because it's become  calcified.  It's the wealthiest city in the United States today is  Washington D.C.  That's a huge problem.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  It's a problem when there are as many cranes, we always talk  about the measure of the corruption are the number of cranes in any given  neighborhood in Washington D.C.  It is wild.  But yes, they like the status  quo.  Keep the money spending even if we don't have it.  </p><p> Peter Schweizer, have a great holiday, a merry Christmas, and all that  jazz.  We'll see you in the new year.  </p><p> And up next, this is a fun one.  OK, what where the worst media moments of  2018?  Will I make any of those?  I hope not.  Governor Mike Huckabee and  Howie Kurtz take us through the video and the most embarrassing moments  when we get back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right, 2018 is coming to a close, can you believe it?  So we  thought, what better time than to highlight a few of the media lowlights  from the past year.  And our friends at Grabien helped us out here, too.   My old producer Tom Elliott does a great job there.  Here with me now to  take us through the tape, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, host of  \"Media Buzz\" also right here on FOX, Howie Kurtz.  All right, gents, I want  to first start with the media's once warm embrace of a man who is now not  on the top of the invite list.  Let's watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti joins us live  now.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Joining me now is Stormy Daniels' attorney Michael  Avenatti.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Michael Avenatti is with us now.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Michael Avenatti joins us now.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And joining me now from Los Angeles is Michael  Avenatti.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  We want more of the spooning comments that they made toward  Avenatti, Howie.  </p><p> HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST:  He was hard to book.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  He was the belle of the ball, though, until he wasn't.  So  should the media have seen this coming with the meltdown of Avenatti?  </p><p> KURTZ:  The degree to which CNN and MSNBC put this guy on sometimes several  times a day to peddle his unsubstantiated claims and develop his  presidential delusions was really something.  But the worst by far was  putting on Avenatti on to make the claims of Julie Swetnick to vouch for  this woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of beginning a bunch of gang rapes - - </p><p> INGRAHAM:  That's what I want to see.  That's a scene I want to see.</p><p> KURTZ:  Yes, go to that videotape.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  It will tell us more -- in the introductions, we want to see,  it's like, really, tell us more about all this unsubstantiated garbage.   That should go down as one of the biggest blackeyes of this media over the  last 12 months.  Disgusting.  </p><p> And are we going to the next one, now?  All right, Huck wants to describe  this as well.  Governor, I think Michael Avenatti is just one of those  figures who will occasionally pop up like if they have a celebrity  Hollywood Squares maybe, he will be the lower right square or something.   But I don't see of Avenatti playing much of a role in public life in the  future.  </p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  I think his history is up like a  rock, down like a rock, back under the rock from whence he crawled.  That's  the end of the story for Michael Avenatti, I'm pretty sure.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Number two on our list involves some actual dumpster diving as  journalists attempt to find some dirt, literally, tying President Trump to  Russia.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Quickly, you looked through the trash there?  What did  you find?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, we did.  We came here expecting this office to be  empty.  But in fact, all day here, we've been here throughout the course of  the day, people have been going in and out.  We went through the trash to  see what could find because we saw people dumping rubbish there.  New  computers, new computers are being delivered here, and they're throwing  away the rubbish.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Somehow the accent makes it all the more interesting.  </p><p> KURTZ:  Yes, right.  Here we are with the rubbish.  Let's inspect the  rubbish.  Not that big of a deal, but it kind of smells.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Literally and figuratively.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  But governor, again, this just tells you how low they can go.   Going through the garbage now?  I guess you could do that, but, for what?   What'd they get?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  I thought they were doing a tour of their newsroom, because  that's what you typically see with a lot of these networks.  Anything,  anything, and that does show that if you are willing to go through people's  trash hoping to get something negative on conservatives, you're pretty  desperate.  And this is a media that is pretty desperate, there's no doubt  about it.  That was hilarious.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Howie, what's the rating for the media now?  That approval  rating usually hovers around 20 percent or something, whether people  respect them?  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  It may be up to 30.  But basically --  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  It's up to 30 now.  Wow, that's actually pretty good.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  No, Howie.</p><p> KURTZ:  This is not my rating.  I'm tell you how it shows up --</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Gov, what are you -- hey, governor, we have to check this.  Do  that Google search, Raymond.  Is it really 30 percent?  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I've just got to tell you, Howie, the flu is more popular than  the media right now.  </p><p> KURTZ:  While it is on a downward spiral, and some of these examples show  why people don't trust the press.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Let's move on to number three, where some CNN hosts did their  best to test the limits of the FCC.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's the craziest -- I've ever heard.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- hole countries.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- hole countries.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  These countries are -- holes. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I couldn't give a -- about them.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've definitely been -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You -- and slant eyes.  I called you a -- and a -- and  a wetback. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I didn't say the n-word.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You are offended when I saw --  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, that's a lot of --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KURTZ:  Did you wear out the beeper there?  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  I don't even know how you do those edits on that stuff.   Governor, let's start with you.  The swear-fest, I guess it's people are  more authentic, living their truth.  I love that phrase, we're living our  truth.  I didn't like it when our previous guest who was a war hero and a  triple amputee, and I adore him -- I don't like it when people use p-i-s-s- e-d on air.  I know that sounds old-fashioned but, I know we all swear.   Maybe not the governor, but we all swear, but we want to not on TV as much  if we can possibly not.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I don't know if you know this or not, but they quit serving  sandwiches in the CNN cafeteria and now they just sell soap for people to  eat that because they've gotten so potty-mouthed over there.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> HUCKABEE:  So it's a steady diet.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  What are the rules.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Every brand of soap.</p><p> KURTZ:  In one interview, CNN anchor Fareed Zakaria called Trump a b-ser,  using the full word, four different times.  It just goes to show that when  you're talking about Donald Trump, the standards go out the window, there's  a complete double standard.  You can get down and dirty and curse all you  want because somehow that's OK.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  We have an anchors on other networks saying he's a racist.  Just  like he's a racist, he's a liar, he's a racist, he's a liar. </p><p> KURTZ:  He's a blanking racist.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  He's a blanking racist.  But it just -- it shows you, both  governor and Howie, it shows you -- and I hate that Trump derangement  syndrome has become such a cliche, but something is burrowed deep into the  psyche of people that they are not even able to have friendships with  people with whom they disagree, the tolerant set.  And you see this in  media figures.  People who I have been friends with in other media outlets  for years, not all of them -- I used to like Don Lemon.  Don Lemon used to  come on my radio show, we were joking earlier, I used to have people like  Frank Rich on my radio, John Kerry.  We could disagree, but now there's so  -- it's burrowed in anger and resentment and upset.  </p><p> KURTZ:  You can't even fraternize.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  You can't even have a conversation.  You are a horrible, awful  rotten person if you ever said anything nice about Donald Trump, and it's  oozing out of their pores, which is very strange.  </p><p> All right, the last one on our list to someone I just mentioned.  CNN's Don  Lemon describing the biggest terror threat facing our country right now.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  We have to stop demonizing people and realize the  biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them  radicalized to the right.  And we have to start doing something about them.   There is no travel ban on them.  There is no ban on -- they had the Muslim  ban.  There is no white guy ban.  So what do we do about that?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Governor Huckabee, you are one of those aforementioned white  men.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes, what do we do?  What do we do?  I'm guilty as charged.  I  am an American white man.  And I don't know what Don Lemon is going to do.   What is he going to do, deport me?  To where?  I'm an American born  citizen.   What is he going to do, arrest me?  For what?  I think  differently than him.  This is America.  This is really the heighth of it.  </p><p> But I have got to tell you, Laura, it's not just what he says.  It's that  tone where he is attempting so diligently to sound authoritative that I  found beyond amusing.  And these guys who sit and they pontificate night  after night with such a tone of seriousness as if they are personally  saving this great republic -- </p><p> INGRAHAM:  They're pained.  But they're very pained -- I'm pain to have to  say this.  I regret having to say this.  </p><p> Howie, before we go, remember this ad from CNN?  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a whole bunch of bananas.  Somewhere buried  within it is an apple.  Some people might try to tell you that there is no  point in looking for it, but there's only one way to know what has been  covered up.  You start digging.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Move over James Earl Jones.  I like James Earl Jones better,  this is CNN.  This is CNN, don't slip on the banana peel.</p><p> KURTZ:  It's a kind of a fruitcake ad.  But there is a certain self- righteousness that has creeped into a lot of media self-promotion.  \"The  Washington Post,\" democracy dies in the darkness.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Democracy dies in the darkness.  </p><p> KURTZ:  Somehow democracy wasn't in danger when Barack Obama was president. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Thank you, Jeff Bezos.  Small business might die in the face of  amazon.  </p><p> KURTZ:  I'm all for self-promotion, but let's keep it real.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Still to come -- both of you, thank you so much -- a message  from Rush Limbaugh on my last radio show today.  Plus, the Christmas police  is back.  That's next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  The Christmas police are back and coming for your mail.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  We love that little stager.  Tavia Hunt, wife of Kansas City  Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, was getting into the holiday spirit and writing on  her Christmas cards like a lot of you do.  She ordered this photo on a  customizable stamp, and you can see her family, beautiful family, standing  right there in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, where I have  been many times.  It's a beautiful picture.  </p><p> The United States post office didn't think so.  Soon after she placed the  order, Tavia was told by Stamps.com that the U.S. Postal Service guidelines  dictate that all religious content is forbidden.  </p><p> Joining me now is Hiram Sasser, attorney for Tavia Hunt.  Tavia is not  feeling well tonight.  But Hiram, where does the stand now?  First of all,  when is the last time a religious service of any great number in attendance  was held at Saint Basil's Cathedral?  I think it's been quite a long time.   It's a museum now.  </p><p>HIRAM SASSER, TAVIA HUNT'S ATTORNEY:  It certainly has been a long time,  but that's the problem with these postal regulations is that they are so  broad in prohibiting anything religious at all that they would encompass  something such as just a cathedral in the background even though it's not  even being used as a cathedral anymore.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  But what I don't understand is under what constitutional norm or  statutory norm are they operating?  This is not establishing a state  religion, even by the most amorphous, squishiest of tests, most ambiguous  of tests, that the Supreme Court established.  It seems like it falls  squarely within one's free expression rights under the First Amendment.   So, I don't get it.  You can probably show a picture of someone at Hooters  and that's OK, but you can't be a little cathedral in the background, I  don't even understand the argument.  </p><p>SASSER:  You can.  But you can read all the facts and the interaction at  our website at FirstLiberty.org.  But here's what's interesting about this,  is that the postal service prints religious stamps.  They are just saying  that you are not allowed to.  They just passed a regulation that went into  effect in May of 2018 saying nothing religious can be on a customized  stamp.  And the postal service even responded to us today, and they said,  look, you just can't have anything religious on a customized stamp.  But  we'll sell you our religious stamps, but you can't have one.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  OK, first of all, the Madonna stamp is always sold out.  Every  time I try to buy them for Christmas cards, they are like, we have a  rainbow, we have this and that.  They have beautiful stamps but not the one  I happen to want.  OK, I like that one.  </p><p> Listen to the USPS policy on customized postage.  \"Acceptable images or  text may not contain content that is unsuitable for all ages and audiences,  including any depiction of political, religious, violent or sexual  content.\"  How is religious lumped in with violent and sexual content?  </p><p>SASSER:  Religion, I guess, is the new pornography for the postal service.   That's why we're trying to get to the bottom of it.  Here's what great  about the postal service, though.  They don't have to go through a real  complicated rule making process like other agencies.  They can change this  tomorrow if they want to.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, it's going to be changed.  This is lunacy.  Thanks for  bringing this to our attention.  This has got to be done away with.  Thanks  so much.</p><p> And a radio legend helped me signoff my last radio show today.  You don't  want to miss it.  Last Bite, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  It's time for the Last Bite.  After 17 years on the radio, I  left the airwaves today.  I know liberals are celebrating.  Don't worry,  the podcast is coming in January.  But as I signed off, a surprise guest  and the giant in the radio industry surprised me.  Listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Is this Laura Ingraham?  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Oh, Rush.  How are you?  </p><p> LIMBAUGH:  Everybody wants to talk to you, and I finally found a way to  worm my way in there.  </p><p> Laura, I've got to tell you something.  I listen to you on the radio, I  want you on TV, and I have to be honest.  Every time I do, I ask myself why  we are not winning even bigger.  You are that good.  You are that  persuasive.  And you are that unique.  </p><p> If anybody and everybody heard you, it would be a slam dunk that they would  agree with you.  I didn't want to let your last show get away here without  showing those sentiments with you.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, Rush, thank you so much.  It means an enormous amount to  me.  It's bittersweet.  I don't want to get too sappy or emotional, but  it's been -- it's a tough -- it's a tough sendoff.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Laura Ingraham is  up next. Laura?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM- HOST: Hey, Bongino. If you think that's rhythm, I've got to  check out your dance moves, my friend. I mean--</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BONGINO: I've been - no, no. Listen--</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM: That's rhythm? Well, I couldn't even find her in that little  shadow thing you had on there. That's crazy. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BONGINO: Laura, if you see my dance moves, you can't unsee it. You'd have  to bleach your eyes. So--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM: You're the-- </p><p>BONGINO: They're - they're bad. </p><p>INGRAHAM: OK. You're the male version of Elaine on Seinfeld. Fantastic. </p><p>BONGINO: It's worse. </p><p>INGRAHAM: OK--</p><p>BONGINO: Yes. She looks like John Travolta compared to me. It's that bad. </p><p>INGRAHAM: We're inviting you next year to the Ingraham dance party. All  right, my friend? Hey, Merry Christmas if I don't see you.</p><p>BONGINO: Merry Christmas. You got it. </p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The INGRAHAM ANGLE from  Washington tonight. When this city doesn't work for the American people,  the American people go to work for themselves. What am I talking about?  Well, tonight we're going to speak with the man behind a GoFundMe effort to  finance the border wall. Check this out. Only three days this has been up.  He's already raised $9 million. Story of the can-do American spirit in  action is ahead. </p><p>Plus, were anti-Trump forces inside GOP leadership responsible for the  dirty dossier being spread throughout the media? An investigation with  Peter Schweizer is ahead. </p><p>And as 2018 comes to a close, we'll bring you the highlights of the worse  media offenses of the year. Governor Mike Huckabee, Howie Kurtz break down  the videotape. And also tonight, the Christmas police are back. We just  have an excuse to use our Christmas police little video thing, which I  really love. But how the U.S. Postal Service canceled one family stamp over  a claim that the stamp was too religious at Christmas. Why don't you see  this? You will not believe it. </p><p>But we begin tonight with this. Donald Trump making a stand for his wall.  It's what voters wanted, but leadership stood in his way. Trump is now  forcing the hand of Democrats, threatening a shutdown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've made my position very  clear. Any measure that funds the government must include border security.  Has to. It is the solemn promise to protect and defend the United States of  America, and it is our sacred obligation. We have no choice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Joining me now are two Republicans engaged in this fight. House  Majority Whip Steve Scalise, he's in charge of wrangling these votes, and  Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. Plus Fox's Chief Political  Correspondent Ed Henry joins us too. He's been following all the  developments. </p><p>Congressman Scalise, let's start with you. You have the votes, but the  Senate looks shaky, to say the least. Are we headed for a shutdown  tomorrow? </p><p>STEVE SCALISE, HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: First of all, Laura, I think it was a  really important day today. When Nancy Pelosi last week was in the Oval  Office with the President, Chuck Schumer, and she said, \"Mr. President, you  don't have the votes of the House to fund the wall.\" </p><p>And today we've put up a massive vote with a large margin of Republicans  that said we're going to stand with this President, we're going to fund the  wall. And we just gave him serious leverage in whatever negotiations he's  going to have with the Senate. They have to confront this issue knowing we  have the President's back in the House.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sean, a lot of my listeners on radio today and then tonight,  they're watching, and they're thinking, how are we always in this position?  It's the end of the year, no one is rushing to get out of town. Like, no  traffic in D.C. Everyone has already gone. </p><p>SEAN DUFFY, REPUBLICAN, WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN: Yep. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Except you guys are there. We're here. But everyone has already  gone. And their mind they're gone. And Paul Ryan said, we're going to fight  - we're going to have a fight, we're going to have a conversation about the  border wall. Two years in the House Majority, two years at Senate Majority,  we wait until the end of December to deal with an issue that the American  people want dealt with.</p><p>DUFFY: Yes. I mean - first of all, I think we're set up to lose here. We  were not set up to win. We should have had this budget fight last week on  Friday. We could have--</p><p>INGRAHAM: How about last spring? </p><p>DUFFY: No, but - but still as we come to the end of the year, we could have  done it last week, or better yet, we could have even done it this Tuesday  where we would have passed a bill that funded the border wall before the  Senate acted. But we were going to act it today, Thursday, the 20th of  December, right before the end of the year, two weeks before Nancy Pelosi  takes over and think that we have leverage. This is idiotic. </p><p>What we should have done, Laura, is we just passed a bill on criminal  justice reform. Why did we negotiate criminal justice reform, which  Democrats want, which will get no credit for? Why don't we negotiate in  exchange for criminal justice reform, give us $5 billion in border  security? No one negotiated that deal. So we have--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM: Why--</p><p>DUFFY: --we're probably going to lose. </p><p>INGRAHAM: I mean, until you raise that tonight, we were talking earlier,  I've not even thought about that. I mean, the President did not run on  criminal justice reform.</p><p>DUFFY: No. </p><p>INGRAHAM: I'm personally glad it passed. I'm going to be really anxious to  see how it works out. </p><p>DUFFY: I'm not. </p><p>INGRAHAM: You're not. That's fine. But he isn't getting credit for. </p><p>DUFFY: No. </p><p>INGRAHAM: He won't get credit for it. But if you want to use it, use it in  a way that advances the Trump agenda. Ed Henry - hold on. Ed Henry has  information now for us about where things stand in the Senate. Ed, I've tweeted earlier. Everyone's going to follow my tweets all  throughout the next 48 hours. I said earlier that Mitch McConnell should  fight for this wall as hard as he fought for Cavanaugh. And actually, it's  probably more important in the long-term survival of the country.</p><p>ED HENRY, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, remember, he only  needs 51 votes. I've been talking to Senate Republicans in private. What  they are saying is they're hopeful they can get to 51 votes to pass what  the House Republican leaders there are talking about, Congressman Scalise  and Congressman Duffy as well. But the challenge I'm being told is that you  have Republicans like Bob Corker. You mentioned there's not a lot of  traffic. Some of them have gone home already. Bob Corker told Fox tonight--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Disgraceful. </p><p>HENRY: --he's retiring from Tennessee. He's already driving home to  Tennessee. That's his planning anyway. </p><p>INGRAHAM: A disgrace. </p><p>HENRY: Because--</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's a disgrace. </p><p>HENRY: --they're not planning to stick around. Now, will they be pulled  back because of the wall funding? We'll see. But I've talked to sources  inside the White House, by the way, who tell me, think about it, put  yourself in the shoes of President Trump. He was told that we're going to  repeal and replace Obamacare. He was told we're going to have wall funding.  He was told that we'd eventually get out of Afghanistan and Syria once we  defeated ISIS. </p><p>And you go down the list, and a lot of these priorities that he didn't just  campaign on in promise, but he actually won on in 2016, he hasn't been able  to follow up on. Look at the tariffs. Established Republicans, time and  time again, people inside the White House remind me, told the President  \"don't do it.\" And Congressman Duffy will be the first to tell you that bud  (ph) for President Trump standing up against Canada, the dairy farmers in  Congressman Duffy's district--</p><p>DUFFY: Right. </p><p>HENRY: --wouldn't have been helped there in Wisconsin.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. So time and again, the President's instincts on these  issues, edges took us through a couple of them. We're spot on. He was  pulled back from his instincts by the experts. I think some of them were  foreign policy experts that are now thankfully gone or treasury experts.  His instincts on this are right. And I want to play something for  everybody. You've got to watch Chuck Schumer. They're playing a big game  there on Capitol Hill today. This is what he said about the shutdown.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: President Trump is plunging the  country into chaos. And he said in front of us he'd be proud to shut down  the government. It is nothing to be proud of. The bottom line is simple.  The Trump  will shut down the government, but it will not get him his  wall. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Congressman Scalise, temper tantrum. I don't think so. I mean, he  campaigned on (inaudible) on this. He deserves the Republicans to get  behind him and also put the Democrats back on their heels. OK. You stay for  border security, $5 billion? </p><p>SCALISE: Yes. </p><p>INGRAHAM: That - really that's what we're arguing about, $5 billion? </p><p>SCALISE: Laura, this looks like another Schumer shutdown. And think about  this. A few years ago, Chuck Schumer voted for a border wall. He's going to  have a hard time reconciling that. If you listen to what he's saying, he is  making it personal. He doesn't want Donald Trump to get money for the wall  because he doesn't want Donald Trump to get to win. </p><p>The American people see Donald Trump fighting for them to secure the  border. It's about border security. It's been about this throughout his  campaign. He won on this issue as one of the front and center issues. And  so now he's actually doing it. </p><p>If Chuck Schumer wants to sit there and say we're going to have a shut  down, try to blame somebody else for it. The American people know this is  about border security. You're for it or you're against it. We have people  in the caravan who are known criminals, they're attacking our border patrol  agents at the border. Let's actually stand up for them. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. He says that we're worried about chaos. Oh, it's - spend  real-time. Not just the photo ops they do when they go up to the border  patrol people and try to usher in migrants - real chaos. The Tijuana  government knows what chaos is, Mexico has seen the chaos. The cartels are  being enriched by others. Chuck Schumer chaos, that line is so tired and  old. I want you to chime in here though because Nancy Pelosi said this  earlier today and I got you to respond. Last week--</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: There are no votes in the House, the  majority of votes, for a wall, no matter where you start. </p><p>UNKNOWN: That's exactly right. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: You proved her wrong?</p><p>DUFFY: I think it is when I checked the vote list. We just passed $5  billion--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. You proved her wrong. Could Schumer be wrong?</p><p>DUFFY: Steve Scalise did a great job counting the votes. </p><p>INGRAHAM: You whipped it. Yes. Could Schumer be wrong as well? </p><p>DUFFY: He could be wrong. But - Nancy Pelosi is more concerned about her  votes to become the Speaker as opposed to the votes to do what's right for  America and secure the border. But think of this, Laura. We have agreement  on all the funding but for the $5 billion for the wall. That's the only  thing that's holding up funding the government versus shutting the  government down.</p><p>But I look at Chuck Schumer out there talking to the American people and  Nancy talking to the American people today. Donald Trump has to do an Oval  Office address. He has to frame--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM: I've said this for a year. </p><p>DUFFY: --and he has to talk about - we have to talk about the families that  have lost loved ones to the drug abuse that comes--</p><p>INGRAHAM: One year. </p><p>DUFFY: --off of southern border, meth and - in my community, we've - all  our counties don't have money because they're spending so much money for  out-of-home placement for kids who've lost their parents because of drug  abuse, or the parents who've lost a loved one at the hands of an illegal  immigrant. Frame the issue of America. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p>DUFFY: Take away the photos of the kids at the border with the (inaudible). </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM: Personalize it. We don't - they personalize it. They say the  death of a seven-year-old girl is on your shoulders--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DUFFY: On average, every single day, we stop 10 known or suspected  terrorists from coming into America. Last year alone, our ICE agents, who  are in the middle of this too, saved over 900 kids from human trafficking.  Those are real kids who are safe today because of what we're doing to  secure our border. Who knows how many got in that we didn't catch. So,  thank, God, we have President Trump fighting to secure the border. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, he has to give an--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DUFFY: That's what this fight is going to be about. Him having an address  (ph) would be great. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Sean is absolutely right. I've begged him to do this for a year,  on air. I'd say this is the most important issue for the American people  today. It's the government and immigration. Those two issues are the top of  the list for the people. The government, meaning, working against the  people and immigration. That's it. Got to address the country on this. </p><p>DUFFY: And this is the--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM: Not tweets. Address the country, lay it out. I'm sorry, I know  I'm going to reign (ph) on this, but it's really important. I want to get  to some other big news of the day, the Mattis resignation, because by the  reaction in the hours following, you would have thought that we just  decided on an imprudent ground invasion into a foreign land. For instance,  here was Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: Everything that indicates stability, everything that indicates  strength, everything that indicates knowledge is leaving this  administration. General Kelly, General Mattis, so many others--</p><p>UNKNOWN: McMaster. </p><p>SCHUMER: McMaster, exactly. There is chaos now in this administration. </p><p>PELOSI] I am shaken by the resignation of General Mattis for what it means  to our country, for the message it sends to our troops, and for the  indication of what his view is of the Commander in Chief.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Here's a message that sends to our troops you're coming home. OK.  That's a message that sends to your troops. The days of Bush  interventionism is over. That's where the President ran. And Obama went  through four secretaries of defense. I do not remember the freak-out. And I  thought Pelosi and company were for pulling troops back--</p><p>HENRY: Right. </p><p>INGRAHAM: --once we actually have victory. Now they're the  interventionists. I'm really confused--</p><p>HENRY: Right. </p><p>INGRAHAM: --about where they are. </p><p>HENRY: When the President is for something they've been for a long time--</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's unbelievable. </p><p>HENRY: --they don't want to admit it, on trade and other issues as well. I  think you made a really important point a moment ago about Senator Schumer  as well, in pushing the chaos narrative. It's sort of like every time  there's development in the Mueller investigation, we here \"The walls are  closing in, this is it.\"</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p>HENRY: And then it's sort of fizzles out. Here's the bottom line though. I  don't think you can sugarcoat the fact that Mattis leaving is a big  development because his letter was pretty blistering in terms of his  differences with the President on Syria, for example. </p><p>Here's my bigger point. Watch what Lindsey Graham is saying tonight. He has  been an ally to the President, as you know, in recent days on a whole range  of issues, and he's warning, don't make the same mistake that Barack Obama  made in terms of pulling out of Iraq that you could have a terrorist safe- haven in Afghanistan. But I also hear your point, Laura, which is - it gets  back to what he said at the top. The President campaigned directly in 2016,  not just on repeal and replace, in trade--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p>HENRY: --and the tariffs. But he also said, we're not the world's  policeman. He was honest about that in terms of Syria and Afghanistan,  which is now by the way the longest war ever. It just - right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: 17 years. We still have men and women--</p><p>HENRY: And so he campaigned in one on that. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Guys, everyone has to re-frame (ph). OK? It's because we're  watching Schumer with his glasses down on the end of his nose, where  something (ph) is really serious about this. OK? But remember what Donald  Trump campaigned on. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're getting out of the nation-building business. Our moments of  greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge. </p><p>We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. </p><p>I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions  of dollars. We cannot be the policeman of the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: He won in part on a non-interventionist platform. Obama beat Bush  on a non-interventionist platform. It had been like Adam Kinzinger run  around town acting like - it's like 2003 all over again. </p><p>Steve Scalise, Mattis has a different point of view than the President on  this? Well, that's why Donald Trump is elected President. If Mattis wants  to run for President, go run for President. I found that letter to be  surprising coming from him--</p><p>SCALISE: Ultimately--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --and a little dismissive. I didn't like it. </p><p>SCALISE: Ultimately, you only have one Commander in Chief. And look, the  President and Secretary of State Tillerson had some differences on foreign  policy, and so Rex Tillerson left. Mike Pompeo came in. and he's doing a  great job representing our country and the President. He'll find somebody  else to serve in this role. It's an important role. Secretary Mattis did a  great job of helping (inaudible) ISIS, and they're not going all the way--</p><p>INGRAHAM: They want to stay. </p><p>SCALISE: --but he did a great job--</p><p>INGRAHAM: They don't want to leave. </p><p>SCALISE: But he's--</p><p>INGRAHAM: But when we go, they don't want--</p><p>SCALISE: He's going to be able to find another general who's going to be  able to--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p>SCALISE: --serve this country well as his defense secretary. </p><p>INGRAHAM: The line is always, if we leave, chaos will ensue, which means we  can never leave, because we're in these countries that are by their very  constitution very chaotic.</p><p>DUFFY: There is a life footprint there. 2,000 troops not engaged in battle  but give you more advice to the--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why we're there? What is it a national security interest--?</p><p>DUFFY: Because I think if we leave, I think - or you can--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM: OK. So we're going to be there for everywhere. And let's take a  poll--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DUFFY: But what--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --American people right now. </p><p>DUFFY: But what happens with Russia? What happens with Iran? I mean--</p><p>INGRAHAM: What happened to Russia? Economy is smaller than France's. Right.  What are - what are we worried about Russia for? </p><p>DUFFY: Did you see the territory to them? Do you see the territory to Iran  who wants to kill the big Satan America or the little Satan Israel? I think  that's a mistake. </p><p>INGRAHAM: How much money did China spend in Iraq and Afghanistan? </p><p>DUFFY: Yes. I don't know. </p><p>INGRAHAM: None. </p><p>DUFFY: Probably none. Right. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. And we're $20 trillion on that. </p><p>DUFFY: But are at the point that the President is the Commander in Chief.  He gets to call the ball and he has - he deserves a staff around and that  supports him. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p>DUFFY: So--</p><p>INGRAHAM: It seemed unnecessarily petty of an American hero, Mattis. And I  thought that was surprising.</p><p>DUFFY: But you know what? I think that we have the right to disagree. And  in our party-- </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p>DUFFY: --we don't all fall in line. We can have different--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. </p><p>DUFFY: --opinions and we can debate it and we can agree (inaudible)  President--</p><p>INGRAHAM: We'll see if Bush-ism works in 2020.</p><p>SCALISE: Yes, we'll see.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We're going to see if we can go back to Bush-ism, and that's  going to sell the American people--</p><p>DUFFY: No, no, we don't want to go to--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. We're going to see if that--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SCALISE: President Trump is rebuilding our military, and that's something  he campaigned on. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. He's not squandering-</p><p>SCALISE: He's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM: --the military either. </p><p>SCALISE: --on that promise as well. </p><p>DUFFY: Yes. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, he's not squandering the military. </p><p>Guys, thank you so much. </p><p>SCALISE: All right. Thank you. </p><p>INGRAHAM: And I want to get to a tragic but important story outside of  Washington. It relates to what we're talking about. And we have to tie this  all together for the American people. A community ravaged by the lack of  action on the part of our government and local government, state  government, who just turned their backs on them. What are we talking about? </p><p>Visalia, California, it sits between LA and San Francisco. And in that  town, over the course of two heroin days earlier this week, Gustavo Garcia,  he's a man twice removed from this country, went on what authorities call a  reign of terror. It's a 24-hour shooting spree, killing at least two and  injuring many more. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN (voice-over): Deputies taking gunfire from this man, 36-year-old  Gustavo Garcia. It all went down on Road 140 and Avenue 256 early Monday  morning. You can hear the officer reloading his gun as the bullets ring  out. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, while the circumstances of this are tragic on their own, the  run-up to it is even more so. Two days before this reign of terror, he was  arrested by the Tulare County Sheriff's deputies for being under the  influence of a controlled substance. He was held in the county jail for  about 10 hours before being released even though ICE officials had issued  an immigration-hold on him. You see this arrest wasn't Garcia's first rush  of the law. He has a violent criminal past.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN (voice-over): Immigration and Customs Enforcement tells FOX 26  News, Garcia had been deported twice. In the past, the Sheriff's office  could have alerted immigration because of Garcia's extensive rap sheet,  which includes armed robbery more than 15 years ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, you might be asking yourself, why did the cops let him go  despite the ICE hold, especially given his past? So, was it the police's  fault?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN (voice-over): ICE did follow a detainer as soon as it learned of  Garcia's arrest Friday. And this would be enough to keep him in custody in  other states. But Sheriff Boudreaux says his office no longer recognizes  those detainers and it can't reach out to ICE for misdemeanor crimes. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: So Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said, \"Before SB 54,\"  which is the Sanctuary State Bill, \"Gustavo Garcia would have been turned  over to ICE officials. That's how we've always done it. After SB 54,  though, we no longer have the power to do that.\"</p><p>We should know the Tulare County Board of Supervisors voted to adopt a  resolution opposing California sanctuary state law in May of this year. And  even though it's kind of symbolic, it does show a citizenry standing up for  common sense. </p><p>Joining me now is Tulare County Sheriff, Mike Boudreaux. Sheriff, I know  our viewers across the country are watching this and are shaking their  heads going, how would - how can this happen in the United States of  America? Will we emote morning, noon and night about the tragic  circumstances of people who are trying to come into the country? And I get  it. They're tragic circumstances. It's tough. But yet, the politicians -  did you get a call from Pelosi? Did you get a call from Gavin Newsom? Any  other officials in California concerned about what's happening there?</p><p>MIKE BOUDREAUX, TULARE COUNTY SHERIFF: You know, the only phone call that I  got was from the ACLU demonizing the actions that we took, which is really  unfortunate. Tulare County is how it's pronounced actually, but--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sorry. </p><p>BOUDREAUX: --in Tulare County, we are - that's fine - we're an agricultural  community. We produce multi-billion dollars worth of agriculture that's  sent all over the world. And we have a large undocumented community. But we  also have a large group of people who don't commit these types of crimes on  a daily basis. </p><p>I think what our focus is on is the criminal. The criminal element that  ends up in my jail that I no longer have the tools to reach out to ICE, my  counterpart, my law enforcement partners, and I'm no longer able to  recognize the detainer through the sanctuary state law as well as the Ninth  Court Circuit indicating that the detainers don't meet due process. So,  because of those two combined efforts, we no longer can telephone ICE and  even ask the question why is this detainer placed nor can we recognize the  detainer itself. And I think--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Can you--</p><p>BOUDREAUX: --that I need to--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Wait, wait. Hold on. </p><p>BOUDREAUX: --make myself very clear is that-</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sheriff, Sheriff, Sheriff, hold on, hold on. Can you give a heads  up--</p><p>BOUDREAUX: Yes. </p><p>INGRAHAM: --to ICE? Can you give them a heads up? </p><p>BOUDREAUX: I'm sorry?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Can you give them a heads up? Can you call and say, we're about  to release this individual or we have this individual in custody even if  they can't come and interview him or examine him? Is there any notification  at all you could give to ICE? </p><p>BOUDREAUX: We're not allowed to - we're not allowed to talk to our  counterparts under these laws--</p><p>INGRAHAM: What is the conservative lawsuit against this? </p><p>BOUDREAUX: --especially with--</p><p>INGRAHAM: This is just an outrage. Hold on. I got to play something for  you, Sheriff. This was Nancy Pelosi's claim about what sanctuary policies  actually accomplish. Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PELOSI: Our City of San Francisco is a sanctuary city. And we see it as a  place where it makes us safer. It makes us safer because people can go to  school, they can get driver's license, they can be witnesses against other  violence that they see in the community. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Is your community feeling safer tonight?</p><p>BOUDREAUX: They're not feeling safer. But I will say that we don't - we're  not against our undocumented community. We're not against immigrants. We  don't - we're not against Dreamers or DACA. And I think that it needs to be  very clear our community as a whole - even our undocumented community - I  sat with a large group of people, and they're not afraid of their law  enforcement. They're not even afraid-</p><p>INGRAHAM: So that's a lie? </p><p>BOUDREAUX: --of being deported. What they're--</p><p>INGRAHAM: So that's a lie, Sheriff. That argument that I hear parroted to  me morning, noon and night, every time we deal with one of these sanctuary  policy cases. We did this in New Jersey a couple of weeks ago. The advocate  that came on said, \"Oh, no, we're not going to have immigrants cooperating  with authorities. We're not going to show up and testify in cases.\" That's  just bunk. But this is the--</p><p>BOUDREAUX: That is bunk. </p><p>INGRAHAM: --the parroted line. So you don't see that at all in your  community? </p><p>BOUDREAUX: Yes. That's not true. We don't see that. We see our community  reaching out to us. What they're afraid of? What they're afraid of is that  the criminal will return to their community because we can't report them to  ICE.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. And commit domestic violence, rape, burglary, robbery, other  offenses against property and people. </p><p>Sheriff, thank you for the heads up and for speaking out on what we are  going to be following all throughout the next year because so many people  won't do it. We're going to do it. </p><p>All right. Coming up, when our leaders fail, Americans begin to take action  into their own hands in a good way. An Air Force veteran and triple amputee  is finding his own way to pay for the border wall. He's going to tell us  about it, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, this really is a story about America's quintessential can-do  attitude. Whether their leaders fail them, our citizens take matters into  their own hands. I know Brian Kolfage is a triple amputee Air Force vet who  started the GoFundMe page for the wall - \"the wall\" that the politicians  don't want to fund, and he started this just three days ago. In that short  time, he has already raised more than $9.7 million. Now, here to tell us  why he did this, what he hopes to achieve is Brian himself. </p><p>All right, Brian. Now, the critics will say that this is just a publicity  stunt. It's not going to even make a dent in the total cost, which should  be at least around $20 billion. I'm not great at math, but that's a pretty  - that's a pretty tough hill to climb. So what do you say to those critics? </p><p>BRIAN KOLFAGE, VET RAISING MONEY FOR BORDER WALL: I'd say they're full of  crap. And this is the United States and we can do anything we want. And if  people want to donate to that wall and give their money, they can do it. I  mean, what's 80 bucks for 60 million people. The common person can give  that kind of money. </p><p>And this is not just about Republicans and conservatives. There is  outpouring of Democrats that are messaging me and giving to this wall fund.  It's from both sides of the aisle, but you don't hear the liberal media  saying that. This is America coming together. They want the wall, and  they're putting their money where their mouth is and they're funding it. </p><p>INGRAHAM: You've had some run-ins before with Facebook, I know, on blocking  various accounts you've had, even a military beer business you had that  gave 10 percent of your profits to military charities. </p><p>You're a triple amputee Air Force veteran. And yet Facebook has had like  kind of an aggressive attitude towards you. I know you've had counsel  trying to fight them on this. Are you seeing any resistance to your  postings? I've got a lot on my Facebook page. And I've sent them out to my  friends. But are you getting any resistance at all in the social media  community? </p><p>KOLFAGE: Well, I'm - I'm not allowed on Facebook anymore. My company,  military grade coffee company was outright banned. And Facebook executives  told me I'm not allowed to do use it. And they threatened my wife they'd  delete her account if they catch me on Facebook. So I don't use Facebook  anymore. I've gone to Twitter and that's where people can find me. </p><p>And it just - it's ridiculous the way that these companies treat people.  And Americans are just pissed off. They're pissed off in general and  they're mad with the way politics and politicians are handling things and  big tech and - it just - it's a lot of problems that are bubbling up right  now. And it's just a culmination of things. And everyone is - Americans are  just not happy. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, why - why the wall? Why is this an issue for you? </p><p>KOLFAGE: Well - I mean, the wall is an important thing for me. I feel it's  near and dear to my heart. And it was a promise that was made to the  Americans. And this is a very important part of our nation, our country. We  need security. We're a nation of laws. We need to enforce these laws. We  can't have people coming across our border who are unchecked that don't  know who they are. </p><p>I mean, we can have another terrorist attack tomorrow. It doesn't take many  people to stage an attack. We need to know who's coming across that border  and we need to keep it in check. And this - like I said, this wall is in  our constitution. We need to have the wall, and the Americans want the  wall. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Wait. What do you mean the wall is in our constitution? Where in  the constitution? </p><p>KOLFAGE: Well, it just - it's part of our nation. It's part of our lives. </p><p>INGRAHAM: I mean, you're talking about--</p><p>KOLFAGE: We are a nation--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --our sovereignty. Our sovereignty. </p><p>KOLFAGE: Yes, sovereignty. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Right. Yes--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KOLFAGE: We're a nation of walls. And--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --the wall itself is not in the constitution--</p><p>KOLFAGE: The Trump wall is not in the constitution. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. But the--</p><p>KOLFAGE: Let's clarify that. </p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. I get what your point is. He made the promise. </p><p>KOLFAGE: Yes. </p><p>INGRAHAM: And if that wall doesn't get built, it's hard to see - it's hard  to see Trump winning in 2020. I'm just going to - I know people like  hearing that. But if this wall doesn't get built, I think it's going to  demoralize a lot of people. We're going to have more problems. We got to  get the same built. </p><p>But Mikel Jollett - I don't know who this person is, but it's some singer I  guess a lot of people follow - was hitting you pretty hard on Twitter  saying the following. \"Right now in America people are donating money they  don't have to build a wall they don't need to solve a problem that doesn't  exist.\" And I guess the band, airborne toxic effect, basically saying  you're bad at math because it would take till 2086 - yes, you're racist,  bad at math. I mean, there's no real substantive argument against why a  wall may or may not work. But I'm sure you're getting - get a lot of that. </p><p>KOLFAGE: Maybe that's just the liberal tactics in the liberal media.  They're going to come out and attack my family.  And they can go ahead and  do what they want, but we are not stopping.  We are going to keep on  pushing through.  No matter what Congress does, if they pass this through,  we're not stopping.  We're going to keep pushing this through.  We're going  to see what the Senate does.  We're going to see how this plays out.  And  Americans aren't happy and they're going to keep giving to this GoFundMe,  and we're going to keep pushing it.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  It's $9.7 million, it's one of the top GoFundMe efforts in just  three days in the United States for the whole year.  Brian, we're going to  following this.  Thank you for your service to this country.  You suffered  greatly for our freedom and you continue to inspire so many people.  Thank  you so much.  We really appreciate it.  And merry Christmas to your family.  </p><p>Now on to some troubling revelations inside a Florida court.  Documents  filed yesterday show us the publication \"Buzzfeed\" was sued after they  published the bogus dossier on President Trump.  But they won in court.   But that's not actually the interesting part of the story.  Inside the  filing were revelations about certain Republicans that will shock a lot of  you.  </p><p>First, a longtime associate of the late Republican from Arizona Senator  John McCain initially provided a copy of that infamous Steele dossier to  \"Buzzfeed\" in the first place.  And second, a Paul Ryan aide and  Congressman Adam Kinzinger were given an early look at the dossier before  others even became aware of it.  </p><p>Here now is Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability  Institute.  So Peter, why does this not surprise me, that when someone is  trying to shop an anti-Trump document as salacious and as ridiculous as  that was, they went to two big-time neoconservatives who are diametrically  opposed to Trump on things like the wall, speaking of the wall, his  noninterventionist philosophy and his economic nationalism, go down the  line.  McCain and Kinzinger, and I guess Paul Ryan had some access to it as  well.  </p><p>PETER SCHWEIZER, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE:  Yes, you're right,  Laura.  This speaks to something profound about Washington's political  culture.  Think about this for a second.  If McCain's office or Ryan's  office had been given a salacious, unverified dossier about one of their  colleagues, do you think they would have been leaking it around to the  press corps?  I really doubt it.  </p><p>This speaks to the fact that Donald Trump is a disruptor.  There is a deep  cultural clash between him and the Washington establishment.  And it speaks  to the fact that they do not like the fact that he is disrupting the way  things are done in Washington, D.C., the same way that on the political  left Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman-elect Ocasio-Cortez is doing on the  left of the political spectrum.  </p><p>And I think it speaks to the fact that, what Donald Trump represents, it's  those policies you talked about, but it's about changing the dynamics of  how Washington works.  And they do not like it and they want to stop it.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  They want the status quo.  Let's face it, a lot of people make a  lot of money.  Regular folks out there, they see what people make as  lobbyists or consultants, and these are people who haven't won elections in  a decade.  And yet they still make tens of millions of dollars with ad buys  and ad design and placement and consulting contracts.  So they like the  status quo.</p><p>Trump comes in like a wrecking ball and says this whole town stinks to high  heaven, and it makes them really nervous.  They are freaking out about this  Syria withdrawal.  I bet most Americans don't even know we are in Syria,  because they're thinking, wait a second, don't we have problems in  Cincinnati to deal with, but we're in Syria with 2,000 after we've already  decimated ISIS.</p><p>So I think he has held up a mirror to the corruption in Washington, and  they don't like what they are seeing.  So it has got to be Trump is the  problem and Trump is the corrupt one.  </p><p>SCHWEIZER:  Right, exactly.  And consider just something like deregulation.   Everybody thinks it's great because it frees up American businesses, makes  them more competitive.  But it costs a lot of people in Washington, D.C.,  money.  Here's why.  The reason why regulations, whether it's environmental  or financial, are so complicated and complex is they are designed that way,  because you've got an entire industry in Washington, D.C., that is  interpreting rules and laws that nobody else understands.  </p><p>If you come in and say, you know what, we are getting rid of these  thousands of pages of regulations, now suddenly that is a huge revenue  stream for Washington consultants that's gone.  That's just one of the ways  in which the swamp is being changed in Washington, D.C.</p><p>So what I say to people is agree with Trump on certain policies or not,  there is no disputing the fact that he is a disruptor.  We love disruptors  in Silicon Valley, we like them in the entertainment business.  I think  it's good to have them in American politics too, because it's become  calcified.  It's the wealthiest city in the United States today is  Washington D.C.  That's a huge problem.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  It's a problem when there are as many cranes, we always talk  about the measure of the corruption are the number of cranes in any given  neighborhood in Washington D.C.  It is wild.  But yes, they like the status  quo.  Keep the money spending even if we don't have it.  </p><p>Peter Schweizer, have a great holiday, a merry Christmas, and all that  jazz.  We'll see you in the new year.  </p><p>And up next, this is a fun one.  OK, what where the worst media moments of  2018?  Will I make any of those?  I hope not.  Governor Mike Huckabee and  Howie Kurtz take us through the video and the most embarrassing moments  when we get back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right, 2018 is coming to a close, can you believe it?  So we  thought, what better time than to highlight a few of the media lowlights  from the past year.  And our friends at Grabien helped us out here, too.   My old producer Tom Elliott does a great job there.  Here with me now to  take us through the tape, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, host of  \"Media Buzz\" also right here on FOX, Howie Kurtz.  All right, gents, I want  to first start with the media's once warm embrace of a man who is now not  on the top of the invite list.  Let's watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti joins us live  now.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Joining me now is Stormy Daniels' attorney Michael  Avenatti.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Michael Avenatti is with us now.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Michael Avenatti joins us now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And joining me now from Los Angeles is Michael  Avenatti.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  We want more of the spooning comments that they made toward  Avenatti, Howie.  </p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST:  He was hard to book.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  He was the belle of the ball, though, until he wasn't.  So  should the media have seen this coming with the meltdown of Avenatti?  </p><p>KURTZ:  The degree to which CNN and MSNBC put this guy on sometimes several  times a day to peddle his unsubstantiated claims and develop his  presidential delusions was really something.  But the worst by far was  putting on Avenatti on to make the claims of Julie Swetnick to vouch for  this woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of beginning a bunch of gang rapes - - </p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's what I want to see.  That's a scene I want to see.</p><p>KURTZ:  Yes, go to that videotape.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  It will tell us more -- in the introductions, we want to see,  it's like, really, tell us more about all this unsubstantiated garbage.   That should go down as one of the biggest blackeyes of this media over the  last 12 months.  Disgusting.  </p><p>And are we going to the next one, now?  All right, Huck wants to describe  this as well.  Governor, I think Michael Avenatti is just one of those  figures who will occasionally pop up like if they have a celebrity  Hollywood Squares maybe, he will be the lower right square or something.   But I don't see of Avenatti playing much of a role in public life in the  future.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  I think his history is up like a  rock, down like a rock, back under the rock from whence he crawled.  That's  the end of the story for Michael Avenatti, I'm pretty sure.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Number two on our list involves some actual dumpster diving as  journalists attempt to find some dirt, literally, tying President Trump to  Russia.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Quickly, you looked through the trash there?  What did  you find?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, we did.  We came here expecting this office to be  empty.  But in fact, all day here, we've been here throughout the course of  the day, people have been going in and out.  We went through the trash to  see what could find because we saw people dumping rubbish there.  New  computers, new computers are being delivered here, and they're throwing  away the rubbish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Somehow the accent makes it all the more interesting.  </p><p>KURTZ:  Yes, right.  Here we are with the rubbish.  Let's inspect the  rubbish.  Not that big of a deal, but it kind of smells.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Literally and figuratively.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  But governor, again, this just tells you how low they can go.   Going through the garbage now?  I guess you could do that, but, for what?   What'd they get?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I thought they were doing a tour of their newsroom, because  that's what you typically see with a lot of these networks.  Anything,  anything, and that does show that if you are willing to go through people's  trash hoping to get something negative on conservatives, you're pretty  desperate.  And this is a media that is pretty desperate, there's no doubt  about it.  That was hilarious.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Howie, what's the rating for the media now?  That approval  rating usually hovers around 20 percent or something, whether people  respect them?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It may be up to 30.  But basically --  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  It's up to 30 now.  Wow, that's actually pretty good.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, Howie.</p><p>KURTZ:  This is not my rating.  I'm tell you how it shows up --</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Gov, what are you -- hey, governor, we have to check this.  Do  that Google search, Raymond.  Is it really 30 percent?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I've just got to tell you, Howie, the flu is more popular than  the media right now.  </p><p>KURTZ:  While it is on a downward spiral, and some of these examples show  why people don't trust the press.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Let's move on to number three, where some CNN hosts did their  best to test the limits of the FCC.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's the craziest -- I've ever heard.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- hole countries.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- hole countries.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  These countries are -- holes. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I couldn't give a -- about them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've definitely been -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You -- and slant eyes.  I called you a -- and a -- and  a wetback. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I didn't say the n-word.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You are offended when I saw --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, that's a lot of --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ:  Did you wear out the beeper there?  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I don't even know how you do those edits on that stuff.   Governor, let's start with you.  The swear-fest, I guess it's people are  more authentic, living their truth.  I love that phrase, we're living our  truth.  I didn't like it when our previous guest who was a war hero and a  triple amputee, and I adore him -- I don't like it when people use p-i-s-s- e-d on air.  I know that sounds old-fashioned but, I know we all swear.   Maybe not the governor, but we all swear, but we want to not on TV as much  if we can possibly not.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't know if you know this or not, but they quit serving  sandwiches in the CNN cafeteria and now they just sell soap for people to  eat that because they've gotten so potty-mouthed over there.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  So it's a steady diet.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  What are the rules.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Every brand of soap.</p><p>KURTZ:  In one interview, CNN anchor Fareed Zakaria called Trump a b-ser,  using the full word, four different times.  It just goes to show that when  you're talking about Donald Trump, the standards go out the window, there's  a complete double standard.  You can get down and dirty and curse all you  want because somehow that's OK.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  We have an anchors on other networks saying he's a racist.  Just  like he's a racist, he's a liar, he's a racist, he's a liar. </p><p>KURTZ:  He's a blanking racist.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  He's a blanking racist.  But it just -- it shows you, both  governor and Howie, it shows you -- and I hate that Trump derangement  syndrome has become such a cliche, but something is burrowed deep into the  psyche of people that they are not even able to have friendships with  people with whom they disagree, the tolerant set.  And you see this in  media figures.  People who I have been friends with in other media outlets  for years, not all of them -- I used to like Don Lemon.  Don Lemon used to  come on my radio show, we were joking earlier, I used to have people like  Frank Rich on my radio, John Kerry.  We could disagree, but now there's so  -- it's burrowed in anger and resentment and upset.  </p><p>KURTZ:  You can't even fraternize.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  You can't even have a conversation.  You are a horrible, awful  rotten person if you ever said anything nice about Donald Trump, and it's  oozing out of their pores, which is very strange.  </p><p>All right, the last one on our list to someone I just mentioned.  CNN's Don  Lemon describing the biggest terror threat facing our country right now.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  We have to stop demonizing people and realize the  biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them  radicalized to the right.  And we have to start doing something about them.   There is no travel ban on them.  There is no ban on -- they had the Muslim  ban.  There is no white guy ban.  So what do we do about that?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Governor Huckabee, you are one of those aforementioned white  men.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, what do we do?  What do we do?  I'm guilty as charged.  I  am an American white man.  And I don't know what Don Lemon is going to do.   What is he going to do, deport me?  To where?  I'm an American born  citizen.   What is he going to do, arrest me?  For what?  I think  differently than him.  This is America.  This is really the heighth of it.  </p><p>But I have got to tell you, Laura, it's not just what he says.  It's that  tone where he is attempting so diligently to sound authoritative that I  found beyond amusing.  And these guys who sit and they pontificate night  after night with such a tone of seriousness as if they are personally  saving this great republic -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  They're pained.  But they're very pained -- I'm pain to have to  say this.  I regret having to say this.  </p><p>Howie, before we go, remember this ad from CNN?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a whole bunch of bananas.  Somewhere buried  within it is an apple.  Some people might try to tell you that there is no  point in looking for it, but there's only one way to know what has been  covered up.  You start digging.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Move over James Earl Jones.  I like James Earl Jones better,  this is CNN.  This is CNN, don't slip on the banana peel.</p><p>KURTZ:  It's a kind of a fruitcake ad.  But there is a certain self- righteousness that has creeped into a lot of media self-promotion.  \"The  Washington Post,\" democracy dies in the darkness.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Democracy dies in the darkness.  </p><p>KURTZ:  Somehow democracy wasn't in danger when Barack Obama was president. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Thank you, Jeff Bezos.  Small business might die in the face of  amazon.  </p><p>KURTZ:  I'm all for self-promotion, but let's keep it real.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Still to come -- both of you, thank you so much -- a message  from Rush Limbaugh on my last radio show today.  Plus, the Christmas police  is back.  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Christmas police are back and coming for your mail.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  We love that little stager.  Tavia Hunt, wife of Kansas City  Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, was getting into the holiday spirit and writing on  her Christmas cards like a lot of you do.  She ordered this photo on a  customizable stamp, and you can see her family, beautiful family, standing  right there in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, where I have  been many times.  It's a beautiful picture.  </p><p>The United States post office didn't think so.  Soon after she placed the  order, Tavia was told by Stamps.com that the U.S. Postal Service guidelines  dictate that all religious content is forbidden.  </p><p>Joining me now is Hiram Sasser, attorney for Tavia Hunt.  Tavia is not  feeling well tonight.  But Hiram, where does the stand now?  First of all,  when is the last time a religious service of any great number in attendance  was held at Saint Basil's Cathedral?  I think it's been quite a long time.   It's a museum now.  </p><p>HIRAM SASSER, TAVIA HUNT'S ATTORNEY:  It certainly has been a long time,  but that's the problem with these postal regulations is that they are so  broad in prohibiting anything religious at all that they would encompass  something such as just a cathedral in the background even though it's not  even being used as a cathedral anymore.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  But what I don't understand is under what constitutional norm or  statutory norm are they operating?  This is not establishing a state  religion, even by the most amorphous, squishiest of tests, most ambiguous  of tests, that the Supreme Court established.  It seems like it falls  squarely within one's free expression rights under the First Amendment.   So, I don't get it.  You can probably show a picture of someone at Hooters  and that's OK, but you can't be a little cathedral in the background, I  don't even understand the argument.  </p><p>SASSER:  You can.  But you can read all the facts and the interaction at  our website at FirstLiberty.org.  But here's what's interesting about this,  is that the postal service prints religious stamps.  They are just saying  that you are not allowed to.  They just passed a regulation that went into  effect in May of 2018 saying nothing religious can be on a customized  stamp.  And the postal service even responded to us today, and they said,  look, you just can't have anything religious on a customized stamp.  But  we'll sell you our religious stamps, but you can't have one.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, first of all, the Madonna stamp is always sold out.  Every  time I try to buy them for Christmas cards, they are like, we have a  rainbow, we have this and that.  They have beautiful stamps but not the one  I happen to want.  OK, I like that one.  </p><p>Listen to the USPS policy on customized postage.  \"Acceptable images or  text may not contain content that is unsuitable for all ages and audiences,  including any depiction of political, religious, violent or sexual  content.\"  How is religious lumped in with violent and sexual content?  </p><p>SASSER:  Religion, I guess, is the new pornography for the postal service.   That's why we're trying to get to the bottom of it.  Here's what great  about the postal service, though.  They don't have to go through a real  complicated rule making process like other agencies.  They can change this  tomorrow if they want to.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, it's going to be changed.  This is lunacy.  Thanks for  bringing this to our attention.  This has got to be done away with.  Thanks  so much.</p><p>And a radio legend helped me signoff my last radio show today.  You don't  want to miss it.  Last Bite, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  It's time for the Last Bite.  After 17 years on the radio, I  left the airwaves today.  I know liberals are celebrating.  Don't worry,  the podcast is coming in January.  But as I signed off, a surprise guest  and the giant in the radio industry surprised me.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Is this Laura Ingraham?  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Oh, Rush.  How are you?  </p><p>LIMBAUGH:  Everybody wants to talk to you, and I finally found a way to  worm my way in there.  </p><p>Laura, I've got to tell you something.  I listen to you on the radio, I  want you on TV, and I have to be honest.  Every time I do, I ask myself why  we are not winning even bigger.  You are that good.  You are that  persuasive.  And you are that unique.  </p><p>If anybody and everybody heard you, it would be a slam dunk that they would  agree with you.  I didn't want to let your last show get away here without  showing those sentiments with you.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, Rush, thank you so much.  It means an enormous amount to  me.  It's bittersweet.  I don't want to get too sappy or emotional, but  it's been -- it's a tough -- it's a tough sendoff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

An investigation with Peter Schweizer is ahead.</p><p>And as 2018 comes to a close, we'll bring you the highlights of the worse media offenses of the year. Governor Mike Huckabee, Howie Kurtz break down the videotape. And also tonight, the Christmas police are back. We just have an excuse to use our Christmas police little video thing, which I really love. But how the U.S. Postal Service canceled one family stamp over a claim that the stamp was too religious at Christmas. Why don't you see this? You will not believe it.</p><p>But we begin tonight with this. Donald Trump making a stand for his wall. It's what voters wanted, but leadership stood in his way. Trump is now forcing the hand of Democrats, threatening a shutdown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've made my position very clear. Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to. It is the solemn promise to protect and defend the United States of America, and it is our sacred obligation. We have no choice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Joining me now are two Republicans engaged in this fight. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, he's in charge of wrangling these votes, and Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. Plus Fox's Chief Political Correspondent Ed Henry joins us too. He's been following all the developments.</p><p>Congressman Scalise, let's start with you. You have the votes, but the Senate looks shaky, to say the least. Are we headed for a shutdown tomorrow?</p><p>STEVE SCALISE, HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: First of all, Laura, I think it was a really important day today. When Nancy Pelosi last week was in the Oval Office with the President, Chuck Schumer, and she said, \"Mr. President, you don't have the votes of the House to fund the wall.\"</p><p>And today we've put up a massive vote with a large margin of Republicans that said we're going to stand with this President, we're going to fund the wall. And we just gave him serious leverage in whatever negotiations he's going to have with the Senate. They have to confront this issue knowing we have the President's back in the House.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sean, a lot of my listeners on radio today and then tonight, they're watching, and they're thinking, how are we always in this position? It's the end of the year, no one is rushing to get out of town. Like, no traffic in D.C. Everyone has already gone.</p><p>SEAN DUFFY, REPUBLICAN, WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN: Yep.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Except you guys are there. We're here. But everyone has already gone. And their mind they're gone. And Paul Ryan said, we're going to fight - we're going to have a fight, we're going to have a conversation about the border wall. Two years in the House Majority, two years at Senate Majority, we wait until the end of December to deal with an issue that the American people want dealt with.</p><p>DUFFY: Yes. I mean - first of all, I think we're set up to lose here. We were not set up to win. We should have had this budget fight last week on Friday. We could have--</p><p>INGRAHAM: How about last spring?</p><p>DUFFY: No, but - but still as we come to the end of the year, we could have done it last week, or better yet, we could have even done it this Tuesday where we would have passed a bill that funded the border wall before the Senate acted. But we were going to act it today, Thursday, the 20th of December, right before the end of the year, two weeks before Nancy Pelosi takes over and think that we have leverage. This is idiotic.</p><p>What we should have done, Laura, is we just passed a bill on criminal justice reform. Why did we negotiate criminal justice reform, which Democrats want, which will get no credit for? Why don't we negotiate in exchange for criminal justice reform, give us $5 billion in border security? No one negotiated that deal. So we have--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why--</p><p>DUFFY: --we're probably going to lose.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I mean, until you raise that tonight, we were talking earlier, I've not even thought about that. I mean, the President did not run on criminal justice reform.</p><p>DUFFY: No.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I'm personally glad it passed. I'm going to be really anxious to see how it works out.</p><p>DUFFY: I'm not.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You're not. That's fine. But he isn't getting credit for.</p><p>DUFFY: No.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He won't get credit for it. But if you want to use it, use it in a way that advances the Trump agenda. Ed Henry - hold on. Ed Henry has information now for us about where things stand in the Senate. Ed, I've tweeted earlier. Everyone's going to follow my tweets all throughout the next 48 hours. I said earlier that Mitch McConnell should fight for this wall as hard as he fought for Cavanaugh. And actually, it's probably more important in the long-term survival of the country.</p><p>ED HENRY, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, remember, he only needs 51 votes. I've been talking to Senate Republicans in private. What they are saying is they're hopeful they can get to 51 votes to pass what the House Republican leaders there are talking about, Congressman Scalise and Congressman Duffy as well. But the challenge I'm being told is that you have Republicans like Bob Corker. You mentioned there's not a lot of traffic. Some of them have gone home already. Bob Corker told Fox tonight--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Disgraceful.</p><p>HENRY: --he's retiring from Tennessee. He's already driving home to Tennessee. That's his planning anyway.</p><p>INGRAHAM: A disgrace.</p><p>HENRY: Because--</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's a disgrace.</p><p>HENRY: --they're not planning to stick around. Now, will they be pulled back because of the wall funding? We'll see. But I've talked to sources inside the White House, by the way, who tell me, think about it, put yourself in the shoes of President Trump. He was told that we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. He was told we're going to have wall funding. He was told that we'd eventually get out of Afghanistan and Syria once we defeated ISIS.</p><p>And you go down the list, and a lot of these priorities that he didn't just campaign on in promise, but he actually won on in 2016, he hasn't been able to follow up on. Look at the tariffs. Established Republicans, time and time again, people inside the White House remind me, told the President \"don't do it.\" And Congressman Duffy will be the first to tell you that bud (ph) for President Trump standing up against Canada, the dairy farmers in Congressman Duffy's district--</p><p>DUFFY: Right.</p><p>HENRY: --wouldn't have been helped there in Wisconsin.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. So time and again, the President's instincts on these issues, edges took us through a couple of them. We're spot on. He was pulled back from his instincts by the experts. I think some of them were foreign policy experts that are now thankfully gone or treasury experts. His instincts on this are right. And I want to play something for everybody. You've got to watch Chuck Schumer. They're playing a big game there on Capitol Hill today. This is what he said about the shutdown. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: President Trump is plunging the country into chaos. And he said in front of us he'd be proud to shut down the government. It is nothing to be proud of. The bottom line is simple. The Trump will shut down the government, but it will not get him his wall.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Congressman Scalise, temper tantrum. I don't think so. I mean, he campaigned on (inaudible) on this. He deserves the Republicans to get behind him and also put the Democrats back on their heels. OK. You stay for border security, $5 billion?</p><p>SCALISE: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That - really that's what we're arguing about, $5 billion?</p><p>SCALISE: Laura, this looks like another Schumer shutdown. And think about this. A few years ago, Chuck Schumer voted for a border wall. He's going to have a hard time reconciling that. If you listen to what he's saying, he is making it personal. He doesn't want Donald Trump to get money for the wall because he doesn't want Donald Trump to get to win.</p><p>The American people see Donald Trump fighting for them to secure the border. It's about border security. It's been about this throughout his campaign. He won on this issue as one of the front and center issues. And so now he's actually doing it.</p><p>If Chuck Schumer wants to sit there and say we're going to have a shut down, try to blame somebody else for it. The American people know this is about border security. You're for it or you're against it. We have people in the caravan who are known criminals, they're attacking our border patrol agents at the border. Let's actually stand up for them.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. He says that we're worried about chaos. Oh, it's - spend real-time. Not just the photo ops they do when they go up to the border patrol people and try to usher in migrants - real chaos. The Tijuana government knows what chaos is, Mexico has seen the chaos. The cartels are being enriched by others. Chuck Schumer chaos, that line is so tired and old. I want you to chime in here though because Nancy Pelosi said this earlier today and I got you to respond. Last week--</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: There are no votes in the House, the majority of votes, for a wall, no matter where you start.</p><p>UNKNOWN: That's exactly right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: You proved her wrong?</p><p>DUFFY: I think it is when I checked the vote list. We just passed $5 billion--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. You proved her wrong. Could Schumer be wrong?</p><p>DUFFY: Steve Scalise did a great job counting the votes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You whipped it. Yes. Could Schumer be wrong as well?</p><p>DUFFY: He could be wrong. But - Nancy Pelosi is more concerned about her votes to become the Speaker as opposed to the votes to do what's right for America and secure the border. But think of this, Laura. We have agreement on all the funding but for the $5 billion for the wall. That's the only thing that's holding up funding the government versus shutting the government down.</p><p>But I look at Chuck Schumer out there talking to the American people and Nancy talking to the American people today. Donald Trump has to do an Oval Office address. He has to frame--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: I've said this for a year.</p><p>DUFFY: --and he has to talk about - we have to talk about the families that have lost loved ones to the drug abuse that comes--</p><p>INGRAHAM: One year.</p><p>DUFFY: --off of southern border, meth and - in my community, we've - all our counties don't have money because they're spending so much money for out-of-home placement for kids who've lost their parents because of drug abuse, or the parents who've lost a loved one at the hands of an illegal immigrant. Frame the issue of America.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>DUFFY: Take away the photos of the kids at the border with the (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Personalize it. We don't - they personalize it. They say the death of a seven-year-old girl is on your shoulders--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUFFY: On average, every single day, we stop 10 known or suspected terrorists from coming into America. Last year alone, our ICE agents, who are in the middle of this too, saved over 900 kids from human trafficking. Those are real kids who are safe today because of what we're doing to secure our border. Who knows how many got in that we didn't catch. So, thank, God, we have President Trump fighting to secure the border.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, he has to give an--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUFFY: That's what this fight is going to be about. Him having an address (ph) would be great.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sean is absolutely right. I've begged him to do this for a year, on air. I'd say this is the most important issue for the American people today. It's the government and immigration. Those two issues are the top of the list for the people. The government, meaning, working against the people and immigration. That's it. Got to address the country on this.</p><p>DUFFY: And this is the--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Not tweets. Address the country, lay it out. I'm sorry, I know I'm going to reign (ph) on this, but it's really important. I want to get to some other big news of the day, the Mattis resignation, because by the reaction in the hours following, you would have thought that we just decided on an imprudent ground invasion into a foreign land. For instance, here was Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: Everything that indicates stability, everything that indicates strength, everything that indicates knowledge is leaving this administration. General Kelly, General Mattis, so many others--</p><p>UNKNOWN: McMaster.</p><p>SCHUMER: McMaster, exactly. There is chaos now in this administration.</p><p>PELOSI&gt; I am shaken by the resignation of General Mattis for what it means to our country, for the message it sends to our troops, and for the indication of what his view is of the Commander in Chief.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Here's a message that sends to our troops you're coming home. OK. That's a message that sends to your troops. The days of Bush interventionism is over. That's where the President ran. And Obama went through four secretaries of defense. I do not remember the freak-out. And I thought Pelosi and company were for pulling troops back--</p><p>HENRY: Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: --once we actually have victory. Now they're the interventionists. I'm really confused--</p><p>HENRY: Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: --about where they are.</p><p>HENRY: When the President is for something they've been for a long time--</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's unbelievable.</p><p>HENRY: --they don't want to admit it, on trade and other issues as well. I think you made a really important point a moment ago about Senator Schumer as well, in pushing the chaos narrative. It's sort of like every time there's development in the Mueller investigation, we here \"The walls are closing in, this is it.\"</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>HENRY: And then it's sort of fizzles out. Here's the bottom line though. I don't think you can sugarcoat the fact that Mattis leaving is a big development because his letter was pretty blistering in terms of his differences with the President on Syria, for example.</p><p>Here's my bigger point. Watch what Lindsey Graham is saying tonight. He has been an ally to the President, as you know, in recent days on a whole range of issues, and he's warning, don't make the same mistake that Barack Obama made in terms of pulling out of Iraq that you could have a terrorist safe- haven in Afghanistan. But I also hear your point, Laura, which is - it gets back to what he said at the top. The President campaigned directly in 2016, not just on repeal and replace, in trade--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>HENRY: --and the tariffs. But he also said, we're not the world's policeman. He was honest about that in terms of Syria and Afghanistan, which is now by the way the longest war ever. It just - right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: 17 years. We still have men and women--</p><p>HENRY: And so he campaigned in one on that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Guys, everyone has to re-frame (ph). OK? It's because we're watching Schumer with his glasses down on the end of his nose, where something (ph) is really serious about this. OK? But remember what Donald Trump campaigned on. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're getting out of the nation-building business. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge.</p><p>We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive.</p><p>I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policeman of the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: He won in part on a non-interventionist platform. Obama beat Bush on a non-interventionist platform. It had been like Adam Kinzinger run around town acting like - it's like 2003 all over again.</p><p>Steve Scalise, Mattis has a different point of view than the President on this? Well, that's why Donald Trump is elected President. If Mattis wants to run for President, go run for President. I found that letter to be surprising coming from him--</p><p>SCALISE: Ultimately--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --and a little dismissive. I didn't like it.</p><p>SCALISE: Ultimately, you only have one Commander in Chief. And look, the President and Secretary of State Tillerson had some differences on foreign policy, and so Rex Tillerson left. Mike Pompeo came in. and he's doing a great job representing our country and the President. He'll find somebody else to serve in this role. It's an important role. Secretary Mattis did a great job of helping (inaudible) ISIS, and they're not going all the way--</p><p>INGRAHAM: They want to stay.</p><p>SCALISE: --but he did a great job--</p><p>INGRAHAM: They don't want to leave.</p><p>SCALISE: But he's--</p><p>INGRAHAM: But when we go, they don't want--</p><p>SCALISE: He's going to be able to find another general who's going to be able to--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>SCALISE: --serve this country well as his defense secretary.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The line is always, if we leave, chaos will ensue, which means we can never leave, because we're in these countries that are by their very constitution very chaotic.</p><p>DUFFY: There is a life footprint there. 2,000 troops not engaged in battle but give you more advice to the--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why we're there? What is it a national security interest--?</p><p>DUFFY: Because I think if we leave, I think - or you can--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK. So we're going to be there for everywhere. And let's take a poll--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUFFY: But what--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --American people right now.</p><p>DUFFY: But what happens with Russia? What happens with Iran? I mean--</p><p>INGRAHAM: What happened to Russia? Economy is smaller than France's. Right. What are - what are we worried about Russia for?</p><p>DUFFY: Did you see the territory to them? Do you see the territory to Iran who wants to kill the big Satan America or the little Satan Israel? I think that's a mistake.</p><p>INGRAHAM: How much money did China spend in Iraq and Afghanistan?</p><p>DUFFY: Yes. I don't know.</p><p>INGRAHAM: None.</p><p>DUFFY: Probably none. Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. And we're $20 trillion on that.</p><p>DUFFY: But are at the point that the President is the Commander in Chief. He gets to call the ball and he has - he deserves a staff around and that supports him.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>DUFFY: So--</p><p>INGRAHAM: It seemed unnecessarily petty of an American hero, Mattis. And I thought that was surprising.</p><p>DUFFY: But you know what? I think that we have the right to disagree. And in our party--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>DUFFY: --we don't all fall in line. We can have different--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>DUFFY: --opinions and we can debate it and we can agree (inaudible) President--</p><p>INGRAHAM: We'll see if Bush-ism works in 2020.</p><p>SCALISE: Yes, we'll see.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We're going to see if we can go back to Bush-ism, and that's going to sell the American people--</p><p>DUFFY: No, no, we don't want to go to--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. We're going to see if that--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCALISE: President Trump is rebuilding our military, and that's something he campaigned on.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. He's not squandering-</p><p>SCALISE: He's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: --the military either.</p><p>SCALISE: --on that promise as well.</p><p>DUFFY: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, he's not squandering the military.</p><p>Guys, thank you so much.</p><p>SCALISE: All right. Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And I want to get to a tragic but important story outside of Washington. It relates to what we're talking about. And we have to tie this all together for the American people. A community ravaged by the lack of action on the part of our government and local government, state government, who just turned their backs on them. What are we talking about?</p><p>Visalia, California, it sits between LA and San Francisco. And in that town, over the course of two heroin days earlier this week, Gustavo Garcia, he's a man twice removed from this country, went on what authorities call a reign of terror. It's a 24-hour shooting spree, killing at least two and injuring many more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN (voice-over): Deputies taking gunfire from this man, 36-year-old Gustavo Garcia. It all went down on Road 140 and Avenue 256 early Monday morning. You can hear the officer reloading his gun as the bullets ring out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, while the circumstances of this are tragic on their own, the run-up to it is even more so. Two days before this reign of terror, he was arrested by the Tulare County Sheriff's deputies for being under the influence of a controlled substance. He was held in the county jail for about 10 hours before being released even though ICE officials had issued an immigration-hold on him. You see this arrest wasn't Garcia's first rush of the law. He has a violent criminal past.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN (voice-over): Immigration and Customs Enforcement tells FOX 26 News, Garcia had been deported twice. In the past, the Sheriff's office could have alerted immigration because of Garcia's extensive rap sheet, which includes armed robbery more than 15 years ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, you might be asking yourself, why did the cops let him go despite the ICE hold, especially given his past? So, was it the police's fault?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN (voice-over): ICE did follow a detainer as soon as it learned of Garcia's arrest Friday. And this would be enough to keep him in custody in other states. But Sheriff Boudreaux says his office no longer recognizes those detainers and it can't reach out to ICE for misdemeanor crimes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: So Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said, \"Before SB 54,\" which is the Sanctuary State Bill, \"Gustavo Garcia would have been turned over to ICE officials. That's how we've always done it. After SB 54, though, we no longer have the power to do that.\"</p><p>We should know the Tulare County Board of Supervisors voted to adopt a resolution opposing California sanctuary state law in May of this year. And even though it's kind of symbolic, it does show a citizenry standing up for common sense.</p><p>Joining me now is Tulare County Sheriff, Mike Boudreaux. Sheriff, I know our viewers across the country are watching this and are shaking their heads going, how would - how can this happen in the United States of America? Will we emote morning, noon and night about the tragic circumstances of people who are trying to come into the country? And I get it. They're tragic circumstances. It's tough. But yet, the politicians - did you get a call from Pelosi? Did you get a call from Gavin Newsom? Any other officials in California concerned about what's happening there?</p><p>MIKE BOUDREAUX, TULARE COUNTY SHERIFF: You know, the only phone call that I got was from the ACLU demonizing the actions that we took, which is really unfortunate. Tulare County is how it's pronounced actually, but--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sorry.</p><p>BOUDREAUX: --in Tulare County, we are - that's fine - we're an agricultural community. We produce multi-billion dollars worth of agriculture that's sent all over the world. And we have a large undocumented community. But we also have a large group of people who don't commit these types of crimes on a daily basis.</p><p>I think what our focus is on is the criminal. The criminal element that ends up in my jail that I no longer have the tools to reach out to ICE, my counterpart, my law enforcement partners, and I'm no longer able to recognize the detainer through the sanctuary state law as well as the Ninth Court Circuit indicating that the detainers don't meet due process. So, because of those two combined efforts, we no longer can telephone ICE and even ask the question why is this detainer placed nor can we recognize the detainer itself. And I think--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Can you--</p><p>BOUDREAUX: --that I need to--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Wait, wait. Hold on.</p><p>BOUDREAUX: --make myself very clear is that-</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sheriff, Sheriff, Sheriff, hold on, hold on. Can you give a heads up--</p><p>BOUDREAUX: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: --to ICE? Can you give them a heads up?</p><p>BOUDREAUX: I'm sorry?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Can you give them a heads up? Can you call and say, we're about to release this individual or we have this individual in custody even if they can't come and interview him or examine him? Is there any notification at all you could give to ICE?</p><p>BOUDREAUX: We're not allowed to - we're not allowed to talk to our counterparts under these laws--</p><p>INGRAHAM: What is the conservative lawsuit against this?</p><p>BOUDREAUX: --especially with--</p><p>INGRAHAM: This is just an outrage. Hold on. I got to play something for you, Sheriff. This was Nancy Pelosi's claim about what sanctuary policies actually accomplish. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PELOSI: Our City of San Francisco is a sanctuary city. And we see it as a place where it makes us safer. It makes us safer because people can go to school, they can get driver's license, they can be witnesses against other violence that they see in the community.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Is your community feeling safer tonight?</p><p>BOUDREAUX: They're not feeling safer. But I will say that we don't - we're not against our undocumented community. We're not against immigrants. We don't - we're not against Dreamers or DACA. And I think that it needs to be very clear our community as a whole - even our undocumented community - I sat with a large group of people, and they're not afraid of their law enforcement. They're not even afraid-</p><p>INGRAHAM: So that's a lie?</p><p>BOUDREAUX: --of being deported. What they're--</p><p>INGRAHAM: So that's a lie, Sheriff. That argument that I hear parroted to me morning, noon and night, every time we deal with one of these sanctuary policy cases. We did this in New Jersey a couple of weeks ago. The advocate that came on said, \"Oh, no, we're not going to have immigrants cooperating with authorities. We're not going to show up and testify in cases.\" That's just bunk. But this is the--</p><p>BOUDREAUX: That is bunk.</p><p>INGRAHAM: --the parroted line. So you don't see that at all in your community?</p><p>BOUDREAUX: Yes. That's not true. We don't see that. We see our community reaching out to us. What they're afraid of? What they're afraid of is that the criminal will return to their community because we can't report them to ICE.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. And commit domestic violence, rape, burglary, robbery, other offenses against property and people.</p><p>Sheriff, thank you for the heads up and for speaking out on what we are going to be following all throughout the next year because so many people won't do it. We're going to do it.</p><p>All right. Coming up, when our leaders fail, Americans begin to take action into their own hands in a good way. An Air Force veteran and triple amputee is finding his own way to pay for the border wall. He's going to tell us about it, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, this really is a story about America's quintessential can-do attitude. Whether their leaders fail them, our citizens take matters into their own hands. I know Brian Kolfage is a triple amputee Air Force vet who started the GoFundMe page for the wall - \"the wall\" that the politicians don't want to fund, and he started this just three days ago. In that short time, he has already raised more than $9.7 million. Now, here to tell us why he did this, what he hopes to achieve is Brian himself.</p><p>All right, Brian. Now, the critics will say that this is just a publicity stunt. It's not going to even make a dent in the total cost, which should be at least around $20 billion. I'm not great at math, but that's a pretty - that's a pretty tough hill to climb. So what do you say to those critics?</p><p>BRIAN KOLFAGE, VET RAISING MONEY FOR BORDER WALL: I'd say they're full of crap. And this is the United States and we can do anything we want. And if people want to donate to that wall and give their money, they can do it. I mean, what's 80 bucks for 60 million people. The common person can give that kind of money.</p><p>And this is not just about Republicans and conservatives. There is outpouring of Democrats that are messaging me and giving to this wall fund. It's from both sides of the aisle, but you don't hear the liberal media saying that. This is America coming together. They want the wall, and they're putting their money where their mouth is and they're funding it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You've had some run-ins before with Facebook, I know, on blocking various accounts you've had, even a military beer business you had that gave 10 percent of your profits to military charities.</p><p>You're a triple amputee Air Force veteran. And yet Facebook has had like kind of an aggressive attitude towards you. I know you've had counsel trying to fight them on this. Are you seeing any resistance to your postings? I've got a lot on my Facebook page. And I've sent them out to my friends. But are you getting any resistance at all in the social media community?</p><p>KOLFAGE: Well, I'm - I'm not allowed on Facebook anymore. My company, military grade coffee company was outright banned. And Facebook executives told me I'm not allowed to do use it. And they threatened my wife they'd delete her account if they catch me on Facebook. So I don't use Facebook anymore. I've gone to Twitter and that's where people can find me.</p><p>And it just - it's ridiculous the way that these companies treat people. And Americans are just pissed off. They're pissed off in general and they're mad with the way politics and politicians are handling things and big tech and - it just - it's a lot of problems that are bubbling up right now. And it's just a culmination of things. And everyone is - Americans are just not happy.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, why - why the wall? Why is this an issue for you?</p><p>KOLFAGE: Well - I mean, the wall is an important thing for me. I feel it's near and dear to my heart. And it was a promise that was made to the Americans. And this is a very important part of our nation, our country. We need security. We're a nation of laws. We need to enforce these laws. We can't have people coming across our border who are unchecked that don't know who they are.</p><p>I mean, we can have another terrorist attack tomorrow. It doesn't take many people to stage an attack. We need to know who's coming across that border and we need to keep it in check. And this - like I said, this wall is in our constitution. We need to have the wall, and the Americans want the wall.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Wait. What do you mean the wall is in our constitution? Where in the constitution?</p><p>KOLFAGE: Well, it just - it's part of our nation. It's part of our lives.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I mean, you're talking about--</p><p>KOLFAGE: We are a nation--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --our sovereignty. Our sovereignty.</p><p>KOLFAGE: Yes, sovereignty.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right. Yes--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KOLFAGE: We're a nation of walls. And--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --the wall itself is not in the constitution--</p><p>KOLFAGE: The Trump wall is not in the constitution.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. But the--</p><p>KOLFAGE: Let's clarify that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. I get what your point is. He made the promise.</p><p>KOLFAGE: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And if that wall doesn't get built, it's hard to see - it's hard to see Trump winning in 2020. I'm just going to - I know people like hearing that. But if this wall doesn't get built, I think it's going to demoralize a lot of people. We're going to have more problems. We got to get the same built.</p><p>But Mikel Jollett - I don't know who this person is, but it's some singer I guess a lot of people follow - was hitting you pretty hard on Twitter saying the following. \"Right now in America people are donating money they don't have to build a wall they don't need to solve a problem that doesn't exist.\" And I guess the band, airborne toxic effect, basically saying you're bad at math because it would take till 2086 - yes, you're racist, bad at math. I mean, there's no real substantive argument against why a wall may or may not work. But I'm sure you're getting - get a lot of that.</p><p>KOLFAGE: Maybe that's just the liberal tactics in the liberal media. They're going to come out and attack my family. And they can go ahead and do what they want, but we are not stopping. We are going to keep on pushing through. No matter what Congress does, if they pass this through, we're not stopping. We're going to keep pushing this through. We're going to see what the Senate does. We're going to see how this plays out. And Americans aren't happy and they're going to keep giving to this GoFundMe, and we're going to keep pushing it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's $9.7 million, it's one of the top GoFundMe efforts in just three days in the United States for the whole year. Brian, we're going to following this. Thank you for your service to this country. You suffered greatly for our freedom and you continue to inspire so many people. Thank you so much. We really appreciate it. And merry Christmas to your family.</p><p>Now on to some troubling revelations inside a Florida court. Documents filed yesterday show us the publication \"Buzzfeed\" was sued after they published the bogus dossier on President Trump. But they won in court. But that's not actually the interesting part of the story. Inside the filing were revelations about certain Republicans that will shock a lot of you.</p><p>First, a longtime associate of the late Republican from Arizona Senator John McCain initially provided a copy of that infamous Steele dossier to \"Buzzfeed\" in the first place. And second, a Paul Ryan aide and Congressman Adam Kinzinger were given an early look at the dossier before others even became aware of it.</p><p>Here now is Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. So Peter, why does this not surprise me, that when someone is trying to shop an anti-Trump document as salacious and as ridiculous as that was, they went to two big-time neoconservatives who are diametrically opposed to Trump on things like the wall, speaking of the wall, his noninterventionist philosophy and his economic nationalism, go down the line. McCain and Kinzinger, and I guess Paul Ryan had some access to it as well.</p><p>PETER SCHWEIZER, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE: Yes, you're right, Laura. This speaks to something profound about Washington's political culture. Think about this for a second. If McCain's office or Ryan's office had been given a salacious, unverified dossier about one of their colleagues, do you think they would have been leaking it around to the press corps? I really doubt it.</p><p>This speaks to the fact that Donald Trump is a disruptor. There is a deep cultural clash between him and the Washington establishment. And it speaks to the fact that they do not like the fact that he is disrupting the way things are done in Washington, D.C., the same way that on the political left Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman-elect Ocasio-Cortez is doing on the left of the political spectrum.</p><p>And I think it speaks to the fact that, what Donald Trump represents, it's those policies you talked about, but it's about changing the dynamics of how Washington works. And they do not like it and they want to stop it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They want the status quo. Let's face it, a lot of people make a lot of money. Regular folks out there, they see what people make as lobbyists or consultants, and these are people who haven't won elections in a decade. And yet they still make tens of millions of dollars with ad buys and ad design and placement and consulting contracts. So they like the status quo.</p><p>Trump comes in like a wrecking ball and says this whole town stinks to high heaven, and it makes them really nervous. They are freaking out about this Syria withdrawal. I bet most Americans don't even know we are in Syria, because they're thinking, wait a second, don't we have problems in Cincinnati to deal with, but we're in Syria with 2,000 after we've already decimated ISIS.</p><p>So I think he has held up a mirror to the corruption in Washington, and they don't like what they are seeing. So it has got to be Trump is the problem and Trump is the corrupt one.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Right, exactly. And consider just something like deregulation. Everybody thinks it's great because it frees up American businesses, makes them more competitive. But it costs a lot of people in Washington, D.C., money. Here's why. The reason why regulations, whether it's environmental or financial, are so complicated and complex is they are designed that way, because you've got an entire industry in Washington, D.C., that is interpreting rules and laws that nobody else understands.</p><p>If you come in and say, you know what, we are getting rid of these thousands of pages of regulations, now suddenly that is a huge revenue stream for Washington consultants that's gone. That's just one of the ways in which the swamp is being changed in Washington, D.C.</p><p>So what I say to people is agree with Trump on certain policies or not, there is no disputing the fact that he is a disruptor. We love disruptors in Silicon Valley, we like them in the entertainment business. I think it's good to have them in American politics too, because it's become calcified. It's the wealthiest city in the United States today is Washington D.C. That's a huge problem.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's a problem when there are as many cranes, we always talk about the measure of the corruption are the number of cranes in any given neighborhood in Washington D.C. It is wild. But yes, they like the status quo. Keep the money spending even if we don't have it.</p><p>Peter Schweizer, have a great holiday, a merry Christmas, and all that jazz. We'll see you in the new year.</p><p>And up next, this is a fun one. OK, what where the worst media moments of 2018? Will I make any of those? I hope not. Governor Mike Huckabee and Howie Kurtz take us through the video and the most embarrassing moments when we get back.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, 2018 is coming to a close, can you believe it? So we thought, what better time than to highlight a few of the media lowlights from the past year. And our friends at Grabien helped us out here, too. My old producer Tom Elliott does a great job there. Here with me now to take us through the tape, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, host of \"Media Buzz\" also right here on FOX, Howie Kurtz. All right, gents, I want to first start with the media's once warm embrace of a man who is now not on the top of the invite list. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti joins us live now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joining me now is Stormy Daniels' attorney Michael Avenatti.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Michael Avenatti is with us now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Michael Avenatti joins us now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And joining me now from Los Angeles is Michael Avenatti.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: We want more of the spooning comments that they made toward Avenatti, Howie.</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST: He was hard to book.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He was the belle of the ball, though, until he wasn't. So should the media have seen this coming with the meltdown of Avenatti?</p><p>KURTZ: The degree to which CNN and MSNBC put this guy on sometimes several times a day to peddle his unsubstantiated claims and develop his presidential delusions was really something. But the worst by far was putting on Avenatti on to make the claims of Julie Swetnick to vouch for this woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of beginning a bunch of gang rapes - -</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's what I want to see. That's a scene I want to see.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes, go to that videotape.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It will tell us more -- in the introductions, we want to see, it's like, really, tell us more about all this unsubstantiated garbage. That should go down as one of the biggest blackeyes of this media over the last 12 months. Disgusting.</p><p>And are we going to the next one, now? All right, Huck wants to describe this as well. Governor, I think Michael Avenatti is just one of those figures who will occasionally pop up like if they have a celebrity Hollywood Squares maybe, he will be the lower right square or something. But I don't see of Avenatti playing much of a role in public life in the future.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: I think his history is up like a rock, down like a rock, back under the rock from whence he crawled. That's the end of the story for Michael Avenatti, I'm pretty sure.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Number two on our list involves some actual dumpster diving as journalists attempt to find some dirt, literally, tying President Trump to Russia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Quickly, you looked through the trash there? What did you find?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we did. We came here expecting this office to be empty. But in fact, all day here, we've been here throughout the course of the day, people have been going in and out. We went through the trash to see what could find because we saw people dumping rubbish there. New computers, new computers are being delivered here, and they're throwing away the rubbish.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Somehow the accent makes it all the more interesting.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes, right. Here we are with the rubbish. Let's inspect the rubbish. Not that big of a deal, but it kind of smells.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Literally and figuratively.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: But governor, again, this just tells you how low they can go. Going through the garbage now? I guess you could do that, but, for what? What'd they get?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I thought they were doing a tour of their newsroom, because that's what you typically see with a lot of these networks. Anything, anything, and that does show that if you are willing to go through people's trash hoping to get something negative on conservatives, you're pretty desperate. And this is a media that is pretty desperate, there's no doubt about it. That was hilarious.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Howie, what's the rating for the media now? That approval rating usually hovers around 20 percent or something, whether people respect them?</p><p>HUCKABEE: It may be up to 30. But basically --</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's up to 30 now. Wow, that's actually pretty good.</p><p>HUCKABEE: No, Howie.</p><p>KURTZ: This is not my rating. I'm tell you how it shows up --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Gov, what are you -- hey, governor, we have to check this. Do that Google search, Raymond. Is it really 30 percent?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I've just got to tell you, Howie, the flu is more popular than the media right now.</p><p>KURTZ: While it is on a downward spiral, and some of these examples show why people don't trust the press.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Let's move on to number three, where some CNN hosts did their best to test the limits of the FCC.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's the craziest -- I've ever heard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- hole countries.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- hole countries.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These countries are -- holes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I couldn't give a -- about them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've definitely been --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You -- and slant eyes. I called you a -- and a -- and a wetback.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I didn't say the n-word.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You are offended when I saw --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, that's a lot of --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Did you wear out the beeper there?</p><p>INGRAHAM: I don't even know how you do those edits on that stuff. Governor, let's start with you. The swear-fest, I guess it's people are more authentic, living their truth. I love that phrase, we're living our truth. I didn't like it when our previous guest who was a war hero and a triple amputee, and I adore him -- I don't like it when people use p-i-s-s- e-d on air. I know that sounds old-fashioned but, I know we all swear. Maybe not the governor, but we all swear, but we want to not on TV as much if we can possibly not.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I don't know if you know this or not, but they quit serving sandwiches in the CNN cafeteria and now they just sell soap for people to eat that because they've gotten so potty-mouthed over there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HUCKABEE: So it's a steady diet.</p><p>INGRAHAM: What are the rules.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Every brand of soap.</p><p>KURTZ: In one interview, CNN anchor Fareed Zakaria called Trump a b-ser, using the full word, four different times. It just goes to show that when you're talking about Donald Trump, the standards go out the window, there's a complete double standard. You can get down and dirty and curse all you want because somehow that's OK.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We have an anchors on other networks saying he's a racist. Just like he's a racist, he's a liar, he's a racist, he's a liar.</p><p>KURTZ: He's a blanking racist.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's a blanking racist. But it just -- it shows you, both governor and Howie, it shows you -- and I hate that Trump derangement syndrome has become such a cliche, but something is burrowed deep into the psyche of people that they are not even able to have friendships with people with whom they disagree, the tolerant set. And you see this in media figures. People who I have been friends with in other media outlets for years, not all of them -- I used to like Don Lemon. Don Lemon used to come on my radio show, we were joking earlier, I used to have people like Frank Rich on my radio, John Kerry. We could disagree, but now there's so -- it's burrowed in anger and resentment and upset.</p><p>KURTZ: You can't even fraternize.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You can't even have a conversation. You are a horrible, awful rotten person if you ever said anything nice about Donald Trump, and it's oozing out of their pores, which is very strange.</p><p>All right, the last one on our list to someone I just mentioned. CNN's Don Lemon describing the biggest terror threat facing our country right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right. And we have to start doing something about them. There is no travel ban on them. There is no ban on -- they had the Muslim ban. There is no white guy ban. So what do we do about that?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Governor Huckabee, you are one of those aforementioned white men.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes, what do we do? What do we do? I'm guilty as charged. I am an American white man. And I don't know what Don Lemon is going to do. What is he going to do, deport me? To where? I'm an American born citizen. What is he going to do, arrest me? For what? I think differently than him. This is America. This is really the heighth of it.</p><p>But I have got to tell you, Laura, it's not just what he says. It's that tone where he is attempting so diligently to sound authoritative that I found beyond amusing. And these guys who sit and they pontificate night after night with such a tone of seriousness as if they are personally saving this great republic --</p><p>INGRAHAM: They're pained. But they're very pained -- I'm pain to have to say this. I regret having to say this.</p><p>Howie, before we go, remember this ad from CNN?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a whole bunch of bananas. Somewhere buried within it is an apple. Some people might try to tell you that there is no point in looking for it, but there's only one way to know what has been covered up. You start digging.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Move over James Earl Jones. I like James Earl Jones better, this is CNN. This is CNN, don't slip on the banana peel.</p><p>KURTZ: It's a kind of a fruitcake ad. But there is a certain self- righteousness that has creeped into a lot of media self-promotion. \"The Washington Post,\" democracy dies in the darkness.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Democracy dies in the darkness.</p><p>KURTZ: Somehow democracy wasn't in danger when Barack Obama was president.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Thank you, Jeff Bezos. Small business might die in the face of amazon.</p><p>KURTZ: I'm all for self-promotion, but let's keep it real.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Still to come -- both of you, thank you so much -- a message from Rush Limbaugh on my last radio show today. Plus, the Christmas police is back. That's next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The Christmas police are back and coming for your mail.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>INGRAHAM: We love that little stager. Tavia Hunt, wife of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, was getting into the holiday spirit and writing on her Christmas cards like a lot of you do. She ordered this photo on a customizable stamp, and you can see her family, beautiful family, standing right there in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, where I have been many times. It's a beautiful picture.</p><p>The United States post office didn't think so. Soon after she placed the order, Tavia was told by Stamps.com that the U.S. Postal Service guidelines dictate that all religious content is forbidden.</p><p>Joining me now is Hiram Sasser, attorney for Tavia Hunt. Tavia is not feeling well tonight. But Hiram, where does the stand now? First of all, when is the last time a religious service of any great number in attendance was held at Saint Basil's Cathedral? I think it's been quite a long time. It's a museum now.</p><p>HIRAM SASSER, TAVIA HUNT'S ATTORNEY: It certainly has been a long time, but that's the problem with these postal regulations is that they are so broad in prohibiting anything religious at all that they would encompass something such as just a cathedral in the background even though it's not even being used as a cathedral anymore.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But what I don't understand is under what constitutional norm or statutory norm are they operating? This is not establishing a state religion, even by the most amorphous, squishiest of tests, most ambiguous of tests, that the Supreme Court established. It seems like it falls squarely within one's free expression rights under the First Amendment. So, I don't get it. You can probably show a picture of someone at Hooters and that's OK, but you can't be a little cathedral in the background, I don't even understand the argument.</p><p>SASSER: You can. But you can read all the facts and the interaction at our website at FirstLiberty.org. But here's what's interesting about this, is that the postal service prints religious stamps. They are just saying that you are not allowed to. They just passed a regulation that went into effect in May of 2018 saying nothing religious can be on a customized stamp. And the postal service even responded to us today, and they said, look, you just can't have anything religious on a customized stamp. But we'll sell you our religious stamps, but you can't have one.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, first of all, the Madonna stamp is always sold out. Every time I try to buy them for Christmas cards, they are like, we have a rainbow, we have this and that. They have beautiful stamps but not the one I happen to want. OK, I like that one.</p><p>Listen to the USPS policy on customized postage. \"Acceptable images or text may not contain content that is unsuitable for all ages and audiences, including any depiction of political, religious, violent or sexual content.\" How is religious lumped in with violent and sexual content?</p><p>SASSER: Religion, I guess, is the new pornography for the postal service. That's why we're trying to get to the bottom of it. Here's what great about the postal service, though. They don't have to go through a real complicated rule making process like other agencies. They can change this tomorrow if they want to.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, it's going to be changed. This is lunacy. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. This has got to be done away with. Thanks so much.</p><p>And a radio legend helped me signoff my last radio show today. You don't want to miss it. Last Bite, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's time for the Last Bite. After 17 years on the radio, I left the airwaves today. I know liberals are celebrating. Don't worry, the podcast is coming in January. But as I signed off, a surprise guest and the giant in the radio industry surprised me. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Is this Laura Ingraham?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh, Rush. How are you?</p><p>LIMBAUGH: Everybody wants to talk to you, and I finally found a way to worm my way in there.</p><p>Laura, I've got to tell you something. I listen to you on the radio, I want you on TV, and I have to be honest. Every time I do, I ask myself why we are not winning even bigger. You are that good. You are that persuasive. And you are that unique.</p><p>If anybody and everybody heard you, it would be a slam dunk that they would agree with you. I didn't want to let your last show get away here without showing those sentiments with you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, Rush, thank you so much. It means an enormous amount to me. It's bittersweet. I don't want to get too sappy or emotional, but it's been -- it's a tough -- it's a tough sendoff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

However, while there is no agreement to measure this magnitude, the percentages of study influence that both parties handle (the use of targeted ads to benefit Trump in the last presidential election Democrats and the Google Search Engine Manipulation Effect that Republicans argue) give it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a degree of influence that lies over 10% of total</emphasis>votes.<br/>\"If the Internet is considered an egalitarian platform but most of Twitter is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a liberal poison well</emphasis> (liberal is synonymous with progressive in this context) what the president seeks is at least a little justice in the system,\" said a spokesman from the White House to Politician. \"We think <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">that social media plays a vital role within our culture</emphasis> that has helped them become increasingly profitable,\" the source added.<br/>The existence of this draft has leaked a day after President Trump accused Google of harming him in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the upcoming presidential election in 2020.</emphasis><br/>The president's warnings came a day after he met at the White House with Google CEO <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sundar Pichai</emphasis>as part of a summit of social media meetings.<br/>\"[Google argues] that it does not intend to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">illegally sabotage the 2020 presidential election</emphasis> even though everything he said was going in the opposite direction,\" the representative said on his Twitter account.<br/>The president supports his accusations on a Fox News show in which a former Google engineer claimed <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">that the Internet giant wants to \"make sure Trump loses in 2020.\"</emphasis><br/>An information the president claimed to \"be watching Google very closely.\"<br/>The strong <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">pro-Democratic</emphasis> political bias within Silicon Valley's big business is well known in the United States. It is a good proof that the Democratic party received 90% of the money donated by staff by the big Silicon Valley companies in the political cycle from 2004 to 2018.<br/>An abysmal dispute that multinationals, however, seek to camouflage through official donations from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the Political Action Committees</emphasis> - ephemeral organizations created by companies to channel political donations during the election periods - in which money is usually distributed to 50%.<br/>However, taking into account thetotal of the money donated to both parties the ratio is 9 to 1 in favor of the Democrats.<br/>For example,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Google gave $16.3 million to Democrats</emphasis> versus $1.7 million to Republicans. In the case of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon it was 6.7 million compared to $732,000.</emphasis>Apple, meanwhile, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">delivered $5.7 million to $578,000.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook $3.9 million versus $580,000.</emphasis> Finally, in the case of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix it was 3.7 million compared to $75,000.</emphasis><br/>Disparate figures that have long caused a loud alarm among representatives and supporters of the Republican Party in the United States.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8021440</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS6-NM61-JBJN-M3JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 8, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Its founder Mark Zuckerberg told CNBC he did not want to be an 'arbiter of truth,' and criticized Twitter's Jack Dorsey for the factchecks. Google share were also up. It has not passed comment on the row.The draft version of the order suggests that Trump will order the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to clarify how to enforce regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.That is the federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for users' posts.But the draft order says that the protection should not apply if companies are 'engaged in editorial conduct' - meaning making a judgment for themselves about how people's points of view are presented.That is what Trump accuses Twitter of doing by fact-checking him, and what conservatives claim happens to their posts which are promoted less than those with more liberal viewpoints. </p><p>Such a move could open up Twitter, Facebook and other platforms to an avalanche of lawsuits from people claiming their views have been unfairly censored. It also requires the agency to look at whether social media platforms are using 'deceptive' policies to moderate content by not openly declaring how they decide how viewpoints are dealt with.Trump is also expected to set up a mechanism allowing Americans to report alleged political censorship or bias by the social media giants which will be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.The White House tech bias reporting tool will collect complaints of online censorship and submit them to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC will then be required to 'consider taking action', examine whether complaints violate the law, draw up a report describing such complaints and make the report publicly available. The White House launched a similar tool last year but it is now closed.The draft order says it received 16,000 responses of alleged bias and suggests that they will form part of the Federal Trade Commission's investigation. Anti-conservative bias claims on social media  Facebook internal report admitted bias Facebook last year opened itself to an independent investigation of anti-conservative bias after repeated criticism from Trump.The audit, carried out by former Republican Senator Jon Kyl and others, found that the tech giant was still some way off eliminating its bias.It concluded that Facebook's efforts to counter fake news had silenced conservative voices. One example, was that fact-checking sites used by the social media giant were inherently left-leaning.In addition, it found that Facebook's ads policy could have restricted anti-abortion advocacy. Kyl's report said: 'Facebook has recognized the importance of our assessment and has taken some steps to address the concerns we uncovered. But there is still significant work to be done to satisfy the concerns we heard from conservatives.'Don Jr. claimed to be hit by 'Shadow banning'A series of high-profile pro-Trump figures have claimed that Twitter and Instagram have made it harder to find their accounts or individual posts.Among those making the claim have been Donald Trump Jr., and Mark Meadows, at the time a congressman and now Trump's White House chief of staff, and Jim Jordan, a prominent Trump defender.Trump Jr. made the claim in his book, Triggered.Twitter has denied that it was involved in such a practice but did update its algorithm when the controversy erupted in July 2016. Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - has said it does not alter the prominence of posts for political reasons.James Woods is banned from Twitter The conservative actor and prominent tweeter was locked out of his account in May 2019 for tweeting: ''If you try to kill the King, you best not miss'#HangThemAll.'Candace Owens suspended by Twitter after criticizing lockdownConservative commentator Candace Owens tweeted earlier this month: 'Apparently @GovWhitmer believes she is a duly elected dictator of a socialist country. The people of Michigan need to stand up to her. Open your businesses. Go to work. The police think she's crazy too. They are not going to arrest 10,000,000 people for going to work.'A Twitter spokesman confirmed that Owens' tweet violated its Covid-19 fake news policy. Twitter said the tweet would be deleted and Owens would serve a 'timeout' before being allowed to log back on. Google accused of censorship of views on abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism on its YouTube platformIn February, Google persuaded a federal appeals court on Wednesday to reject claims that YouTube illegally censored Prager University, a conservative nonprofit run by radio talk show host Dennis Prager.PragerU claimed that YouTube's opposition to its political views led it to tag dozens of videos on such topics as abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism for its 'Restricted Mode' setting, and block third parties from advertising on the videos.Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said YouTube was a private forum despite its 'ubiquity' and public accessibility, and hosting videos did not make it a 'state actor' for purposes of the First Amendment.Clinton scourge Tulsi Gabbard sues Google over violating free speech Last year she announced she was suing Google for $50million after it suspended her advertising account in the hours after a Democratic debate because it was trying to silence her.Although she's a Democrat, Gabbard's nationalist ideals have put her at odds with the Democratic party.Hillary Clinton suggested the Iraq War veteran was a Russian asset. Tulsi Now Inc. said in the lawsuit filed in July 2019 that Google violated her right to free speech and didn't provide 'a straight answer' for suspending her ads account.Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify ban Infowars' Alex JonesIn 2018, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify banned pages and content from Infowars and the show's host Alex Jones. A Facebook spokesman referred to content which it said glorified violence and the use of dehumanizing language to describe Muslims and migrants. These violated their graphic violence and hate speech policies.The spokesman noted conspiracy theories espoused by Jones on events like the 9/11 attacks and Sandy Hook school shooting, were not the reason for his ban. YouTube followed suit a few hours later, as did Spotify, after Apple removed Jones from its podcast directory. Laura Loomer banned from Twitter after she claimed Ilhan Omar was 'anti Jewish' and supported Shariah law It comes as a federal appeals court this week upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit that accused Twitter, Facebook and other tech giants of conspiring to stifle the political views of far-right activist, Laura Loomer, and a conservative nonprofit, Freedom Watch. In November 2018, Loomer handcuffed herself to the front doors of Twitter headquarters in New York after the company banned her. The company permanently suspended Loomer's account, which had more than 260,000 followers, after she tweeted that Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, is 'anti Jewish' and supports Sharia law.Facebook also banned Loomer, who is running for a Florida congressional seat as a Republican.In March 2019, U.S District Judge Trevor McFadden said their suit raises 'non-trivial concerns' but didn't tie these concerns to viable legal claims. The draft order also requires the attorney general to establish a working group including state attorneys general that will examine the enforcement of state laws that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair and deceptive acts. And federal agencies are to be told to review their advertising on social media platforms, which was worth $1.5 billion in the last decade. Section 230 of the 1996 law is a shield against social media networks being sued for what people post on their platforms.It says: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' It also says that: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.' A publisher or speaker can normally be sued for defamation for the contents of their speech but by not being categorized as those, any attempt to sue social media giants for what is written on them falls at the first hurdle.The 1996 statute has allowed Silicon Valley to make billions of dollars from their users' posts, photos and videos, with minimal legal liability, while giving them freedom to remove anything they see as 'objectionable.' When it was written social media did not exist.Since its explosive growth, platforms including Twitter and Facebook have changed repeatedly.Their algorithms decide the order in which users see new posts, and can be used to make particular content more or less visible.That has led critics to say that they are behaving as publishers - deciding what people read or see - and not simply as forums.The rest of the act gives forums powers to set standards for content, which social media platforms have used as a basis for moderating content and to justify the existence of algorithms. Conservatives - and many others outside mainstream thought on matters like history, climate change and even the coronavirus - have criticized the use of Section 230 claiming big tech has censored content without being subject to scrutiny. Republican senators Marco Rubio (FL) and Josh Hawley (MO) were among those who slammed Twitter for putting its fact-checking flag on the president's tweets.Rubio said: 'The law still protects social media companies like @Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers. 'But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher then they should no longer be shielded from liability &amp; treated as publishers under the law.' Hawley, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it 'raises serious questions about whether Twitter targeted the President for political reasons.' There is however zero possibility of a Democratic House passing reforms to the law itself.That leaves Trump trying to use the powers of the executive branch.The draft order also puts a prohibition on federal tax dollars going to online platforms that 'violate free speech principles.' But a report last February showed the feds spent just $8 million on social media ads in 2018. The idea of broadening the platforms' legal exposure carried more weight. Under the order, the Commerce Secretary would file a petition for new FCC rule-making. It would make platforms liable when actions are 'deceptive, pretextrual, or inconsistent with a provider's terms of service,' or when taken with 'inadequate notice' or by an 'unreasoned explanation.' Trump himself has made ample use of lawsuits and legal threats over his career. USA found in 2016 Trump and his companies had been involved in 3,500 lawsuits over three decades.Trump's moves brought immediate pushback. 'This is simply setting the wheels of law enforcement and regulation in motion against a private company for questioning the president,' said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, according to the Washington Post. Added former FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, 'Social media can be frustrating. But an executive order that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into the president's speech police is not the answer.' Jesse Blumenthal, head of the Koch-backed Stand Together group, said it was 'just nonsense' to try to rewrite a clear statute through an executive order. The draft rule's first section contains language that is more political than technical, following reports the administration rushed to put it out.It calls free speech 'the bedrock of American democracy' and says having a limited number of platforms 'hand-pick' speech is 'fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.' Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted: 'Here's the inevitable effect ... all comments sections will be taken down. No website has the resources to actively edit all comments in order to shield themselves from liability, and no website is willing to leave comments entirely standards-free.'Pachter said that fact-checking 'is a stupid idea on Twitter's part' and that instead they should just delete tweets which are reported, warn the offender or suspend them for breaking its rules. Trump had claimed Wednesday in a Twitter thread that conservatives are being silenced and disproportionately regulated on social media websites like Twitter and Facebook as Twitter issued 'misleading' warning labels on two of his tweets about mail-in voting on Tuesday.'Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,' the president posted to his Twitter Wednesday morning. 'We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that happen again.'The warning was issued after Trump reacted with fury to having two of his tweets labelled as misleading, with links to news articles suggesting they were false attached. Responding to the 'fact checking' Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale said: 'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters.'Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them.' In contrast, Twitter's Jack Dorsey refused to take down the president's tweets where he touted a debunked conspiracy theory that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a staffer when he was a Republican U.S. congressman from Florida. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg meanwhile criticized his competitor and said it was not the place of private companies to interfere in what people say online. Speaking to Fox News, Zuckerberg said: 'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this ... I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.'Twitter users, including some Republicans, did not react kindly to the president suggesting increased regulations on social media websites.Michael Pachter, research analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told Fox Business: 'Twitter came up with a rule that applies to one person ...'They're not treating (Trump) the way they treat everybody else. They came up with a separate set of rules just for him, which is fact-checking, because they're too afraid of his bullying to delete the tweet or suspend him.' Prominent conservative Margot Cleveland, whose work has been featured in several right leaning news publications, weighed in claiming any private organization has the right to decide what speech can and cannot be featured on their platform.'Pro Tip: Saying Twitter is violating your constitutional right to free speech or your First Amendment rights is wacko b/c Twitter ain't the government,' Cleveland wrote Wednesday morning. 'Saying Twitter is 'stifling free speech' isn't. Powerful private organizations can &amp; do stifle speech.' Trump critic and Republican George Conway, who is married to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, reposted a message from the State Department spokeswoman that contradicted the president's tweet.Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg goes after Twitter for its fact-checking of Trump  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg criticized competitor Twitter on Thursday after it 'fact-checked' tweets from Donald Trump.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey immediately fired back saying that the site would continue to call out 'incorrect or disputed information' about elections shared by users. In his interview with Fox, Facebook's Zuckerberg said that it was not the place of the company to act as an 'arbiter of truth'.'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' he said.'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' he added.'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.'Dorsey tweeted: 'Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me. Please leave our employees out of this. We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make,' he wrote. 'Per our Civic Integrity policy, the tweets yesterday may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot (only registered voters receive ballots),' he added. 'We're updating the link on @RealDonaldTrump's tweet to make this more clear.''The State Department's spokesperson, a couple of hours after the President of the United States suggested that the government may 'strongly regulate' social media platforms or 'close them down,'' Conway wrote as a lead up.Morgan Ortagus tweeted from the official State Department spokesperson account: 'Governments that restrict internet access deprive their citizens of the information they need to stay safe. #FreedomOfExpression both online and offline is vital, especially during COVID-19. @StateDept is proud to be an active member of the @FO_Coalition.' Kellyanne Conway criticized Twitter for flagging the tweets, lashing out at Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site Integrity, during an interview with Fox &amp; Friends Wednesday.She even cited his Twitter handle on live television to make sure Republicans knew where to direct their complaints.'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway lamented.'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' Trump also re-asserted his flagged tweets' theme in his Wednesday morning tweet: 'Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country.'Trump views that mail-in ballots will increase the chances of voter fraud - and benefit Democrats in 2020.'It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots,' Trump insisted. 'Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!' On Tuesday, the president tweeted that California's mail-in balloting initiative would lead to substantial voter fraud in the November general election.Biased head of Twitter's 'Site Integrity' has previously called the President 'a racist tangerine'   Yoel Roth, whose official title at Twitter is head of Site Integrity, faced backlash on Wednesday after his history of anti-Trump tweets emerged less than 24 hours after the social media giant put a fact-checking warning on two of the president's tweets. In a January 2017 tweet, Roth referred to the Trump administration as 'actual Nazis in the White House' and tweeted in November 2016 that fly over states were racist.He also compared Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway to Nazi Joseph Goebbels saying: ''Today on Meet The Press, we're speaking with Joseph Goebbels about the first 100 days...' - What I hear whenever Kellyanne is on a news show.'The majority of Roth's tweets criticizing Trump and his administration were posted around 2017.Roth started working at Twitter in 2015 as a product trust partner, according to his LinkedIn profile.He has been in his current role as head of site integrity for almost two years.Conway, who is a counselor to Trump, lashed out at Roth in an interview with Fox &amp; Friends on Wednesday and went as far as giving out his Twitter handle on live television.'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway said.'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' 'There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed,' Trump wrote Tuesday morning.He then insinuated that non-citizens would be able to obtain ballots.'The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one,' he continued in the Twitter rant. 'That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote.'Trump ended the two-tweet tirade by saying, 'This will be a Rigged Election.''No way!' said Trump, who votes in Florida absentee.The president used a mail-in ballot to vote in the Florida primary last month - a move his administration has defended since he cannot show up for in-person voting while living in Washington, D.C. By Tuesday afternoon, Twitter had flagged the tweets with a blue exclamation mark prompting users to 'get the facts about mail-in ballots.'Another page on the social media site called Trump's tweets 'unsubstantiated,' according to fact-checkers from CNN, Washington Post and other news outlets.'These tweets contain potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots,' a statement from Twitter read. Following the move from Twitter, Trump used the social media site he is attacking to decry its decision to label his tweets 'misleading' and accused them of 'stifling free speech.' He threatened the tech giant, stating he wouldn't allow it to continue.'@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post,' Trump wrote Tuesday night.'Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!' he asserted.Trump's 2020 campaign was quick to slam the move.'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters. Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them,' campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. Slew of pending antitrust cases against big techGoogle, Facebook, Amazon and Apple are under a series of probes into allegations that the tech behemoths use their clout to unfairly defend their market share, including one by the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.The Justice Department is believed to be looking at all four companies while the Federal Trade Commission is probing Facebook and Amazon.Dozens of state attorneys general, led by New York, are also investigating Facebook.Earlier this month it was reported a group of state attorneys in Texas were likely to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google.Once seen as the darlings of Washington, Silicon Valley firms have become targets for politicians of all stripes.US regulators recently imposed a record $5 billion fine on Facebook for lapses in privacy and data protection, including the leaking of private data for political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.Tech firms and their backers deny monopolistic conduct and argue the fast-evolving digital economy has robust competition and has led to lower prices and more choice for consumers.But there is growing concern that slapping fines on companies that make hundreds of billions of dollars has done little to curb their powers. Reporting by Reuters For weeks Trump has said that states, not wanting to expose the voting public to COVID-19, shouldn't be implementing full-scale mail-in balloting plans. The president has drawn a distinction between absentee ballots, which he said can be used for special purposes, and governors sending every American voter a ballot to send back in. 'I have to do an absentee because I'm voting in Florida and I happen to be president and I live in that beautiful house over there that's painted white,' he said in the Rose Garden Tuesday. Trump's tweets came after the Republican National Committee and two other GOP groups filed a lawsuit Sunday against California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had signed an executive order to use mail-in ballots for the November election. 'In California the governor, I hear, is sending millions of ballots all over the state. Millions, to anybody. People that aren't citizens, illegals, anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot,' Trump said at the White House Tuesday.'We are not going to destroy this county by allowing things like that to happen. We're not destroying our country,' he added. Republicans long have been suspicious that making voting easier would elect more Democrats. Young people, for instance, tend to tilt more Democratic, but are also less likely to vote in-person. California was the first state in the country to commit to sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters for the November election, a move responding to the coronavirus pandemic.'Democrats continue to use this pandemic as a ploy to implement their partisan election agenda, and Governor Newsom's executive order is the latest direct assault on the integrity of our elections,' Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. 'No state that conducts all-mail elections automatically mails ballots to inactive voters because it invites fraud, coercion, theft, and otherwise illegitimate voting,' it added.The lawsuit asks for Newsom's order to be barred as unlawful and was filed by the RNC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the California Republican Party.Numerous studies have found little evidence of voter fraud connected to voting by mail. Democrats say it is necessary to counter health risks from the coronavirus by helping to prevent crowds at polling places.Last Wednesday, Trump denounced plans to expand voting by mail in Michigan and Nevada, two key swing states. He briefly threatened to withhold federal funding for the two states but dropped the warning after an avalanche of criticism from Democrats. Since winning the 2016 election via the Electoral College, but losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, the president has alleged that 'millions' of people voted illegally in California and that's how Clinton had such an edge. There was no evidence of wide-scale voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election. READ DONALD TRUMP'S DRAFT EXECUTIVE ORDER ON SOCIAL MEDIA 'FAIRNESS' What is the truth about Trump's fact-checked Tweet? Twitter's fails to answer American politics' most bitterly disputed question: Could fraud swing a presidential election? Twitter ignited a war with Donald Trump by attaching a fact-check to his tweets about mail-in ballots Tuesday, labeling them misleading and calling some of his claims 'false.' Its move puts the social media platform immediately at odds with Trump and his Republican Party.Twitter has not said why it chose these tweets particularly, or how it assembled its own factcheck. Additionally, its head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, has been plunged into the center of the row with his history of anti-Trump tweets surfacing. Here we analyze the controversy over the dueling claims about fraud.What Donald Trump said  What Twitter said Breaking down each side's claims What Trump said: There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. This is the heart of Trump's - and Republicans' - anti-mail-in ballot push. But it is impossible to either entirely prove or disprove because it is a prediction.There is however substantial evidence that mail-in ballots are not 'substantially' fraudulent: they are used universally in five states - Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah. Oregon was the first to go all mail-in, in 2000.That means every voter is sent a ballot in advance, which they can either return completed during early voting by mail or in person at a polling place, or take uncompleted to a polling center on election day. None of these states has been hit by increased claims of electoral fraud which would render their elections 'substantially fraudulent.' In Oregon, for example, the Secretary of State's office referred 57 cases of possible fraud to prosecutors, resulting in 10 prosecutions after the 2016 presidential elections. Among them were a student who voted in Colorado as well as Oregon when her parents sent her a ballot from home, and a woman who voted for herself and her daughter.[item name=video id=4376024 style=2 /]As for how those 10 cases would have changed the election, four were Democrats, one Republican, one Libertarian and four unaffiliated; Oregon voted for Hillary Clinton by 1,002,106 to 782,403 for Donald Trump. The tiny scale of prosecuted cases is a pattern across the country: the White House highlighted a report from the conservative Heritage Foundation which runs a database of fraud cases, but it managed to come up with just over 1,000 cases of all types of fraud going back as far as 1994, covering elections at every level. Similarly, in 2012, a large-scale investigation commissioned by the Knight Foundation found 491 instances of absentee ballot fraud in the previous 12 years. It said that level appeared to be higher than in voting in person; in the same period it found only 10 cases of people impersonating other voters at a polling place.However in that same period, the total number of votes cast by Americans runs far into the billions and there have been no cases where an entire state's elections have been declared to be 'substantially fraudulent' or anything equivalent to that. In fact, levels of fraud uncovered by investigation after investigation are consistently extremely low. For example, the U.S. Attorney in North Carolina ordered an audit of the 2016 election, where more than 4.5 million ballots were cast in a state which voted for Trump but is seen now as a possible swing state.It uncovered the following - effectively about 500 votes which were ineligible:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>400 suspected felons and 41 non-citizens had voted illegally</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>34 citizens were wrongly refused the right to vote because they were mistakenly declared ineligible</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>two suspected cases of voter impersonation - it was not specified whether this was in person or by mail</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>24 people who voted twice, mostly in other states.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The exercise suggests that the numbers were far too small to move the results of the election. If translated to states with closer margins - such as Michigan - such a scale of fraud would still do nothing to change the outcome. </p><p>Analysis: It is impossible to disprove Trump's claim that voting will be 'substantially fraudulent,' but he has no evidence to back it up. Mail-in voting has happened for many years with a very low level of fraud but it appears to be at a higher level than fraud for voting in person. Trump's use of the word 'substantially' flies in the face of past experience</p><p>Trump: Mail boxes will be robbed</p><p>Mail theft is a constant problem for the Postal Service but there do not appear to be prosecuted cases where the intention was to steal ballots.</p><p>Ballots have however been stolen along with other items; in Anchorage, Alaska in 2018 KTUU reported that 46 ballots and other sodden mail were found in a snowbank after being reported missing from a set of mailboxes. </p><p>They were returned, voided and new ballots issued to the voters affected. Barcodes on ballot forms means they can be traced. </p><p>The highest risk is simply that people lose out on voting when mail is stolen. </p><p>Analysis: Unlikely - at best - to be tied to voting fraud </p><p>Trump: Ballots will be forged</p><p>Trump attaches no number to this claim or specifies what he means but he seems to be suggesting that fake ballots will be made. </p><p>This is highly difficult to pull off - each state uses different security methods but all have methods to prevent forgery. There do not appear to be cases of entirely forged ballot papers.</p><p>Analysis: Highly unlikely to happen </p><p>Trump: Ballots will be 'illegally printed out'</p><p>It is unclear exactly what Trump means with this, making it difficult to analyze. </p><p>He may mean that ballots are issued in excess numbers or to illegal immigrants. </p><p>The number of mail-in ballots applications or ballots issued has been a long-running point of contention between Republicans and Democrats.</p><p>Republican groups including Judicial Watch have sued a number of states - among them California - claiming they issue voting papers to defunct voters, who may have died or moved.</p><p>Republicans broadly have been active in 'purging' voter rolls and introducing use-it-or-lose-it voting laws, which the Supreme Court upheld as constitutional. </p><p>California settled a case with the group in 2017, agreeing to contact 1.5 million people who were possibly inactive voters and removing them from the voter roll if they did not respond.</p><p>However in Ohio, the Republican secretary of state released a list of 'inactive voters' to be purged, only for tens of thousands of names on the list to be discovered to be errors who were still active voters.</p><p>Analysis: Confused at best </p><p>Trump: Ballots will be fraudulently signed</p><p>Forging signatures to impersonate another voter appears to be the most common form of fraud - but is still vanishingly rare.</p><p>The most prominent case to help Trump's claim is, ironically, one involving Republicans in North Carolina.</p><p>There the 2018 election for the 9th District was voided because of suspicions that a Republican contractor for Mark Harris had 'harvested' ballots and then had them filled in by members of his staff.</p><p>Mail-in ballots went Republican by 60% but just 16% of those who used them were registered to the party; Harris 'won' by a wafer-thin margin of 905 votes.</p><p>The contractor, Leslie Dowless, got his staff to go door-to-door in Bladen County and offer 'assistance' to people to request then fill in ballots; his stepdaughter admitted she simply signed them herself. Most of the targets were African-American. </p><p>They had done the same for the primary and Harris had beaten the incumbent, with 437 mail-in ballots for Harris, the challenger, to just 17 for the incumbent.</p><p>The fraud was the largest in modern history, and there had been warnings about Dowless' suspicious conduct before, but he had not been investigated. </p><p>The true scale of Dowless' crimes - and the number of ballots 'fraudulently signed' remains unclear. A total of 437 were submitted int he primary, and he was charged with specimen cases in the general election prosecution.</p><p>The last time a congressional election was voided was in 1974, and the re-run was the first ever ordered because of fraud.</p><p>Dowless' motive was financial, having billed $5 Republicans per absentee vote he 'helped.' </p><p>However, the scale of fraud which would be needed to sway a presidential election is far greater than Dowless was operating on, and there is no evidence that anything on that scale has happened.</p><p>Apart from anything else, at $5 a vote, the cost would be huge. </p><p>Election officials say that they have two levels of checks in place for preventing fraudulent signatures - first, inspecting for envelope tampering, and secondly signature verification.</p><p>That is itself fraught with challenges, including that people's signatures may change over time, but has been held up by officials of both parties as a robust system that prevents fraud. </p><p>Analysis: Such fraud undoubtedly happens but the scale involved is tiny compared to the scale of voting. Ironically the best proof for Trump's case involves his own party</p><p>Trump: The governor of California is sending ballots to... anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one</p><p>Gavin Newsom's executive order states that the ballots will go to registered voters. </p><p>Trump suggests they will go to illegal immigrants, who cannot register to vote.</p><p>Put simply, as long as the register of voters is accurate, then there is no prospect that they will got to illegal immigrants. </p><p>There have been cases of non-citizens who have been mistakenly registered, including 1,500 who were mistakenly sent ballots in June 2018 after an error at the DMV in California. </p><p>However it is unknown how many of those were illegal immigrants rather than legal immigrants, or under-18s, and it is also unknown how many - if any - voted. If they had voted, they would have been criminally liable.</p><p>In contrast to a potential 1,500 illegal votes, more than 6.6 million ballots were cast in that primary in California. </p><p>Analysis: Trump is wrong - as long as California's list of electors is up to date </p><p>Trump: Professionals telling all of those people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote</p><p>Trump is referring to the practice known by Republicans as 'ballot harvesting,' where politically-aligned groups collect mail-in ballots and return them for counting.</p><p>Ballot harvesting is among the most complicated areas of election law, and whether and how it is allowed varies state by state. </p><p>Some states - including Texas - have explicitly outlawed anybody returning an absentee ballot, or allowing only a family member to do so.</p><p>But others have no such restrictions, and there is no federal law on it. In Arizona, an attempt to ban it was deemed to fall foul of the Voting Rights Act.</p><p>Broadly, 27 states allow third-parties to collect and return ballots, but with a patchwork of restrictions; for example in Colorado, one person can return no more than 10 ballots. </p><p>California changed the law so that in the 2018 cycle, third-party groups could encourage people to fill in mail-in ballots and collect them. The main restriction is that collectors cannot be paid per ballot. </p><p>Republicans say this contributed to a blue wave which overwhelmed their members of Congress in the state - although the blue wave was repeated across the country.</p><p>There is nothing wrong in any state with asking people who have not voted to consider voting - in fact it is the basis of much campaigning, such as volunteers of both parties driving the elderly to vote on election day - or for that matter lobbying them about who they should vote for. </p><p>What is definitely true is that where legal, ballot-harvesting can juice turn-out - and it's not just Democrats who think that.</p><p>Devin Nunes, one of Trump's most reliably loyal Congressional defenders and a California Republican told Fox News this month that a 'robust ballot-harvesting operation' was vital to the party in November.</p><p>'I hate saying that because it's illegal in 49 states,' he said, mis-stating the complexities of the law over it.</p><p>Fraud associated with ballot harvesting does not appear to have been formally reported in California but some Republicans have offered anecdotal suggestions that it took pace in 2018.</p><p>Where ballot harvest fraud definitely happened as in North Carolina's 9th district in 2018, when Republican operative Leslie Dowless illegally persuaded voters to either complete a mail-in application and ballot for his party, or had his staff fill them in himself. </p><p>The state bans any handling of a ballot by a third party, but Dowless did so on a scale which was enough to void a congressional election for the first time since 1974. </p><p>Analysis: What Trump says will happen is not necessarily illegal in any form, but can be depending on the state. It has been practiced illegally on a large scale in one well-known case - to benefit Republicans</p><p>Twitter: Trump falsely claimed that mail-in ballots would lead to 'a Rigged Election.' However, fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud.</p><p>There is evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to fraud - cases of it have been prosecuted after every election cycle. </p><p>The issue which is political divisive is the scale on which it happens.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly made claims it involves 'millions' of votes but there has never been any proof that he is correct.</p><p>His own commission on electoral fraud was disbanded without reporting, and no large-scale findings to back up his claims of vast fraud have been made.</p><p>But there have repeatedly been prosecutions of fraud linked to mail-in ballots - even if the numbers are vanishingly low in comparison </p><p>Analysis: Twitter are wrong to state categorically that there is no fraud. The dispute is not over its existence: the dispute is over whether it is widespread and enough to change the outcome of a presidential election</p><p>Twitter: Trump falsely claimed that California will send mail-in ballots to 'anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there.' In fact, only registered voters will receive ballots.</p><p>Gavin Newsom's executive order states that the ballots will go to registered voters.</p><p>That depends on the register being correct and nobody having been registered who is illegal. </p><p>Analysis: Twitter is correct as long as the rules are followed </p><p>Twitter: Five states already vote entirely by mail and all states offer some form of mail-in absentee voting, according to NBC News.</p><p>There are five states which mail ballots to every voter, although all of those voters can choose to vote in person if they wish.</p><p>All states do offer absentee voting in some form; each state's laws are different.</p><p>Analysis: Twitter is imprecise </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-63232878</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600W-XKK1-JCJY-G0T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7347\"/><timeReceived>5:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.
