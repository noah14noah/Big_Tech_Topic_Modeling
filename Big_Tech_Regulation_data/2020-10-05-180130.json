The online behemoth now faces renewed complaints in India.   Reuters reports that the All India Online Vendors Association charges Amazon with favoring some sellers over others, thus tilting the balance against the group\u2019s members while giving the favored companies an unfair advantage. The sellers said, in a legal finding, that the U.S.-based retail giant is driving independent vendors out of business by giving online discounts to companies it favors.   The sellers association alleges that Amazon India\u2019s wholesale arm buys goods in bulk from manufacturers and then sells them at a loss to sellers such as Cloudtail. Such favored sellers are then able to hawk these goods on Amazon\u2019s marketplace \u2014 at a big discount.   Reuters reported that the association\u2019s filing this month said that \u201cthis anti-competitive arrangement ... is causing foreclosure of competition by driving independent sellers out of the market.\u201d   Amazon has run into various regulatory challenges in India, where it has committed $6.5 billion in investments.   The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is already investigating Amazon and rival Flipkart, owned by Walmart. In that case, Amazon is defending itself from charges it violates competition law with its discounting practices.   In 2018, the same Indian vendors association made similar allegations \u2014 and filed an antitrust complaint with the CCI. The complaint argued that Amazon was favoring merchants that it partly owns, such as Cloudtail and Appario.   \u201cThere should not be any preferential treatment,\u201d Chanakya Basa , a lawyer for the group at that time, said. More than 2,000 sellers belong to the group.   Amazon denied the claims. \u201cAmazon has an equal relationship with all the sellers on our marketplace,\u201d Amazon India spokeswoman Bhumika Shah said at the time. She added that that the company is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to compliance with local laws.   Amazon and other Big Tech companies have faced increasing scrutiny over antitrust issues in the U.S. Last month, the CEOs of  Amazon ,  Apple ,  Facebook  and  Google 's parent,  Alphabet , testified before Congress about their business practices.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS AND AMAZON PAY CONVERSATION: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 CONSUMER TRUST     From tiny Main Street shops to the tech giants of Silicon Valley, companies are working fervently to revive and reinvent the economy.

The country\u2019s new policy, according to a 15-page draft seen by Bloomberg and written by the Ministry of Commerce\u2019s Department for Promotion of Industry &amp; Internal Trade , dictates that a new eCommerce regulator be appointed, who would oversee the industry, making sure competition is active and everyone has access to the same set of information and resources.   The rules would also require that the government have access to online companies\u2019 sources and algorithms, so as to do away with \u201cdigitally induced biases,\u201d and look into determining whether companies have \u201cexplainable AI.\u201d   All in all, the draft seeks to create fairness and level the playing field against unfair hoarding by the biggest and most powerful companies.   \u201cIt is in the interest of the Indian consumer and the local ecosystem that there are more service providers\u201d and that \u201cthe network effects do not lead to creation of digital monopolies misusing their dominant market position,\u201d the draft said, according to Bloomberg.   The tech market in India is booming, but global corporations are firmly entrenched as the dominant leaders in every field from online retail to content streaming to messaging and digital payments. India\u2019s government has been fighting back against this monopolistic tendency as of late, including banning dozens of apps backed by Chinese tech titans.   The corporations have been heavily spending in India\u2019s telecom market recently due to the higher-than-usual adoption of mobile apps and technology there. According to stats quoted in a recent PYMNTS report , 67 percent of mobile users are utilizing digital payments in India, up from 57 before the pandemic, and higher than the global 47 percent.   As such, Facebook and Silver Lake have dumped billions into Jio Platforms , the Reliance Industries subsidiary for telecommunications. Amazon, meanwhile, is allegedly looking into buying a $2 billion stake in Bharti Airtel , the third-largest operator there, which the company has denied is happening.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    PYMNTS STUDY: THE CROSS-BORDER MERCHANT FRICTION INDEX \u2013 JUNE 2020    The PYMNTS Cross-Border Merchant Friction Index analyzes the key friction points experienced by consumers browsing, shopping and paying for purchases on international eCommerce sites.

If the push becomes a reality, big tech and social media companies like Facebook and Google will have to contend with new rules that will hamper their operations in India. The plan to go big on data localization comes after two meetings of a joint parliamentary committee that was set up a few weeks ago - after Prime Minister Narendra Modi''s government introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDP) in Parliament in the last session held in December 2019.''In the first meeting the members of parliament received a broad presentation from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. In the second meeting held on February 18, the members were very keen to ensure that social media and big tech companies ensure data of Indians remains within the territorial boundaries of India. </p><p>That seems to be the key take away,'' a senior official familiar with the proceedings told Asia Times.This, if accepted by the government and added to the proposed data protection bill, will have major consequences for data flows from India to the rest of the world. It will also mean that companies like Google and Facebook, which depend on content generated by users to sharpen their advertising algorithms, will now have to reshape their business models. Many companies are also worried about whether the data restrictions will be feasible because the Internet depends on servers placed strategically throughout the globe. As data travels from server to server, it is impossible to ensure it is not stored under different jurisdictions for different purposes.The need for a data protection law came out of a historic Supreme Court judgment passed unanimously by nine judges in August 2017. The constitutional bench ruled in what is now known as the Puttaswamy judgment that privacy is a fundamental right and therefore, data protection, one of its key elements, must be enshrined in law. This will ensure Indians will have legal protection from other parties having access to their personal data and misusing it. But researchers and advocates of the law are beginning to worry that the government wants to use the proposed law to build a bigger mass surveillance capability and has little interest in protecting citizens'' data. Amber Sinha, research director of the non-profit Center for Internet and Society, has been following the data protection debate for years. ''The movement towards a data protection law is a welcome and much belated development. There is a need for the parliamentary committee to align the bill with the principles enshrined in the Puttaswamy judgment,'' he said. However, he is also concerned that key issues like the mass surveillance of citizens are not being discussed as much as they should be. ''On matters of surveillance, the protection of individual privacy is given primacy over all other interests, and should be the mandate of any data protection law. There is also dire need to make the proposed data protection authority more independent and accountable to ensure that the law is effectively implemented and enforced,'' he said.Smriti Parsheera, a lawyer for the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy who has been tracking the bill, agrees with Sinha''s assessment. ''The bill needs significant strengthening in terms of the design, independence and accountability of the Data Protection Authority. The Data Protection Authority is going to have a unique remit in terms of covering all individuals, private entities and state actors and across all sectors of the economy. To make this work effectively we need a radical rethinking of regulatory governance practices, but what we have instead is a bill that does not include even the basic checks and balances that we see under existing Indian laws.''According to top government sources, the committee has so far not even discussed the controversial section 35 of the proposed law. This section gives the government blanket powers to access any sensitive data of Indian citizens in the name of national security. In fact, this goes against the very grain of a comprehensive report that was put together by a government-appointed committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge, Sri Krishna. In fact, a note prepared by him was also circulated among MPs in the first meeting, along with a comprehensive analysis of the changes made between the draft that was recommended by his committee and the new version introduced by the government in Parliament. Government sources also suggest that the joint parliamentary committee members currently examining the bill are divided along party lines. ''Those from the ruling party, the BJP, seem to have been briefed on pushing for data localization. They are also keen to ensure that social media companies can be regulated in some form so that politicians and their parties can''t be targeted easily,'' the official said. Researchers and advocates of privacy like Parsheera also have other worries that the joint parliamentary committee members have not discussed. ''For instance, the bill does not provide for the kind of transparency in regulation making that we see in the case of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India or the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India. It also does not have independence in the selection process that other laws in India currently have,'' she said. ''In addition to its regulatory and enforcement functions, the bill entrusts the DPA with the duty to address individual complaints, a function that should ideally rest with a separate body like the banking ombudsman,'' she added.MENAFN1902202001590000ID1099729631</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1099729631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7X-7VR1-F04Y-T489-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"964\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We've been watching our neighbours do the trick for years. It's called export-oriented growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's all about building a big manufacturing sector. You encourage under-employed rural workers to move to the city and take jobs in factories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Because your one big economic advantage is an abundant supply of cheap labour, you start by concentrating on making low-cost, simple, labour-intensive items such as textiles, clothing and footwear.</p><p>Since the locals don't have much capacity to buy this stuff, you concentrate on exporting it. Foreigners will lap it up because to them it's so cheap.</p><p>As the plan works and the country's income rises, you plough a fair bit back into raising the education level of your workers, which allows you to move to making more elaborate goods and to paying higher wages. You're on the way to being a developed country.</p><p>Over the decades we've seen a succession of countries climb this ladder: Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, China and now even Vietnam and Bangladesh at the bottom. It's like pass-the-parcel: as each country's labour gets too expensive to be used to produce low-value thongs and T-shirts, some poorer country takes over and starts the climb to prosperity.</p><p>That's the way it's always done. Except for one country: India. Its economy started growing strongly in the 1990s and now it's the world's third-biggest (provided you measure it correctly, allowing for differences in purchasing power).</p><p>India has got this far without building a big, export-oriented manufacturing sector. It's done something that's probably unique: skipped the manufacturing stage and gone straight to the rich-country stage, in which most growth in jobs and production comes from services.</p><p>The Indians have done it by being so good with software and other information and communications technology and the things that hang off it, such as call centres. It's a big export earner.</p><p>It's an impressive effort, and there's no reason a developing country shouldn't have a big tech sector.</p><p>But, even so, the experts are saying India would be a lot better off if it had a bigger, more vibrant manufacturing sector, employing a lot more people who, by Indian standards, would be on good wages. This is a key theme in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's report on the Indian economy, issued this week.</p><p>The report offers suggestions on what could be done to encourage the growth of manufacturing.</p><p>First, some basic facts. India has a population of 1250 million and before long it will overtake China's. About 29 per cent of the population is younger than 15.</p><p>Manufacturing accounts for only 13 per cent of India's gross domestic product, which is low compared with the other BRICS emerging economies Brazil, Russia, Indonesia and China, but not South Africa.</p><p>Indian manufacturing probably accounts for a slightly smaller share of its total employment. Huh? It's normally the other way round. You'd expect it to be quite labour intensive. But despite abundant, low-skilled and relatively cheap labour, Indian manufacturing is surprisingly capital and skill intensive, the report says.</p><p>Almost two-thirds of manufacturing employment is in companies with fewer than 10 employees. That compares with Brazil's 9 per cent. This tells us the sector's many small firms mean it isn't exploiting its potential economies of scale.</p><p>And, indeed, its manufacturing productivity is low, with productivity 1.6 times higher in China and and 2.9 times in Brazil.</p><p>India's employment in manufacturing hasn't grown much over the years, with the sector hardest hit by the economy's recent slowdown. What new jobs have been created have been \"informal\", with workers not covered by social security arrangements. Manufacturing's share of India's \"merchandise\" or goods exports (that is, ignoring the big and rapidly growing exports of IT services) fell from 77 per cent to 65 per cent over the decade to 2013.</p><p>My guess is an important reason for the sector's unusual configuration and weak growth is excessive regulation. India has been and still is a highly, and badly, regulated economy. The socialists' obsession with manufacturing means I wouldn't be surprised if the newer technology sector has taken over the running because, being outside the Left's traditional preoccupations, it wasn't so heavily regulated.</p><p>Some regulation has been removed but, particularly as they apply to manufacturing, India's labour and tax laws, which are tougher on bigger than smaller firms, have inhibited and distorted the industry's development.</p><p>As the report puts it, manufacturing firms have little incentive to employ and grow, since by staying small they can avoid taxes and complex labour regulations.</p><p>A second part of the explanation the report points to is what it calls \"structural bottlenecks\". As with all developing countries, the whole Indian economy suffers under inadequate economic and social infrastructure.</p><p>But manufacturing is particularly reliant on good transport links - more so than the tech sector - and India's transport infrastructure is still bad.</p><p>Every business needs a reliable electricity supply, but manufacturing probably needs it more than most. A business survey has found that 48 per cent of manufacturing firms experience power cuts for more than five hours a week. About 60 per cent of firms feel that erratic power supply affects their competitiveness and they would be willing to pay more for a more reliable supply.</p><p>As usual with developing economies, the list of things that need reform is long. The challenge for governments is to give priority to the ones that would do most to help, even though everything is interconnected. In the case of Indian manufacturing, however, the OECD's top recommendation is to introduce simpler and more flexible labour law, which doesn't discriminate by the size of the enterprise.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUSTRATION: By Glen LeLievre</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-6i0a7cru31wd1bbhk7a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DN6-5VD1-F0J6-J17V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 22, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy/Standards of living</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Industry/Manufacturing</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X90</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING OUTPUT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009JNX</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

But this seemingly narrow intellectual question is increasingly becoming a central matter of urgent concern in the context of Indian democracy - and, indeed, democracy and the free flow of information around the world. Foreign governments are moving to impose new responsibilities on dominant tech firms. Australia, for instance, is forcing Facebook and Google to pay news companies for displaying their stories; French antitrust officials have ordered Google to negotiate with local media firms to pay for displaying their content; and in the United States, a fierce political war rages on between liberals and conservatives on this very issue.</p><p>Let's go back to that philosophical question for a moment, though. Publishers have always held a vaunted position in society. Traditional media formats - daily newspapers, broadcast television networks and radio stations - once consumed the public's attention. My grandfather would comb through newspapers and news magazines every day, while my grandmother listened to the radio all day, every day - not uncommon for those of their generation. The result was that we came to know not only the voices and faces that graced these outlets, but the publishing houses and media personalities behind the businesses. This intense aura about the media ecosystem - a world that could make someone famous - gave news organisations great power. They had the power to convey the news - and with that power, came great responsibility.</p><p>As with any line of business, news organisations cannot be expected to necessarily and voluntarily demonstrate that responsibility - by, for instance, not spreading political falsehoods, hateful messaging, and other vitriol. To put it differently: Absent meaningful regulation, businesses operating in a free market economy, including media outlets, will do whatever they wish to maximise shareholder returns. Profit displaces social considerations.</p><p>So to ensure they would act responsibly, the government created a policy framework.</p><p>In India, the contours of media regulation have become sophisticatedly diverse, with laws such as the Press Council Act, 1978, the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, the Newspaper (Price and Page) Act, 1956, and the Cinematograph Act, 1952.</p><p>To quote from an example, the last of these - a reform of the Indian film industry enacted 70 years ago - notes that a \"film shall not be certified for public exhibition if, in the opinion of the authority competent to grant the certificate, the film or any part of it is against the interests of 1 (the sovereignty and integrity of India) the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or involves defamation or contempt of court or is likely to incite the commission of any offence.\" Without the law, the government couldn't be sure that an intrepid director might just slip offending content into mass-market films every now and then.</p><p>Some might argue that Facebook and Google should be treated like publishers, too; they now dominate the media sector in India and often facilitate the dissemination of offending content. They have, until now, been regarded as open platforms, which allow any and all speech (different kinds of views/all shades of opinion) but can remove whatever they wish - a conceptualisation originally stemming from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 US law that simultaneously affirms that Internet companies won't \"be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information\" and won't \"be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material\". The idea was simple: Let the Internet grow and develop its own commercial standards as necessary.</p><p>Here is the problem. This benevolent regulatory framework has enabled Facebook to claim it acts as a publisher and reap the censorship rights thereof, but turn around and also claim it is an undiscerning platform to reap the benefits of free speech leniency. A more just regime might, instead of giving the firm a free pass on both ends, hold its feet to the fire on both counts. There can be no doubt the company acts as some novel form of entity in between; even the company's lawyers have suggested that the company possesses a \"quintessential publisher function\" over the \"protected\" practice of determining \"what to publish and the decision of what not to publish\" - while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also contended the company \"should err on the side of greater expression.\"</p><p>So, if it is true that Internet firms have editorial power - and it is, so long as they decide what specific news stories, search results, and social media posts to show us among the billions of possibilities - then let us treat them as such. The responsibility must now lie with the national government to do right by its citizens - many of whom have been targeted, misled, and pilloried, which has been enabled by Internet platforms. The time has come for the imposition of decency in exchange for continued participation in the Indian consumer market.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

In Sweden, which chose a private-sector partner for its e-krona initiative ...</p><p>The perks of digital money depend on where you are in the world. </p><p>In Sweden, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/press-and-published/notices-and-press-releases/notices/2019/riksbank-develops-an-e-krona-in-a-test-environment/\"> chose</url> a private-sector partner for its e-krona initiative on Friday, the Riksbank is grappling with the death of cash. For other advanced economies, the chief bugbear is often expensive and slow payments systems. In less developed economies, there is another purpose: financial inclusion. That is, bringing those without bank accounts into the financial system. </p><p>Before a chance meeting at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meetings in Washington DC this autumn, we had no idea of the leap that one big emerging market -- India -- had made in this sphere. </p><p>If you want an idea of the scale, then take a look at this table from a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap106.htm\"> paper</url> that the Bank for International Settlements published on Sunday evening: </p><p>India has 1.3bn people. What we are talking about is hundreds of millions of people, including those from marginalised groups such as women and poor people, gaining access to financial services and being able to transfer funds instantly in the space of a few years. </p><p>So what\u2019s the story? At its core it\u2019s a tale of what one of the BIS paper\u2019s authors, Siddharth Tiwari,\u00a0\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://bispodcast.libsyn.com/the-design-of-digital-financial-infrastructure-lessons-from-india steps\"> calls the \u201cvisionary\u201d</url>\u00a0action of the government. </p><p>It begins about a decade ago with something called <url normalizedValue=\"https://uidai.gov.in/\"> Aadhaar</url>. </p><p>Aadhaar put simply is one of the biggest banks of biometric data in the world. Back in 2010, the Indian government decided it would take full digital fingerprints and an iris scan from each citizen to create a digital identity -- this taking the form of a twelve-digit number.\u00a0About 1.2bn Indians now have a digital identity.\u00a0</p><p>Aadhaar sounds terrifyingly 1984 to us. Leaving aside the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d50dcf96-0223-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47\"> very real ethical concerns</url>\u00a0and possibilities of data breaches, what we want to focus on here is that Aadhaar has provided a brilliant foundation for banking the unbanked. Which, without dispute, it has.\u00a0</p><p>But a fingerprint alone cannot make payments possible. There is another element of the revolution: the National Payments Corporation of India.\u00a0 </p><p>A non-profit between the country\u2019s central bank and 56 commercial lenders, the NPC has built a system that enables both Indians and financial firms to take advantage of this mass pool of digital identity data.\u00a0</p><p>Think of Aadhaar as an \u201cidentity rail\u201d, giving banks and fintech companies a secure means to identify would-be customers -- and the government and businesses an easy way to pay them. The payments system, dubbed UPI or the Unified Payments Interface, in turn acts as a \u201cpayments rail\u201d to give those players access to infrastructure that enables the transfer of funds. </p><p>UPI began operating in 2016 and through the creation of virtual accounts identifies customers through various methods -- from Aadhaar numbers and QR codes, to the conventional sort code and account number. Unlike, say, <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedwire\"> Fedwire</url>, the main US payments system, it is frictionless and operates around the clock. It is also super cheap. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, it has proven massively popular:\u00a0</p><p>This is all very nice.\u00a0</p><p>But it\u2019s an additional genius element that we think\u00a0will pique the interest of economic officialdom far beyond India.</p><p>We have written before that the prime reason central bankers are so terrified of Libra is that it has the potential to make cross-border payments much more secure, quick and cheap than they are right now -- and wrestle control over money out of policymakers\u2019 hands as a result. The reason being is that stablecoins, and the likes of Alipay, have payment systems which are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">standalone</emphasis>, enabling a payer on one side of the world to transfer funds to a payee\u2019s account on the other directly and instantaneously. </p><p>How is this different to regular payments? Well these are often what is known as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">overlay</emphasis> systems, with payments going through correspondent banking networks. The thinking is that these added layers mean less efficiency, more expense and higher barriers to entry. At the same time, by going through a publicly-regulated payments system settled in fiat money, overlay systems offer more security.\u00a0</p><p>But the BIS thinks the Indian example shows that it isn\u2019t an either or case. In the Indian case they claim you can have both cheap and instant payments stacked on top of a regulated, fiat-money core because you have both Aadhaar and, in UPI, a payments system that is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">interoperable</emphasis>. </p><p>The reason UPI is interoperable is because it is designed to allow individuals to manage money residing in several accounts from a single bank or payment service app on their phone. Not only does this increase competition between banks by enabling people to switch funds cheaply, it also allows fintech or big-tech interfaces -- be they overlay or standalone -- to work through their infrastructure. An example is WhatsApp, now in the middle of a pilot project that will provide a payments interface for more than 400m Indians. </p><p>These steps have, Tiwari claims, allowed India in 10 years to get as far as it might\u2019ve in 50 had it stood still. </p><p>We would also argue that, in so doing, they have left many advanced economies playing catch-up. Take the eurozone. Of course, the standards of data protection here are much tougher -- and the reasons for that have a lot of merit. Yet would it not be a giant leap towards a proper banking union if citizens in each of the 19 member states were allowed to use a well protected digital identity to access banking services from any provider throughout the region?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related links:</emphasis><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/06/19/1560920406000/Facebook-s-Libra-will-not-help-the-unbanked/\">Facebook's Libra will not help the unbanked</url> - FT Alphaville\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-27c94d405c6c4af1ad40c43b5cc691bd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRW-DC31-JB77-K1WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

In a letter, as reported by various media outlets in India, the All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists argues that laws from the 1940s prohibit the sort of home delivery operation that Amazon is piloting in India.   The letter is addressed to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other government officials in the country. According to published reports , it states, among other things: \u201cWe have also given you enough evidence above to prove our point. We also have a full dossier ready on this subject and entering this space can bring on legal implications which can bring disrepute to Amazon\u2019s name.\u201d   TechCrunch quoted an Amazon spokesman as saying upon the launch of the online pharmacy: \u201cThis is particularly relevant in present times, as it will help customers meet their essential needs while staying safe at home,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.   Amazon Pharmacy launched in Bengaluru, India last week.   The legal framework surrounding Amazon\u2019s move is complicated by the general muddy state of drugstore regulation in India. For years, pharmacists have complained about confusion around what is allowed as small operations have launched. The opposition to Amazon\u2019s entry appears to be less than unified, however, as some commentators have argued that the pharmacists\u2019 trade group doesn\u2019t speak for all Indian consumers.   Often referred to by Westerners as Bangalore, the city has a population of about 12 million, and sometimes is called \u201cthe Silicon Valley of India.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    PYMNTS Live Roundtable: Tuesday, August 18, 2020 \u2013 12:00 PM (ET)     Card products are undergoing changes from form factor to digital-first spend controls to totally touchless capabilities and more. Big-spending demographics like Millennials and Gen-Z reward digital-first features that have demonstrable value, and research shows they will switch financial institutions to gain Big Tech connected economy experiences.

The rules would also place fewer restrictions on the government, which would be allowed to request anonymized and non-personal data from companies. The latest version of the bill circulated this week. </p><p>According to Financial Times[2], it was introduced to India's parliament today. While some compare India's proposed rules to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation[3] (GDPR), others say India is moving toward policies seen in China[4]. For instance, India's proposed regulations place fewer restrictions on the government's use of sensitive data, including biometric data, NYT points out.India has been working on its data policies for years[5], and critics, including US senators[6], have asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to soften the country's stance on data localization, which could require cloud[7] and online shopping data[8] to remain in the country. This version of the bill includes requirements that certain \"sensitive\" and \"critical\" data, like financial, health and biometric info, remain in the country, but it's less strict than previous versions, FT reports.The current parliament session ends December 13th, so chances are, this bill will not be voted on until the next session.

A panel was appointed by the Indian government last month to regulate data that doesn\u2019t contain personal details and yet is crucial to letting companies do business, according to Reuters. The idea is for the companies to share data so as to spur research, national security and policymaking.   However, this was met with opposition from the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), which said this was \u201canathema\u201d to promoting competition, and that it could potentially hurt trade and investment in developing countries, Reuters reported. The panel\u2019s proposals also run contrary to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s initiative to get more U.S. companies to invest in India.   A Washington, D.C.-headquartered law firm, Covington and Burling , said India\u2019s proposals are \u201cfar-reaching concepts that would have a significant impact on the ability of both Indian and multinational firms to do business in India,\u201d in a note prepared for the USIBC, Reuters reported.   A USIBC drafted letter said the organization as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are \u201ccategorically opposed\u201d to requiring the sharing of proprietary data, according to Reuters. The letter hasn\u2019t been published yet, but it is expected to be completed and submitted in a matter of weeks.   The plan to regulate data is another irritant for tech companies already mired in tight eCommerce rules and concerns over antitrust. It could put more distance between New Delhi and the U.S., compounding on differences over digital taxes and tariffs, Reuters reported.   Kris Gopalakrishnan , the head of the panel and founder of Indian tech giant Infosys , said the group plans to work with the government to review input from the industry, Reuters reported.   In January, India was mulling a data protection law that would require companies to get permission from users before collecting their data in any way.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    New PYMNTS Report: Preventing Financial Crimes Playbook  \u2013 July 2020     Call it the great tug-of-war.

Continue reading India s proposed internet regulations could threaten privacy everywhere</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">whatsapp (stock 1020)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In December, after a somewhat bruising Senate hearing with Facebook, I argued that the fight over encryption was just beginning. This week, with India poised to unveil new rules that threaten encrypted communications around the world, it seems safe to say that the encryption fight is now fully underway.</p><p>First, some background.</p><p>Messaging products that are end-to-end encrypted can be read only by the sender and the recipient. The encrypted platform itself   such as Apple s iCloud, or Facebook s WhatsApp   can t read the message, because it doesn t have a key. This has led to periodic attempts from law enforcement agencies and lawmakers to force platforms to create so-called  backdoors  that would allow them to snoop on the contents of those messages. But the platforms have resisted, and the issue has generally been in a stalemate.</p><p>In India, though, things are moving very quickly to make end-to-end encryption illegal. The country has sought to exert more control over the internet in the wake of lynchings committed after false rumors spread on WhatsApp. But the Indian government has often taken a draconian approach to regulating the web   shutting down internet access at least 95 times last year, including an indefinite shutdown in Kashmir that a judge called an  abuse of power  earlier this year.</p><p>Now a set of rules proposed a little over a year ago would force tech platforms to cooperate continuously with government requests, without requiring so much as a warrant or court order. Among the requirements is that any post be  traceable  to its origin. And in what is believed to be a world first, the rules would require tech companies to do the investigating   to deploy their sophisticated tools to track a post s spread on their network back to its point of origin, and then turn that information over to law enforcement.</p><p>This is quite different from the current approach, in which law enforcement identifies a suspect and then asks platforms to supply information about them. Now tech companies could essentially be required to serve as deputies of the state, conducting investigations on behalf of law enforcement, without so much as a court order.</p><p>That almost certainly means breaking encryption   how else could tech companies be expected to trace the source of a message? Imagine Clearview AI, but as a service tech companies are required to provide to law enforcement for free, and you start to understand what the Indian government is asking for here.</p><p>The final rules are expected to be released imminently, Saritha Roi reports in Bloomberg:</p><p>The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is expected to publish the new rules later this month without major changes, according to a government official familiar with the matter. [ ]</p><p>The provisions in the earlier draft had required platforms such as Google s YouTube or ByteDance Inc. s TikTok, Facebook or its Instagram and WhatsApp apps, to help the government trace the origins of a post within 72 hours of a request. The companies would also have to preserve their records for at least 180 days to aid government investigators, establish a brick-and-mortar operation within India and appoint both a grievance officer to deal with user complaints and a government liaison.</p><p>The rules would apply to any app with more than 5 million users, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok. Bloomberg reports that it s not clear whether the identities of foreign users would be exempt.</p><p>The tech companies are fighting back. A trade group has argued that the rules would represent a severe violation of Indian citizens  privacy, and they would almost certainly sue if the rules were implemented as written.</p><p>But there s no guarantee that they ll win. And if these rules take effect India won t be the last democracy to implement them. Tech companies will come under increasing pressure to implement a similar system in other Western countries. (Australia seems poised to try to break encryption as well.)</p><p>What happens if encryption supporters lose? First, privacy is diminished for billions of users   including for activists, dissidents, victims of domestic abuse, businesses, and even government workers who have come to rely on secure messaging.</p><p>Second, the move could hurt the tech sector   both in India and abroad   by making it prohibitively expensive to launch a new business. Who can afford to build a compliance regime that requires the company to accommodate any government request, no matter how small, from day one? In practice, the answer is likely to be  only incumbents.  Hannah Quay-de la Vallee makes this point here:</p><p>If this rule is implemented in India (and potentially copied by other nations) it could force companies to create two types of systems   one that uses e2e and one that doesn t. Companies might well justifiably balk at the cost and complexity of that approach and simply build less secure systems. That would weaken the overall safety of the internet ecosystem, harming users around the globe. Alternatively they could remove themselves from the Indian market altogether, depriving 1.2 billion people of state-of-the-art internet security. Neither of these are good outcomes.</p><p>Given how many things Americans have to worry about domestically, I understand how a story about Indian internet rules can fly under the radar. But it s important to recognize that the spirit that s animating the discussion in India is alive and well in the United States. Threats to privacy are multiplying faster than tech or society can deal with them. In such a world, encryption is one of the last   and best   tools we have to fight back.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending sideways:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook s</emphasis>fundraising features, which have led to more than $3 billion in donations since 2015, have generated significant goodwill.

When this project began, we thought the political and legal aspects of our job were over, and we merely needed to identify, prepare, and document data for researchers with our Facebook counterparts.

In the past month alone, RIL bought a 15% stake in online lingerie retailer Zivame\u2014a sta...</p><p>In these uncertain times, few things are more reliable than investment announcements from Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries (RIL) and India\u2019s richest man.   In the past month alone, RIL bought a 15% stake in online lingerie retailer Zivame\u2014a stake it reportedly wants to grow\u2014and paid Rs620 crore ($83 million) for a majority stake in online pharmacy Netmeds. In a press release, RIL said the Netmeds deal would help its subsidiary Reliance Retail \u201cbroaden its digital commerce proposition to include most daily essential needs of consumers.\u201d   Ambani is far from done. RIL is reportedly in different stages of talks with at least four other firms for potential investments or buyouts, including the India business of Chinese short-video app TikTok, which was banned in India on June 29; and homegrown retail giant Future Group, which owns, among other things, 300 department stores under the popular brand Big Bazaar.   RIL\u2019s deep pockets are giving the Indian startup ecosystem access to critical funds and could help pump up valuations. But critics are concerned that giving a free hand to one company could compromise the spirit of fair trade, and maybe even lead to a monopoly.   \u201cThere is legitimacy to a lot of the needs of the startup sector, but whether Reliance should play that role and to what extent, those are questions that need to be considered,\u201d says Apar Gupta, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a New Delhi-based advocacy group. \u201cIs our competition-law regime strong enough to consider all the risks, and evaluate them to a level where people can have confidence in these determinations?\u201d   For evidence of Ambani\u2019s ambition and tactics, one need look no further than Reliance Jio, RIL\u2019s subsidiary that has wreaked havoc in India\u2019s telecom sector over the past four years.  The Jio effect  Since it launched in September 2016, Reliance Jio has carpet-bombed its rivals by offering dirt-cheap services\u2014at one point making phone calls in India nearly free . The strategy has helped the company overtake all other players in both users and revenue.   The aggressive pricing forced rivals to lower rates , eventually leading them to book huge losses . \u201cThe situation is dire\u2014it is a matter of survival for everyone,\u201d Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal  said in December . \u201cThere is one competitor who has unlimited access to finances\u2014I wouldn\u2019t comment on that, but the situation is bad.\u201d Some industry experts worry that Vodafone Idea\u2019s financial struggles could pave the way for a duopoly .   RIL\u2019s aggression in the startup space may lead to similar outcomes, making it hard for smaller businesses to thrive and curtailing innovation in the long run. These are exactly the kinds of things Amazon and Facebook are being accused of in the US .   Reliance Jio\u2019s control over telecom\u2014the core infrastructure for digital businesses\u2014also gives it an edge over rivals, and raises concerns about the company\u2019s ability to misuse its unique position.   Those worries became more pronounced this year: In April, Facebook took a 9.99% stake in RIL subsidiary Jio Platforms for Rs43,574 crore ($5.7 billion), and in July Google took a 7.73% stake for Rs33,737 crore ($4.5 billion). Jio Platforms is the umbrella entity for all of Ambani\u2019s digital and internet businesses, including mobile apps, broadband connectivity, smart devices, cloud computing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, augmented and mixed reality, and blockchain.   \u201cGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai\u2019s statement is that this is a component of the India Digitization Fund, and there will be product tie-ups [between the two companies],\u201d says Gupta of the Internet Freedom Foundation. That has a degree of concern as it poses challenges for startups that may compete in the same space where Google and Jio Platforms choose to operate.   Ambani\u2019s internet dreams also create risks for Indian consumers.  Data is the new oil  In January 2019, Ambani made a strong pitch for protecting Indians\u2019 data . \u201cIn this new world, data is the new oil and data is the new wealth,\u201d he said during an event. \u201cIndia\u2019s data must be controlled and owned by Indian people and not by corporates, especially global corporations.\u201d   Today, RIL is sitting on a treasure trove of data via its telecom, digital, and retail arms. Its new investors, Facebook and Google, have a wealth of data, too. And acquiring more internet businesses will give RIL even more of that precious \u201coil.\u201d While companies\u2019 access to user data is raising red flags all over the world, experts worry that India doesn\u2019t have competition laws in place that would be strong enough to combat misuse.   \u201cOur competition law right now is not suited to an evaluation of data-side harms and data markets,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cIt does not consider them and does not have the expertise to do so.\u201d He says India\u2019s Ministry of Corporate Affairs is currently evaluating the need to consider data as a core area of competition regulation.  Satan or savior?  Not everyone is feeling threatened by Ambani\u2019s growing clout over the Indian internet. It doesn\u2019t hurt that RIL is making investments at a time when many Indian startups are hanging by a thread .   The Covid-19 pandemic has taken its toll on the startup ecosystem, requiring many businesses to pivot and some to close entirely. In addition, most startups in India rely on venture capital and private equity funding, which the pandemic has made scarce. In March, when Covid-19 cases in India were still few, startup funding dropped 50% from the month before.   \u201cPublic markets are crashing and venture capital funds have become extremely cautious towards their spending,\u201d Apoorv Ranjan Sharma, co-founder and managing director of startup accelerator 9Unicorns, wrote in The Economic Times . \u201cDeep-pocketed global investors, too, have decided to put off some large deals for the time being.\u201d   Against that backdrop, some entrepreneurs see Ambani as a savior. They are hopeful that, if acquired, smaller firms will thrive under RIL, which does not have a strong technology background and will need to invest in young teams to succeed.   In addition, most Indian entrepreneurs see Reliance Jio as a major force behind years of industry growth. \u201cA lot of tech-related innovation in India has happened because of Jio,\u201d says Bipin Preet Singh, founder and CEO of digital payments firm MobiKwik. \u201cMany startups that have pitched for investment in recent years have talked about Jio because it has helped them.\u201d   RIL\u2019s growth in the digital economy also fits with prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s push for local businesses to win over India\u2019s 1.3 billion-strong consumer base. There\u2019s a belief among some entrepreneurs that RIL is a safer option when it comes to data because it\u2019s an Indian company.   \u201cThe reality is that Jio has created the biggest and the best internet network in India at the lowest possible cost,\u201d says Singh. \u201cMy bigger fear is that if only foreign companies are coming and taking over all our market, then all the data is sitting with them and it will be available to foreign governments. You\u2019re joking if you think it won\u2019t be available to, say, Donald Trump.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The move comes in the wake of the looming dominance of Google Pay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google Pay and Walmart's PhonePe were the most downloaded fintech apps worldwide last year, according to mobile app tracker Sensor Tower. Industry reports indicate they account for over two-thirds of UPI transactions. Alibaba-backed Paytm is a distant third, after being the leader until late last year. The plethora of other UPI-based payment apps, including NPCI's BHIM, are seeing their share dwindle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NPCI is an umbrella organization that was created by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to enable seamless mobile payments between multiple banks via UPI. Seeing the tepid uptake of bank apps, RBI made provisions to let Google use UPI to enter India's payments market two years ago. The government was keen to give a boost to digital transactions which can be tracked, broaden financial inclusion, and catalyse economic growth.</p><p>But now it appears to be doing a double take at the prospect of a duopoly of US companies riding on India's unique public infrastructure for digital payments. If the UPI market cap is enforced, it will be one of the most significant antitrust action so far to curb Big Tech in India.</p><p>Google executives in India have been quick to discourage the step in media statements, claiming it would stifle innovation and go against the government's objective of bringing hundreds of millions more into digital payments. The move would deny a new consumer the choice of using the app they prefer. So it's not clear how such a market share cap can be enforced without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>REGULATORY DILEMMA</p><p>The NPCI move and Google's reaction bring to the fore in India a dilemma that regulators worldwide are grappling with: how to benefit from the digital transformation that big tech companies bring without letting the leading ones become so dominant that they can abuse their position.</p><p>The European Union has so far fined Google $9.3 billion for dubious practices like manipulating search results to push its own products and services, shutting out competitors in its contracts with advertisers, and so on. Last month, 50 states in the US launched an investigation into Google's \"potential monopolistic behaviour\" and its effect on smaller companies. The $820-billion search giant dominates online advertising, hogging nearly one-third of global digital ad spend, estimates eMarketer.</p><p>Adding payment transactions in India, Google gets into a stronger position to profile consumers, manipulate behaviour, and help advertisers target them. The world over, consumers love the convenience of \"free services\" like search, payments, e-commerce and social media. But there is also growing awareness of a lack of control over how their data is used or the ways in which their internet use is mediated.</p><p>India is mulling a data protection law, inspired by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). But it's unclear what could be a viable middle ground for India, which is neither the tight control of Europe nor the laissez faire of the US.</p><p>\"It's in India's strategic interest to encourage entrepreneurship and unshackle innovation. You can't have regulations that impinge on that in a significant way. So it will be important to state that objective as clearly as preserving citizens' fundamental rights to privacy,\" says Punit Shukla, who co-authored the national strategy on artificial intelligence at government think tank NITI Aayog before moving to World Economic Forum as a project lead on global tech governance.</p><p>Another grey area he points out is the clamour for global tech companies to store data on Indian citizens locally. \"That argument has taken on a nationalistic tone unnecessarily. Privacy can be invaded even if all the data is stored locally,\" says Shukla. \"We should also look at whether our startups will be hindered in global markets if other countries adopt similar policies.\"</p><p>Privacy has less to do with where the data is stored than what is stored and how it is encrypted, processed and shared. While calls to regulate tech to prevent monopoly and protect consumers grow more strident, the ways to do it are unclear.</p><p>In the pushback against Big Tech, it's easy to lose sight of how UPI transactions took off after Google Pay launched on 18 September, 2017. The number of UPI transactions had reached a modest 16 million in August that year despite its adoption by Paytm, PhonePe, BHIM and several other apps since its rollout in April 2016.</p><p>Monthly UPI transactions nearly doubled to 30 million in September 2017, crossed 100 million in November 2017, and hit the 500 million mark a year later. Last month, the number was 955 million, NPCI data showed.</p><p>UPI scores heavily over mobile wallets in higher value transactions, according to RedSeer. The total value of mobile wallet transactions in the last financial year was Rs.1.84 trillion; UPI transaction value was nearly five times that amount. But wallets like Paytm may stage a comeback if top UPI apps are hamstrung by market caps.</p><p>One can attribute the rise of UPI to Big Tech's money power to acquire users with cashbacks. But it has a lot to do with being user-friendly and hooking users with gamification such as Google Pay's \"scratch cards\". Users get scratch cards for sending or receiving money, and follow instructions for a chance to win a cash reward.</p><p>INDIAN WAY</p><p>\"American tech companies have started to understand Indian consumers better. Google and Amazon have gone the deepest and to some extent WhatsApp, although it is limited by its service being encrypted,\" says Sahil Kini, co-founder of fintech infrastructure startup Setu, who was earlier a member of the IndiaStack team that built Aadhaar and UPI. \"Google is introducing India-specific apps. Google Pay in India is different from other countries. They've established a unit to build products for the so-called next billion users, half of whom will be from India.\"</p><p>Privacy regulators also need a deep dive to understand the behaviour of users to ensure their needs are served. Communication consultant Erica Diya Basu, who is currently researching internet governance at American University, finds little evidence that even civil society advocates of privacy in India have drilled down to the user level to see how they're interacting with technology. \"This space is heavily populated by people from the legal and technology spheres. It's only now in the past year that others from the social and behavioural sciences are being included in the debate,\" she says.</p><p>India has an opportunity to create its own tech regulation framework suited to its society and economy, just as it did with citizen ID and mobile payments. It's important to do it well because India will have the largest number of people coming online outside China.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

But there are plenty of basic, important steps people can take to reduce their risk.\"</p><p>WikiLeaks, an activist organization that exposes government secrets, revealed what appeared to be a legitimate trove of internal CIA documents Tuesday that suggested hackers within the agency had been able to co-opt Android and Apple smartphones, Samsung SmartTVs, and Internet-enabled cars, among other computer systems, to spy on targets.</p><p>Using a variety of tools, CIA hackers found ways past antivirus systems and defensive software and around messaging apps that encrypt communication by scrambling messages so third parties cannot intercept a conversation by hacking into the deepest parts of a phone or computer operating system.</p><p>By Wednesday, companies cited in the data leak had responded, saying they were working to patch the apparent vulnerabilities of their products. </p><p>Samsung, whose Internet-connected TVs were put into a false off-mode and used as listening devices by CIA operatives, according to the leak, said Wednesday that it was \"urgently\" trying to fix the security flaws.</p><p>According to the leaked documents, the CIA discovered and kept secret 14 methods of exploiting Apple devices. Those vulnerabilities are known as zero-day attacks, meaning they pounce on security defects unknown even to the company itself and, therefore, have no known fix. </p><p>Apple said in a statement that most of those issues were already fixed in its latest software update; those that weren't were being quickly addressed, it said.</p><p>The spy agency also collected 24 \"weaponized\" zero-day exploits against Android devices, the documents said. Google, the creator of Android operating systems, did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Of course, some of these same companies have been embroiled in controversies over how they use and collect consumer data.</p><p>Google, which was sued for its practice of scanning Gmail users' emails for advertising purposes, agreed to modify its own use of data following a lawsuit in 2010.</p><p>\"Data has become such a part of wearables, smart homes, social media, smart cars, surveillance, that it's not about privacy as much as it is about disclosure,\" said Jules Polonetsky, CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum. \"These are data-driven products, tools, services, and the ethics of how you design and use these tools, and how people understand what you're doing with their personal information - that's the central point.\"</p><p>Facebook was not named outright in the CIA documents, though WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging service owned by the social media giant, was.</p><p>But just six days prior to the WikiLeaks data dump, Facebook had been dealing with its own privacy concerns.</p><p>In settling a 2013 class-action lawsuit accusing it of violating the federal Wiretap Act and California's Invasion of Privacy Act by mining Facebook users' private messages without their knowledge or consent, the company agreed last week not to read its users' private messages.</p><p>Facebook, which pointed out in the settlement that it had dropped that particular message-mining practice several years ago, vowed to make it clearer to users how all their data and information is scanned, used and sold to advertisers. The settlement still has to be reviewed by U.S. District Court Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland on April 12 before it can take effect.</p><p>Though Facebook is not the CIA, and mining user messages using an algorithm is not the same as a human hacker breaking into someone's cell phone or the TV they have at home, privacy advocates said both actions stem from a lack of transparency and strict privacy regulations in the U.S.</p><p>\"What this settlement suggests, and not just to Facebook, but to other companies in the tech world, is if you tell people you're offering people a private tech service, your word needs to be matched by what you're doing,\" Breyault said.</p><p>President Trump has pledged a forthcoming cybersecurity executive order that would push for studies of current vulnerabilities and the United States' cyberattack capacity. But <url normalizedValue=\"http://leaked drafts\">leaked drafts</url> do not indicate a clear plan for addressing privacy concerns or creating a national mandate that protects consumer data.</p><p>\"One of the key challenges of the Trump administration, which has been very pro-security, is learning how to integrate privacy concerns into surveillance concerns,\" Polonetsky said. \"Being responsible for deciding exactly what is too far or what is not for the CIA to use and deciding when we need strong encryption to protect our infrastructure even though that leads to security tensions is so important.

For most, that's too many to remember without using duplicates, which can leave multiple accounts vulnerable should one password fall into the wrong hands. Using a password manager, like1Password, Dashlane and Passpack, allows users to store a list of passwords in a secure account for which they only need to remember one strong password.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Update your software: </emphasis>Always make sure you're using the most up-to-date version of software as updates from manufacturers often come with security patches and bolstered protections.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Enable two-step verification: </emphasis>Activating two-step verification on your online accounts will require a step beyond entering a password - like sending a text message with a code to your phone - before you can log in.

In the recent Wikileaks leak, it was revealed that the CIA may have found a way around these apps, by hacking into the phone on which the apps were run to record conversations, both written and spoken, before they were transmitted via the app. Still, experts suggest using something called end-to-end encryption, which means even the app makers can't unscramble your conversation.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>during his keynote address to kick off Facebook's F8 developer conference at Fort Mason in San Francisco, California on Tues.

Fitbit's stock had surged as much as 30 percent earlier this week on reports that Alphabet had put in an offer. The deal is expected to close in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google will pay $7.35 a share for the fitness tracker, helping it advance its ambitions for wearable technology. The company does not make its own smartwatch.</p><p>Fitbit stock surged 16 percent after the announcement. Like comparable products manufactured by Garmin, Apple and Samsung, the Fitbit gives consumers immediate access to ever-more-specific slices of fitness data - from their daily step count to their heart rate to how well they sleep. Yet the data has also become a treasure trove for employers and insurance companies, complicating the relationships between workers and their bosses.</p><p>\"Fitbit has been a true pioneer in the industry and has created terrific products, experiences and a vibrant community of users,\" said Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google. \"We're looking forward to working with the incredible talent at Fitbit, and bringing together the best hardware, software and AI, to build wearables to help even more people around the world.\"</p><p>Even though the deal could grant Google a big boost in a market where it has long lagged, it could also raise regulatory headaches for the tech giant. The companies indicated in their securities filings that they would probably need to obtain approval from antitrust watchdogs to consummate the merger - a process that arrives precisely as all of Silicon Valley is under the political microscope in Washington for being too big and powerful.</p><p>Google in particular is the subject of competition investigations by federal and state officials, which are focused in large part on its advertising business. As part of its merger terms, Google has agreed to pay $250 million to Fitbit if it can't secure regulators' blessings, a move that some analysts saw as a critical warning sign.</p><p>\"This deal is going to get a bright spotlight from regulators in the Beltway, which speaks to such a high termination fee,\" Daniel Ives, managing director for equity research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in an email. \"Google knows politicians and regulators have the company in their sights with another battle now on the horizon in this Big Tech vs. Beltway theme.\"</p><p>Regulators could be particularly interested in privacy: Google collects a trove of data about the users of its services - including its search and email systems - and smartphones and smart-home devices. In doing so, the company often has found itself in the crosshairs of Congress and a slew of government agencies around the world for failing to protect that personal information.</p><p>Fitbit, however, stressed that health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads.</p><p>\"Strong privacy and security guidelines have been part of Fitbit's DNA since day one, and this will not change,\" the company said in its Friday release. \"Fitbit will continue to put users in control of their data and will remain transparent about the data it collects and why.\"</p><p>Antitrust regulators have been \"slow to the game\" when it comes to looking at how data plays into fortifying monopoly power, said Sally Hubbard, the director of enforcement strategy at Open Markets Institute, which has advocated for tougher competition enforcement against tech giants.</p><p>\"That's a source of their dominance,\" Hubbard said. \"The reason no one else can really challenge Google in targeted advertising is because no one has the surveillance network Google has. . . . So I think antitrust enforcers need to take a really hard look at whether they should allow Google to acquire another unique data set.\"</p><p>Apple has posed serious competition for Fitbit. At the end of last year, Apple owned roughly half the world's smartwatch market in terms of units shipped.</p><p>When reporting company earnings in July, Fitbit lowered its guidance for the year, citing lagging sales of the new lightweight model, Versa Lite. Fitbit has more than 28 million active users worldwide.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rachel.siegel@washpost.com\">rachel.siegel@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-02ca09e2fcf011e981906be4deb56e01</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDF-PYG1-JCDY-T4F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"716\"/><timeReceived>11:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 2, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001VZA</classCode><className>GARMIN LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Fitbit's stock had surged as much as 30 percent earlier this week on reports that Alphabet had put in an offer. The deal is expected to close in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google will pay $7.35 a share for the fitness tracker, helping it advance its ambitions for wearable technology. The company does not make its own smartwatch.</p><p>Fitbit stock surged 16 percent after the announcement. Like comparable products manufactured by Garmin, Apple and Samsung, the Fitbit gives consumers immediate access to ever-more-specific slices of fitness data - from their daily step count to their heart rate to how well they sleep. Yet the data has also become a treasure trove for employers and insurance companies, complicating the relationships between workers and their bosses.</p><p>\"Fitbit has been a true pioneer in the industry and has created terrific products, experiences and a vibrant community of users,\" said Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google. \"We're looking forward to working with the incredible talent at Fitbit, and bringing together the best hardware, software and AI, to build wearables to help even more people around the world.\"</p><p>Even though the deal could grant Google a big boost in a market where it has long lagged, it could also raise regulatory headaches for the tech giant. The companies indicated in their securities filings that they would probably need to obtain approval from antitrust watchdogs to consummate the merger - a process that arrives precisely as all of Silicon Valley is under the political microscope in Washington for being too big and powerful.</p><p>Google in particular is the subject of competition investigations by federal and state officials, which are focused in large part on its advertising business. As part of its merger terms, Google has agreed to pay $250 million to Fitbit if it can't secure regulators' blessings, a move that some analysts saw as a critical warning sign.</p><p>\"This deal is going to get a bright spotlight from regulators in the Beltway, which speaks to such a high termination fee,\" Daniel Ives, managing director for equity research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in an email. \"Google knows politicians and regulators have the company in their sights with another battle now on the horizon in this Big Tech vs. Beltway theme.\"</p><p>Regulators could be particularly interested in privacy: Google collects a trove of data about the users of its services - including its search and email systems - and smartphones and smart-home devices. In doing so, the company often has found itself in the crosshairs of Congress and a slew of government agencies around the world for failing to protect that personal information.</p><p>Fitbit, however, stressed that health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads.</p><p>\"Strong privacy and security guidelines have been part of Fitbit's DNA since day one, and this will not change,\" the company said in its Friday release. \"Fitbit will continue to put users in control of their data and will remain transparent about the data it collects and why.\"</p><p>Antitrust regulators have been \"slow to the game\" when it comes to looking at how data plays into fortifying monopoly power, said Sally Hubbard, the director of enforcement strategy at Open Markets Institute, which has advocated for tougher competition enforcement against tech giants.</p><p>\"That's a source of their dominance,\" Hubbard said. \"The reason no one else can really challenge Google in targeted advertising is because no one has the surveillance network Google has. . . . So I think antitrust enforcers need to take a really hard look at whether they should allow Google to acquire another unique data set.\"</p><p>Apple has posed serious competition for Fitbit. At the end of last year, Apple owned roughly half the world's smartwatch market in terms of units shipped.</p><p>When reporting company earnings in July, Fitbit lowered its guidance for the year, citing lagging sales of the new lightweight model, Versa Lite. Fitbit has more than 28 million active users worldwide.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rachel.siegel@washpost.com\">rachel.siegel@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-02ca09e2-fcf0-11e9-8190-6be4deb56e01</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDF-VV91-DXXY-3358-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"716\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 2, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001VZA</classCode><className>GARMIN LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That's a problem for tech companies that are trying to shore up public trust while also fighting back an array of regulatory assaults.\"From a reputation perspective, you'd hate to have local officials who are generally more trusted gunning for you,\" says Washington lobbyist Bruce Mehlman. The big picture: State attorneys general have been particularly active[2] under the Trump administration, acting unilaterally to go their own way in some cases, and uniting[3] to fight Washington in others. </p><p>Aggressive state AGs with an interest in tech often move into higher profile political roles \u2014 such as former Missouri AG Josh Hawley, who's now a Republican senator and a vocal critic[4] of Big Tech.There's also former California AG Kamala Harris, a presidential candidate who, as a senator, was tough on[5] data privacy and election security. At the state level, populist movements on the right and the left may converge on some tech-related issues, such as perceived partisan bias and and business market dominance. Cities and states are also showing an appetite for intervening in the gig economy, which is expected to have ripple effects[6] far beyond firms like Uber, Lyft and Doordash. The bottom line: \"There's so much change that people don't feel protected from, and the concurrent loss of trust in the establishment,\" Mehlman says. \"So you have a rise of permission-less players who no longer think Washington should be the locus of global leadership.\"Go deeper: The brewing storm for Big Tech[7]The fall of unicorns[8] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/local-state-government-trust-congress-b820f103-7952-429d-bfea-adf7fc7beaa4.html\">https://www.axios.com/local-state-government-trust-congress-b820f103-7952-429d-bfea-adf7fc7beaa4.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/bpmehlman/status/1175925684272807936\">https://twitter.com/bpmehlman/status/1175925684272807936</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/democrat-state-attorney-general-fighting-trump-6d6d145b-2ff6-420e-a84a-3fe42ec727d1.html\">https://www.axios.com/democrat-state-attorney-general-fighting-trump-6d6d145b-2ff6-420e-a84a-3fe42ec727d1.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/08/28/feature/a-conservative-senators-crusade-against-big-tech/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/08/28/feature/a-conservative-senators-crusade-against-big-tech/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264252/presidential-candidates-breaking-up-big-tech-stance-warren-sanders-booker-klobuchar\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264252/presidential-candidates-breaking-up-big-tech-stance-warren-sanders-booker-klobuchar</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-ab5-will-affect-much-more-than-uber/\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-ab5-will-affect-much-more-than-uber/</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/brewing-storm-big-tech-3e856ab5-20bc-4ed9-9870-cc2903b29d08.html\">https://www.axios.com/brewing-storm-big-tech-3e856ab5-20bc-4ed9-9870-cc2903b29d08.html</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/fall-unicorns-startups-ipos-26a96a98-62d9-41b4-ac1b-4c15b4490b4e.html\">https://www.axios.com/fall-unicorns-startups-ipos-26a96a98-62d9-41b4-ac1b-4c15b4490b4e.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO100095441570300847506251764500201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6J-VM41-F03R-N0WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"478\"/><timeReceived>8:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 7, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Or decent corporate earnings would be canceled out by news of a terror attack overseas.</p><p>\"Kind of stagnant, almost boring\" is how Jay Suskind, head trader at Ryan Beck &amp; Co., describes the stock market's showing for 2005. \"Everybody kept waiting for it to break below 10,000 or above 11,000 and get some conviction.\"</p><p>The upshot is that while homeowners in New Jersey and in many other parts of the country saw the value of their property continue to rise at a double-digit clip, most watched their retirement accounts or college savings accounts put in so-so performances.</p><p>The market's halting recovery from the 2001 recession is thought to have undercut President Bush's initiative this year to partially privatize Social Security.

He uses WhatsApp and loves his iPhone. But there's a hidden dimension to this.<br/> \"I shared with the team at [WhatsApp owner] Facebook that I run my ministry on WhatsApp,\" says Lembong, who spoke on stage at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2015. He recently made a trip to Silicon Valley to pitch Indonesia to big tech companies.</p><p><br/> \"They were stunned. I mentioned to them I appreciate end-to-end encryption on WhatsApp. I said the same thing at Apple,\" he adds. End-to-end encryption scrambles messages sent over the internet, preventing them from being intercepted by hackers.<br/> \"Being a reformist can get a bit intimidating. You're targeting vested interests. You're going against mafias. A lot of our industries suffer from oligopoly and cartel-like behavior. These people do strike back.\" Performance issues<br/> Lembong, a former banker and private equity executive, is working with Indonesia's new reformist president Joko Widodo (popularly called \"Jokowi\") to bolster the economy and bring investments into the country.<br/> Barely a year into his team's stint, it's facing immense pressure to perform. Approval ratings have slid below 50 percent. The Indonesian economy is sluggish as the Rupiah sank.<br/> Some question his commitment towards opening up the economy, citing how tariffs have gone up under his watch.<br/> A businessman with no political or military connections, Jokowi represents an atypical break from the past, although he faces stark realities. He has to deal with a strident parliamentary opposition, which largely remains loyal to his defeated electoral opponent, former general Prabowo Subianto. Policies he enacted will require time to take shape, given the massive red tape involved.<br/> Defending Jokowi to an expectant audience, Lembong urges for patience with his persuasive, low-key charm. He speaks in a hushed tone - as if conversing with a friend at a cafe rather than a crowd at a political rally.<br/> He brings up the reforms that are already being carried out by the Jokowi administration, emphasizing that it'll take three or four years to see meaningful change.<br/> The government is tweaking 89 regulations to make it simpler to do business in the country.<br/> It's aiming to reverse laws that require internet companies to have servers in the country, as well as prevent foreign investment into ecommerce companies.<br/> More recently, Jokowi announced Indonesia would join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement that aims to increase trade among member countries.<br/> It attracted controversy by making copyright laws even more favorable to incumbents, and allowing companies to sue governments for infringing upon the TPP. However, Lembong believes the TPP will benefit Indonesia on balance by reducing protectionism and opening up the country to foreign investors.<br/> Jokowi told CNBC: \"This is the first year. If you were building a house, you would have just laid the foundation. Don't ask me about the roof yet, about the walls. I will do that in the second year, the third, the fourth or the fifth.\" The next generation<br/> Some are concerned that Jokowi's reforms may not last beyond his administration, which at most would last ten years for two terms. However, Lembong believes the country is moving irreversibly towards openness. In fact, there's a slate of good policies from the previous government that Jokowi has reactivated or continued.<br/> \"Jokowi is the spearhead of the next generation of leaders [...] At my own ministry, I was surprised at the number of people who are retiring. There's a lot of retirements and we're now having to do a lot of promotions internally.\"<br/> \"The overall thrust, the overall direction, will continue because of that. We're at the changing of the guard, the turnover of the generations,\" he says.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INCIND-n7988044</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INCIND2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HCR-M0C1-JBYT-H033-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410716</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inc.

The carrier has so far paid Boeing about $26 million for the order.</p><p> Garuda joined other airlines worldwide in grounding its one Max 8 jet after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight this month which killed all 157 people aboard. It came less than five months after 189 people died in the Oct. 29 crash of another Max 8, operated by Indonesian private carrier Lion Air.</p><p> \u201cPassengers always ask what type of plane they will fly as they have lost trust and confidence in the Max 8 jet,\u201d Rosan told The Associated Press, \u201cThis would harm our business.\u201d</p><p> He said that Garuda plans to meet with Boeing representatives next week in Jakarta to discuss details of cancelling the order.</p><p> \u201cWe don\u2019t want to use Max jets \u2026 but maybe will consider switching it with another Boeing model of plane,\u201d Rosan said. He said Indonesian passengers are afraid to take flights using any Max model, whether it\u2019s the 8, 9 or 10 series.</p><p> A preliminary report from Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee in December stopped short of declaring a probable cause of the Oct. 29 crash.</p><p> Officials have provided scant details since then, saying they are still analyzing data from a cockpit voice recorder that was only recovered from the sea in January.</p><p> Meanwhile, in Europe, Polish national carrier PLL LOT said it was considering asking for financial compensation from Boeing or even a delay to deliveries of purchased 737 Max 8 aircraft after the planes were grounded globally following the crash in Ethiopia.</p><p> In a statement to The Associated Press on Friday, LOT said it would wait for communications from Boeing and flight regulators on whether to put the Max 8 planes back into service. LOT has five 737 Max 8 planes and is to receive nine more this year. Its total fleet counts over 80 aircraft.</p><p> Another Polish carrier, charter airline EnterAir, said Friday it would also seek damages. It has two Max 8 planes and has placed orders for another four.</p><p> Earlier this month, Norwegian Air Shuttles said it would seek compensation from Boeing. It had grounded its 18 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft.</p><p> The Conversation</p><p>Boeing 737 Max: The FAA wanted a safe plane \u2013 but didn\u2019t want to hurt America\u2019s biggest exporter either</p><p> March 22, 2019</p><p> Authors</p><p> Susan Webb Yackee, Professor of Political Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison</p><p> Simon F. Haeder, Assistant Professor of Political Science, West Virginia University</p><p> Disclosure statement: Susan Webb Yackee has an Innovation in Regulatory Science Award from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and her research is also supported by the Russell Sage Foundation.

In fact, this decade is on pace to see the fewest casualties since the dawn of jet travel in the 1930s.</p><p> Yet the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 serves as a stark reminder that despite the significant safety gains in commercial aviation, accidents are still possible. And when they occur, the number of fatalities is often large.</p><p> What makes the most recent crash particularly concerning is that the airplane design may have played a significant contributing role. Perhaps even worse, there are early indications that regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration \u2013 the agency that oversees the development and certification of all U.S. airplanes \u2013 may have been more concerned about bringing the Boeing 737 Max to market than about consumer safety.</p><p> As a result, observers have accused the FAA of being too cozy with Boeing. And transportation officials in both the U.S. and Canada plan to review how the plane got certified to fly by the FAA.</p><p> As experts on the regulatory process, we see this as a tragic example of what happens when an agency must balance competing goals. The FAA was supposed to protect air travelers and regulate aircraft makers. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t want to make it harder for companies like Boeing to make money in a very competitive global market.</p><p> And a heated rivalry is exactly where Boeing\u2019s current troubles began.</p><p> Competing in a global market</p><p> The global market for jetliners has been dominated by two major competitors: Boeing and Airbus. Since the 1990s, they\u2019ve been in a bruising battle over market share.</p><p> Competition has been particularly fierce in the narrow-body or single-aisle aircraft market. This segment historically has made up about two-thirds of deliveries for both Airbus and Boeing. It also holds significant growth potential in the future. Altogether, they have sold and delivered almost 20,000 aircraft from the A320 or 737 families since their respective launches in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p> When one company gains even a slight edge by offering a more efficient product, the implications can be massive. This occurred with the highly successful launch of the Airbus 320neo in 2010. The cost savings from reduced fuel consumption proved so significant that even American Airlines, an exclusive Boeing customer at the time, ordered several hundred 320neos. Fuel is the second-highest expense for airlines after labor.</p><p>Boeing playing catch-up</p><p> Falling behind its rival, Boeing felt the need to update its 737 family. And it had to do it fast, particularly with regard to fuel efficiency.</p><p> So Boeing decided to alter the position of the plane\u2019s engines. But doing so changed the plane\u2019s aerodynamics in a way that could cause the plane\u2019s nose to tip upward into a stall, which is what appears to have happened repeatedly before the recent crashes.</p><p>Boeing sought to solve this engineering problem using an automated correction system known as MCAS. A malfunction of this system may have contributed to the crashes of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610 in October \u2013 although investigations are ongoing.</p><p>Boeing has put out a statement saying that it working with investigators to determine the cause of the crash.</p><p> The FAA and the Boeing 737 Max 8</p><p> Even before these incidents, there were concerns that the FAA was delegating too much safety oversight to Boeing itself.</p><p> The FAA allowed Boeing to handle much of the safety certification process, and Congress supported doing so \u2013 though recent events may be prompting lawmakers to change their tune. Reports have suggested that Boeing even excluded FAA technical experts from some of those decisions.</p><p> In addition, recent analyses suggest that Boeing made several misjudgments when it designed MCAS and hasn\u2019t been fully forthcoming with both the FAA and airlines about how it worked. The airline has also been accused of providing inadequate training for pilots.</p><p> \u2018Regulatory capture\u2019 at the FAA?</p><p> This has led critics to argue that the FAA has gotten too close to the entity it was supposed to oversee.</p><p> This situation \u2013 when regulatory agencies created to protect the public interest become overly entangled with commercial and special interests \u2013 is known as \u201cregulatory capture.\u201d Many see this as corrosive for society. The 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil explosion, the largest marine spill in history, is considered an example of this.</p><p> Yet, capture is difficult to prove, especially in an era when businesses must work closely with government to ensure that agency officials have the best and latest technical information to develop and issue appropriate regulations.</p><p> During this process, public regulators are supposed to act in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d However, the term is inherently vague and open to a multitude of competing interpretations. Unless it involves outright bribes or other corrupt activities, business influence on regulators fails to amount to criminal conduct.</p><p> To us, it seems that the FAA was simply caught in an impossible position between the competing goals of protecting consumers and protecting American business interests. In this case, the pendulum may have swung too far to the side of the latter.</p><p> Unquestionably, we want our airplanes to be safe. And, to be clear, we believe Boeing does as well. Yet we also want American companies to be successful, and regulations are inherently costly and time-consuming for businesses, many of which are competing with companies worldwide.</p><p> It is not surprising that Boeing was eager to move forward with the 737 Max as fast as possible. Nor is it surprising that the FAA and other regulatory bodies are hesitant to impose excessive burdens on American companies \u2013 particularly on one of the nation\u2019s premier exporters.</p><p> And generally, business interests tend to be much more successful in obtaining their preferred regulatory outcomes than public interest groups. Our own recent work shows that the White House \u2013 regardless which party controls it \u2013 is more likely to interfere with regulations coming out of more liberal and arguably pro-regulatory agencies.</p><p> The pendulum keeps swinging</p><p> The existence of competing incentives confronting regulatory agencies is nothing new. Public agencies must serve a multitude of goals and objectives and somehow find an appropriate balance.</p><p> Yet, at times, the balancing act by public agencies may tilt too far in one direction. And unfortunately, when the imbalance occurs at agencies tasked with protecting public safety, the consequences can be exceedingly dire.</p><p> It seems likely that increased public scrutiny in the wake of the two crashes may force the FAA to take a more aggressive stance on the side of consumer safety in the future. Eventually, however, business interests are likely to begin pushing back, and once again the pendulum will swing the other way.</p><p> Comments</p><p> Navjot Gill, logged in via Google: That is an A330neo (widebody long-haul plane) not an A320neo (narrowbody, short-haul plane) in the picture. There are people out there knowledgeable about commercial who can fact check these things. It is astonishing how many times the media gets basic things incorrect about this industry. As the author of \u201cThe Killing Zone\u201d Paul Craig mentioned, if the media gets basic information about aviation wrong, makes you wonder about the reporting on other industries one is not very knowledgeable about.</p><p> David Peetz, Professor of Employment Relations, Centre for Work, Organisation and Wellbeing, Griffith University, In reply to Navjot Gill: Navjot, The person who uploaded the picture was most likely unrelated to the authors of the story and working from stock images on file. So I don\u2019t think it says anything bout the accuracy of the story itself.</p><p> Susan and Simon, it seems that issues of regulatory capture would be less salient here if safety certification were handled by an international body, rather than a series of national ones, as the national ones have an inherent conflict of interest (safety vs economic competitiveness). I can see problems with such an approach but in the end it may be the best resolution to a problem that affects people in many countries, not just the USA. Any thoughts?</p><p> EU fines Google $1.7 billion for abusing online ads market</p><p> By KELVIN CHAN and RAF CASERT</p><p>Associated Press</p><p> Wednesday, March 20</p><p> BRUSSELS (AP)  European Union regulators have fined Google 1.49 billion euros ($1.7 billion) for abusing its dominant role in online advertising, the third big antitrust penalty they\u2019ve given the internet giant since 2017.</p><p> The latest punishment means the commission has now issued Google with almost $10 billion in fines from probes into various parts of the Silicon Valley tech company\u2019s business.</p><p> In the latest ruling, Google and parent company Alphabet were found to have breached EU rules by imposing restrictive clauses in contracts with websites that used its AdSense advertising business. That prevented Google rivals from placing their ads on these sites, the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said Wednesday.</p><p> \u201cGoogle abused its dominance to stop websites using brokers other than the AdSense platform,\u201d Vestager told a news conference as she outlined the results of the long-running probe.</p><p> The AdSense For Search service  known simply as AdSense  lets Google act as a middleman between advertisers and website owners who want to make money by selling space for ads. AdSense allows web publishers such as newspapers and bloggers to place text ads on their websites, with the content of the ads based on results from search functions on their sites.</p><p> The commission said Google has 70 percent of the European market for \u201conline search advertising intermediation.\u201d</p><p>Microsoft filed a complaint with the EU in 2009 about Google\u2019s service and the commission formally launched its probe in 2016, although it said at the time that Google had already made some changes to give customers more freedom to show competing ads.</p><p>Google \u201cprevented its rivals from having a chance to innovate and to compete in the market on their merits,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cAdvertisers and website owners, they had less choice and likely faced higher prices that would be passed on to consumers.\u201d</p><p> Last year, Vestager hit the company with a record 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion at the time) fine following an investigation into its Android operating system. In 2017, she slapped Google with a 2.42 billion euro ($2.7 billion at the time) fine in a case involving its online shopping search results.</p><p>Google\u2019s case highlights how the EU has led the way in promoting tougher regulation for the big tech companies . Besides cracking down on antitrust breaches by multinationals like Microsoft and Intel, the EU has enforced tougher data privacy rules that affect Facebook and other social media companies.</p><p>Google\u2019s senior vice president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said the company agrees that \u201chealthy, thriving markets are in everyone\u2019s interest.\u201d</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ve already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission\u2019s concerns. Over the next few months, we\u2019ll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe,\u201d Walker said in a statement.</p><p>Google, which is appealing both of the earlier cases, said ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcement that it has put in place remedies required by the commission. The company said in a blog post that it was making some tweaks to its shopping results. It will also start asking European users of new and existing Android phones if they want to use another search service or mobile browser.</p><p> Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of technology at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/apf-technology\">https://apnews.com/apf-technology</url> and of social platforms at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms\">https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms</url></p><p> Opinion: Lawmakers Are Rolling Up Their Sleeves to Legislate Privacy, but Are They Getting It Right?</p><p> By Krisztina Pusok</p><p> InsideSources.com</p><p> Another week, another hearing discussing privacy legislation on Capitol Hill. This time, it was the Senate Judiciary Committee who gathered recently to discuss the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that will go into effect January 1, 2020, and other issues considering a federal privacy legislation.</p><p> It\u2019s evident that the 116th Congress is doing something in moving the discussion on privacy forward. But in light of the several bills already proposed on both sides of the aisle, the question remains if the regulators will get it right this time.</p><p> Following major data scandals and breaches in the past year, lawmakers of both parties have shown that they are serious about taking up privacy legislation. A handful of senators  including Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Marco Rubio, R-Florida, Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, and John Kennedy, R-Louisiana  have all introduced bills in the past five months. All proposals represent their own model of privacy regulation, and while each of them takes a stand in fleshing out specific obligations and rights, only some of the provisions and ideas may end up in a final proposal.</p><p> So, the question is what issues and principles should we expect to factor in at the core of a comprehensive federal privacy regulatory model?</p><p> The issue of pre-emption, whether the federal government assumes authority over balkanized state policies, is the most contentious in the data privacy debate.</p><p>California has passed the CCPA, and other states are following suit. This, however, creates a privacy patchwork of state based \u201csolutions,\u201d which will likely create more problems than it solves. Inconsistent state privacy laws already impose excessive compliance burdens for content creators and small businesses, making it difficult for these companies to compete with internet giants. Small businesses and entrepreneurs are in need of clear and nationally uniform privacy guidelines to help them grow.</p><p> Currently, several of the legislative proposals could impede innovation and restrict choices for consumers. To ensure the continuation of United States\u2019 success as a leader in technological innovation, it is the policymakers\u2019 responsibility to make sure that strong privacy protections are not at odds and do not threaten innovation and research, and do not impose burdens on the small players. As such, a workable legislative framework should include clear provisions that promote education and innovation and do not punish small and medium companies at the benefit of the largest players, as the GDPR does.</p><p> Clear rules should empower entrepreneurs and businesses to design for privacy upfront, rather than having to wait for a data breach or another data misuse scandal to force the rollback of a product or service.</p><p> An additional key ingredient for getting the privacy legislation recipe right is reasonable data security and corporate responsibility. Data breaches are subjecting billions of consumers to the threat of identity theft and loss of privacy. Yet, despite major security advancements, there is no sign of slowing down the amount of data breaches and number of consumers affected every year.</p><p> A recent study published by the American Consumer Institute, titled \u201cHow Safe Are Popular Apps,\u201d shows that many popular apps are not as secure as they should be, highlighting the need to continually improve the products and cybersecurity practices to protect customers from breaches.</p><p> Drafting comprehensive privacy legislation is a complex endeavor and these recommendations are by no means exhaustive and prescriptive, but they should serve as guideposts to steer legislators toward the right path. The stakes are too high to unintentionally lock ourselves in a context that would prevent us from innovating.</p><p> We have all of the right signals showing us that policymakers want to legislate, and this Congress has an opportunity for bipartisan agreement on protecting personal information privacy. Yet, time is probably a crucial aspect that will influence the content of a 100-plus-page legislation.</p><p>Congress has less than 10 months until CCPA and other state legislations kick in to figure out an optimal solution for protecting the online privacy of American consumers. The current patchwork of state privacy laws has not served Americans well, and it\u2019s threatening to become more confusing and complex for businesses to thrive and consumers to enjoy the latest technology. It\u2019s time for lawmakers to roll-up their sleeves and get this right. There is no more time to be lost.</p><p> ABOUT THE WRITER</p><p> Krisztina Pusok is the director of policy and research at the American Consumer Institute.

The USTR is only investigating the income tax policy as we have yet to settle on how to charge the companies income tax.</p><p>The government has been struggling to collect more revenues to fund its cash-strapped budget as the COVID-19 pandemic hits almost all business sectors. Ministry data show that state revenue reached Rp 664.3 trillion (US$47.41 billion) as of May, down 9 percent year-on-year (yoy), as tax income dropped 10.8 percent yoy to Rp 444.6 trillion.</p><p>Law No. 2/2020 stipulates that the government is able to charge VAT on taxable intangible goods and/or services sold through e-commerce platforms and charge income tax or electronic transaction tax on e-commerce operated by foreign individuals or digital companies that have a significant economic presence.</p><p>The significant economic presence will be determined through the companies' gross circulated product, sales and/or active users in Indonesia.</p><p>The new Finance Ministerial Regulation No. 48/2020 states that the tax authority will impose 10 percent VAT on digital products, including streaming services and digital games, sold by non-resident internet companies with a significant economic presence in Indonesia starting July 1.</p><p>The finance minister previously said services provided by streaming platforms such as Spotify and Netflix, as well as video conference platform Zoom, would be among those subject to the tax.</p><p>We were previously unable to charge the VAT even though many people have turned to digital services during the coronavirus pandemic, she said on Tuesday. We are doing this to maintain our tax base.</p><p>United States President Donald Trump's administration earlier this month announced investigations into foreign digital services taxes it says are targeting American technology companies.</p><p>The US Trade Representative office is now looking into taxes in Britain and the European Union, as well as Indonesia, Turkey and India following a similar trade investigation into France last year.</p><p>Washington opposes the efforts to tax revenues from online sales and advertising, saying they single out US tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix.</p><p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries are negotiating the first major rewriting of income tax rules to take better account of the rise of big tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Google that often book profit in low-tax countries.</p><p>The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) has yet to reach a consensus on how to tax digital companies. In the meantime, it allows its members to pursue their own initiatives before a global consensus is reached, but the initiatives should be revoked by the members if they contradict the measures agreed to later by the framework.</p><p>Indonesia's digital tax is an anticipatory move if the OECD fails to reach an agreement by the year-end deadline, Danny Darussalam Tax Center (DDTC) research partner Bawono Kristiaji said recently.</p><p>\"I think retaliation from the US is very likely to happen, it is just a matter of how the Indonesian government wants to do a cost-benefit calculation when the digital tax is in place.\"</p><p>A researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF), Nailul Huda, projected that Indonesia could earn up to Rp 7.2 trillion by requiring internet firms to pay taxes, but warned that it might find difficulties as other countries look to do the same.</p><p>(Eleven Media Group)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2413996354</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6055-8GM1-DY0W-444P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The USTR is only investigating the income tax policy as we have yet to settle on how to charge the companies income tax.</p><p>The government has been struggling to collect more revenues to fund its cash-strapped budget as the COVID-19 pandemic hits almost all business sectors. Ministry data show that state revenue reached Rp 664.3 trillion (US$47.41 billion) as of May, down 9 percent year-on-year (yoy), as tax income dropped 10.8 percent yoy to Rp 444.6 trillion.</p><p>Law No. 2/2020 stipulates that the government is able to charge VAT on taxable intangible goods and/or services sold through e-commerce platforms and charge income tax or electronic transaction tax on e-commerce operated by foreign individuals or digital companies that have a significant economic presence.</p><p>The significant economic presence will be determined through the companies' gross circulated product, sales and/or active users in Indonesia.</p><p>The new Finance Ministerial Regulation No. 48/2020 states that the tax authority will impose 10 percent VAT on digital products, including streaming services and digital games, sold by non-resident internet companies with a significant economic presence in Indonesia starting July 1.</p><p>The finance minister previously said services provided by streaming platforms such as Spotify and Netflix, as well as video conference platform Zoom, would be among those subject to the tax.</p><p>We were previously unable to charge the VAT even though many people have turned to digital services during the coronavirus pandemic, she said on Tuesday. We are doing this to maintain our tax base.</p><p>United States President Donald Trump's administration earlier this month announced investigations into foreign digital services taxes it says are targeting American technology companies.</p><p>The US Trade Representative office is now looking into taxes in Britain and the European Union, as well as Indonesia, Turkey and India following a similar trade investigation into France last year.</p><p>Washington opposes the efforts to tax revenues from online sales and advertising, saying they single out US tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix.</p><p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries are negotiating the first major rewriting of income tax rules to take better account of the rise of big tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Google that often book profit in low-tax countries.</p><p>The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) has yet to reach a consensus on how to tax digital companies. In the meantime, it allows its members to pursue their own initiatives before a global consensus is reached, but the initiatives should be revoked by the members if they contradict the measures agreed to later by the framework.</p><p>Indonesia's digital tax is an anticipatory move if the OECD fails to reach an agreement by the year-end deadline, Danny Darussalam Tax Center (DDTC) research partner Bawono Kristiaji said recently.</p><p>\"I think retaliation from the US is very likely to happen, it is just a matter of how the Indonesian government wants to do a cost-benefit calculation when the digital tax is in place.\"</p><p>A researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF), Nailul Huda, projected that Indonesia could earn up to Rp 7.2 trillion by requiring internet firms to pay taxes, but warned that it might find difficulties as other countries look to do the same.</p><p>(Eleven Media Group)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6054-P1H1-DXMS-836H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"688\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Th...</p><p>Australia\u2019s media and industry commentators have been quick to applaud the ACCC\u2019s mandatory draft code for negotiation between traditional news organisations and digital platforms giants aimed at restoring the balance of power between new and old media.   The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) today released its draft news media bargaining code of conduct, outlining mandatory steps both sides are required to take in order to negotiate payments for content featured across digital platforms managed by Google and Facebook.   Under the mandatory code proposed, news media organisations would notify Google or Facebook of their intention to begin bargaining over content payments, as well as any other issues they want to negotiate. The code allows for a three-month negotiation and mediation timeframe between both parties. Should no agreement be reached, an independent arbitration process would occur, resulting in a binding agreement within 45 days based on whichever offer is deemed most reasonable.    The code also allows media organisations, such as regional and community mastheads, to join forces and collectively bargain with digital platforms. What\u2019s more, while the code initially applies only to Google and Facebook, the ACCC has said other digital platforms may be added if they scale to similar bargaining power heights against Australian news media businesses.   \u201cThere is a fundamental bargaining power imbalance between news media businesses and the major digital platforms, partly because news businesses have no option but to deal with the platforms, and have had little ability to negotiate over payment for their content or other issues,\u201d ACCC chair, Rod Sims, said. \u201cIn developing our draft code, we observed and learned from the approaches of regulators and policymakers internationally that have sought to secure payment for news.   \u201cWe wanted a model that would address this bargaining power imbalance and result in fair payment for content, which avoided unproductive and drawn-out negotiations, and wouldn\u2019t reduce the availability of Australian news on Google and Facebook.\u201d   In addition to the negotiation conditions, the ACCC\u2019s code sets down minimum and enforceable standards governing non-payment related issues between major platforms and news media businesses. One is that digital platforms would be required to give news media businesses 28 days\u2019 notice of algorithm changes which could materially affect referral traffic to news, algorithm changes designed to affect ranking of news behind paywalls, and substantial changes to display and presentation of news, and advertising directly associated with news.   Digital platforms are also required to share with news media businesses information about data collected through users\u2019 interactions with news on digital platforms. Examples include how long users spend on an article, and how many articles they consume in a certain time period. The platforms would also be required to publish proposals for how they would recognise original news content on their services.   Another element of the terms is around third-party comments. Under the ACCC\u2019s code, news media businesses are expected to gain access to flexible user comment moderation tools, including an ability to turn off comments on individual stories they post to digital platforms. Importantly, the minimum standards also pave the way for news media businesses to prevent news content being included on any set digital platform.   The draft code\u2019s release comes off the back of the ACCC\u2019s initial Digital Platforms Inquiry , first established in late 2017 by the Federal Government to explore the potentially detrimental impact digital platform giants such as Google and Facebook are having on Australia\u2019s media and advertising landscape.   Eighteen months later, the ACCC tabled its final inquiry report , finding digital platforms to be adversely impacting everything from media competition, monetisation and journalism quality, through to consumer data, privacy and digital industry competition. The report featured 23 wide-sweeping recommendations for how to address these concerns, spanning everything from competition law to consumer protection, media regulation and privacy laws.    In December last year, the Government responded to the ACCC\u2019s report with a program of work including a voluntary code of conduct for negotiation around content between traditional news media organisations and the digital platforms. But by April, this had become a mandatory code , driven by accelerated concerns around the future of news media organisations in the face of the COVID-19 crisis.    The draft code of conduct comes two months after the ACCC opened up industry consultation on a concepts paper released in May. The regulatory watchdog said more than 40 submissions were received, including one from a group of 88 smaller media businesses.   A final round of consultation on the draft mandatory code will take place in August, with the code expected to be finalised shortly afterwards.   Responses to the news from media organisations were quick, loud and clear. News Corp executive chairman Australasia, Michael Miller, described it as a \u201cwatershed moment to benefit all Australians\u201d.

I congratulate them for their leadership,\u201d Miller said.   \u201cThe tech platforms' days of free-riding on other peoples' content are ending. They derive immense benefit from using news content created by others and it is time for them to stop denying this fundamental truth.   \u201cThe ACCC\u2019s draft Code of Conduct is a watershed moment; it can force the platforms to play by the same rules other companies willingly follow and it ultimately means they will no longer be able to use their power to walk away from negotiations with news creators.\u201d   Miller said he was looking forward to entering into negotiations with the platforms as soon as possible.    \u201cThis code has the potential to benefit all Australians by securing the future for the people and companies who serve real communities with real news,\u201d he said.     A Nine spokesperson also saw the code as a way of evening up the balance of power.   \u201cNine welcomes the fact that the ACCC and the Government continue to push the agenda forward by recognising the importance of the regulatory and bargaining imbalances that exist between Australian media organisations and the dominant global digital platforms,\u201d the statement read.   \u201cWe are confident that following this important step in the process we are positioned to achieve an outcome which will ensure significant long-term benefits to our news organisation.\u201d     Read more  ACCC launches fresh legal challenge against Google's consumer data practices for advertising    However, the applause was tempered by Greens spokesperson for media, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who criticised the ACCC for not extending the code of conduct to publicly funded media such as the ABC and SBS.   \u201cThe Greens have been calling for big tech giants like Google and Facebook to be reined in for a long time. Today\u2019s progress towards levelling the playing field between big tech and Australian media is welcome,\u201d she said.     \u201cBut the devil is in the detail of this plan. The proposal to exclude the public broadcasters from bargaining arrangements and remuneration means Google and Facebook will be able to keep using taxpayer-funded journalism for free.   \u201cIt seems it\u2019s okay for tech giants to rip journalism from the ABC and SBS for free, but if it\u2019s Murdoch\u2019s content then they have to pay,\u201d she said. \u201cAustralian taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to prop up the profits of multinational tech giants that barely pay any tax here.   Senator Hanson-Young noted the ABC\u2019s recent reporting during the bushfire crisis and COVID-19 pandemic as a vital source of information for the community that shouldn\u2019t be available for free to tech giants.   \u201cHow the proposed code will benefit smaller players in the Australian media landscape must be looked at more closely or there is a real risk of a deepening crisis for regional media outlets and small and independent publishers,\u201d she added.

Other experts have said similar in recent days, as more big tech companies are releasing more data about minority and female hiring (see 1508180055 and 1508120043). And Commissioner Mignon Clyburn said diversity is important and even part of the Telecom Act. Yet sometimes, diverse suppliers unprepared to land big orders can themselves be part of the problem, panelists said at the FCC's fourth annual event on supplier diversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Supplier diversity is woven into the fabric of our national communications policy,\" Clyburn said, citing Section 257 of the Telecom Act, which tasks the commission with \"identifying and eliminating ... market entry barriers for entrepreneurs and other small businesses.\" Even \"if this directive were not part of our federal statute, supplier diversity is important because it yields tremendous benefits to all stakeholders, not just those companies who might be awarded that bid,\" Clyburn said. She also mentioned the commission's efforts to expand broadband to unserved and underserved areas, which she said will benefit small businesses and suppliers. \"Spectrum is the fuel for wireless enabling opportunities, and [diverse suppliers] are the enablers of those opportunities,\" Clyburn said.</p><p>Fernando Hernandez, Microsoft supplier diversity director, said he is looking for new ways to establish and incorporate supplier diversity. Traditional supplier diversity \"is good, but we need a 2.0 model,\" Hernandez said. Comcast NBCUniversal Supplier Diversity Manager Jay Burks said Comcast has a continued focus on looking for diverse vendors to add to its supply chain. Earlier this week, a supplier diversity initiative said that Comcast NBCU joined (see 1508190068). Natalie Robinson, CBS Television supplier diversity director, said her company has made supplier diversity a focus, and hosts yearly matchmaker sessions to connect potential suppliers with the company's procurement team.</p><p>Both large companies and small businesses can face a few pitfalls during the supplier procurement process, panelists said. Suppliers \"have to remember [they] are dealing with a large corporation\" and be aware of its timing, Hernandez said. \"Our procurement process takes a long time.\" Hernandez also said it's critical for suppliers to establish relationships with individuals, instead of just \"pushing paper\" to land a contract. Video and digital communication is more personal and a better way to engage with potential clients than relying on traditional paper forms, he said. \"Understanding the corporate culture is really critical.\" He encouraged minority suppliers to be concise and efficient in their communication with large companies, and warned of reaching \"the point of diminishing return\" if suppliers try to communicate too much with potential clients.</p><p>Nneka Chiazor, Verizon federal regulatory affairs director, said many suppliers will overpromise and underdeliver. \"It's painful for us as minorities in a corporation to take on a supplier and champion their cause and take it to the highest point you can, only to find out that they aren't ready,\" she said. Robinson agreed, and said she encounters many suppliers that land a contract, but aren't prepared for the immediate workload placed on them and don't have enough resources to do what they initially proposed.</p><p>Panelists said communication, networking and patience are some of the main keys for diverse suppliers to land contracts with large corporations. \"People ultimately want to do business with people they know,\" said Eugene Agee, Sprint vice president-procurement. \"You build relationships by connecting with people,\" Chiazor said: \"Do your homework and be prepared.\" Burks agreed, but said face-to-face meetings can be hard to get. \"Face to face is important, but to get the face-to-face [meeting] you have to\" sometimes begin with social media interaction and online networking, he said. \"It's the passion that you communicate about your business that I think is key in building that [client's] trust.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GR9-KKD1-DYRJ-00M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"703\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>August 21, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517210 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&amp;T and Comcast for bad behavior. Pai, the nation's chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. </p><p>Pai doesn't have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality but is seeking input on how to \"approach\" its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net- neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon, which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use, can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn't stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook - lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with <person><nameText>Sen. Ed Markey, </nameText></person>a Massachusetts Democrat, last month to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflixand Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality and last week issued a statement warning that his changes would \"result in a worse internet for consumers.\" Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last month to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was \"extremely well received,\" according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality - Netflix- has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality \"on a public policy basis.\" The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to \"blacklist\" sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an \"internet slowdown\" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a \"site loading\" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. Comedian John Oliver, host of an HBO political talk-show, also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise abstract issue. But until last week, there had been no net- neutrality development to rally around. \"I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,\" said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN44187490</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NFJ-KG31-JC8S-D03S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Its adherents have revolutionised software engineering. \"Agile teams\" was originally only a software industry term but is now used in a number of other fields. It refers to groups who self organise, cross collaborate, and fulfill various functions at once. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those outside the industry might think software development is a lonely career path where a programmer must sit at a computer all day working through code. The reality is it has become a more interpersonal field where people are expected to work closely as part of teams. </p><p>This kind of transferable skill is increasingly sought after in a number of other areas too. Cross collaboration in the science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) spheres is now the norm. </p><p>\"In the past three years we've started internships for our master's students,\" explains Dr Mike Brady from Trinity College Dublin's department of computer science. \"The number of our students is pretty small, about 20 in total, but they're all finding paid internships with blue chip companies. </p><p>\"Our academics go out and evaluate the internship, mindful that the students aren't just making coffee and photocopying. </p><p>\"The companies will then come back to us informally and say which ones were technically very strong, good communicators, flexible and adaptable.\" </p><p>According to Brady, the difference between the technology boom in the 1990s and now is that, back then, computer companies would take on anybody. \"Now they're extremely selective,\" he says. \"There are long recruitment processes which include technical tests and aptitude tests before you are actually interviewed by people. If you get to that stage you will then be interviewed by people you may be working with, a team leader and some representatives from HR.</p><p>\"The internships are like six-month interviews but the recruitment process goes both ways at the moment. Computer scientists are in short supply so students can assess whether the company is worth working for and vice versa.\" </p><p>Despite this level of scrutiny, Brady doesn't think a postgraduate qualification is an absolute must. \"Whether you come out of college with a bachelors degree or a master's, the big tech MNCs are looking for people who are technically good, and above all who can work with other people.\" </p><p>The jobs market in any specialised area is highly competitive and only the best will get hired. \"Students frequently lose out on jobs because they fall down during the application process,\" says Angela Collins from the careers centre at Waterford Institute of Technology. \"It's crucial that CVs and application forms are accurate and have compelling statements of interest in, and suitability for, the position being applied for. Be aware of your skills and competencies and the ones that suit the sector you are going into.\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soft skills</emphasis>In any sector, it is important that employees can work with others and be personable. So while technical know-how is important, people skills are too. \"Have an answer prepared for the question, 'tell me about yourself,' \" says Collins. \"Keep it short and try to include your education, main subjects, final year project, skills, work experience and your career objective. This catches many students out when asked - prepare your answer for the ear of an employer. Research the company and know what they do and how you will fit into the role. Prepare for behavioural type interviews - you might be asked to describe problems you had in the past and how you handled them or you might be given a hypothetical situation and asked what you would do.\" </p><p>\"It is important to remember that anything up to 70 per cent of graduate roles do not specify the specific degree requirements - this gives graduates an opportunity to shape their career,\" says John Hannon, head of the career development centre at NUI Galway. </p><p>He explains that graduates rarely follow exactly the paths they had planned at their Leaving Cert: \"The majority of us change career at least three times. Scientists can specialise and steer their careers towards research and development; they can also work in industry - in labs, regulatory, compliance or clean-room systems for example.\"</p><p>He points to growth areas such as medical devices, healthcare and IT. In these industries, products are manufactured and developed  but graduates also need to need to be prepared to sell and market those same products and services. </p><p>\"Some graduates are innovative and entrepreneurial and start the journey towards having their own business - we need to develop and support this in Ireland.</p><p>\"The knowledge and skills given by a degree gives a good base to progress in a career. Science, engineering, technology and maths graduates may stay in work areas that are easily identified with science or engineering; however it is important to remember that their interests and preferences may change over time in college and the opportunities available change also,\" he says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.1784845</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C4N-SMN1-DYS1-0043-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-12-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 6, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XK2</classCode><className>APPRENTICESHIPS &amp; INTERNSHIPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY1</classCode><className>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FXZ</classCode><className>COMPUTER SCIENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEHO</classCode><className>TECHNICIANS &amp; TECHNOLOGICAL WORKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFC8</classCode><className>STEM EDUCATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009Z8F</classCode><className>RESUMES &amp; CURRICULA VITAE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008X8W</classCode><className>GRADUATE &amp; PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000006</classCode><className>ACADEMIC TESTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CECH</classCode><className>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT &amp; ENGINEERING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N511200CC</classCode><className>SOFTWARE MAKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY1</classCode><className>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIEM</classCode><className>AGILE DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FXZ</classCode><className>COMPUTER SCIENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008X8W</classCode><className>GRADUATE &amp; PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Google, for its part, has been at the center of the media industry for two decades. With that backdrop, Adweek spoke with insiders about their thoughts on how Pichai performed and where we could be headed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jason Kint, CEO, Digital Content NextI don\u2019t agree with the takes that are out there that the big tech CEO just ran over Congress again, or that Congress is tech-illiterate, like the kind of stuff we heard out of the Mark Zuckerberg hearing in the spring, that being the most comparable kind of hearing with a big CEO. They\u2019re becoming smarter with their questions, and I think the staff probably is, too. Repetition of these hearings is important, and I was much more optimistic about the level of questions, for one.</p><p>I almost hesitate to point out individual [lawmakers], because I heard a lot of people zoning on the same sort of topics, and even if we went off that topic of data and antitrust and went into bias, search bias and these other questions, they are, I think, probably a different path to the same destination\u2014which is that Google has enormous scale and isn\u2019t very transparent, isn\u2019t well understood and they\u2019ve built a fortress that is preventing a lot of innovation among companies trying to compete with them. A lot of the questions pointed back to that same larger issue.</p><p>In regards to the moments where Rep. [Ted] Poe held up his iPhone and asked whether Google could track him walking across the room was a reasonable question.\u00a0\u201cI saw a lot of coverage where people tried to make the point that it was an iPhone and not a Google device,\u201d Kint said, \u201cbut frankly, Google can track a lot of that stuff off the iPhone, too.\u201d</p><p>Collin Colburn, analyst, ForresterIs it really surprising Google won\u2019t share its search engine algorithm? Congress seemed enamored with trying to unwrap how the algorithm works, but Pichai followed Google\u2019s long history of not fully disclosing how the algorithm works. I think the bigger highlight for me was that Google seems more open to regulation than Facebook does.</p><p>Will Critchlow, CEO, DistilledPichai was never troubled by any of the lines of questioning, in my opinion.</p><p>Sidetracking into debates about partisan bias that\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0start from solid data or technical foundations were easy for him to brush off.</p><p>There were tons of technical misunderstandings and basic questions, which were opportunities for him to run down the clock while appearing helpful.</p><p>China was the one area where his answers seemed shaky, but his questioners seemed to take his answers pretty much at face value. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t see any really deep questions explored or feel the prospect of serious oversight happening any time soon.</p><p>In my opinion, it\u2019s a real shame we didn\u2019t see questions going deeper into the monopoly and competition issues or into the huge problems at YouTube that resemble the manipulation and fake news problems we have seen Facebook be criticized heavily for.</p><p>Jeremy Hull, svp of innovation, iProspectI\u2019m not surprised that Sundar Pichai was asked about Google\u2019s collection of users\u2019 location data.\u00a0 Today, people are sharing more information than ever before, both actively and passively. Google\u2019s aim has always been to thoughtfully utilize this data at the individual level to personalize and continuously improve each individual\u2019s experience with their products, and at an aggregate level to identify trends. I think the Android operating system is quite transparent about the data that is collected\u2014when I set up my new Pixel 3 phone a few weeks ago, there were multiple prompts that disclosed the type of information collected, which invited me to opt in or opt out, and, as Pichai mentioned, Google regularly contacts users via email and invites them to review their account settings.</p><p>Ultimately, I believe more and more people are willing to share data like location history as long as they see a tangible benefit.\u00a0 For example, Google Photos automatically labels and categorizes pictures based on where they were taken, making it easy to find pictures you took on last year\u2019s vacation at a moment\u2019s notice. Google Maps uses aggregate location information to provide incredibly accurate travel time estimates based on the pool of location information being passively shared by Google device users.\u00a0 As long as there is a tangible benefit to the consumer and clear explanations of what data is being shared, I believe people will continue to become more comfortable exchanging their data for these kinds of benefits.</p><p>Jason Hartley, svp, national head of search &amp; paid social, 360iOne of the main takeaways is the sheer breadth of the knowledge gap in Congress as to how Google\u2014and really technology platforms in general\u2014actually work. For those outside of our industry it\u2019s an understandably complex landscape, and it would be wise for technology providers to begin diligently educating Congress. Otherwise, if government regulation begins, it could be rife with unintended consequences.</p><p>Jordan Koene, Chief Evangelist, SearchmetricsGoogle\u2019s algorithm looks at results and, based on countless factors, establishes which are deemed most relevant. This means that there is probably no attempt, either conscious or unconscious, to provide any kind of fair balance or reflect multiple sides of an argument. Expertise, accuracy and authority are considered, but fairness in a traditional sense simply isn\u2019t part of their calculation. This makes it easily possible for results to appear biased, even if this is not down to any deliberate action on Google\u2019s part. As an example, one study we conducted of keywords related to \u2018Trump\u2019 found that Google displayed results that were, on the whole, more negative toward the president, when compared with the equivalent results on other search engines like Bing.

business.</p><p>High-tech contract manufacturers such as Jabil have seen their results tumble as their big tech customers face an industrywide downturn exacerbated by the Sept. 11 terrorist

from several hundred dollars to more than $30,000, with an average payout of around $3,000.</p><p>JUDGES TO RECONSIDER KMART CASE</p><p>A federal appeals court will reconsider a split decision reinstating a Tampa lawsuit by a former Kmart Corp. manager suing over benefits under the Americans With Disabilities Act.</p><p>The case raised two legal questions -- whether former employees can sue under the ADA and whether people can sue when employers offer different levels of benefits for physical and mental disabilities.</p><p>James Johnson, a longtime manager who quit due to severe depression, challenged Kmart's system of granting higher disability benefits to physically sick workers compared to those with mental illnesses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The industry was quick to react, largely welcoming the suggestion, although some think more can be done.      After an 18-month investigation, a 624-page report and further months of consultation and review, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) finally handed down its recommendations for a mandatory payment code between the big tech platforms (primarily Google and Facebook) and news media publishers.     In a nutshell \u2013 publishers will be able to bargain with the tech giants to secure what they consider as ample funding for their work. The three-month negotiation period will be overseen by a regulator and if a decision cannot be reached then one will be made in arbitration.   The driving force behind the payment code is the apparently unfair relationship between the tech platforms and publishers, which largely benefits the former while resulting in the closure of newsrooms across the country. This is disputed by Google and Facebook \u2013 they claim the relationship is already a symbiotic one and that the publishers are greatly overestimating the importance of their content to the success of the tech platforms.    Facebook and Google would be forced to reach agreements with publishers over the worth of news under the new draft code      Essentially \u2013 with Google and Facebook acting as the conduit between readers and stories, the publishers have lost advertising revenue. And they want it back. But not all publishers will be allowed to access the new funds. SBS and ABC are government-funded and therefore not eligible , says treasurer Josh Frydenberg, and a set of guidelines provided by the ACCC includes hoops such as publishers producing \u2018core news\u2019 (journalism on publicly significant issues; journalism that engages Australians in public debate and informs democratic decision making; and journalism relating to community and local events), adherence to professional standards and editorial independence. Sports broadcasts, entertainment content, academic and review content and talkback radio will not be eligible for any payment.  The industry responds  News Corp Australiasia boss Michael Miller was delighted by the announcement, telling the media it was a \u2018world-first\u2019 and saying he was keen to get into the ring with the tech platforms.    News Corp boss Miller welcomed the code, calling it a \u2018world-first\u2019    \u201cWhile other countries are talking about the tech giants\u2019 unfair and damaging behaviour, the Australian Government and the ACCC are taking world-first action. I congratulate them for their leadership,\u201d he says.   \u201cThe tech platforms\u2019 days of free-riding on other peoples\u2019 content are ending. They derive immense benefit from using news content created by others and it is time for them to stop denying this fundamental truth.   \u201cThe ACCC\u2019s draft Code of Conduct is a watershed moment; it can force the platforms to play by the same rules other companies willingly follow and it ultimately means they will no longer be able to use their power to walk away from negotiations with news creators.   \u201cThis code has the potential to benefit all Australians by securing the future for the people and companies who serve real communities with real news.   \u201cI look forward to entering into negotiations with the platforms as soon as possible.\u201d   Nine, arguably the company most likely to benefit from the exchange along with News Corp, also welcomed the decision, saying it would provide a more equal future for the industry.   \u201cNine welcomes the fact that the ACCC and the Government continue to push the agenda forward by recognising the importance of the regulatory and bargaining imbalances that exist between Australian media organisations and the dominant global digital platforms.   \u201cWe are confident that following this important step in the process we are positioned to achieve an outcome which will ensure significant long term benefits to our news organisation.\u201d   Nine and News Corp were the two companies most vocal about how much revenue was being lost due to the interference of the tech giants. Miller said a bill of up to $1bn could be on the table, while Nine chairman Peter Costello estimated it could be $600m. This has been hotly contested by Google Australia boss Mel Silva .   The industry union though feels the code hasn\u2019t gone far enough and says it isn\u2019t yet sure the smaller players will benefit from the ruling. MEAA media president Marcus Strom says the body is currently reviewing the code and its likely outcome for smaller publishers.   \u201cFor nearly two decades Google and Facebook have built enormous fortunes off the back of aggregating content that others have made and others have paid for. It is a business model that has literally destroyed newsrooms around the world,\u201d says Strom.   \u201cIt is time that free lunch comes to an end.   \u201cMEAA and many media organisations have been calling for recognition of the compensation issue for many years. Finally, those calls have been heard \u2013 albeit after great resistance from the digital platforms.   \u201cThis draft code is a great first step. It is underpinned by the ACCC\u2019s acknowledgement that \u2018a strong and independent media landscape is essential to a well-functioning democracy\u2019. It acknowledges the clear bargaining imbalance between the digital behemoths and Australian news media companies.   \u201cHowever, there are still issues that must be addressed and included in the code. We are concerned, for instance, that many of the new regional media outlets formed this year during the COVID-19 crisis could be excluded \u2013 and these innovative outlets are the organisations that need the most support.\u201d    MEAA\u2019s Strom isn\u2019t sure the code is the silver bullet the industry needs    According to the Public Interest Journalism Initiative (PIJI) more than 200 newsrooms have closed temporarily or for good since January 2019 . In 2020 alone, more than 100 newspaper mastheads have been suspended or closed . Another 1,000 editorial jobs are likely to go, according to the MEAA, in the next six months.   \u201cThe closure of so many regional newspapers in recent months demonstrates how precarious the battle for survival is for smaller media outlets. Regional media should benefit from the proposed code. We will need to review this issue in consultation with regional media outlets and our members,\u201d says Strom.   PIJI is calling for strict guidelines to be brought in as part of the code, including large penalties of up to $10m for any breaches.  The tech platform denial  Unsurprisingly, Google has rebuffed the suggestions put forward by the ACCC. Silva says the business is \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d in the code, and called it \u201cheavy-handed\u201d.   \u201cOur hope was that the code would be forward thinking and the process would create incentives for both publishers and digital platforms to negotiate and innovate for a better future \u2013 so we are deeply disappointed and concerned the draft code does not achieve this. Instead, the government\u2019s heavy handed intervention threatens to impede Australia\u2019s digital economy and impacts the services we can deliver to Australians,\u201d she says.   In fact, according to Silva, Australian news publishers already benefit from $218m worth of free clicks each year. Silva hinted at a bigger issue \u2013 that businesses and investors looking to work with Australia in the future may be concerned by the Australian Government\u2019s intervention and question the dedication to the country\u2019s digital future.   \u201cIt sets up a perverse disincentive to innovate in the media sector and does nothing to solve the fundamental challenges of creating a business model fit for the digital age,\u201d says Silva.    Silva is disappointed with the outcome    Silva\u2019s comments speak to a bigger concern for the industry \u2013 what if Google isn\u2019t bluffing? It claims the publishers need it more than it needs them, and if that proves to be correct the response to the code could be devastating for the industry. Should Google crackdown on publishers\u2019 access to its platforms, or enforce changes to its algorithm which provide even less stability than the industry is currently facing, the result could be catastrophic. Likewise, the ACCC\u2019s code suggests publishers should work together to gain bargaining power over the tech platforms. The ACCC says this is what the publishers did in pushing for the code in the first place. But that theory requires everyone to play ball \u2013 should there be outliers who are willing to work directly with the tech platforms outside of the agreed structure, the power imbalance could slip even further.   \u201cWe urge policymakers to ensure that the final Code is grounded in commercial reality so that it operates in the interests of Australian consumers, preserves the shared benefits created by the web, and does not favour the interests of large publishers at the expense of small publishers,\u201d says Silva, leaning on the industry\u2019s insecurities and providing more fuel to the fire.   Facebook hasn\u2019t made its intentions regarding the code clear yet. ANZ managing director Will Easton said the business was reviewing the proposal. But Facebook has been vocal in the past about the benefit it provides publishers, including through its various funding programs for newsrooms and it\u2019s unlikely the social media business will throw its support wholeheartedly behind the ACCC\u2019s draft.  Who will benefit?  Free TV, the industry body representing commercial free-to-air broadcast, welcomed the code, saying it supported the important principle that news is worth paying for.   \u201cThe reason this legislation is necessary is because neither Google or Facebook were prepared to genuinely negotiate a reasonable payment for their use of our news content on key services such as Google Search, Facebook Newsfeed or Instagram,\u201d says CEO Bridget Fair.   \u201cWe are pleased that the ACCC has recognised that without an external driver to reach agreement or to break a deadlock, the digital platforms are unlikely to change their approach to making fair payment for news.\u201d   Commercial Radio Australia (CRA) took a similar stance, with CEO Joan Warner calling it an important step towards fairer negotiations.    CRA\u2019s Warner    \u201cThe draft code has the potential to address some of the serious issues raised by the commercial radio industry, such as revenue sharing and greater transparency of algorithms,\u201d she says.   \u201cWe will carefully examine the details and the implications for broadcasters during the consultation process.\u201d   It isn\u2019t yet clear how much radio and television broadcasters will actually benefit from the code. At this stage, the primary focus seems to be on digital news publishers, but both Free TV and CRA put forward their perspectives during the deliberation period , including the argument that their content is often co-opted by digital platforms and used for easy viral news stories. It seems possible that the code won\u2019t address this concern \u2013 especially as it clearly dismisses reality TV, entertainment content and talkback radio.   The deliberation process is likely to take between six months and a year, with all concerned parties encouraged to provide feedback to the ACCC over the code. ACCC boss Rod Sims says payments could begin flowing as early as six months after the code is adopted.   On Friday, Sims pointed to the billions in revenue both Facebook and Google had between them in Australia and said that even if Google does take the step of turning off Google News in Australia, as it did in Spain when faced with regulations, it would still be caught by the code.   By the time a final code is ready to be released, Australia will be staring down the barrel of another election and it\u2019s likely more newsrooms will have closed, or at least shrunk. Whether the code will be able to turn hopes around for regional journalism, public interest reporting or news media, in general, is hard to tell \u2013 but without some serious changes, the outlook is bleak.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42747829347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-0KK1-F07F-803S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2058\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Mumbrella</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

I'd like to get everybody on the same team with one identity and try to accomplish economic development like a bank does, with branches. Where there's one brand and we are not stealing business from each other. \u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Seth Meltzer, principal, Hudson Partners Development: I would hire a very large accounting firm to dig into the statewide budgets of every state in the United States and compare and rank New York state at every level, and put out a very clear explanation as to why New York state is one of the highest tax states in the country.</p><p>Sarah Reginelli, president, Capitalize Albany: I'd use the data Sean is talking about to abolish the jurisdictional lines between municipalities here, and really have us all working together. There's been a lot of progress to stay as a region and to act as a region, but we are still confined by working within those boundaries and working in economic development at the local level.\u00a0</p><p>From a taxing perspective, it makes things a lot more challenging when you are dealing with multiple school districts, multiple municipalities where you have different tax rates, where you can walk across the border and pay a reduced percentage in taxes for businesses. It's sets an unfair and unhealthy challenge between communities.</p><p>Ryan Silva, executive director, NYS Economic Development Council: It's important for folks to realize that economic development is a marathon. It's really not a sprint. And it would be very difficult to have substantive change happen that would ultimately change the trajectory of economic development in the Capital Region.</p><p>One of the challenges that New York state faces is the time to market is longer here than it is probably in just about any other state. So, from the point where something goes from an idea to a door actually being opened, is exponentially longer here than it is anywhere else in the country.</p><p>To the extent that we can expedite that process, streamline permitting, some of the regulatory challenges when you are dealing with multiple jurisdictions, so that you have the ability to move through that process very quickly. In economic development, time is money.</p><p>F. Michael Tucker, president, Tucker Strategies: There are three things that I would do. First, I'd begin to develop a team to have one-on-one discussions with the \"not in my backyard, brother.\" I think we don't enter into dialogue with our critics as well as we should, and as a result you get into disagreements and fights along the way. That makes it very difficult to move projects forward.</p><p>Second, I'd launch an entrepreneurial fund for early stage startups, probably $25 million, to be able to support some of the talent that we have here in the region, particularly with the Make Your Space and college and university opportunities that exist.</p><p>Third, I would propose \"five for 50,\" where you'd get a $5,000 tax credit for every $50,000 job that you created. This would be across the board in every area of the economy.</p><p>Marty Vanags, president, Saratoga County Prosperity Partnership: I'm taking what everybody said one step further. So, we reduce the regulations, we get hold of the taxes, we reduce the timelines, we erase jurisdictional boundaries. Once all of that is set in place and perfect, we announce to the world and to the states and to the rest of the country that we are no longer going to provide tax incentives or any kind of incentive for economic development.</p><p>And the reason is, we've reached this level of nirvana where we are perfectly situated for economic development and a reverse domino effect.</p><p>Because when the first state in the southeast, I think it was Georgia, back postwar, decided to give incentives for economic development, it started this domino effect for all of the states. And so all we do now is give away tax base to companies to get them to locate, whether essentially they need it or not.\u00a0This would reverse that domino effect, all the other states will agree to do the same thing.\u00a0</p><p>What sort of industries do you see the Capital Region most suited for in the years to come?</p><p>Tucker: The region has been driven by the evolution of the semiconductor industry. It's important that we renew our effort in semiconductor research because research was one of the reasons that brought GlobalFoundries here and will continue to sustain them here.\u00a0</p><p>Certainly the life sciences, biotech, health care, the Capital 2020 URI plan and the health tech cluster that was identified and developed will also be important.</p><p>Silva: Given the diversity of the technologies and the different types of advances that are happening in the region, I would say big data, analytics and informatics really impact the broader technologies as a whole.</p><p>I grew up in New England and decided to stay in 2003 because there was a big Tech Valley push and there was this initiative that people in the region were buying into. I think those types of consistent investments, not only in the actual research and development, but in the marketing and branding of this region, helps keep young professionals here. It's an example of why this region, aside from New York City, is one of the few regions in New York state whose population is actually growing, which is huge, because it reversed a 50-year trend of a declining population in the Capital Region.</p><p>Reginelli: The idea of leveraging beyond the tech sector is really critical. And because we are a government town, we have a really great representation of attorneys and these amazing firms that are located here. We've got the financial sector here and on board, and it's really pivoting their focus to these emerging technologies in their region, finding ways for those existing strong sectors to support these new emerging sectors and be able to amplify their growth and really have them take root. That's helpful in attracting the talent to these existing service providers, but also really, again, as Ryan said, retaining all of these incredible students that are coming out of our amazing educational institutions and giving them that whole range; from tech to manufacturing to the service sectors. It's an exciting opportunity to have those wraparound leverages, as well.</p><p>Maguire: When you look at the wage growth, it's in manufacturing. That's a real testament to the heritage that this region has. Moving forward, I think this region has a place for advancing advanced manufacturing, leveraging that background we have, but also spinning off of what's happening in Saratoga County at GlobalFoundries.</p><p>But all this manufacturing is happening all over here. We are hearing about what's happening with Momentive, maybe the most valuable company in the region pretty soon. What's happening across the river at Regeneron, the pharmaceutical company. I think advanced manufacturing is a place where we have to really pay more and more attention to.</p><p>The region historically has been held back by parochialism. How real is that obstacle, and has progress been real in recent years?</p><p>Meltzer: The progress has been real, but in New York state, with burdensome regulatory and tax policies, we're swimming upstream. It has been progress but it's a competition. It's a national competition. In a lot of ways we lose that.</p><p>Eagan: A lot of times it's politics that forces \"local.\" If you hear almost any of our mayors speak, they are not going to speak very long and they are not going to insert the words Capital Region into their remarks, because I think they recognize it.</p><p>If I could wave a magic wand, our boundaries wouldn't be so small. And that might also fund government in a different way. Right now, it does matter where our businesses or residents locate because it adds to your tax base. But if we didn't fund government that way, we really wouldn't be in this competition with one another. When a company moves from one community to another in the region, the region is no better served.</p><p>A number of years ago I was at a peer group meeting in San Antonio, and they wanted us to see this new park - where a major employer, a manufacturer, all their suppliers, would be employed in the same park. Toyota Tundra had built one of the first ones in the country in San Antonio. So, we get into this van in downtown San Antonio and we're driving and we're driving and I said, \"Where are we now?\" \u00a0</p><p>My colleague says, \"San Antonio.\"</p><p>I said, \"No, what community are we in?\" We were driving 45 minutes and we were still in San Antonio.</p><p>When you have so many layers, whether it's cities, towns, villages, the other boards, the school districts, etc., it makes it more complicated and expensive.\u00a0</p><p>Silva: Ride-sharing has been a tremendous asset to connect people from Troy, who may not have gone to Schenectady, or people from Albany who may not have always been able to go up to Saratoga. I think we need to look at what's next. And is that light rail? Is that high-speed rail? Is that working with CDTA to further improve the connectivity and the mobility of people in the region? Especially the millennials, which is ultimately every region's goal, how do you retain that young talent? They want to live and work in a place that's cool, that's fun, that's different, where they can have unique experiences.</p><p>Each one of these communities has complimented themselves very well. Troy is not trying to do the same thing Schenectady is. Saratoga isn't trying to do the same thing Albany is. And then you've got suburbs like Colonie and Latham and Clifton Park, which have become great large-scale communities.</p><p>What has been the effectiveness of Gov. Andrew Cuomo setting up the regional competitions for state money with the regions?</p><p>Tucker: I have been fortunate to have served on the Regional Economic Council since its inception here in the Capital Region, and we have really done exceptionally well. One hundred and fifteen projects, over $90 million of awards, leveraging almost $800 million of investment. In economic development parlance, we often talk about bringing outsiders in for a familiarization tour or fam-tour. We have been able to give each other a fam-tour. People from Glens Falls have not been to Hudson, and people from Troy perhaps had not been out into some of the rural areas. It's brought people to the table that either didn't have time or didn't have a reason to come together to identify issues and discuss opportunities.</p><p>It's certainly made it a more efficient process from the perspective of application. I do think that many projects aren't ready for the grant money that they are applying for. But that is not a bad thing because the discipline of going through the process has helped people put together business plans that perhaps the second or third time are successful, or in that process they realize the project is not viable.</p><p>I also think that one of the strengths of the application process that we need to take advantage of, is going back and looking at all the projects that had been applied for and sift through those as economic development professionals and see if there are projects that we can put back into the pipeline and revive or restore funding for.</p><p>Vanags: As the newcomer, I've still got some observational tendencies on this. I think this is a laudable and very strong effort at being more effective and efficient in handing out dollars for economic development projects. The timelines seem a little stretched, but nothing in these kind of programs is perfect.</p><p>My only criticism of the program would be that, with present company accepted, you need to have some changes on that regional council from time to time. I think that fresh faces once in awhile would be good.</p><p>Silva: Given the challenges around regulations and certainly mandate relief, which any one of the county executives will tell you that, having a tax cap is a great first start, but if you're not providing necessary mandate relief, you still have to pay for all of those pass-through things that are incorporated into those mandates. There is a lot of regulatory reform that needs to happen, but there also needs to be effective communication about what the economic incentives actually are and what they actually do for a project.</p><p>Maguire: Let me use the North Country as an example of why I think the REDC has become effective. At the onset of the REDC, there was a lot of complaining about, in the North Country, for example, of the council not being properly structured. There was Fort Drum, Watertown was its own economy, the Adirondack Park boundary was its own economy, Plattsburgh was its own economy.</p><p>What the REDC did was force the North Country to think bigger. As a result of that, the North Country has been one of the top performing regions for a number of years. It was like, challenge accepted: If you are going to force this upon us, we are going to succeed.</p><p>I think the same thing is occurring here in this region. I think we still have a little ways to go, but we are thinking about things in a different manner than has been done before.</p><p>One of the things I think the REDC could maybe address is benchmarking what the cost of doing business is in the region from a local perspective. We've never benchmarked that at the REDC level.</p><p>Another piece I want to address is our challenge as economic developers. When you look at IDA incentives that are put out there, they are reported as cash in your pocket. And they are not. They are meant to reduce barriers. IDA tax breaks and how they are phrased and how they are put out in the public, puts us at odds with the community.</p><p>We just did one in Guilderland with the Albany Place Project. I firmly believe that had the IDA not been involved in that deal, we would have a hotel that would eventually just continue to fall down and down and down and eventually shutter, provide no tax benefit to the community, and become a drain on resources. But by the IDA getting involved there, we sort of set the ground level and stabilized things and skirt more and more investment.</p><p>Communities around the country are seeing new waves of development along city riverfronts. We've seen some of that with the Mohawk Harbor in Schenectady, but 787 stands as a barrier to Albany developing along its waterfront. What would it take to take 787 down, or is there an alternative?</p><p>Reginelli: I don't think you'll find anybody who doesn't have a vision of having 787 boulevarded or buried and being able to just walk right from downtown, wherever you are, to that gorgeous Hudson River. But that infrastructure is there. It's not going anywhere anytime soon, barring some massive funding coming out of the sky for that. And so you do need to look at the sort of realistic alternatives, because if we are not doing things now, where we can, we are missing opportunities. You also can't forget that there are active rail lines that run under 787, as well. If you took 787 down tomorrow, you'd still have those incredibly active industrial rail lines running through. That makes it difficult crossing to get to the river. So it's not just 787. It's an infrastructure barrier there.</p><p>The first inroad was the pedestrian bridge that goes across to Jennings Landing. But now it's working beyond that to find as many access points as possible.</p><p>At Capitalize Albany, we are undertaking a study of an off-ramp of 787 that's underutilized. That skyway project is really looking at the possibility of creating sort of a high-line type linear park that connects Clinton Avenue to the Corning Preserve. We are working with the state parks department from a Regional Council grant to look at the feasibility of that.</p><p>And then when you look to the south, we have got a great underpass that connects the Liberty Park site, the Convention Center surplus property there as a development opportunity, to be able to get to the Corning Preserve there, as well. In the Pastures neighborhood and the South End, there are connection points that have beautiful access to the riverfront.</p><p>So it is really finding those, investing in those connections, celebrating those, and that starts to drive the investment momentum surrounding them. That will then put pressure, in the future, on the idea of being able to have the more comprehensive approach to the waterfront connection</p><p>Meltzer: If I were emperor for a day, I would extend my reign by multiple years and build it all across the river and build a nice pedestrian bridge or maybe a gondola or something along those lines. Every time I go across the river and I come back, it is almost like I see it for the first time again. I would do it on the other side of the river, say 30- or 50-year plan, and at some point 787 works into that. But I would go all private and public partnership across the river.</p><p>Any final thoughts?</p><p>Eagan: Regarding the vision for Tech Valley, and if it happened or not: Next year will be 20 years that all of a sudden the Chamber made sort of this broad proclamation saying we have these companies here, we just have to tell people about it. And the whole idea with the branding of Tech Valley, I don't think it was ever the thought that people locally were going to use the term like Silicon Valley does. I think it was to really show that it's here, and how do we get people here to believe in it, so prospects that were coming in from outside would say, what are you talking about?</p><p>Eight years ago at one of our board meetings, we had Linda Hill, who had been the longtime economic developer with National Grid, and Dave Rooney, who has done marketing with CEG for a long time. We asked them to talk about the perception of us when they go to national and international meetings, and if people refer to us as Tech Valley. She said that, here, when somebody says Albany, they are literally referring to the city. Loudonville, for example, is not Albany. But she said that most people who go to those meetings are referring to Glens Falls and they call it Albany.</p><p>What you don't hear in the news is that our economy is transformed from what it was in 1998, and it's been those tech companies and innovation companies. So I think Tech Valley is very real.</p><p>And it's the private sector job growth. Think back to 2008, 2009, and all the downsizing the state did. If we hadn't done that work the decade before, you'd see how much our economy had shrunk. But we still, in those depths of recession, had private sector job growth.</p><p>Silva: Okay, so we don't have a third or fourth chip plant. We have Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, probably the largest, fastest growing pharmaceutical company in the country right now. Sales went up 23 percent again last year. You have Fingerpaint Marketing, CommerceHub, Vicarious Visions - the creators of Guitar Hero - were in our backyard. And there are still people in this region that don't know that.</p><p>Transfinder. AMRI. A small company like GreyCastle Security in the cyber security world started off with two guys in a room, probably the size of this. They have the entire fifth floor over in Troy in one of their buildings there now and 52 employees, an office in Rochester, and they are looking to merge with a company in the greater Boston area. There are so many success stories. Bullex, which started up in the RPI incubator, got sold out to an international company.</p><p>There really are so many great stories of technology and technology companies here, and I think it goes back to the entrepreneurialism of the Capital Region. There is a really great opportunity to start, grow and expand a business here in the Capital Region, and that was done throughout 25 years of branding Tech Valley, of investing in early stage startup companies.</p><p>Vanags: Twenty years ago we started calling it Tech Valley. Twenty years ago we started bringing in companies. And 20 years ago, it took that much time to make things happen. And I think unfortunately, because of our election cycle, it gets lost. Every elected official runs on the platform of economic development, but they need that economic development to occur in a two-year time period, of which they are in office, or a three year or four year, whatever it might be.</p><p>But we, as practitioners, have to look at it from a long-term perspective. As a professional, you keep your nose down, you keep pushing forward and over time the good things happen, the results happen. After listening to all you guys, I am even more excited now to go out there and slay some dragons, as we call it. I think we have got a lot to work off of now.</p><p>Tucker: There are a lot of things we missed because of the time - sustainable smart growth, the strength of our creative economy, our arts, culture and tourism asset. We talked a little bit about 787 and the Albany waterfront. With the exception of Saratoga, each of our eleven cities has waterfront. And you have horse racing.</p><p>Silva: And SPAC.</p><p>Maguire: In drawing a distinction between economic growth and economic development, I think what we do as a Regional Planning Commission is pay a little more attention to economic development. The research and studies we do uncover that information. When we did our 2016 indicators report, it uncovered a lot of good news for the region. We found that median household income improved from similar MSAs around the country, and we went from a rank of six to a rank of three.</p><p>But we dug further into that. It wasn't just enough to know that we improved in rank, but we also saw that we did have a little bit of a recession hangover, where we actually saw a dip in inflation income during that same period. It's great we celebrate those successes, but we do pay attention to the finish line on the marathon here.</p><p>Poverty, the same point. While we increased or we improved compared to others, we still had an increase in poverty over that same period. Again, some of that recession hangover.</p><p>Education. We are doing quite well in education.\u00a0We can hold our own against other similar MSAs around the country. In fact, we were third highest in that ranking of about 60 MSAs. We went from 59.9 percent to 63.8 percent in the total number of folks with higher education. We also have declined in non-high school graduates and actually addressed that development piece by getting people through high school and getting them into the workforce.</p><p>We saw an increase in homeownership. We improved our position in labor force participation. We improved by about four places in that list. We are making progress here. We are making strides significantly.\u00a0And we have a pretty competitive pack to keep up with when you look at those other MSAs that are part of that peer group that we look at. We're in the right direction and finding our way toward removing some of those barriers.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

KegWorks sells beer supplies, dispensing equipment and other beverage products online and at a retail store on Military Road in Kenmore. The company is a subsidiary of Dot Com Holdings of Buffalo Inc., whose revenue rose 6.9 percent in 2015.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Our business on the consumer side is really tied to disposable income, and if the economy burps, our products are probably the first thing to go,\" McManus said. \"On our commercial side, we're tied to hospitality construction. Once again, if the economy burps ... the first thing that stops is hospitality construction.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He and eight other leaders of some of the region's fastest-growing firms participated in Business First's Sept. 15 roundtable, sponsored by Hodgson Russ LLP. The conversation ranged from challenges in business to generational differences in the workforce to the economic redevelopment taking shape in the area.</p><p>Some criticized state incentives that attract out-of-town companies, saying more should be offered to those already here. Others took issue with special attention given to one industry over another.</p><p>Joy Kuebler of Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC started the firm 13 years ago. It debuted at No. 16 on Business First's 2016 Fast Track Companies list.</p><p>\"I think my frustration has more come from the attention that's been given to the tech startup and high-tech entrepreneur competitions,\" she said. \"An entrepreneur means any number of things, and to say that a service-industry entrepreneur does not have access to the same amount of opportunity for funding through those various mechanisms has been very frustrating for me.\"</p><p>Robert Rich III of ROAR Logistics Inc., a transportation and logistics company, expressed related concerns about various subsidies and funding opportunities.</p><p>\"It's great for us as Western New Yorkers to say we have all the new companies coming in here, but at what cost?\" Rich said. \"In a lot of cases, we're forced to compete with companies coming in here with advantages created by New York state.\"</p><p>See the accompany slideshow for our panelists.</p><p>Why has your business been successful?</p><p>Barrett PRICE, CEO, Bear Metal Works</p><p>We've grown over the years because of diversification into the nuclear industry, as well as the food service industry. Again, growth is about the economy. We're hoping to continue that growth with acquisition of another company.</p><p>Joseph LOWRY III, CEO, RJR Engineering PC</p><p>Our recent growth has been mostly a result of acquisitions. It's also been a step back internally that we took to re-systematize our business to make it more effective.</p><p>Joy KUEBLER, President/CEO, Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC</p><p>We've been here for 13 years and a big part of our growth has been strategically around the world of green infrastructure. So federal level, state level with the DEC. And the indication is that green infrastructure is the way we're dealing with water management. We're dealing with pollution control, particularly around the Great Lakes. As landscape architects, this is work we do very well and we've been able to leverage supplying that service right away. We've been on the forefront of that work for a long time.</p><p>John PIERONI, Managing partner, WNY Asset Management LLC</p><p>A lot of our growth has come from our partnerships with CPAs. We work with 40 or more CPA firms in Buffalo and Rochester. They have trusted us with their clients, so that's been a big reason why we grow.</p><p>Terry GALANIS Jr., CEO, Sealing Devices Inc.</p><p>We've been in business 53 years. We have grown strictly because of continuous investment in the company. We have not made any acquisitions but we have created additional businesses by adding capabilities to our existing customers so that we now supply a lot of things, too. Most customers today want more product from a smaller number of suppliers. We found out that by adding more capabilities, we can grow our business within our customer market.</p><p>Tom McMANUS, CEO, Kegworks</p><p>We've grown a lot because of the craft beer boom. Buffalo is not unique with the number of breweries that are coming online. Every market has that, and we work with a majority of them to help them provide the products that get the beer out of the keg into the glass.</p><p>Robert RICH III, President/CEO, ROAR Logistics</p><p>We are a third-party logistics provider. We've grown steadily since we started in 2003 primarily through organic growth but also through three acquisitions. We're constantly looking at acquisitions, constantly looking at upgrading our talent. The key to our growth has been our people. I think that should be the key to the growth for any company: the quality of the people you hire.</p><p>Jim SPROULL, Partner, Genesis PPG</p><p>Our growth has largely been attributed to strategic partnerships. Kind of like John was saying with the CPAs, we've partnered with financial institutions, smaller community and regional banks that utilize our services for their commercial clients, so we've grown organically. We have not done any major acquisitions.</p><p>Robert VEZINA, President, Life Safety Engineered Systems</p><p>Our growth is due to expanding nationally. We have a national presence. Instead of just trying to grow fast in Buffalo, we decided we had to branch out, so we have capabilities throughout the country and Canada. And the other way we grew is by focusing on service rather than construction-type projects. In the service industry, you tend to keep your customers. So you have a nice base to grow from and can add more services for them and then can get new customers. That's how we grew.</p><p>You each talked about the road map to growth. What challenges confronted you as you went through it?</p><p>Robert VEZINA, Life Safety Engineered Systems</p><p>For me, we're growing so fast that we're doubling every two years. So the problem or the challenge is that processes and procedures have to change and get more control.</p><p>Jim SPROULL, Genesis PPG</p><p>For us, a lot of it deals with trust. When you are starting out in a business, there are typically other players already in that space, and in ours it's large, national companies. Those are the names we have to go up against, so we have to build trust in our clientele.</p><p>Robert RICH III, ROAR Logistics</p><p>As the economy tightens and relationships shift from being relationship-driven to price-driven, providing and proving your value to your customers can be more challenging. I think that proving your value to customers over not just providing low prices is critical to being long-term partners.</p><p>Tom McMANUS, Kegworks</p><p>The rapidly changing online environment from Amazon is a challenge to our consumer business, which is a big part of our business. Amazon poses a huge threat to the way people shop. For us, it also has removed all barriers of entry into our marketplace by using Amazon as a platform. So that has really changed our consumer business. On our commercial side, I agree with Bob that as the economy tightens, we're tied to hospitality construction. I think we're going to see some challenges in the next 18 to 24 months in the economy because we're starting to see some leading indicators of things slowing down.</p><p>Terry GALANIS Jr., Sealing Devices</p><p>One of the biggest challenges for business today is government regulation. The economy won't grow fast enough for us. The economy can't grow 1 percent and expect everybody to grow. There's too much government regulation, too much health care cost coming down on the companies. You have an anti-business government not only on the state level but on the federal level, and it's causing people not to spend money on infrastructure, growth and capital expenditures.</p><p>John PIERONI, WNY Asset Management LLC</p><p>Our biggest challenge is trust. In our world of managing people's finances, you have to build that trust. We've had to do that by actually doing what we say we're going to do. Over the years, now that we're in our 22nd year, it's become easier.</p><p>Joy KUEBLER, Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC</p><p>A challenge for us is cash flow. So we are tied to the architecture and construction world, which means that we might win a project in one year and might not actually start that project for two or three years. So we're trying to figure out how we account for that project as a win against revenue, but when do we actually start collecting? On the other side, once we start the project, we might be waiting another three months to six months to 18 months before we actually see any cash. So as a small business, that is extremely difficult. We are just like an architectural engineering firm. The access to capital has been very tight for us so we're sort of spinning in this very small hamster wheel all the time.</p><p>Joseph LOWRY III, RJR Engineering</p><p>I will echo Joy on cash flow. That's been a big thing for us. We're kind of in the same industry as she is, so cash flow, projecting it accurately and forecasting it - it's a problem. But also how to scale up our administrative side. We can scale up our engineering very easily. We're very good technically at what we do, but then knowing when to invest more in infrastructure, when to invest more in technology. Administratively, that's been a little bit of a challenge.</p><p>Barrett PRICE, Bear Metal Works</p><p>Our customers and our growth mean more diversifying ourselves. That means I have to hire more staff, have to have more people educated and retrained into every piece of paper that's related to an order and sign off on the processes as we go along. So retraining experienced workers is a challenge.</p><p>Some of you mentioned challenges with cash flow.How easy or difficult has it been to get what you need from banking institutions?</p><p>Tom McMANUS, Kegworks</p><p>As you get bigger, there's more people and you need to feed the beast, whether it's inventory to support your growing customer base. Same thing you're subject to when you get paid from your customers. Somehow the banks don't give you that same flexibility, so you're working with that. We're lucky; a big part of our business we're paid upfront so I don't have the huge challenges like the people in architectural construction. But access to capital is always challenging. The SBA is there - it's a great resource but it's also a very expensive resource. I'll be curious to see the impact on the marketplace for access to banking capital with the First Niagara change.</p><p>Joy KUEBLER, Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC</p><p>I'll address the elephant in the room. As a woman in business, I think there's a bit of a misconception across a lot of markets that there are many programs out there to help us and we get an extra advantage. We've actually not found that to be very true. Programs that are set up are at a very introductory level, so when you're trying to grow, you can only get so far. But even access to capital, whether that's through a bank organization or through private financing, to have been told, \"Do you have any man who could help you sign this loan\" after 13 years of business? That still happens; it happens all the time. We don't have inventory. Our inventory is paper and brain power. So that time lag and not having access to capital in the same way different architecture engineering firms might, has forced us to be very organic with our growth.</p><p>What's your reaction when a lender asks if a man can sign a loan for you?</p><p>Joy KUEBLER, Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC</p><p>My first reaction is, I can't believe you actually asked that. And the second, nor would I expect that any other businessperson would have to find a second co-signer for any loan after 13 years in business.</p><p>Barrett PRICE, Bear Metal Works</p><p>The economy is one thing, but the banks are not that friendly about your business. They want to loan you money ... and all of us here, I'm sure, have personal guarantees that we're going to pay back the loan. And when the economy struggles, it keeps us up at night for those reasons: that we have our life savings on the line and we are still here employing people. But the banks will not reduce any interest rates or any of those things unless you ask. They don't come forward to try and help you succeed in business. They want to lend you the money; they're in business to make money and that's it. They forget about you then. They're there for the deal, one deal, and they move on.</p><p>Robert VEZINA, Life Safety Engineered Systems</p><p>For me, the planning for cash needs or capital needs is more my problem because once you realize you don't have enough cash flow or capital, the timing is bad. The banks in Buffalo are pretty good. I've always had good relationships with all of them, so I don't think that's so much of a problem. For me, it's more the anticipation.</p><p>Jim SPROULL, Genesis PPG</p><p>We're in a service-type industry where we need to take care of our customer service, so we need the customer service people in place before the sale so you can fulfill the expectation of the customer. We try to overstaff with the anticipation of the sale, so that means you're always chasing a little bit. The money is chasing the employee side, but you need to do that if you're going to fulfill the expectation of the customer.</p><p>What's your view of the economic development environment? What could they be doing to pay more attention to those businesses that have been here awhile?</p><p>Barrett PRICE, Bear Metal Works</p><p>I'll use my business as an example. This year, we're down in sales. My business right now is going through a restructuring phase. We have facilities that we need to upgrade but there's no alphabet company help or help of that type organization wanting to help me restructure my building and fix it up for the long term. I do my own financing. I'm not getting any help from these companies in that sense. It's more of a struggle to budget my money also, and there are more rules and regulations for air monitoring to removal of contaminated materials and stuff. It's just so costly to stay in business and that's what's frustrating.</p><p>Joseph LOWRY III, RJR Engineering</p><p>A lot of our work comes from outside New York state, and every time we try to get back into the local arena, it's almost always a disappointment. There's these engineering projects that we have a great fit for; we have a good track record. And right down the road from us, someone in Albany comes in and gets that project. I don't expect things to be dropped in the lap of local companies, but it would be nice if there was a recognition of, \"Can your neighbor do this as well as someone across the country?\" and not force us to look outside the area so much.</p><p>Joy KUEBLER, Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC</p><p>I echo Joe's comments. Particularly in the world of design, they'll hire big firms from New York City or Boston before looking at the talent that's right here, invested and committed. But I think my frustration has more come from the attention that's been given to the tech startup and high-tech entrepreneur competitions. An entrepreneur means any number of things, and to say that a service-industry entrepreneur does not have access to the same amount of opportunity for funding through those various mechanisms has been very frustrating for me.</p><p>Robert RICH III, ROAR Logistics</p><p>I think it's fair to say that we all welcome what's going on in Western New York with businesses coming here, but I think as a business based in Buffalo, that got our start in Buffalo in 2003, nobody subsidized what we did. Nobody said to me, \"We're going to give you 10 years of no taxes.\" Nobody said, \"We're going to give you millions of dollars to come to Buffalo.\" We chose to start in Buffalo because it's our hometown. When you see these companies come in, it's great for the community, it's great for us as Western New Yorkers to say we have all the new companies coming in here, but at what cost? In a lot of cass, we're forced to compete with companies coming in here with advantages created by New York state.</p><p>Terry GALANIS Jr., Sealing Devices</p><p>There was an article last week about one-third of the manufacturing jobs have left New York state since 2000. Why did that happen? It's a blue-collar town, basically, from manufacturing but it's changing. You talk about the renaissance. The renaissance in Buffalo is a real estate renaissance, not a renaissance for manufacturing or anything else. That's what a lot of us rely on: manufacturing. So I don't think we're doing enough to bring in the right businesses to the culture we have in Buffalo.</p><p>How do you balance your company's position in the community with what's happening in the community as far as this renaissance goes?</p><p>Barrett PRICE, Bear Metal Works</p><p>I'm to the point where I think my employees see the reinvestment in my facilities and that's making it better for them to have a better-paying job or work in a better work environment. That gives a little pride and security not only in their job but spreading the word to other people who might want to work for me. The reinvestment here is in the infrastructure, buildings, the equipment, as well as the people. But if they have a good place to work, I think they're going to enjoy it. I think I could find people at this point in time, which has been a struggle in the industry.</p><p>Joy KUEBLER, Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC</p><p>As Terry mentioned, the renaissance has been very organized around property and infrastructure development, which has been helpful for us. We're seeing that growth as very positive for us. But I think internally, since our inception we've had a very transparent shop. So with my employees, we do a lot of strategic planning together. We map out the trajectory as a group so there's a lot of buy-in; there's a lot of support internally from the company. When we have those lean times or waiting a year for a project to start, they're willing to buckle down and help the whole group get us through. Some days where I'm ready to throw in the towel because I'm tired, they've been the booster and the support to say, \"We've come through this before, we'll make great strides and we're here for the long haul.\"</p><p>John PIERONI, WNY Asset Management LLC</p><p>For our business, the renaissance has impact - maybe a bit down the road - as people feel better about the community. We may not have a lot of people moving here but I think it starts with not having people move away. So that's progress in and of itself. And then after that, you get people moving to Buffalo. And obviously as businesses and individuals do better, in our field of investment management they will be in a better position to take advantage of our services. The renaissance is helping our business because of that.</p><p>Robert VEZINA, Life Safety Engineered Systems</p><p>I'm benefiting from the renaissance mainly with the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus. We provide all the security for them and get free design service in exchange and that's great. But as Joy said, the employees are extra busy but it's a double-edged sword. We need more people, but they're excited because of the opportunity, they see the growth. That's a big deal for my employees.</p><p>You mentioned it's been easier to recruit and find good employees. Have you done that on your own or have you relied on other sources?</p><p>Terry GALANIS Jr., Sealing Devices</p><p>We do the same as we've always done. I mean, having a strong human resources environment that has a lot of connections within the community and resourcing all those. There are still plenty of good people out there. I think a lot of people have a focus on the millennials. They come to a job interview, the younger people, they're not dressed properly, they don't really have the work ethic. A lot of us have seen it and you see it more and more as you try to grow your business and you bring in more people. You're seeing quite a culture change in the way people look at the work ethic today and they want more time off. It's more of a casual atmosphere. We start talking about this a lot in other companies that we deal with. They see the same problems, where to get people.</p><p>Do you think that's a lack of commitment or just a change in what we consider standard operating procedures?</p><p>Barrett PRICE, Bear Metal Works</p><p>You've got to be flexible, but we have to create procedures and training of people in that culture set and everything has to be done this way and in a timely manner. I can't wait for somebody to get back from the gym at 9 o'clock when we need the doors open at 8. You want to be flexible in your scheduling of people, but the rules and procedures that were implemented make it harder to change that culture.</p><p>Joy KUEBLER, Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC</p><p>We found that the millennials who come to us have sought us out and they are aware of our culture, aware of our style of work, the work that we put out on the street. They're actively finding us because they have an interest in working the way that we work. Finding talent across Western New York - landscape architecture is not a dime-a-dozen type of profession. We have had the opportunity to bring people to Western New York, so we've actually been growing population, even if it's only 30 people at a time. But we've had three hires who we brought in from outside the area.</p><p>John PIERONI, WNY Asset Management LLC</p><p>We've had a challenge of finding talent on our own, so we've had to resort mostly to hiring agencies to find talent for us. It seems like there are no easy ways to find people who are looking for jobs. They all seem to have gone to recruiters or head hunters. You find good talent but you have to pay a pretty fair amount to attract them because they came through a head hunter. If I could comment on the millennials: We share a lot of the same concerns that you have, Terry. Our concern is not that we're inflexible, but will that new flexibility of running a business be successful or is it a fun, nice fad? Perhaps it's more casual, but will it be as productive?</p><p>Robert RICH III, ROAR Logistics</p><p>I think the millennials bring an interesting dynamic to business. There's a lot of energy with the millennials; they're excited. I think they need a challenge but they also need flexibility. I think one of the greatest challenges for businesses that are rigid in their operations and how they do things is how to retain millennials who are full of energy and want the challenges and want to have an exciting workplace.</p><p>Jim SPROULL, Genesis PPG</p><p>There are facets of the millennials that if you tap into and understand, you can use as assets. And you look at the large companies, the big tech companies across the country, whether it's Facebook or Google, they're built on these models. And if you understand that the millennials love community and they want to have relationships and you foster those within a workplace, you can create that energy so that production is tied to some kind of incentives and environment within the workplace. Then I think you can maximize the production and the effort.</p><p>Do you find they want to contribute right away, that they want to help make a difference immediately to your business?</p><p>Terry GALANIS Jr., Sealing Devices</p><p>Millennials are very efficient and they really identify quickly to some shortcomings. They want to do things faster, easier. They want access to information quickly and they get it quickly. They know how to navigate the internet; they know how to navigate things. Young engineers want answers right away so you have to have the technology so they can access the internet, websites, whatever - all the things they need to get the job done. They don't want to wait until tomorrow when a sale comes in. They have a problem now and they want to do it. When you talk about millennials, there's a big dichotomy between very efficient and very energetic ones. And one is that \"I'm kind of going to take it easy because society is going to take care of me now. I can live at home and have health care until I'm 26.\" You have a segment here and it's going to be interesting to see who shakes out where.</p><p>Can you talk about long-term strategies for your companies?</p><p>Robert VEZINA, Life Safety Engineered Systems</p><p>My company is a family business. I have three sons who work for me and a daughter-in-law. Grooming them to take over, that's my succession plan for whenever I'm not enjoying what I'm doing, which I don't know when that will be. As far as staying in Western New York, I love Buffalo and now that it's finally turned around - I've been here a long time, over 60 years, and it's finally going on the up - I'm not going to leave now. I really enjoy the people here, the environment. It's like nowhere else in the world. I would never want to leave that.</p><p>Barrett PRICE, Bear Metal Works</p><p>It's a little difficult for someone like me to pick up and move my business; that isn't going to happen. There's too much equipment and cost involved with that. Staying here is the plan. Hopefully my son comes along in the business and wants to take over. Again, it comes back to banking, through the fiscal climate and how we succeed and continue to thrive here. It is predicated by the personal guarantees to pay off your loans. The banks, they control you and what you do. So to say that you want an exit plan, the easiest one is, as you said, the millennials or entrepreneurs want to create an app and sell the company and move on - let somebody else worry about it. That will be nice for all of us to walk away with 10 bajillion dollars.</p><p>John PIERONI, WNY Asset Management LLC</p><p>Buffalo has given us our business and we have no intentions of ever leaving. I think a community that maybe in the past wasn't growing so fast is a challenge, but I've always thought that if you're really going to work hard, you could do business in any environment. It may not be rapid growth, but I think it just means you have to be better at what you do. You have to be more efficient, you have to be smarter, always trying to adopt new principles and new strategies. But you do business in Buffalo, even prior to this renaissance, and a succession plan is critical. I have two partners. We have always had formal succession plans in place and luckily we have some young, talented people who have potential in the future and hopefully that's the way we'll succeed.</p><p>Tom McMANUS, Kegworks</p><p>I think it really speaks to the loyalty of the entrepreneurs to this area. As John said, we operate in this environment because we choose to and we want to, despite New York state, despite maybe some local regulations you deal with. When you talk to colleagues in other parts of the country and you hear what they pay in taxes, man, it's real fun to think about what you could do with that extra coin. But it speaks to where we're from; we're loyal to this area, we love it. At the end of the day, we're still doing business. New York state still has to be the worst state in the country to do business. So we're succeeding, we're doing everything that we're doing despite the environment, not because of the environment.</p><p>Robert RICH III, ROAR Logistics</p><p>There's a lot of civic pride in staying in Buffalo, and New York state really does nothing in terms of offering any tax incentives - any incentives, for that matter. Why do we stay in Buffalo? Why do we do what we do and how do we thrive? I think you have to have an excitement about the region. You have to be a hometown booster. You have to be all about Buffalo to say you're going to make your stake in industry in New York state when you don't have the incentives.</p><p>Do you think other markets may feel the same about their state because they have economic development agencies that are going out and trying to recruit you and other businesses to go there and offering incentives?</p><p>Robert RICH III, ROAR Logistics</p><p>There is, but there's also a positive vibe. A lot of these places are vying for these businesses, and this ties back to the millennials because when you look at the workforce, they want to work somewhere that's cool and hip. And fortunately, Buffalo has become cool and hip. So these businesses are staying where they are. I think you'll see a lot of companies here that have the same loyalty to their towns and stayed despite unfavorable business climates.</p><p>Terry GALANIS Jr., Sealing Devices</p><p>You look at fast-growing companies and we're all entrepreneurs. We navigate around the regulations or anything else; we find a way to work it out. As much as government or anybody can throw in front of you, you still have to navigate, you're still going to be profitable, you're still going to use your resources that you have as an entrepreneur to get the job done. I think that's why you see a lot of companies that want to stay. I have a lot of respect for entrepreneurs and privately held companies that stick their neck out.</p><p>John PIERONI, WNY Asset Management LLC</p><p>I almost feel like there's a problem with our core business in New York. If we need these IDAs to come up with these special incentives, doesn't that speak to the underlying problem that the way our state looks at businesses is flawed? If they were more pro business, you wouldn't need special programs and the environment itself would be conducive to business.</p><p>What advice would you give to somebody who is a Type A personality and willing to take some risk?</p><p>Robert VEZINA, Life Safety Engineered Systems</p><p>I would say if you're just starting up, make sure you have enough cash to last for at least three years.</p><p>Tom McMANUS, Kegworks</p><p>I will follow up on that. Don't live by your income statement; live by your statement of cash flows.</p><p>Jim SPROULL, Genesis PPG</p><p>For an entrepreneur to really make it, along with the cash side, there are three components that I see. You need this cash for ramp-up because you could have the greatest idea or greatest product and you could never see it come to fruition because you run out of money to actually see that go to market or to fulfill the service that you're trying to do. The third is network and the people you have around you. I've seen great ideas, great money and great people who just aren't connected enough to get that product off.</p><p>Robert RICH III, ROAR Logistics</p><p>I'd say run lean, stay focused.</p><p>Barrett PRICE, Bear Metal Works</p><p>The entrepreneur versus a millennial, two different descriptions. The millennial who is trying to grow a business has to realize it's hard work and more time. You can't show up at 9 o'clock, go home at noon, have lunch and then think the business will grow by itself. You have to work it a long time and you just have to be committed to it.</p><p>Joseph LOWRY III, RJR Engineering</p><p>As an entrepreneur and a millennial, I'd tell someone to ask for help. I'm probably the youngest one in the room, so a lot of people will take me under their wing and mentor me just by default. So take it. If someone is willing to give you help, take it. Everyone wants to help, it seems.</p><p>Joy KUEBLER, Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC</p><p>Thinking back, I started with $1,000 dollars, a computer and a baby on a hip. There wasn't a lot of opportunity for growth and trajectory the way I wanted to grow as an individual and as a practitioner, so I decided to create that space for me. If someone had told me going in everything that I knew later, I'm not sure I would have done it. I think some of my best advice is to find a mentor and stay with them.</p><p>John PIERONI, WNY Asset Management LLC</p><p>You have to be willing to take calculated risks, and especially on yourself, with yourself. What I've seen with some small businesses is that sometimes they start pricing a product or service at a real low level. Because they're doing everything themselves and don't have a lot of overhead, they can get away with that and might attract some business because of price. But a lot of small-business owners fall into that trap and then they can't afford to expand.</p><p>Barrett PRICE, Bear Metal Works</p><p>You're always changing, you're always evolving.</p><p>Terry GALANIS Jr., Sealing Devices</p><p>You have to have a solid business plan, have a solid product, a niche in the market or something that's creative and you just have to have the wherewithal to stick it out. My parents started a business about 53 years ago and they didn't take any money for two years. You really have to put the money back in the business to keep it going.</p><p>Jim SPROULL, Genesis PPG</p><p>I think the importance of hiring the right people as you grow. For an entrepreneur, you're a Type A personality - ego sometimes goes along with that and the ability to take a step back and say, \"I'm actually going to hire people who are smarter than me and better at specific things.\" Along the way, it will make the best organization.</p><p>Give us your vision for the next three to five years for your business and what you see happening in Western New York.</p><p>Terry GALANIS Jr., Sealing Devices</p><p>Any business can grow as long as they have an appetite to grow, an incentive to grow. For us, I see the next three years as being strong for us because we've invested in the last five years. There are technologies now that will lead us into different markets. Our challenge now is to get the right people in to go to those markets and seek out the business.</p><p>John PIERONI, WNY Asset Management LLC</p><p>Business looks good for us in the upcoming years. We've always grown organically but, in our industry, a lot of our peers are reaching retirement age and looking for exit strategies. They might not have a large enough firm to transition internally, so they'll need to be bought out. We are looking for acquisitions over the next three to five years to help grow our business.</p><p>Tom McMANUS, Kegworks</p><p>In the short term, I'm concerned about growth. Our business on the consumer side is really tied to disposable income, and if the economy burps, our products are probably the first to go. On our commercial side, we're tied to hospitality construction. Once again, if the economy burps or something longer term, the first thing that stops is hospitality construction. In the long term, we just have to innovate.</p><p>Joy KUEBLER, Joy Kuebler Landscape Architect PC</p><p>We're actively in a retooling phase.We had tremendous growth and now we've taken that step back, sort of that half-step back to say, \"We need to retool and look at the lay of the land before we keep barreling forward.\" That's our short term. Our long term, at 20 years we'd like to be at 25 people and have planners and engineers as well as landscape architects.</p><p>Robert RICH III, ROAR Logistics</p><p>Being in the transportation industry, our business sort of ebbs and flows with the economy and how other businesses are doing. I see the future is going to be comprised of further organic growth. Hopefully as Western New York takes off, we'll see more opportunities to do business out of Western New York. We realize that we have six offices nationally now, 120 agents around the world. For us, we have to look at acquisitions.</p><p>Joseph LOWRY III, RJR Engineering</p><p>We see more growth in the next three years. Our growth hasn't just been for the sake of growth, it's been with an end goal. We want to be a certain size of business to give us the capabilities to do a certain type of project. But we chose to jump-start that with acquisitions. In the past year or so we've doubled the size of our company, so now it's more of an organic strategy. We're going to take it to grow organically and build up, rebuild the foundation under our company.</p><p>Jim SPROULL, Genesis PPG</p><p>We see great growth potential for our company but, at the same time, we're always analyzing threats. One thing we're always looking at is our industry is largely being commoditized, so people just price shop, price shop, price shop. There's an undercutting or a race to zero in at some level of the products that we offer. We are continually trying to innovate and look at other things we can add, other services, things that are intangible to our customers that you can't put a price on and let those come to the forefront so that we continue to grow.</p><p>Barrett PRICE, Bear Metal Works</p><p>I'm going to use a different term. It's not growth, it's rebound. We have flatlined because of oil in the manufacturing sector. That needs to rebound to give the trickle-down to manufacturing and then we will have tremendous growth.</p><p>Robert VEZINA, Life Safety Engineered Systems</p><p>I anticipate that we will continue to grow at the same rate for the next three to five years. We're in facility maintenance and loss prevention. Both those things don't require the economy to be robust.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

A wide dispersion in outcomes for regions, sectors and individual companies means selectivity will be key to capturing the long-term value creation. Identifying survivors and winners while avoiding value destruction in harder-hit segments will require detailed knowledge of companies and sectors. This means being nimble and adjusting investment approach and asset allocations as we move through different phases of the crisis and recovery. Equity valuations and opportunities The near-term uncertainty and indiscriminate selling resulted in major price anomalies, particularly for high quality businesses where earnings and dividends could start to normalise as lockdown restrictions are lifted. </p><p>The nature of this crisis is very different to almost any other - companies that proved resilient in the Global Financial Crisis have seen parts or all of their business shuttered overnight. Understanding their capacity to manage this situation through access to funding and the ability to manage their cost base is vital and requires a deep understanding of the company and the industry in which it operates. Companies with the most sustainable financial structures tend to perform better in highly uncertain environments and take market share from struggling competitors. This provides some protection from downside risks as well as offering an upside in the recovery phase. Companies exposed to global and Chinese growth trends should be able to recover more quickly. Fixed income valuations and opportunities Both liquidity and valuations in the credit markets have responded positively to massive policy interventions, although Developed Market government bond yields remain near historical lows. Credit spreads globally have recovered significantly, and liquidity and market access for bond issuers have improved. Valuations post the rally reflect a desire to 'look through' the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, warranting some caution and selectiveness. However, we believe parts of the high yield market compensate for the increased default risk and offer attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term, even if volatility remains elevated as we move through the crisis. Credit rating downgrades will continue in the coming months, with rating agencies lagging corporate stress as they update their assessments. Some of the fallen angel credits - investment grade companies downgraded to high yield - are providing opportunities, particularly those that can deleverage and eventually return to investment grade and/or benefit from central bank purchases targeted at BB-rated securities. Regional disparities Differing speeds and conditions of normalisation will create winners and losers at the country level and over different time horizons. Allocating capital in a way that is sensitive to recovery rates and learning from recovery trajectories can offer opportunities. Longer-term, demographics remain a relatively predictable and central input into investment outcomes. Countries with youthful populations and growing middle classes will have consumption tailwinds, first in technology, and later in leisure and travel. Countries with ageing populations will require investment in healthcare and technology solutions. We believe that Asia, with its faster normalisation and young populations, offers some of the best long-term growth opportunities, particularly in insurance and healthcare. We are more concerned about non-Asian emerging market countries given their more limited resources in responding to the crisis. Globalisation to 'indigenisation' The conditions of globalisation were already changing before Covid-19 - most clearly reflected in the US-China trade war. That shift has been accelerated by the Covid-19 shock testing supply chains in healthcare and pharmaceuticals, food supply chains and technology infrastructure. These sectors will be increasingly treated as areas of national security, with sourcing brought inside country borders or regional blocs. They will also be subjected to increased regulation and oversight, giving them characteristics closer to the utility or defence industries. While more regulation could lead to lower profits over time, it is also likely to create more stable earnings and cash flows, potentially benefiting valuations. These sectors should prove to be winners, but due to less physical travel between and within countries, travel and leisure, lodging, transport and cross-border education could be impaired. Technological revolutions in consumer behaviour The lockdowns have forced consumption away from physical retail and towards e-commerce and home delivery. The shift is especially visible in online food retail, where adoption was previously slow but is now experiencing a step-change in pace that we expect will persist after the lockdowns. Consumers are also paying more attention to their well-being, benefiting sporting goods and companies that improve quality of life. Leisure travel will eventually resume, particularly among younger people, but with more concern around the safety and quality of destinations and accommodation. People are adapting to working from home and we will probably see consumers investing in their home offices and digital equipment as a result. Telecommunications, technology and connectivity should be long-term winners, as well as contactless payments, education and medical consultations. More broadly, many activities which have been forced online such as face-to-face work meetings, gym workouts and grocery shopping will continue post-lockdown as people enjoy time and cost savings. Companies that own the platforms used for these services and the connectivity/infrastructure providers that deliver them will benefit. Connectivity providers could also be elevated to greater national importance, receiving increased investment. Europe is behind the US and China in adapting networks for the next telecommunication standard (5G), but post-pandemic it could receive more attention, given the likely increase in online activity. Covid-19 has reframed the debates around online privacy and the dominance of 'Big Tech'. The crisis has brought to prominence how critical the technology giants are in modern society, most clearly seen in the approval of Amazon's investment into Deliveroo because food delivery is deemed an essential service. Another example is China's ubiquitous video surveillance that is perceived negatively in Europe and North America but enabled China to contact-trace effectively and enforce lockdowns. That perception could evolve through the crisis, creating opportunities for a number of technology companies. Healthcare The healthcare industry is set to change in several ways. Firstly, pharmaceutical and biotech companies are at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic and could find political and pricing pressures ease given their role. Another area that is set to benefit is diagnostics. Diagnostics are a cost-effective and crucial way to identify the spread of the virus and we expect greater investment in this area in the future. Telemedicine, the practice of caring for patients remotely, has seen a significant increase in demand and this should continue in the longer-term as part of ongoing investment in healthcare IT and digitalisation. Finally, the crisis has shown that some hospital systems are underfunded, and it's reasonable to expect increased investment in the future to ensure they are better prepared for pandemics. The costs of this will be low compared to the economic destruction that can occur from lockdowns. The new economic order - download the full whitepaper We believe the Covid-19 crisis will trigger a step-change in policy, accelerate existing trends and transform investment frameworks. Government intervention, fiscal activism, corporate governance and sustainability, and continued Asian economic strength will characterise this new order, creating opportunities out of dislocation.

Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future returns. Investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon. Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the value of investments in overseas markets. Investments in small and emerging markets can also be more volatile than other more developed markets. The value of bonds is influenced by movements in interest rates and bond yields. If interest rates and so bond yields rise, bond prices tend to fall, and vice versa. The price of bonds with a longer lifetime until maturity is generally more sensitive to interest rate movements than those with a shorter lifetime to maturity. The risk of default is based on the issuers ability to make interest payments and to repay the loan at maturity. Default risk may therefore vary between government issuers as well as between different corporate issuers. Reference in this document to specific securities should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy or sell these securities, but is included for the purposes of illustration only.

Companies with the most sustainable financial structures tend to perform better in highly uncertain environments and take market share from struggling competitors. This provides some protection from downside risks as well as offering an upside in the recovery phase. Companies exposed to global and Chinese growth trends should be able to recover more quickly. Fixed income valuations and opportunities Both liquidity and valuations in the credit markets have responded positively to massive policy interventions, although Developed Market government bond yields remain near historical lows. Credit spreads globally have recovered significantly, and liquidity and market access for bond issuers have improved. Valuations post the rally reflect a desire to 'look through' the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, warranting some caution and selectiveness. However, we believe parts of the high yield market compensate for the increased default risk and offer attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term, even if volatility remains elevated as we move through the crisis. Credit rating downgrades will continue in the coming months, with rating agencies lagging corporate stress as they update their assessments. Some of the fallen angel credits - investment grade companies downgraded to high yield - are providing opportunities, particularly those that can deleverage and eventually return to investment grade and/or benefit from central bank purchases targeted at BB-rated securities. Regional disparities Differing speeds and conditions of normalisation will create winners and losers at the country level and over different time horizons. Allocating capital in a way that is sensitive to recovery rates and learning from recovery trajectories can offer opportunities. Longer-term, demographics remain a relatively predictable and central input into investment outcomes. Countries with youthful populations and growing middle classes will have consumption tailwinds, first in technology, and later in leisure and travel. Countries with ageing populations will require investment in healthcare and technology solutions. We believe that Asia, with its faster normalisation and young populations, offers some of the best long-term growth opportunities, particularly in insurance and healthcare. We are more concerned about non-Asian emerging market countries given their more limited resources in responding to the crisis. Globalisation to 'indigenisation' The conditions of globalisation were already changing before Covid-19 - most clearly reflected in the US-China trade war. That shift has been accelerated by the Covid-19 shock testing supply chains in healthcare and pharmaceuticals, food supply chains and technology infrastructure.

Technological revolutions in consumer behaviour The lockdowns have forced consumption away from physical retail and towards e-commerce and home delivery. The shift is especially visible in online food retail, where adoption was previously slow but is now experiencing a step-change in pace that we expect will persist after the lockdowns. Consumers are also paying more attention to their well-being, benefiting sporting goods and companies that improve quality of life. Leisure travel will eventually resume, particularly among younger people, but with more concern around the safety and quality of destinations and accommodation. People are adapting to working from home and we will probably see consumers investing in their home offices and digital equipment as a result. Telecommunications, technology and connectivity should be long-term winners, as well as contactless payments, education and medical consultations. More broadly, many activities which have been forced online such as face-to-face work meetings, gym workouts and grocery shopping will continue post-lockdown as people enjoy time and cost savings. Companies that own the platforms used for these services and the connectivity/infrastructure providers that deliver them will benefit. Connectivity providers could also be elevated to greater national importance, receiving increased investment. Europe is behind the US and China in adapting networks for the next telecommunication standard (5G), but post-pandemic it could receive more attention, given the likely increase in online activity.

Firstly, pharmaceutical and biotech companies are at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic and could find political and pricing pressures ease given their role. Another area that is set to benefit is diagnostics. Diagnostics are a cost-effective and crucial way to identify the spread of the virus and we expect greater investment in this area in the future.

These days, it seems like exposure of consumers\u2019 sensitive, personal information is turning into a regular occurrence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The current news cycle is dominated by the most recent revelations involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, but similar incidents may be on the horizon: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that more bad actors will be discovered. Perhaps this is why Facebook suspended CubeYou, another company harvesting Facebook users\u2019 private information.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Facebook isn\u2019t the only Silicon Valley company facing consumer privacy issues; Google\u2019s YouTube service is being accused of illegally collecting behavioral data on children under the age of 12.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And let us not forget about the data hacks at Equifax, Target or the U.S. government\u2019s Office of Personnel Management. With so many data breaches and privacy violations happening on what feels like a routine basis, one starts to forget who did what to how many millions of Americans. It\u2019s a data tsunami with no end in sight.</p><p>How can so many companies mishandle so much private data yet remain immune to customer dissatisfaction, and ultimately, regulation? After last week\u2019s hearings on Facebook, the answer is pretty clear: policymakers with jurisdiction over the tech sector are operating in the dark. They have little to no understanding of how tech companies make money or how ad-supported business models work. And until last week, they were focused on an issue their constituents don\u2019t seem to care about, at the expense of focusing on how to protect consumers\u2019 private information online.</p><p>Three weeks ago, policymakers in Washington were focused on which archaic section of the U.S. Communications Act of 1934 should be used to codify \"net neutrality\u201d into law. Big Tech has been a vocal advocate for net neutrality rules, so long as they only apply to internet service providers (ISPs). Crippling competition via regulation: a classic regulatory arbitrage play.</p><p>Unfortunately, numerous lawmakers were either unable or unwilling to see through the rhetoric and fell for Big Tech\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t regulate us, regulate our competitors\u201d mantra. But just like most politicians and pundits misread American voters during the 2016 Presidential election, so too are they misreading their constituents on the issues of net neutrality and privacy.</p><p>American consumers want\u2014and expect\u2014the basic net neutrality principles of no blocking, throttling or discrimination to apply equally to all players across the internet ecosystem, network operators and tech companies alike.</p><p>According to a recent Recon Analytics survey, 83% of American consumers believe that ISPs and tech companies must play by the same net neutrality rules. The same number of consumers support legislation that would enshrine net neutrality rules that apply to both network operators and edge providers. An even greater number of American consumers\u201488%\u2014believe federal legislation is needed to make Big Tech more transparent about the data they collect on users &amp; what they do with that data.</p><p>With the Facebook revelations having captured the attention of both citizens and lawmakers the question now is what will come out of this increased focus by way of actual regulation? In all likelihood, nothing that would materially impact edge companies\u2019 business models or revenue streams.</p><p>While Big Tech may emerge unscathed today, a far-reaching regulatory response\u2014one that impacts the entire internet ecosystem, not just Facebook, Google et al\u2014is just a scandal away. This underscores the importance and the need for policymakers to understand ad-supported business models.</p><p>Google and Facebook understand that the highest barrier to consumer usage of a product or service is cost. Remove that barrier\u2014make a product or service free\u2014and the potential market for said product or service increases drastically.</p><p>Google Maps, for example, is a free service. It\u2019s also a major revenue driver for Google parent company Alphabet Inc. By 2020, Maps is projected to\u00a0generate $5B in incremental revenue for Google, according to some estimates. How does this free service make money? In lieu of charging fees for usage Google collects information on Maps and monetizes that data via targeted online advertising to recoup costs related to developing, maintaining and managing the Maps platform.</p><p>What types of information does Google collect on Maps users, and indeed, users of all of Google\u2019s other platforms and services? It is not only who they are, but also everything they do: what websites they visit; what diseases they search for; the messages they send; the calls they make and receive; friends they've deleted from social networks; appointments they've made. The list is extensive and creepy.</p><p>For example, Google\u2019s Android OS for mobile devices collects where you are every three minutes, stores that information, analyzes it, and then sells it to anyone interested in being able to geo-target their ads to you. With all your location, demographic, and search information, Google and Facebook <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/technology/personaltech/i-downloaded-the-information-that-facebook-has-on-me-yikes.html\">know more about you</url> than even your best friend.</p><p>In 2017, Google generated $110 billion in revenues, with the vast majority of that coming from advertising. To add insult to injury, when searching for current events, the top search results prominently feature state-controlled foreign media like RT (Russia Today) and Sputnik. The same year, Facebook took in $40 billion for allowing companies and foreign government-controlled entities to target Facebook users.</p><p>The complete lack of transparency around Big Tech\u2019s collection and sale of consumers\u2019 personal data can and must be addressed by regulators. Only 20% of respondents to our survey knew how much revenue Google and Facebook brought in from selling consumers\u2019 private information to advertisers.</p><p>No one should fall for the usual claims of \u201ctoo hard to explain\u201d or \u201ctoo technical to regulate.\u201d The companies know or should know with whom they are doing business and on what terms. Imposing more transparency obligations on Big Tech can only be a good thing, for consumers and for advertisers who have begun ringing the alarm bell about how little insight they have into whether their ads are being seen and/or are compelling consumers to act.</p><p>Second, there ought to be a restriction on Big Tech being able to sell consumers\u2019 private information to foreign governments or their proxies. Never, not for any reason.</p><p>Third, Congress should eliminate the regulatory asymmetry that has plagued the internet ecosystem for decades and let all these players go after each other on equal terms. Big Tech and broadband network operators are not operating in distinct, separate silos anymore.</p><p>Almost every year, the executives of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon are voted the among most powerful executives in telecom, often ahead of their network operator peers. Their companies are larger by market capitalization than any telecom provider\u2014Google\u2019s parent Alphabet has a market cap of $719 billion and Facebook's is\u00a0 $479 billion, which is a more than the market cap of AT&amp;T ($216 billion) and Verizon ($194 billion) combined.</p><p>These companies\u00a0engage in intermodal competition for customers every day. For example, the combined competitive onslaught of Amazon, Google and Microsoft forced all the telecom companies to exit the data center business.</p><p>To the extent the FTC needs more clearly defined powers to enforce consistent and uniform privacy protections across the internet ecosystem, Congress should get busy and make it happen. This is especially important in light of the states moving to erect digital barriers at state borders, potentially balkanizing the internet it into 50+ fiefdoms with their own and different privacy protections.</p><p>As we see the internet, media and telecom industries converging, regulators need to ensure the rules of the road align with the competitive realities of the marketplace. Consider the dominant position that Google and Facebook have in digital advertising\u2014more than 90% of every dollar spent on digital advertising goes to one of the two. U.S. regulators need to focus on ways to fuel competition in the digital ad market.</p><p>Post-midterm elections, regardless of which party controls Congress, attention will move beyond the privacy crisis of the day and be replaced by political jockeying leading into the 2020 Presidential election. Any inkling of bipartisanship that currently exists to restore consumers\u2019 confidence in the internet economy will vanish, and we will be stuck with the framework of \u201ctrust us\u201d and \u201cdo no evil\u201d that has failed to prevent the egregious hacks and privacy violations we\u2019ve been reading about.</p><p>The FTC will likely pursue a detailed and lengthy investigation of the Facebook situation,\u00a0possibly deciding\u00a0that Facebook has violated the Consent Decree to which they\u2019ve been subject. A fine would then be likely, and if Washington is serious, it could be quite large.</p><p>The Facebook FTC consent decree carries the possibility of up to $40,000 per violation. Of the 87 million Cambridge Analytica-affected Facebook users, 70 million reside in the United States. This opens up Facebook to a potential fine that could be $2.8 trillion.</p><p>While it is unlikely that the FTC would in fact impose a fine of this size, it could certainly be somewhere in the range of the $2.7 billion the EU fined Google for uncompetitive behavior. It could also be all the way down to\u00a0$168 million, which is the FTC\u2019s record fine, imposed on DISH Network for violating telemarketing rules.</p><p>While nothing will likely happen soon in the form of new legislation or regulation, let\u2019s hope that Washington acts based on facts, recognizing how directly all of these companies compete, while resisting the urge to overreact. The sector would then be able to evolve into a more vibrantly competitive and stable environment in which innovation can flourish, consumers can be protected and Big Tech can continue to grow without putting the entire internet economy at risk.</p><p>Roger Entner is the Founder and Analyst at\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reconanalytics.com/\"/>.

Under the terms of the deal, Dish would acquire Sprint's 9 million prepaid customers for $1.4 billionand its 14 MHz of 800 MHz spectrum for $3.6 billion in three years. Additionally, T-Mobile would be required to offer wholesale services to Dish for seven years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dish gets access to up to 20,000 of New T-Mobile's decommissioned cell sites, and must build 15,000 additional sites, with a commitment to covering 70% of the country with 5G at a minimum speed of 35 Mbps. Importantly, Dish must pay a penalty of $2.2 billion if it does not meet the buildout requirement.</p><p>I do find the \u2018manufacturing' of a fourth national wireless competitor in order to get this deal done to be rather curious. To begin with, it is not usual practice for regulators to get involved at this level. It's a rather sweetheart deal for Dish to get 9 million customers for $1.4 billion ($150/customer) and that amount of attractive low-band spectrum for $3.6 billion, with only a $72 million penalty if they choose not to exercise that option.</p><p>RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/doj-officially-signs-off-t-mobile-sprint-merger\">DoJ officially signs off on T-Mobile-Sprint merger</url></p><p>The biggest wildcard here is Dish itself: its capital structureand its real commitment to build a network and be a serious player in the wireless business. It is fair to ask these questions, given Dish's history of sitting on spectrum, not fulfilling its buildout commitments, and finding creative loopholes around the FCC's auction intentions. </p><p>Those who have been reading my columns in the year+ since the TMO-Sprint deal was originally announced won't be surprised by my view that the Dish deal notwithstanding, we don't need four national, facilities-based networks in the United States. I keep coming back to the point that Sprint, as the increasingly distant fourth carrier, has been struggling for years. It's not all that clear how a Dish wireless business would be more successful than Sprint's wireless business has been or would be, had Sprint remained as a standalone entity. And the fact is: there are very few examples, worldwide, of countries that have four national, facilities-based wireless competitors who are all healthy and profitable.</p><p>The only scenario where I think 4+ makes sense is if there's a larger addressable market than today's largely mature market for wireless services. There are two opportunities here: One is whether New T-Mobile, and the other major operators, are able to use their 4G and 5G networks to also offer a competitive alternative to fixed broadband (where most markets have, at best, two competitors), including the ability to provide an effective service to the ~20% of households in the U.S. that are unserved or underserved by broadband today. The other area of new opportunity is in the broader enterprise and industrial IoT sector, which is more complex and will take some time to develop.</p><p>I don't see Dish being successful if it's just going to rely on being the new \u2018uncarrier'with some disruptive pricing. It must secure an anchor tenant to help fund the buildout of its network (such as Verizon, who might need the capacity), and/or an outside player such as Amazon, who might do something disruptive and not view its wireless business through the same lensand traditional metrics as a traditional operator. That said, if Dish covers substantially less than 70% of the population with its own network, the opportunity for an MVNO tenant to do something disruptive would be diminished, since it's unlikely that the MVNO would have access to New T-Mobile's network in areas not covered by Dish.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Risks to the deal</emphasis></p><p>It is also a risk to put this competitive onus on Dish. The company, which has $13 billion of debt, could well struggle to find the estimated $10 billion capital needed to build a full-on wireless network, which would require some 40,000 towers, according to New Street Research. It would clearly need an anchor tenant, and that's likely to be Amazon, Apple, or one of the big tech firms. Given that the DOJ seems to have an especially keen eye in Big Tech these days, I guess Amazon or whoever that big tech MVNO turns out to be will have to tread somewhat carefully in terms of what wireless service is offered to consumers. So much for free unlimited 5G data for all Prime customers!</p><p>RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/big-tech-takes-massive-blows-5b-facebook-fine-doj-antitrust-probe\">Big tech takes massive blows: $5B Facebook fine, DOJ antitrust probe</url></p><p>There are still uncertainties as to whether this deal gets done and the timing. In an era where nearly every issue is politicized, the DOJ is, to a certain extent, playing arbiter between several Democrat states that oppose the deal and several Republican states that support it. It appears that the legal challenge will go forward, with a trial scheduled to begin October 7. Any additional delay could provide Dish with the ammunition needed to further push out the buildout requirement associated with its existing spectrum. Certainly, regulators have an eye to Dish's strategic options and past practices with regard to buildout requirements, given the stipulation that Dish can't re-sell its wireless assets to a third party for three years.</p><p>Another key, unanswered question pertains to the terms of the MVNO deal between New T-Mobile and Dish. Historically in the U.S. wireless market, regulators have not mandated facilities-based operators to offer fair wholesale rates. Hence our rather moribund wireless MVNO/resale market in wireless, and nonexistent resale market in broadband \u2013 a sharp contrast to most countries in Europe. We see this in the cable MVNO deal with Verizon, where the prices offered by Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile to consumers are not especially favorable, and cable companies do everything they can to get data traffic onto Wi-Fi. I guess it's another irony that the DOJ, which is busy investigating anti-competitive practices by big tech, helps engineer a deal that presumably requires New T-Mobile to offer favorablewholesale rates to Dish.</p><p>RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/dish-crafts-its-plans-to-become-4th-us-wireless-carrier\">Dish crafts its plans to become the 4th US wireless carrier</url></p><p>Another key element here will be the buildout requirement imposed on Dish. This certainly could be a win for network equipment suppliers, tower companies, and the like. I'd imagine that Dish would initially focus on building out a \u2018macro' network, and use the New T-Mobile network for metro-centric small cell services. Of course, building a wireless network from scratch in the 2020 era is, economically, a lower-cost proposition (see: Reliance Jio, etc.), especially when legacy network equipment and systems don't have to be supported.</p><p>My bottom line: we don't need a fourth national wireless network if we'll already have three really good ones. And just because we've manufactured a new competitor in order to get the TMO-Sprint deal done does not necessarily guarantee the success of that competitor. I can certainly envision market conditions changing enough between now and 2023 that Dish could use to circumvent or further delay the buildout requirements.</p><p>Nevertheless, Dish is an entrepreneurial company, and with attractive wholesale rates from New T-Mobile, there will be some great opportunities for creative partnerships and offers in the near-term. In the longer term, the potential for a greenfield wireless network in the United States is exciting. And Dish being Dish, the road to this network being built, and the resultant service proposition, is likely to be unconventional.</p><p>DISCLOSURE: I am not, nor have I been, engaged by any parties in relation to this transaction. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"mailto:mlowenstein@m-ecosystem.com\">Mark Lowenstein</url>, a leading industry analyst, consultant, and commentator, is managing director of      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.m-ecosystem.com/\">Mobile Ecosystem</url>.

By 2035, they're projected to cover 80 million. If legacy players hope to capture a portion of that growth while protecting against digital disruption from Amazon and others, they'll have to move fast to embrace data-based strategies and build modern, digital customer experiences.</p><p>Providing those experiences is critical to fend off big tech and to meet the demands of the new generation of MA consumers. Each new wave of MA customers will be more tech-savvy, and, like younger consumers, they will demand self-service through websites and mobile apps, one-click transactions and easy, 24/7 access to information. Already, 40% of seniors own smartphones, and 82% of those who will soon age in to MA are regular internet users.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/anthem-beats-revenue-estimates-due-to-accelerated-launch-pbm-ingeniorx\">Anthem's Medicare Advantage enrollment grew by 20% in 2019</url></emphasis></p><p>Complicating the challenge, MA plan members are older and sicker than those in other commercial plans, putting more pressure on managing costs.

But the plans that rise to those challenges will focus on three strategic fronts:</p><p>Health plans\u2014burdened by legacy technology, siloed systems and disorganized data\u2014won't be able to deliver on any of those strategies on their own. They'll have to find outside partners that can build and deploy the technology to power superior member experiences.</p><p>The plans that identify and move on those partnerships quickly are most likely to seize the MA opportunity\u2014before Silicon Valley snatches it away.</p><p>Mark Nathan is the founder and CEO of Zipari, a company that creates consumer-experience technology for the health insurance industry.Mark began his 25-year-plus career as a robotics engineer at NASA and spent half of his career leading the modernization of customer experience at Guardian.

O Facebook estava finalmente entrando na lucrativa arena de servi\u00e7os financeiros com um servi\u00e7o de pagamentos na maior economia da Am\u00e9rica Latina. O lan\u00e7amento, em junho, planejado h\u00e1 anos, deveria ser o piloto de uma poss\u00edvel iniciativa global. Mas, oito dias ap\u00f3s a opera\u00e7\u00e3o ter come\u00e7ado, o Banco Central (BC) a tirou da tomada.    A decis\u00e3o do BC ressalta o desafio do Facebook em tentar ganhar a aprova\u00e7\u00e3o dos reguladores financeiros e as complexidades que esses \u00f3rg\u00e3os de controle enfrentam na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de riscos de deixar as gigantes de tecnologia soltas pelo mundo.    No Brasil, o epis\u00f3dio tamb\u00e9m levantou quest\u00f5es sobre a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o em torno do lan\u00e7amento. Executivos do WhatsApp e autoridades do BC realizaram pelo menos tr\u00eas reuni\u00f5es nos 21 meses anteriores, incluindo duas na semana anterior ao lan\u00e7amento.    O presidente do BC, Roberto Campos Neto, disse \u00e0 Reuters, em sua primeira fala com mais detalhes a respeito da decis\u00e3o, que a autarquia n\u00e3o havia decidido ainda como lidar com o modelo de pagamentos proposto \u2013 uma novidade no Brasil, onde n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel transferir recursos por meio de aplicativos usando cart\u00f5es.    \u201cTeve uma reuni\u00e3o pr\u00e9via, onde foi mais ou menos explicado o que era a inten\u00e7\u00e3o, mas n\u00f3s fomos pegos de surpresa com o lan\u00e7amento, no dia 15 de junho, porque n\u00f3s entend\u00edamos que uma coisa relevante teria que ter passado por um trilho de aprova\u00e7\u00e3o como todos os outros passaram\u201d, disse ele em entrevista.    O BC, que afirmou nunca ter recebido um pedido formal de autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o conforme esperado, suspendeu o servi\u00e7o, o Facebook Pay, em 23 de junho. Campos Neto e outras autoridades do BC disseram que as preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es se concentram em concorr\u00eancia, privacidade de dados \u2013 eles n\u00e3o forneceram detalhes \u2013 e em delibera\u00e7\u00f5es em curso quanto \u00e0 necessidade de uma licen\u00e7a para o WhatsApp operar enquanto ofertante ou parte integrante de um arranjo de pagamento.    O WhatsApp disse \u00e0 Reuters que respondeu \u00e0s perguntas do BC e forneceu o cronograma de lan\u00e7amento do servi\u00e7o durante as reuni\u00f5es finais. \u201cConversamos abertamente sobre nossos planos de trazer pagamentos pelo WhatsApp para o Brasil\u201d, afirmou.    A empresa acrescentou estar profundamente preocupada com a privacidade dos usu\u00e1rios, informou que os detalhes financeiros seriam armazenados em uma rede apartada segura e disse possuir contratos de seguran\u00e7a de dados com todos seus parceiros. O WhatsApp afirmou que n\u00e3o quer se tornar uma empresa de servi\u00e7os financeiros.    No Brasil, institui\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras est\u00e3o sujeitas a requisitos de reserva de capital e regras r\u00edgidas. Como uma maneira de contornar o entrave, mas jogar conforme as regras em vigor, o WhatsApp procurou usar as bandeiras Visa e Mastercard, que j\u00e1 possu\u00edam licen\u00e7as do BC, para realizar as transfer\u00eancias de dinheiro. A informa\u00e7\u00e3o foi corroborada tanto pela Visa quanto pela Mastercard.    \u201cO WhatsApp entrou em contato conosco h\u00e1 cerca de dois anos para criar uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de pagamentos que trouxesse conveni\u00eancia a seus usu\u00e1rios e tamb\u00e9m porque n\u00e3o queria se tornar uma institui\u00e7\u00e3o financeira\u201d, disse o presidente da Visa no Brasil, Fernando Teles.    Fase de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 O WhatsApp afirmou que usou sistemas de pagamentos existentes da Visa e da Mastercard, que s\u00e3o reguladas no Brasil. No entanto, Campos Neto pontuou que um servi\u00e7o de transfer\u00eancia de dinheiro via cart\u00f5es fornecido por uma grande empresa de tecnologia nunca existiu no Brasil e que o BC ainda n\u00e3o havia decidido se o WhatsApp precisava de uma licen\u00e7a.    \u201cVale lembrar que big tech n\u00e3o est\u00e1 em pagamentos em grande parte do mundo\u201d, disse ele \u00e0 Reuters em 8 de julho.    \u201cEnt\u00e3o a gente ainda est\u00e1 em uma fase de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o regulat\u00f3ria em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao que vai vir\u201d. N\u00e3o \u00e9 a primeira vez que o Facebook parece ter interpretado mal os meandros da regula\u00e7\u00e3o enquanto busca entrar no mundo financeiro, riqu\u00edssimo em dados.    H\u00e1 um ano, a empresa divulgou planos para a criptomoeda Libra, mas foi confrontada com a contundente rea\u00e7\u00e3o dos bancos centrais. No caso do Brasil, a oportunidade \u00e9 grande, com um mercado de pagamentos via cart\u00f5es crescente que registrou R$ 1,8 trilh\u00e3o em transa\u00e7\u00f5es no ano passado.    Nos est\u00e1gios iniciais de seu servi\u00e7o, o WhatsApp tamb\u00e9m buscou fazer uso de uma regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o de pagamentos que permitia \u00e0s empresas iniciar servi\u00e7os sem licen\u00e7a at\u00e9 atingirem R$ 500 milh\u00f5es ou 25 milh\u00f5es de transa\u00e7\u00f5es em um per\u00edodo de 12 meses, segundo fonte pr\u00f3xima \u00e0 companhia.    Isso, novamente, estava dentro das regras. No entanto, o dispositivo, segundo Campos Neto, foi constru\u00eddo para incentivar pequenas empresas a entrar no mercado, em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o a uma grande companhia de tecnologia como o WhatsApp, com 120 milh\u00f5es de usu\u00e1rios brasileiros.    \u201cO que o WhatsApp fez \u00e9 que eles tentaram se valer dessa prerrogativa, de que \u2018n\u00f3s vamos come\u00e7ar com uma volumetria muito baixa porque uma hora que eu j\u00e1 estou no sistema depois \u00e9 dif\u00edcil tirar\u2019\u201d, afirmou o presidente do BC, classificando a investida como um \u201cartif\u00edcio de volumetria\u201d.    O BC alterou a regra em 23 de junho, dando amparo \u00e0 possibilidade de suspens\u00e3o dos servi\u00e7os de empresas de arranjo de pagamento por ele supervisionadas.

Over the course of five weeks, I blocked Amazon , Facebook , Google , Microsoft , and Apple one at a time, to find out how to live in the modern age...</p><p>A couple of months ago, I set out to answer the question of whether it\u2019s possible to avoid the tech giants. Over the course of five weeks, I blocked Amazon , Facebook , Google , Microsoft , and Apple one at a time, to find out how to live in the modern age without each one.                     This article was originally published in 2019 and has been updated since its original publication.   To end my experiment, I\u2019m going to see if I can survive blocking all five at once.   Not only am I boycotting their products, a technologist named Dhruv Mehrotra designed a special network tool that prevents my devices from communicating with the tech giants\u2019 servers, meaning that ads and analytics from Google won\u2019t work, Facebook can\u2019t track me across the internet, and websites hosted by Amazon Web Services, or AWS, hypothetically won\u2019t load.   I am using a Linux laptop made by a company named Purism and a Nokia feature phone on which I am relearning the lost art of T9 texting .   I don\u2019t think I could have done this cold turkey. I needed to wean myself off various services in the lead-up, like an alcoholic going through the 12 steps. The tech giants, while troubling in their accumulation of data, power, and societal control, do offer services that make our lives a hell of a lot easier.   Earlier in the experiment, for example, I realised I don\u2019t know how to get in touch with people without the tech giants. Google, Apple, and Facebook provide my rolling Rolodex.   So in preparation for the week, I export all my contacts from Google, which amounts to a shocking 8,000 people. I have also whittled down the over 1,500 contacts in my iPhone to 143 people for my Nokia, or the number of people I actually talk to on a regular basis, which is incredibly close to Dunbar\u2019s number .   I wind up placing a lot of phone calls this week, because texting is so annoying on the Nokia\u2019s numbers-based keyboard. I find people often pick up on the first ring out of concern; they\u2019re not used to getting calls from me.  I don\u2019t think I could have done this cold turkey.  On the first day of the block, I drive to work in silence because my rented Ford Fusion\u2019s \u201cSYNC\u201d entertainment system is powered by Microsoft. Background noise in general disappears this week because YouTube, Apple Music, and our Echo are all banned\u2014as are Netflix, Spotify, and Hulu, because they rely on AWS and the Google Cloud to get their content to users.   The silence causes my mind to wander more than usual. Sometimes this leads to ideas for my half-finished zombie novel or inspires a new question for investigation. But more often than not, I dwell on things I need to do.   Many of these things are a lot more challenging as a result of the experiment, such as when I record an interview with Alex Goldman of the podcast Reply All about Facebook and its privacy problems.   I live in California, and Alex is in New York; we would normally use Skype, but that\u2019s owned by Microsoft, so instead we talk by phone and I record my end with a handheld Zoom recorder. That works fine, but when it comes time to send the 386 MB audio file to Alex, I realise I have no idea how to send a huge file over the internet.   My Gmail alternatives\u2014ProtonMail and Riseup\u2014tell me the file is too large; they tap out at 25 MB. Google Drive and Dropbox aren\u2019t options, Dropbox because it\u2019s hosted by Amazon\u2019s AWS and relies on Google for sign-in. Other file-sharing sites also rely on the tech giants for web hosting services.   Before resorting to putting the file on a thumb drive and dropping it in a IRL mailbox, I call up my tech freedom guru, Sean O\u2019Brien, who heads Yale Law School\u2019s Privacy Lab. He also does marketing work for Purism, the company that makes my laptop. O\u2019Brien tries to avoid tech giants in favour of open source technologies, so I figure he might be able to help.   O\u2019Brien directs me first to Send.Firefox.com , an encrypted file-sharing service operated by Mozilla. But\u2026 it uses the Google Cloud, so it won\u2019t load. O\u2019Brien then sends me to Share.Riseup.net , a file-sharing service from the same radical tech collective that is hosting my personal email, but it only works for files up to 50 MB.   O\u2019Brien\u2019s last suggestion is Onionshare , a tool for sharing files privately via the \u201cdark web,\u201d i.e. the part of the web that\u2019s not crawled by Google and requires the Tor browser to get to. I know this one actually. My friend Micah Lee, a technologist for the Intercept, made it . Unfortunately, when I go to Onionshare.org to download it, the website won\u2019t load.   \u201cHah, yes,\u201d emails Micah when I ask about it. \u201cRight now it\u2019s hosted by AWS.\u201d   As I encountered at the beginning of this experiment , Amazon\u2019s most profitable business isn\u2019t retail; it\u2019s web hosting. Countless apps and websites rely on the digital infrastructure provided by AWS, and none of them are working for me this week.   Micah suggests I download it from Github, but that\u2019s owned by Microsoft. Thankfully, O\u2019Brien tells me I can download the Onionshare program directly from Micah\u2019s server via command line on my Linux computer. He has to walk me through it step-by-step, but it works. I\u2019m able to run Onionshare, drop my file into it, creating a temporary onion site; I send the URL for the onionsite to Alex so he can download it via the Tor browser. Once he downloads it, I tell Onionshare to \u201cstop sharing,\u201d which takes the onion site down, erasing the file from the web.   (In the end, Alex doesn\u2019t even wind up using my audio for Reply All\u2019s year-end finale. Sigh.)   I realise that\u2019s a long story about sharing one file, but it\u2019s a nice summation of what online tasks are like this week. There are workarounds for services offered by the tech giants, but they take extra research to find and are often more difficult to use. I wind up in strange parts of the internet, using Ask.com (formerly known as Ask Jeeves) as my search engine, for example, after I ixnay Google.com and realise DuckDuckGo is hosted by AWS.   But Ask.com is not necessarily a great replacement: it\u2019s owned by IAC, the media and dating company behemoth. I\u2019ve just traded one huge corporation seeking to monetise my searches for another, less competent one.   Some strange things are delightful: I discover that my Nokia phone can play the radio, so when I go running, I listen to NPR instead of my usual go-tos: Spotify, a podcast, or an audiobook. I\u2019m planning a trip to South Africa, and wind up in charming conversations with the travel agents I have to call for help; it\u2019s more costly and less efficient to book via a travel agency, but it\u2019s the only option because travel-booking websites aren\u2019t working for me.    My mother-in-law was not impressed with the Nokia\u2019s photos (Screenshot: Maureen Taravella)   Something not delightful is my Nokia 3310\u2019s camera; it takes terrible, dark photos. I have an old Canon point-and-shoot digital camera, but I find I don\u2019t take many photos this week\u2014because without Facebook and Instagram, I don\u2019t have anywhere to share them.  These phones are the nicotine patch for smartphone addiction.  Sometimes I just can\u2019t find a digital replacement. Venmo won\u2019t work without a smartphone, so I pay our babysitter in cash. I start using a physical calendar to keep track of my schedule. When it comes to getting around, Marble Maps is an option, but I\u2019m confused by the interface, so I stick to places I know, and buy a physical map as a back-up.   \u201cIt\u2019s funny because Nokia used to have amazing navigation with Navtech,\u201d a technologist says to me one day when I\u2019m talking about how hard driving is without mapping apps, \u201cbut then they sold themselves to Microsoft.\u201d   Fuck , I think, my Nokia 3310 might be made by Microsoft.       But it turns out, while Microsoft did buy Nokia\u2019s mobile devices division for $US7.2 billion in 2014, it sold Nokia\u2019s \u201cfeature phone assets\u201d two years later for a painful write-down, $US350 million , to Foxconn (of Apple outsourcing fame) and to HMD Global, a Finnish firm helmed by a former Nokia executive. HMD Global now uses Nokia\u2019s \u201cintellectual property,\u201d i.e. brand, to sell phones. Most \u201cNokia\u201d phones are Android smartphones, but there\u2019s a line of \u201cclassic\u201d phones, including the 3310, which run an operating system called FeatureOS made by Foxconn.   My Nokia 3310 is not a tech giant phone, but it\u2019s certainly tech giant adjacent.   To find out why the HMD Global is still selling dumbphones, I call its Hong Kong-based chief product officer, Juho Sarvikas. Sarvikas tells me that the company thought the core market for \u201cclassic\u201d phones would be in Asia and Africa, where smartphones are less prevalent, but he says the devices have done surprisingly well in America.   \u201cDigital well-being is a concrete area now,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you want to go into detox mode or if you want to be less connected, we want to be the company that has the toolkit for you.\u201d   \u201cSo these phones are the nicotine patch for smartphone addiction,\u201d I say.   He laughs, \u201cI\u2019ve never put it that way before, but yes.\u201d   I had assumed that the phones were for parents who wanted their kids to have phones sans a pipeline to social media and apps.   \u201cThat too,\u201d says Sarvikas.   Many people I talk to about this experiment liken it to digital veganism. Digital vegans reject certain technology services as unethical; they discriminate about the products they use and the data they consume and share, because information is power, and increasingly a handful of companies seem to have it all.  He refers to joining social networks as being \u201cbait\u201d that lures other people into \u201csurveillance traps.\u201d  When I meet a full-time practitioner of the lifestyle, Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a technologist at the ACLU, I\u2019m not totally surprised to discover he\u2019s an actual vegan. I am surprised by the lengths to which he\u2019s gone to avoid the tech giants: he doesn\u2019t have a mobile phone and prefers to pay for things with cash.   \u201cMy main concern is people being able to lead autonomous healthy lives that they have control over,\u201d Gillmor tells me during a chat via Jitsi , an open-source video-conferencing service that will work on any web browser. There\u2019s no proprietary app you have to download and it doesn\u2019t require you to create an account.    Daniel Kahn GIllmor\u2014ACLU technologist, digital vegan, and real vegan (Photo: Santiago Garcia)   Gillmor hosts his own email and avoids most social media networks (he makes exceptions for Github and Sourceforge, because he\u2019s an open source developer who wants to share his code with others). He refers to joining social networks as being \u201cbait\u201d that lures other people into \u201csurveillance traps.\u201d   Gillmor thinks people will have better lives if they aren\u2019t being data-mined and monetized by companies that increasingly control the flow of information.   \u201cI have the capacity to make this choice. I know a lot of people would like to sign off but can\u2019t for financial reasons or practical reasons,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to come across as chastising people who don\u2019t make this choice.\u201d   And there are definitely costs to the choice. \u201cHow things are structured determines the decisions people can make socially,\u201d he says. \u201cLike you didn\u2019t get invited to a party [via Facebook] because you chose not to be part of a surveillance economy.\u201d   Gillmor teaches digital hygiene classes where he tries to get people to think about their privacy and security. He usually starts the class by asking people if they know when their phones are communicating with cell towers. \u201cMost people say, \u2018When I use it,\u2019 but the answer is, \u2018anytime it\u2019s on,\u2019\u201d he says.   He wants people to think about their own data trails but also when they are creating data trails for other people, such as when a person uploads their contacts to a technology service \u2014sharing information with the service that those contacts might not want shared.   \u201cOnce the data is out there, it can be misused in ways we don\u2019t expect ,\u201d he says.   But he thinks it\u2019s going to take more than actions by individuals. \u201cWe need to think of this as a collective action problem similar to how we think about the environment,\u201d he says. \u201cOur society is structured so that a lot of people are trapped. If you have to fill out your timesheet with an app only available on iPhone or Android, you better have one of those to get paid.\u201d   Gillmor wants lawmakers to step in, but he also thinks it can be addressed technologically, by pushing for interoperable systems like we have for phone numbers and email. You can call anyone; you don\u2019t need to use the same phone carrier as them. And you can take your phone number to a different carrier if you want (thanks to lawmaker intervention ).   When companies can\u2019t lock us into proprietary ecosystems, we have more freedom. But that means Facebook would have to let a Pinterest user RSVP for an event on its site. And Apple would need to let you Facetime an Android user.   No one wants to give the keys out when they have customer lock-in .   The Amazon block continues to be the most challenging one for me.   My friend Katie is in town from New York; we have plans to meet for dinner one night at a restaurant near my house, an event marked on my physical calendar. On the morning we are to meet, I get an email from her to my Riseup account with the subject line, \u201cWhat is happening.\u201d   Katie had been sending me messages for days via Signal, but I hadn\u2019t gotten them because Signal is hosted by AWS. When she didn\u2019t hear from me, she sent an \u201cARE YOU GETTING MY TEXTS\u201d email to Gmail, and got my away message directing her to my Riseup account.  \u201cARE YOU GETTING MY TEXTS\u201d  I tell her dinner is still a go, but it\u2019s a reminder of the costs of leaving these services. I can opt out, but people might not realise I\u2019ve left, or might forget, even if they do know.   One day, I ask my husband, Trevor, who declined to do the block with me because he has \u201ca real job,\u201d what the hardest part of my experiment is for him. \u201cI never know if you\u2019re going to respond to my texts,\u201d he says.   \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat have I not responded to?   \u201cI sent you some messages on Signal,\u201d Trevor says, having forgotten I am off it.       The block provides constant conversation fodder, and I find myself in conversations more often because, at social gatherings, I don\u2019t have a smartphone to stare at.   An Ivy League professor tells me he regularly employs a Google blocker. \u201cI had to disable it when I paid my taxes because they have Google Analytics on the IRS website,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was kind of horrifying.\u201d   People under 35 are intrigued (and sometimes jealous) of life without a smartphone; people over 35 just seem nostalgic.   One night, I run into Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle, who is delighted to hear about the block. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get away from technology,\u201d he says. \u201cA friend was just telling me about trying to get a TV that wasn\u2019t smart and didn\u2019t have a microphone. It was impossible. He wound up getting a 27-inch [computer] monitor.\u201d   Sometimes we make the choice to bring technology into our lives, but sometimes it\u2019s forced upon us. Television makers have turned their products into surveillance machines that collect what we watch and what we don\u2019t watch and sometimes even what we say, and that\u2019s just how most TVs come now.   This week, I stop watching TV altogether because we don\u2019t have cable and internet TV isn\u2019t an option. I hadn\u2019t meant to make this experiment a \u201crejection of all technology\u201d\u2014but it happens despite my intentions.   I\u2019m most frustrated by this with my phone. I would love to be using a tech-giant free smartphone, but they aren\u2019t really commercially available yet. If you want one, you need to be technically savvy and install a custom operating system on special phone models . That will hopefully change soon, with commercial offerings on the horizon from Eelo and Purism .   In the past, I would have assumed that idealistic projects like these were doomed, but there seems to be a heightened awareness these days of the dystopia created by the tech giants. Everywhere I look, I see criticism of the Frightful Five.  \u201cAre America\u2019s technology companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?\u201d  A writer I know pens an op-ed in the New York Times : \u201c Hate Amazon? Try living without it .\u201d (She didn\u2019t actually live without it.) A CNBC tech reporter reveals she gave up Facebook and Instagram for three months and that it \u201cmade her a lot happier.\u201d A CBS reporter tries and fails to quit Google . A Vice writer gives all the giants up for a month (but not as rigorously as I did). The New York Times writes about apps tracking people\u2019s locations with horrifying regularity and granularity.   The tech giants laid down all the basic infrastructure for our data to be trafficked. They got us to put our information into public profiles, to carry tracking devices in our pockets, and to download apps to those tracking devices that secretly siphon data from them.   \u201cAre America\u2019s technology companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?\u201d asks a Californian politician .   It\u2019s in the air. The tech giants were long revered for making the world more connected, making information more accessible, and making commerce easier and cheaper. Now, suddenly, they are the targets of anger for assisting the spread of propaganda and misinformation, making us dangerously dependent on their services, and turning our personal information into the currency of a surveillance economy.   The world is flawed, and, fairly or not, the tech titans are increasingly being blamed.   A new book about \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d by Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff argues that the extreme mining and manipulation of our data for profit is making an inescapable panopticon the driver of our economy.   Zuboff\u2019s publicist sent me an advance copy as an e-book, and I\u2019ve really been enjoying it, but I have to put it down this week because I can\u2019t read it on my Kindle. Instead, I\u2019m reading a physical book\u2014Henry Thoreau\u2019s Walden , which I ordered from Barnes &amp; Noble. It too is full of calls to re-immerse ourselves in the natural world and not get too caught up in the distractions of modern life.   But, because it was published in 1854, it warns people to get away from work and newspapers rather than smart devices and screens.   For ideas about what the government can do about all this, I call Lina Khan, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute who wrote a blockbuster paper on the need to regulate Amazon\u2019s monopoly power. (At least it\u2019s a blockbuster by academic standards.)  \u201cIf users had been told that the price for access would be near-total surveillance, would they have agreed?\u201d  Khan is in New York doing an academic fellowship at Columbia University where she is working on more papers. Khan doesn\u2019t have a Prime account and avoids Gmail. Right before I call her, I see a tweet from a video producer at the Washington Post who got bombarded with baby ads after she had a stillborn delivery.   \u201cPlease, Tech Companies, I implore you: If your algorithms are smart enough to realise that I was pregnant, or that I\u2019ve given birth, then surely they can be smart enough to realise that my baby died, and advertise to me accordingly \u2014 or maybe, just maybe, not at all,\u201d she wrote in yet another reminder that privacy invasions have real harms.   I recount the story to Khan at the beginning of our call and say that this type of anger seems to be on the rise.    Lina Khan and author having a Skype call (after the experiment ended) (Screenshot: Kashmir Hill)   \u201cThe tech companies\u2019 own actions are prompting the tide to turn. It is a belated reckoning, but it seems to be a reckoning nonetheless,\u201d she says. \u201cCompanies started monetizing user data far before most users even realised their data was valuable, let alone being collected by private actors. If users had been told that the price for access would be near-total surveillance, would they have agreed? Would companies have been forced to offer different business models?\u201d   Khan thinks law enforcers need to get involved to keep these companies from using anti-competitive tactics to dominate the business landscape, as public officials did in the \u201890s against Microsoft .   \u201cSeveral of the big tech firms have acquired rivals and inhibited competitors through predatory conduct,\u201d she says, a topic that\u2019s been in the news recently with the exposure of Facebook emails where CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about cutting off then-viral video service Vine\u2019s access to the Facebook social graph. \u201cThey have engaged in practices that, a few decades ago, were widely considered monopolistic. We need investigations by the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or state attorneys general.\u201d   Europe is on the case, its regulators fining Google and saying Facebook can\u2019t combine users\u2019 data from Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram without their consent. But antitrust regulators in the U.S. have stayed away from these companies because their services are cheap or free, so they\u2019re perceived as pro-consumer, which is ultimately what regulators want to encourage. But how does that work when the \u201cconsumer\u201d is what the company is selling?   An uncomfortable idea I keep coming up against this week is that, if we want to get away from monopolies and surveillance economies, we might need to rethink the assumption that everything on the internet should be free.   So when I try to create a fourth folder in ProtonMail to organise my email and it tells me that I need to upgrade from a free to a premium account to do so, I decide to fork over 48 euros (about $75) for the year. In return, I get a 5 GB email account that doesn\u2019t have its contents scanned and monetized.   However, I\u2019m well aware that not everyone has $75 to spare for something that they can easily get for \u201cfree,\u201d so if that\u2019s the way things go, the rich will have privacy online and the poor (and most vulnerable) will have their data exploited.   The previous week, my 1-year-old, Ellev, started saying that Alexa is \u201cscary\u201d and \u201cspooky,\u201d concepts she learned while trick-or-treating. It\u2019s not unreasonable; I can see how a disembodied voice that\u2019s always there and always listening would be disconcerting to a toddler\u2014or really any normal human being.       But this week, she keeps crying for Alexa, wanting her to play \u201cBaby shark\u201d and other music that is otherwise absent from our home. \u201cI miss Alexa,\u201d she says, and I feel terrible both for depriving her and for making her dependent on an AI at such a young age.   On the last day of the block, Trevor and I are flying to New York, and he\u2019s begging me to end the experiment early so we can use the iPad to keep Ellev happy. However, I\u2019m adamant about maintaining the blockade for the six-hour flight.   \u201cI\u2019m changing my seat to a different part of the plane,\u201d Trevor warns, kiddingly.   Trevor charges the iPad up in case my will falters. But I hold strong. We read books with Ellev, doodle on a magnetic drawing board, sing songs, and play for at least an hour with sticky, flexible \u201cWizzle sticks\u201d that come in her Alaska Airlines snack pack. She sleeps for the last hour and a half of the flight, something she doesn\u2019t usually do if there is an iPad available.   That was Ellev\u2019s 26th flight. In the taxi after we land, Trevor turns to me and says, \u201cThat\u2019s the easiest flight we\u2019ve ever had with her.\u201d   We get to our Airbnb in Brooklyn, which I booked months before the experiment. (It should technically be banned because Airbnb is hosted by AWS.) There\u2019s a lock box on the outside of the apartment building that I open with a four-digit code. Inside is a key that gets us into the building and the same four-digit code opens a digital lock on the apartment\u2019s door. I had written down the address and code on a piece of paper knowing I wouldn\u2019t be able to access the Airbnb website.  Technology creates the problems that technology solves.  We get in with no problem. We\u2019re starving so head to a restaurant we passed in our taxi. Afterward, we need groceries, but Ellev is melting down, so I head to the Airbnb while Trevor goes to shop. I get into the building with the key, but once Ellev and I climb four flights of stairs to the apartment, I realise I don\u2019t have the piece of paper with the door code on it\u2014and I don\u2019t remember the code.   Ellev is crying and trying to turn the doorknob. I start to feel that desperate panic of an earlier age that nowadays accompanies a dying smartphone battery.   My laptop is inside the locked apartment. I use a password manager, stored on that laptop, to get into all my online accounts, so I couldn\u2019t get into Airbnb on another computer even if I wanted to toss in the towel on the blockade.   A masochistic part of my brain reminds me that I am in this mess because I used a site hosted by AWS. I could have just booked a normal hotel room via the phone, and then I would be picking up a new key card at this very moment. Technology creates the problems that technology solves, and vice versa.   While soothing Ellev, I try a bunch of different combinations on the lock based on my vague recollection of what the four numbers are. One of them works. As soon as I get inside, I plug my iPhone into the charger, relieved I\u2019ll resume using it the next day.   Critics of the big tech companies are often told, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the company, don\u2019t use its products.\u201d I did this experiment to find out if that is possible, and I found out that it\u2019s not\u2014with the exception of Apple.    Graphic: Jim Cooke, Gizmodo   These companies are unavoidable because they control internet infrastructure, online commerce, and information flows. Many of them specialize in tracking you around the web, whether you use their products or not. These companies started out selling books, offering search results, or showcasing college hotties, but they have expanded enormously and now touch almost every online interaction. These companies look a lot like modern monopolies .   Since the experiment ended, I\u2019ve resumed using the tech giants\u2019 services, but I use them less. I deliberately seek out alternatives to do what I can, as a consumer, not to help them monopolize the market.  I want to embrace a lifestyle of \u201cslow Internet.\u201d  But the experiment went beyond that for me; it made me reexamine the role of tech in my life more widely. It broke me of that modern bad habit of swiping through my phone looking for a distraction rather than engaging with the people around me or seeking stimulation in my real world environment.   I deleted time-wasting apps like Words With Friends and a Hearts app. I look at Instagram less often, such that I see friends have tagged me in their stories, but don\u2019t see the stories because they\u2019ve already reached their 24-hour expiration mark.   I turn my phone off around 9pm each night and don\u2019t turn it back on until I really need it the next day. It took two weeks of using my \u201cnicotine patch\u201d dumb phone, but I eventually lost the urge to start my day by reaching for my smartphone on the bedside table.   My iPhone tells me in my weekly \u201cScreentime\u201d reports that my usage is down significantly, to under 2 hours per day. My phone feels less like an appendage and more like a tool I use when necessary. I still love using Google Maps or Waze when I\u2019m driving to an unfamiliar place, texting far-away friends and family members, and sharing a beautiful photo on Instagram\u2014but I have regained the ability to put my phone away.   I went through the digital equivalent of a juice cleanse. I hope I\u2019m better than most dieters at staying healthy afterward, but I don\u2019t want to be a digital vegan. I want to embrace a lifestyle of \u201cslow Internet,\u201d to be more discriminating about the technology I let into my life and think about the motives of the companies behind it. The tech giants are reshaping the world in good and bad ways; we can take the good and reject the bad.   I ask Trevor if he notices anything different about me since the experiment.   \u201cYou never know what time it is anymore,\u201d he jokes, but it\u2019s true. I look at my phone infrequently and there are rarely clocks around, personal devices apparently having made them obsolete. I am more in the moment, but less aware of the actual hour and minute.   This is easily solvable: I\u2019ll get a watch. It definitely won\u2019t be a smart one.

The EU has not been enforcing its own laws.\"</p><p>Facebook and Google deny such allegations, accusing local politicians of playing on public fears after the scandal surrounding mass surveillance by the National Security Agency.</p><p>Another area causing deep ire in Europe is American companies' aggressive push to win the best tax deals for themselves by jurisdiction-shopping - a common practice in the USA where  states compete to lure business with incentives.</p><p>The European Commission released documents last week explaining why it decided in June 2013 to open an investigation into whether Apple received unfair tax breaks from Ireland.</p><p>\"The approach in the EU toward this kind of Internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile.\"</p><p>Christian Wey, a competition expert at the University of Dusseldorf-Germany</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STCLD-stc-1147998908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STCLD2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FF3-J0P1-JC3H-043B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 St. Cloud Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>St. Cloud Times (Minnesota)</publicationName><edition>2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 5, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The EU has not been enforcing its own laws.\"</p><p>Facebook and Google deny such allegations, accusing local politicians of playing on public fears after the scandal surrounding mass surveillance by the National Security Agency.</p><p>Another area causing deep ire in Europe is American companies' aggressive push to win the best tax deals for themselves by jurisdiction-shopping - a common practice in the USA where  states compete to lure business with incentives.</p><p>The European Commission released documents last week explaining why it decided in June 2013 to open an investigation into whether Apple received unfair tax breaks from Ireland.</p><p>\"The approach in the EU toward this kind of Internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile.\"</p><p>Christian Wey, a competition expert at the University of Dusseldorf-Germany</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESREG-des-796322498</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESREG2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D9R-43V1-DYJJ-P029-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">254399</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Des Moines Register All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Des Moines Register</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 5, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;
