Neither sales nor profits have matched the pace of share price growth. Yet a $2tn market cap does not look out of reach. The first milestone took almost four decades. The second is likely to be a lot speedier.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Between them, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have added more than a trillion dollars in market value since the start of 2020. Regulators already concerned about the influence of tech mega-companies must surely be looking askance at the stock market bonanza.\u00a0</p><p>What could derail the rally? Two things: continuing economic recession and more forceful antitrust regulation.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Both factors have been at play this week. Microsoft shares dipped in spite of forecast-beating sales after the company reminded investors of the economic drag from the pandemic. Growth in cloud computing, which gives users access to computing power from company servers, failed to match lofty expectations.</p><p>Intel also reported stronger than expected quarterly earnings, yet shares tumbled when it declared it would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29e02e4f-df7f-49d7-8f94-00a5af481909\"> delay the launch</url> of its next generation of chips. Meanwhile, reports that Apple faces consumer protection investigations in multiple US states knocked the iPhone maker\u2019s shares.</p><p>Given the importance of tech to US equity markets, it is worth paying attention to the number of caveats offered by tech companies that reported otherwise boastworthy results.</p><p>Netflix, now practically a utility for millions stuck at home, added 10m new users in the last quarter. Yet it warned that subscriber growth in the next quarter is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48e0056e-5916-4803-842f-f0fd5a4c08fa\"> likely to fall to 2.5m</url>. Vanishing chat app Snapchat added 35m users compared with last year, as teens sequestered with their parents sought out more virtual contact with their friends. But parent company Snap cautioned that demand had already fallen back from a pandemic peak and that it no longer expected to be profitable this year.\u00a0</p><p>Even bombastic electric carmaker Tesla, which reported its fourth quarter of consecutive profits, had to acknowledge the effects that tax credit revenue had. Tesla\u2019s share price is flat on the week.\u00a0</p><p>To some, this pause is valid. </p><p>\u201cThere is a feeling of QE irrationality all over again,\u201d wrote one investor when I asked how he felt about the pandemic-era market rally and the performance of recent listings such as insurance tech start-up Lemonade and ZoomInfo. With governments, including the UK and US, buying up ultra-low-risk sovereign bonds in order to give a boost to markets and hopefully stabilise their economies, the money has gone elsewhere.</p><p>Even Airbnb, whose initial public offering was blown off course by the pandemic and which opted to borrow more money while still a private company, appears to be back on track with its plans.\u00a0</p><p>The indecent haste with which $1tn companies Apple, Microsoft and Amazon became $1.5tn-plus companies lifted the wider tech sector. It also encouraged carelessness. For a brief period after last year\u2019s WeWork farce, it seemed as though every tech start-up nearing a listing had to be profitable or have a bulletproof plan on how to get there. In the heat of the rally, gross margins were suddenly dropped as a talking point.</p><p>Now margins and moderation are back in focus. Four of the most powerful chief executives in big tech \u2014 Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai \u2014 are due to appear in front of a House committee and can expect questions designed to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/216e3135-eec4-4d6a-a914-4d5d03cdee54\"> make them squirm</url>. </p><p>The race to $2tn is still on. But after months of excess it appears that a minor reality check is under way.\u00a0\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-e1de09d1fb8e480c8c2539c802528e9f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60F5-MG71-JB77-K01F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"643\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 24, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Each of the ``fab four'' US tech firms played a distinct role.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Googlefirst helped us to find stuff and then communicate with its Gmail services. Amazon sold us stuff, first books and then pretty much everything. Facebook let us find out whether our friends were :-) or :-(. Apple sold pretty devices for listening to songs and watching films. Each of these companies was happy doing its own thing and left the others alone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now those divisions are breaking down. The big tech firms are on a cybercollision course. Thanks to new hardware, notably tablet computers and smartphones, new software and apps and a world blanketed by wi-fi and 3G (and soon 4G), we work, rest and play online more and more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We read newspapers on our tablets, listen to music on our iPods or MP3 players, book a restaurant table or a cinema ticket on our smartphones, store our photographs on Flickr and look at our personal and professional email, documents and calendars online.</p><p>As the market for digital stuff expands, doing only one thing, however well, is no longer so attractive for tech firms because it's no longer so lucrative.</p><p>What Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Larry Page want to do is to become the sole caterer to all our burgeoning digital needs.</p><p>The more services they can offer, the more users they can attract, the more services they can sell us and the more advertising revenue they can generate. The battle to become chief executive of the web is on.</p><p>Zuckerberg's initial public offering is a key part of his attempt to run the web. Facebook may have more than 800 million users but it is small. Last year it had revenues, largely from selling advertisements, of $US3.7 billion ($3.4bn), as against Google's $US38bn in 2010. To expand, Zuckerberg needs cash and plenty of it.</p><p>In May, after the IPO, he will have a war chest of $US5bn. That will enable him to join his rivals in the fab four as each spends big to try to digitise and revolutionise every corner of our lives, taking a slice out of each transaction that results.</p><p>How will they do this? Being successful in Silicon Valley means being good at keeping secrets, but here are some of the products that insiders say each firm has hidden up its hoodie sleeves.</p><p>Facebook will offer better social networking and communication. It has copied some of the most lauded features of Google's new social networking service Google+. It promises a broader, more social email-style system that Facebookers insist will replace what they call ``old-fashioned'' Gmail.</p><p>Facebook is flirting with the idea of taking on Google's core business with its own search service. Not one based on results in cyberspace, however well sifted by algorithms, but on the data provided by you, me and our friends.</p><p>A Facebook phone, with photos and status updates uploaded to a Facebook page with a single click, is on the way.</p><p>Facebook is joining movie website Netflix, music streaming service Spotify and games maker Zynga to bring us Facebook TV, Facebook movies, Facebook music and Facebook games based on our own preferences and our friends' recommendations.</p><p>There are even Facebook credits, a virtual currency bought with real money that Facebookers use to play computer games. The goal is to make us live wholly inside Facebook's walled garden, a place Zuckerberg insists with boyish enthusiasm ``is going to be really, really good''.</p><p>Sadly for Zuckerberg, he has competition from the neighbours and they have an even bigger stash of cash. Apple, which has $US98bn to spend, almost as much ready cash as the US government, has the most popular smartphone model on the market, the iPhone, and the most popular tablet computer, the iPad.</p><p>Cook, who took over Apple after Steve Jobs resigned from the chief executive job not long before his death last year, is determined to make them even better. He has, for example, integrated Twitter throughout Apple's line-up, enabling us to tweet from any app, a feature clearly aimed at dulling Facebook's mobile growth.</p><p>Cook is also working on iPad, iPod and iTunes services that he believes will trump Facebook's music, movies, TV and games offerings. He wants to sell us e-books through the iBooks part of iTunes, to lure us away from Amazon. Apple's new iCloud service enables us to write and store our documents, spreadsheets, email, contacts and calendar on Apple's servers and access them on any device we want, even ones we do not own, in a direct challenge to Google's online computing services.</p><p>Cook is also readying a web-enabled Apple TV. The idea is that we will buy programs and films using iTunes. Television is the most important mass medium yet to be breached by the digital world.</p><p>Just down the road from Facebook, Google's whizzo brains have stopped lounging on beanbags and crunching granola bars while lecturing the world on the virtues of not being evil and started knuckling down to the gritty business of grinding Zuckerberg's and Cook's noses into the techno-dirt.</p><p>Googlehas its own version of the iPhone. It's not a single phone but any handset that runs its Android software. Android phones comfortably outsell iPhones, accounting for almost half of all smartphones sold worldwide. Googlehas launched a web-based GoogleTV service, offering programs streamed via the web. It is using Google+ to make its search results more social, to combat Zuckerberg's social search ambitions. It has launched GoogleMusic, to offer songs, and it owns YouTube, where we can now watch or rent TV programs and films.</p><p>In development in Mountain View, Google's headquarters, is GoogleWallet, an online payment program that will enable us to buy stuff by waving our phone at a shop's paypad.</p><p>Googlealready makes mobile phones in partnership with HTC and Samsung, and recently it spent $US12.5bn snapping up Motorola's consumer division. It is readying its first own-label, Motorola-built mobile phones and tablet computers to tackle Apple head-on and is even flirting with becoming a telephone service provider.</p><p>``We're still at the very, very early stages of what technology can do,'' Page says.</p><p>``Our ultimate ambition is to transform the overall Googleexperience, making it beautifully simple, almost auto-magical.''</p><p>And what of Amazon, that other West Coast behemoth that nearly doubled in size between 2008 and 2010 and hit almost $US50bn in annual revenues last year? It has new hardware, the Kindle Fire, which helpfully comes loaded with the account details of Amazon users, making it easier than ever to buy stuff. The Fire also boasts social networking that connects Amazon users with others who share tastes in books and films, a direct challenge to Facebook.</p><p>Amazon offers a new app shop, a new online payment system, TV and movie streaming and cloud computing for individuals and businesses.</p><p>As they jostle for position, each of the tech titans is as busy talking down the opposition as it is talking itself up.</p><p>Apple has vowed to ``destroy'' Google's Android mobile phone and tablet computer operating system, which senior executives dismiss as ``theft'' of Apple technology. Apple is suing manufacturers of Android devices all over the world for patent infringement.</p><p>Google's response? ``Failing to succeed in the smartphone market, they are resorting to legal measures.''</p><p>Facebook hired the PR firm Burson-Marsteller to plant negative stories about Google. When it got caught, it said sorry.</p><p>This is what happens when an entire industry reboots itself. The great tech war of 2012 marks the start of the third age of computing. In the beginning, firms battled to sell us hardware. It was IBM vs Apple vs whatever beige box we liked the look of. Then hardware became a commodity and firms competed to sell us better software -- Microsoft Windows v Apple OS v Google's online services.</p><p>Now, in the mobile internet age, firms are battling to create the best online platform, offering a vast, seamlessly connected suite of anytime, anywhere services that we use all day, every day and that become as much a part of our lives as the air we breathe. Creating the dominant platform matters so much because it will give the winning firm the lion's share of the world's eyeballs. More eyeballs means more direct sales of hardware, software and services, and advertising. But eyeballs offer something even more valuable, something tech firms prize more than anything else: data.</p><p>Every time you or I log on to Google, Facebook, Amazon or iTunes, we leave digital fingerprints. With our search queries, our ``likes'', the songs we listen to, the TV programs we watch, the books we buy and our tweets, we reveal who we are. Thanks to our computer's IP address and location-based technology in mobile phones, we also disclose where we are.</p><p>This accurate, real-life, real-time information is an invaluable treasury. It enables Googleand Facebook to offer advertisers the chance to reach their target market and even to advertise to them at particular times of the day and in places where they are most likely to respond. Facebook, whose data is even more valuable because we tell it more about ourselves and it knows who our friends are, is desperate to start using it to ramp up its ad sales to Google-like proportions.</p><p>Analysts think the digital advertising sector could be worth $US200bn by 2020.</p><p>There's a problem here, of course. Apart from Apple's natty hardware and all the big players' software and apps, critics say the fab four create little or nothing. What they do is make all the money in the world by exploiting other people's stuff.</p><p>Most of the content we find when we do a Google search is created by others, but Googlesells ads against the search. The content creators do not receive a share of the ad revenue.</p><p>Googlepoints out that its search engine sends users to the content creators' websites, where each can try to make money itself.</p><p>Amazon sells books at prices lower than publishers and booksellers say is fair. Facebook does not create the data it uses to sell advertising. We agree to hand the data over when we sign up and we do not get to opt out.</p><p>Apple pays record labels for the music it sells through iTunes but keeps a big chunk of sales revenue for itself: iTunes now in effect runs the music industry.</p><p>With an eye to the bottom line, the fab four bitterly resist any attempt to stop them exploiting one another's content. Each spends billions on lobbying politicians to drive home their case that any regulation of the internet would impinge on free speech and free trade. Who could object to freedom, right?</p><p>Well, more and more of us. Newspapers, including this one, have set up paywalls to ensure readers pay for high-quality journalism rather than simply getting it free. Hollywood studios, which are battling piracy, are backing the (now shelved) Stop Online Piracy Act in America, which aims to make internet service providers do more to respect copyright. Facebook is facing a backlash from users over its decision to publish all their posts in a timeline that creates a permanent online diary of its users' lives for all to see.</p><p>In her new book, I Know Who You Are and I Saw What You Did: Social Networks and the Death of Privacy, Lori Andrews, an American law professor, calls for a new constitution governing how web firms can exploit our data and the content generated by traditional businesses.</p><p>How do the hi-tech firms respond to critics? They don't care much, and since they are making more money than god, who can blame them? For now, regulators show little interest in clipping tech firms' wings. Most consumers seem pretty happy, too.</p><p>Polls -- and sales -- show that our desire for a connected future vastly outweighs any concerns we may have that we will become slaves to the machine.</p><p>Ultimately, it is you and I who will decide the victor of the great tech war of 2012. Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple have gone from being the dreams of the young and the obsessions of the stubborn to a place in the dictionary because almost everyone reading this article uses them. Whichever we keep logging on to will keep growing. Whichever we lose interest in won't. The choice -- the click -- is ours.</p><p>MASTERS OF OUR UNIVERSE</p><p>Facebook co-founder and chief executive</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG</p><p>Amazon founder and chief executive</p><p>JEFF BEZOS</p><p>Apple chief executive and Steve Jobs successor</p><p>TIM COOK</p><p>Googleco-founder and chief executive</p><p>LARRY PAGE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS201202061011773937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54WN-HC81-F0JP-W2GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2080\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>1 - All-round Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>February 6, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Let's carry on talking about cloud. The race for control of the cloud very much on at the moment. Big tech companies getting into the space, driving down prices. As ever, it's the survival of the fittest. Will the lesser known names manage to stay competitive and in business?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rackspace Hosting has had a challenging couple years, but with shares up last night, investors a little bit more upbeat about this cloud computing company. So how did the company weather the storm and what happens next? Its CEO is a gentleman called Taylor Rhodes, and he's sitting next to me. Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TAYLOR RHODES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RACKSPACE HOSTING: Good morning, Guy.</p><p>JOHNSON: Tough to be small in a - in an increasing big world?</p><p>RHODES: Well I think you can look at examples in industries that evolve over time. And you've always got the bulk players, the volume players, and you've got the specialists who are in profitable niches. You've got lots of news this morning about Tescos, but at the same time Waitrose is doing quite well. So in any industry, there is the bulk volume and then there's the specialty play. And Rackspace has always been the specialist in the industry that adds value on top of commodity infrastructure.</p><p>JOHNSON: Nice line drawing there between one and the other. It's - it's a fair point to make, and in some ways if you were to go back to that Waitrose analogy, Waitrose is a more managed story.</p><p>RHODES: Absolutely.</p><p>JOHNSON: Tescos is a - some would say a less manage story in store. You just throw everything in there and - and hopefully people will buy it. Is this a divergence we're now going to see between managed cloud storage and unmanaged cloud storage? These are effectively two different businesses.</p><p>RHODES: They are, and I think that's the takeaway. The first five years of cloud - cloud really got started in 2008 and '09 because global financial crisis meant people had to shed costs. Risk tolerance for trying new models was on, but the early five years of cloud were really driven by developers, software engineers who said, the CIO, he's too slow. I want to solve a problem a new way. Here's something where I can buy it on a utility basis. It's available now. I can go develop. But really those developers, the early adopters are very technologically savvy. They want to play with the technology.</p><p>But now the mainstream market, as it always does, is starting to say cloud is compelling. Different economics. It makes infrastructure available. How am I going to use it? I may not have all of those tech skills on my payroll. So you're going to see this unmanaged model where you have technically savvy people who want to control more, and you're going to see the mainstream market prefer a managed cloud model that infrastructure is a component, but how do you manage it?</p><p>The other interesting thing is as commodity continues to creep into cloud and prices get cheaper for the inputs, that's software and that's hardware, what's going to proliferate are tools and software that take advantage of the ubiquity of cheap infrastructure which creates complexity for mainstream companies. They have a hard time keeping up with the tech skills required to manage the cloud themselves. So we'll see this transition from early adoption, which was unmanaged cloud, to mainstream adoption, which is managed cloud.</p><p>JOHNSON: Shall I think about this as hardware and software? I -</p><p>RHODES: And service.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah. So it's a kind of a service. You are the service option. They - they are the kind of - they are the hardware option, and - and - and how different do those two markets become?</p><p>RHODES: I think that if you - if you think about a traditional software company, let's just talk about SaaS or cloud-delivered software. You think about a Microsoft or a VMWare. They used to sell you a license. You bought it as a - as a thing that you paid a price for (inaudible) paid a perpetual maintenance license on.</p><p>And now because the cloud has said, well we're going to tip that model over, we don't like that model anymore, it doesn't fit the cost structure that we want to drive in our businesses, we want to make technology utility or usage-based pricing. Software is going to be monetized more and more in cloud service models. So we take inputs from Microsoft, VMWare and other providers of hardware and software. We build a cloud service model around them and we deliver that technology in a service context to our customers.</p><p>JOHNSON: So you're more IBM?</p><p>RHODES: Well, I think it's a - it's a good model for the free cloud era. I think in the cloud era our model looks more like IBM from a service management perspective delivering value on top of commodity infrastructure.</p><p>JOHNSON: When you look at the - sort of the potential for your business further down the road, how different is it in the United States and how different is it here in Europe? We were talking to our last guest from Google about the differences that exist between the adoption of cloud, the concern surrounding cloud, and the regulatory story surrounding cloud here in Europe versus the United States. How different is it?</p><p>RHODES: It's quite different, and I think Barack (ph) from Google made a great point, which is because Europe isn't one homogenous thing, it is lots of different countries together, you naturally have the friction and complexity of those different models looking at data privacy, looking at the consumer, and trying to plan the right policy.</p><p>But inevitably, because it's a more complex environment, it will move more slowly. There will be frictions built in, versus more - pardon me. I meant to say it is more of a heterogeneous market where the US is more of a homogenous market. There's a common policy and framework. And so you always see the US markets 18 to 24 months ahead of - of the European market in terms of technology adoption, and I think that's one of the reasons why.</p><p>JOHNSON: Is that just a structural impediment that we're just - we're going to have to get used to in Europe, or is it something that we can deal with, find a way around and move on from?</p><p>RHODES: I think as with anything, if you think about ecommerce years ago, people were very hesitant to buy online. They were afraid someone was going to steal their - their credit card number. But it's matured. It's evolved, and now it's a very accepted business model. Cloud will do the same thing. I think it will just develop at pace. As things like compliancy and standards get addressed in cloud models, that will accelerate adoption.</p><p>My hope is that governments here take a very technology and business- friendly approach to cloud because cloud really does speed the innovation of business.</p><p>JOHNSON: Is that hope over expectation? Do you - over reality? What do you think is really going to happen? That's your hope. What do you think is going to happen?</p><p>RHODES: Well I don't have a crystal ball on Brussels, but I do think it will take - it'll take longer. But if you look at cloud adoption, the US is arguably a couple of years ahead further into this. But I moved to London in 2010, spent three years here, and I can tell you that the inflection curve started to catch up. So as the economics of cloud get more and more compelling, you're going to see a larger and larger din from the business marketplace to treat it with fair policies.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just one final question on security. Security seems to be a bigger issue over here as well, though arguably that shouldn't be the case. Do you think businesses understand the cloud yet? Do you think that we fully have grasped what we're doing in terms of what effectively is the - the crown jewels of our business, data? Every company now, its data is everything. We're handing it over to you. Do I as a - as a CEO understand what I'm giving you do you think at this stage?</p><p>RHODES: I think that markets go through hype and then wisdom, and the cloud market has gone through tremendous hype. Even the word cloud has been so overhyped. It's become shorthand for buying computing as a service essentially, but there's - underneath the covers there's lots of different ways. The market is evolving with a preference for what's called hybrid cloud. That means some things will be in a private cloud context which you can manage with a partner or yourself for solely your environment.</p><p>You don't share the tin (ph) or the computing or networking with anybody else. And then there's also public cloud, which is generally the model that a Google would field which is it's shared pools of compute and networking and storage spread over many customers. So what's happening in the market as it goes from hype to wisdom, it's saying private clouds have a real role where data security and privacy and performance of high - hard- hitting databases, but then also the ability to use public cloud right along side for things that are highly variable matter.</p><p>I'll give you a good example. Our customer in the UK, Domino's Pizza, every Tuesday night for the football they run an offer. And they used to have build out physical infrastructure every time they had a very high spike in volume, right? Now that they can use the cloud, they say, right, I'm concerned about data privacy for my consumer's credit cards. I'm going to run that in a private cloud. I'm going to connect that into a public cloud for burstability. Therefore I don't have to buy the peak. I can pay for the base of the business. I can rent the peak, pay for what I use and then turn it off. So that's a very good example of a mainstream market application of hybrid cloud.</p><p>JOHNSON: Using pizzas as the - as the story. Nice to see you, Taylor. Thank you very much indeed for stopping by.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Let's carry on talking about cloud. The race for control of the cloud very  much on at the moment. Big tech companies getting into the space, driving  down prices. As ever, it's the survival of the fittest. Will the lesser  known names manage to stay competitive and in business?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rackspace Hosting has had a challenging couple years, but with shares  up last night, investors a little bit more upbeat about this cloud  computing company. So how did the company weather the storm and what  happens next? Its CEO is a gentleman called Taylor Rhodes, and he's sitting  next to me. Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TAYLOR RHODES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RACKSPACE HOSTING: Good  morning, Guy.</p><p>JOHNSON: Tough to be small in a - in an increasing big world?</p><p>RHODES: Well I think you can look at examples in industries that  evolve over time. And you've always got the bulk players, the volume  players, and you've got the specialists who are in profitable niches.  You've got lots of news this morning about Tescos, but at the same time  Waitrose is doing quite well. So in any industry, there is the bulk volume  and then there's the specialty play. And Rackspace has always been the  specialist in the industry that adds value on top of commodity  infrastructure.</p><p>JOHNSON: Nice line drawing there between one and the other. It's -  it's a fair point to make, and in some ways if you were to go back to that  Waitrose analogy, Waitrose is a more managed story.</p><p>RHODES: Absolutely.</p><p>JOHNSON: Tescos is a - some would say a less manage story in store.  You just throw everything in there and - and hopefully people will buy it.  Is this a divergence we're now going to see between managed cloud storage  and unmanaged cloud storage? These are effectively two different  businesses.</p><p>RHODES: They are, and I think that's the takeaway. The first five  years of cloud - cloud really got started in 2008 and '09 because global  financial crisis meant people had to shed costs. Risk tolerance for trying  new models was on, but the early five years of cloud were really driven by  developers, software engineers who said, the CIO, he's too slow. I want to  solve a problem a new way. Here's something where I can buy it on a utility  basis. It's available now. I can go develop. But really those developers,  the early adopters are very technologically savvy. They want to play with  the technology.</p><p>But now the mainstream market, as it always does, is starting to say  cloud is compelling. Different economics. It makes infrastructure  available. How am I going to use it? I may not have all of those tech  skills on my payroll. So you're going to see this unmanaged model where you  have technically savvy people who want to control more, and you're going to  see the mainstream market prefer a managed cloud model that infrastructure  is a component, but how do you manage it?</p><p>The other interesting thing is as commodity continues to creep into  cloud and prices get cheaper for the inputs, that's software and that's  hardware, what's going to proliferate are tools and software that take  advantage of the ubiquity of cheap infrastructure which creates complexity  for mainstream companies. They have a hard time keeping up with the tech  skills required to manage the cloud themselves. So we'll see this  transition from early adoption, which was unmanaged cloud, to mainstream  adoption, which is managed cloud.</p><p>JOHNSON: Shall I think about this as hardware and software? I - </p><p>RHODES: And service.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah. So it's a kind of a service. You are the service  option. They - they are the kind of - they are the hardware option, and -  and - and how different do those two markets become?</p><p>RHODES: I think that if you - if you think about a traditional  software company, let's just talk about SaaS or cloud-delivered software.  You think about a Microsoft or a VMWare. They used to sell you a license.  You bought it as a - as a thing that you paid a price for (inaudible) paid  a perpetual maintenance license on.</p><p>And now because the cloud has said, well we're going to tip that model  over, we don't like that model anymore, it doesn't fit the cost structure  that we want to drive in our businesses, we want to make technology utility  or usage-based pricing. Software is going to be monetized more and more in  cloud service models. So we take inputs from Microsoft, VMWare and other  providers of hardware and software.  We build a cloud service model around  them and we deliver that technology in a service context to our customers.</p><p>JOHNSON: So you're more IBM?</p><p>RHODES: Well, I think it's a - it's a good model for the free cloud  era. I think in the cloud era our model looks more like IBM from a service  management perspective delivering value on top of commodity infrastructure.</p><p>JOHNSON: When you look at the - sort of the potential for your  business further down the road, how different is it in the United States  and how different is it here in Europe? We were talking to our last guest  from Google about the differences that exist between the adoption of cloud,  the concern surrounding cloud, and the regulatory story surrounding cloud  here in Europe versus the United States. How different is it?</p><p>RHODES: It's quite different, and I think Barack (ph) from Google made  a great point, which is because Europe isn't one homogenous thing, it is  lots of different countries together, you naturally have the friction and  complexity of those different models looking at data privacy, looking at  the consumer, and trying to plan the right policy.</p><p>But inevitably, because it's a more complex environment, it will move  more slowly. There will be frictions built in, versus more - pardon me. I  meant to say it is more of a heterogeneous market where the US is more of a  homogenous market. There's a common policy and framework. And so you always  see the US markets 18 to 24 months ahead of - of the European market in  terms of technology adoption, and I think that's one of the reasons why.</p><p>JOHNSON: Is that just a structural impediment that we're just - we're  going to have to get used to in Europe, or is it something that we can deal  with, find a way around and move on from?</p><p>RHODES: I think as with anything, if you think about ecommerce years  ago, people were very hesitant to buy online. They were afraid someone was  going to steal their - their credit card number. But it's matured. It's  evolved, and now it's a very accepted business model. Cloud will do the  same thing. I think it will just develop at pace. As things like compliancy  and standards get addressed in cloud models, that will accelerate adoption. </p><p>My hope is that governments here take a very technology and business- friendly approach to cloud because cloud really does speed the innovation  of business.</p><p>JOHNSON: Is that hope over expectation? Do you - over reality? What do  you think is really going to happen? That's your hope. What do you think is  going to happen?</p><p>RHODES: Well I don't have a crystal ball on Brussels, but I do think  it will take - it'll take longer. But if you look at cloud adoption, the US  is arguably a couple of years ahead further into this. But I moved to  London in 2010, spent three years here, and I can tell you that the  inflection curve started to catch up. So as the economics of cloud get more  and more compelling, you're going to see a larger and larger din from the  business marketplace to treat it with fair policies.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just one final question on security. Security seems to be a  bigger issue over here as well, though arguably that shouldn't be the case.  Do you think businesses understand the cloud yet? Do you think that we  fully have grasped what we're doing in terms of what effectively is the -  the crown jewels of our business, data? Every company now, its data is  everything. We're handing it over to you. Do I as a - as a CEO understand  what I'm giving you do you think at this stage?</p><p>RHODES: I think that markets go through hype and then wisdom, and the  cloud market has gone through tremendous hype. Even the word cloud has been  so overhyped. It's become shorthand for buying computing as a service  essentially, but there's - underneath the covers there's lots of different  ways. The market is evolving with a preference for what's called hybrid  cloud. That means some things will be in a private cloud context which you  can manage with a partner or yourself for solely your environment. </p><p>You don't share the tin (ph) or the computing or networking with  anybody else. And then there's also public cloud, which is generally the  model that a Google would field which is it's shared pools of compute and  networking and storage spread over many customers. So what's happening in  the market as it goes from hype to wisdom, it's saying private clouds have  a real role where data security and privacy and performance of high - hard- hitting databases, but then also the ability to use public cloud right  along side for things that are highly variable matter.</p><p>I'll give you a good example. Our customer in the UK, Domino's Pizza,  every Tuesday night for the football they run an offer. And they used to  have build out physical infrastructure every time they had a very high  spike in volume, right? Now that they can use the cloud, they say, right,  I'm concerned about data privacy for my consumer's credit cards. I'm going  to run that in a private cloud. I'm going to connect that into a public  cloud for burstability. Therefore I don't have to buy the peak. I can pay  for the base of the business. I can rent the peak, pay for what I use and  then turn it off. So that's a very good example of a mainstream market  application of hybrid cloud.</p><p>JOHNSON: Using pizzas as the - as the story. Nice to see you, Taylor.  Thank you very much indeed for stopping by.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Let's carry on talking about cloud. The race for control of the cloud very much on at the moment. Big tech companies getting into the space, driving down prices. As ever, it's the survival of the fittest. Will the lesser known names manage to stay competitive and in business?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rackspace Hosting has had a challenging couple years, but with shares up last night, investors a little bit more upbeat about this cloud computing company. So how did the company weather the storm and what happens next? Its CEO is a gentleman called Taylor Rhodes, and he's sitting next to me. Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TAYLOR RHODES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RACKSPACE HOSTING: Good morning, Guy.</p><p>JOHNSON: Tough to be small in a - in an increasing big world?</p><p>RHODES: Well I think you can look at examples in industries that evolve over time. And you've always got the bulk players, the volume players, and you've got the specialists who are in profitable niches. You've got lots of news this morning about Tescos, but at the same time Waitrose is doing quite well. So in any industry, there is the bulk volume and then there's the specialty play. And Rackspace has always been the specialist in the industry that adds value on top of commodity infrastructure.</p><p>JOHNSON: Nice line drawing there between one and the other. It's - it's a fair point to make, and in some ways if you were to go back to that Waitrose analogy, Waitrose is a more managed story.</p><p>RHODES: Absolutely.</p><p>JOHNSON: Tescos is a - some would say a less manage story in store. You just throw everything in there and - and hopefully people will buy it. Is this a divergence we're now going to see between managed cloud storage and unmanaged cloud storage? These are effectively two different businesses.</p><p>RHODES: They are, and I think that's the takeaway. The first five years of cloud - cloud really got started in 2008 and '09 because global financial crisis meant people had to shed costs. Risk tolerance for trying new models was on, but the early five years of cloud were really driven by developers, software engineers who said, the CIO, he's too slow. I want to solve a problem a new way. Here's something where I can buy it on a utility basis. It's available now. I can go develop. But really those developers, the early adopters are very technologically savvy. They want to play with the technology.</p><p>But now the mainstream market, as it always does, is starting to say cloud is compelling. Different economics. It makes infrastructure available. How am I going to use it? I may not have all of those tech skills on my payroll. So you're going to see this unmanaged model where you have technically savvy people who want to control more, and you're going to see the mainstream market prefer a managed cloud model that infrastructure is a component, but how do you manage it?</p><p>The other interesting thing is as commodity continues to creep into cloud and prices get cheaper for the inputs, that's software and that's hardware, what's going to proliferate are tools and software that take advantage of the ubiquity of cheap infrastructure which creates complexity for mainstream companies. They have a hard time keeping up with the tech skills required to manage the cloud themselves. So we'll see this transition from early adoption, which was unmanaged cloud, to mainstream adoption, which is managed cloud.</p><p>JOHNSON: Shall I think about this as hardware and software? I -</p><p>RHODES: And service.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah. So it's a kind of a service. You are the service option. They - they are the kind of - they are the hardware option, and - and - and how different do those two markets become?</p><p>RHODES: I think that if you - if you think about a traditional software company, let's just talk about SaaS or cloud-delivered software. You think about a Microsoft or a VMWare. They used to sell you a license. You bought it as a - as a thing that you paid a price for (inaudible) paid a perpetual maintenance license on.</p><p>And now because the cloud has said, well we're going to tip that model over, we don't like that model anymore, it doesn't fit the cost structure that we want to drive in our businesses, we want to make technology utility or usage-based pricing. Software is going to be monetized more and more in cloud service models. So we take inputs from Microsoft, VMWare and other providers of hardware and software. We build a cloud service model around them and we deliver that technology in a service context to our customers.</p><p>JOHNSON: So you're more IBM?</p><p>RHODES: Well, I think it's a - it's a good model for the free cloud era. I think in the cloud era our model looks more like IBM from a service management perspective delivering value on top of commodity infrastructure.</p><p>JOHNSON: When you look at the - sort of the potential for your business further down the road, how different is it in the United States and how different is it here in Europe? We were talking to our last guest from Google about the differences that exist between the adoption of cloud, the concern surrounding cloud, and the regulatory story surrounding cloud here in Europe versus the United States. How different is it?</p><p>RHODES: It's quite different, and I think Barack (ph) from Google made a great point, which is because Europe isn't one homogenous thing, it is lots of different countries together, you naturally have the friction and complexity of those different models looking at data privacy, looking at the consumer, and trying to plan the right policy.</p><p>But inevitably, because it's a more complex environment, it will move more slowly. There will be frictions built in, versus more - pardon me. I meant to say it is more of a heterogeneous market where the US is more of a homogenous market. There's a common policy and framework. And so you always see the US markets 18 to 24 months ahead of - of the European market in terms of technology adoption, and I think that's one of the reasons why.</p><p>JOHNSON: Is that just a structural impediment that we're just - we're going to have to get used to in Europe, or is it something that we can deal with, find a way around and move on from?</p><p>RHODES: I think as with anything, if you think about ecommerce years ago, people were very hesitant to buy online. They were afraid someone was going to steal their - their credit card number. But it's matured. It's evolved, and now it's a very accepted business model. Cloud will do the same thing. I think it will just develop at pace. As things like compliancy and standards get addressed in cloud models, that will accelerate adoption.</p><p>My hope is that governments here take a very technology and business- friendly approach to cloud because cloud really does speed the innovation of business.</p><p>JOHNSON: Is that hope over expectation? Do you - over reality? What do you think is really going to happen? That's your hope. What do you think is going to happen?</p><p>RHODES: Well I don't have a crystal ball on Brussels, but I do think it will take - it'll take longer. But if you look at cloud adoption, the US is arguably a couple of years ahead further into this. But I moved to London in 2010, spent three years here, and I can tell you that the inflection curve started to catch up. So as the economics of cloud get more and more compelling, you're going to see a larger and larger din from the business marketplace to treat it with fair policies.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just one final question on security. Security seems to be a bigger issue over here as well, though arguably that shouldn't be the case. Do you think businesses understand the cloud yet? Do you think that we fully have grasped what we're doing in terms of what effectively is the - the crown jewels of our business, data? Every company now, its data is everything. We're handing it over to you. Do I as a - as a CEO understand what I'm giving you do you think at this stage?</p><p>RHODES: I think that markets go through hype and then wisdom, and the cloud market has gone through tremendous hype. Even the word cloud has been so overhyped. It's become shorthand for buying computing as a service essentially, but there's - underneath the covers there's lots of different ways. The market is evolving with a preference for what's called hybrid cloud. That means some things will be in a private cloud context which you can manage with a partner or yourself for solely your environment.</p><p>You don't share the tin (ph) or the computing or networking with anybody else. And then there's also public cloud, which is generally the model that a Google would field which is it's shared pools of compute and networking and storage spread over many customers. So what's happening in the market as it goes from hype to wisdom, it's saying private clouds have a real role where data security and privacy and performance of high - hard- hitting databases, but then also the ability to use public cloud right along side for things that are highly variable matter.</p><p>I'll give you a good example. Our customer in the UK, Domino's Pizza, every Tuesday night for the football they run an offer. And they used to have build out physical infrastructure every time they had a very high spike in volume, right? Now that they can use the cloud, they say, right, I'm concerned about data privacy for my consumer's credit cards. I'm going to run that in a private cloud. I'm going to connect that into a public cloud for burstability. Therefore I don't have to buy the peak. I can pay for the base of the business. I can rent the peak, pay for what I use and then turn it off. So that's a very good example of a mainstream market application of hybrid cloud.</p><p>JOHNSON: Using pizzas as the - as the story. Nice to see you, Taylor. Thank you very much indeed for stopping by.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Now that they can use the cloud, they say, right, I'm concerned about data privacy for my consumer's credit cards. I'm going to run that in a private cloud. I'm going to connect that into a public cloud for burstability. Therefore I don't have to buy the peak. I can pay for the base of the business. I can rent the peak, pay for what I use and then turn it off. So that's a very good example of a mainstream market application of hybrid cloud.</p><p>JOHNSON: Using pizzas as the - as the story.

Let's carry on talking about cloud. The race for control of the cloud very  much on at the moment. Big tech companies getting into the space, driving  down prices. As ever, it's the survival of the fittest. Will the lesser  known names manage to stay competitive and in business?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      Rackspace Hosting has had a challenging couple years, but with shares  up last night, investors a little bit more upbeat about this cloud  computing company. So how did the company weather the storm and what  happens next? Its CEO is a gentleman called Taylor Rhodes, and he's sitting  next to me. Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      TAYLOR RHODES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RACKSPACE HOSTING: Good  morning, Guy.</p><p>      JOHNSON: Tough to be small in a - in an increasing big world?</p><p>      RHODES: Well I think you can look at examples in industries that  evolve over time. And you've always got the bulk players, the volume  players, and you've got the specialists who are in profitable niches.  You've got lots of news this morning about Tescos, but at the same time  Waitrose is doing quite well. So in any industry, there is the bulk volume  and then there's the specialty play. And Rackspace has always been the  specialist in the industry that adds value on top of commodity  infrastructure.</p><p>      JOHNSON: Nice line drawing there between one and the other. It's -  it's a fair point to make, and in some ways if you were to go back to that  Waitrose analogy, Waitrose is a more managed story.</p><p>      RHODES: Absolutely.</p><p>      JOHNSON: Tescos is a - some would say a less manage story in store.  You just throw everything in there and - and hopefully people will buy it.  Is this a divergence we're now going to see between managed cloud storage  and unmanaged cloud storage? These are effectively two different  businesses.</p><p>      RHODES: They are, and I think that's the takeaway. The first five  years of cloud - cloud really got started in 2008 and '09 because global  financial crisis meant people had to shed costs. Risk tolerance for trying  new models was on, but the early five years of cloud were really driven by  developers, software engineers who said, the CIO, he's too slow. I want to  solve a problem a new way. Here's something where I can buy it on a utility  basis. It's available now. I can go develop. But really those developers,  the early adopters are very technologically savvy. They want to play with  the technology.</p><p>      But now the mainstream market, as it always does, is starting to say  cloud is compelling. Different economics. It makes infrastructure  available. How am I going to use it? I may not have all of those tech  skills on my payroll. So you're going to see this unmanaged model where you  have technically savvy people who want to control more, and you're going to  see the mainstream market prefer a managed cloud model that infrastructure  is a component, but how do you manage it?</p><p>      The other interesting thing is as commodity continues to creep into  cloud and prices get cheaper for the inputs, that's software and that's  hardware, what's going to proliferate are tools and software that take  advantage of the ubiquity of cheap infrastructure which creates complexity  for mainstream companies. They have a hard time keeping up with the tech  skills required to manage the cloud themselves. So we'll see this  transition from early adoption, which was unmanaged cloud, to mainstream  adoption, which is managed cloud.</p><p>      JOHNSON: Shall I think about this as hardware and software? I - </p><p>      RHODES: And service.</p><p>      JOHNSON: Yeah. So it's a kind of a service. You are the service  option. They - they are the kind of - they are the hardware option, and -  and - and how different do those two markets become?</p><p>      RHODES: I think that if you - if you think about a traditional  software company, let's just talk about SaaS or cloud-delivered software.  You think about a Microsoft or a VMWare. They used to sell you a license.  You bought it as a - as a thing that you paid a price for (inaudible) paid  a perpetual maintenance license on.</p><p>      And now because the cloud has said, well we're going to tip that model  over, we don't like that model anymore, it doesn't fit the cost structure  that we want to drive in our businesses, we want to make technology utility  or usage-based pricing. Software is going to be monetized more and more in  cloud service models. So we take inputs from Microsoft, VMWare and other  providers of hardware and software.  We build a cloud service model around  them and we deliver that technology in a service context to our customers.</p><p>      JOHNSON: So you're more IBM?</p><p>      RHODES: Well, I think it's a - it's a good model for the free cloud  era. I think in the cloud era our model looks more like IBM from a service  management perspective delivering value on top of commodity infrastructure.</p><p>      JOHNSON: When you look at the - sort of the potential for your  business further down the road, how different is it in the United States  and how different is it here in Europe? We were talking to our last guest  from Google about the differences that exist between the adoption of cloud,  the concern surrounding cloud, and the regulatory story surrounding cloud  here in Europe versus the United States. How different is it?</p><p>      RHODES: It's quite different, and I think Barack (ph) from Google made  a great point, which is because Europe isn't one homogenous thing, it is  lots of different countries together, you naturally have the friction and  complexity of those different models looking at data privacy, looking at  the consumer, and trying to plan the right policy.</p><p>      But inevitably, because it's a more complex environment, it will move  more slowly. There will be frictions built in, versus more - pardon me. I  meant to say it is more of a heterogeneous market where the US is more of a  homogenous market. There's a common policy and framework. And so you always  see the US markets 18 to 24 months ahead of - of the European market in  terms of technology adoption, and I think that's one of the reasons why.</p><p>      JOHNSON: Is that just a structural impediment that we're just - we're  going to have to get used to in Europe, or is it something that we can deal  with, find a way around and move on from?</p><p>      RHODES: I think as with anything, if you think about ecommerce years  ago, people were very hesitant to buy online. They were afraid someone was  going to steal their - their credit card number. But it's matured. It's  evolved, and now it's a very accepted business model. Cloud will do the  same thing. I think it will just develop at pace. As things like compliancy  and standards get addressed in cloud models, that will accelerate adoption. </p><p>      My hope is that governments here take a very technology and business- friendly approach to cloud because cloud really does speed the innovation  of business.</p><p>      JOHNSON: Is that hope over expectation? Do you - over reality? What do  you think is really going to happen? That's your hope. What do you think is  going to happen?</p><p>      RHODES: Well I don't have a crystal ball on Brussels, but I do think  it will take - it'll take longer. But if you look at cloud adoption, the US  is arguably a couple of years ahead further into this. But I moved to  London in 2010, spent three years here, and I can tell you that the  inflection curve started to catch up. So as the economics of cloud get more  and more compelling, you're going to see a larger and larger din from the  business marketplace to treat it with fair policies.</p><p>      JOHNSON: Just one final question on security. Security seems to be a  bigger issue over here as well, though arguably that shouldn't be the case.  Do you think businesses understand the cloud yet? Do you think that we  fully have grasped what we're doing in terms of what effectively is the -  the crown jewels of our business, data? Every company now, its data is  everything. We're handing it over to you. Do I as a - as a CEO understand  what I'm giving you do you think at this stage?</p><p>      RHODES: I think that markets go through hype and then wisdom, and the  cloud market has gone through tremendous hype. Even the word cloud has been  so overhyped. It's become shorthand for buying computing as a service  essentially, but there's - underneath the covers there's lots of different  ways.

Let's carry on talking about cloud. The race for control of the cloud very much on at the moment. Big tech companies getting into the space, driving down prices. As ever, it's the survival of the fittest. Will the lesser known names manage to stay competitive and in business?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rackspace Hosting has had a challenging couple years, but with shares up last night, investors a little bit more upbeat about this cloud computing company. So how did the company weather the storm and what happens next? Its CEO is a gentleman called Taylor Rhodes, and he's sitting next to me. Good morning.</p><p/><p>TAYLOR RHODES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RACKSPACE HOSTING: Good morning, Guy.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Tough to be small in a - in an increasing big world?</p><p/><p>RHODES: Well I think you can look at examples in industries that evolve over time. And you've always got the bulk players, the volume players, and you've got the specialists who are in profitable niches. You've got lots of news this morning about Tescos, but at the same time Waitrose is doing quite well. So in any industry, there is the bulk volume and then there's the specialty play. And Rackspace has always been the specialist in the industry that adds value on top of commodity infrastructure.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Nice line drawing there between one and the other. It's - it's a fair point to make, and in some ways if you were to go back to that Waitrose analogy, Waitrose is a more managed story.</p><p/><p>RHODES: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Tescos is a - some would say a less manage story in store. You just throw everything in there and - and hopefully people will buy it. Is this a divergence we're now going to see between managed cloud storage and unmanaged cloud storage? These are effectively two different businesses.</p><p/><p>RHODES: They are, and I think that's the takeaway. The first five years of cloud - cloud really got started in 2008 and '09 because global financial crisis meant people had to shed costs. Risk tolerance for trying new models was on, but the early five years of cloud were really driven by developers, software engineers who said, the CIO, he's too slow. I want to solve a problem a new way. Here's something where I can buy it on a utility basis. It's available now. I can go develop. But really those developers, the early adopters are very technologically savvy. They want to play with the technology.</p><p/><p>But now the mainstream market, as it always does, is starting to say cloud is compelling. Different economics. It makes infrastructure available. How am I going to use it? I may not have all of those tech skills on my payroll. So you're going to see this unmanaged model where you have technically savvy people who want to control more, and you're going to see the mainstream market prefer a managed cloud model that infrastructure is a component, but how do you manage it?</p><p/><p>The other interesting thing is as commodity continues to creep into cloud and prices get cheaper for the inputs, that's software and that's hardware, what's going to proliferate are tools and software that take advantage of the ubiquity of cheap infrastructure which creates complexity for mainstream companies. They have a hard time keeping up with the tech skills required to manage the cloud themselves. So we'll see this transition from early adoption, which was unmanaged cloud, to mainstream adoption, which is managed cloud.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Shall I think about this as hardware and software? I -</p><p/><p>RHODES: And service.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Yeah. So it's a kind of a service. You are the service option. They - they are the kind of - they are the hardware option, and - and - and how different do those two markets become?</p><p/><p>RHODES: I think that if you - if you think about a traditional software company, let's just talk about SaaS or cloud-delivered software. You think about a Microsoft or a VMWare. They used to sell you a license. You bought it as a - as a thing that you paid a price for (inaudible) paid a perpetual maintenance license on.</p><p/><p>And now because the cloud has said, well we're going to tip that model over, we don't like that model anymore, it doesn't fit the cost structure that we want to drive in our businesses, we want to make technology utility or usage-based pricing. Software is going to be monetized more and more in cloud service models. So we take inputs from Microsoft, VMWare and other providers of hardware and software. We build a cloud service model around them and we deliver that technology in a service context to our customers.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: So you're more IBM?</p><p/><p>RHODES: Well, I think it's a - it's a good model for the free cloud era. I think in the cloud era our model looks more like IBM from a service management perspective delivering value on top of commodity infrastructure.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: When you look at the - sort of the potential for your business further down the road, how different is it in the United States and how different is it here in Europe? We were talking to our last guest from Google about the differences that exist between the adoption of cloud, the concern surrounding cloud, and the regulatory story surrounding cloud here in Europe versus the United States. How different is it?</p><p/><p>RHODES: It's quite different, and I think Barack (ph) from Google made a great point, which is because Europe isn't one homogenous thing, it is lots of different countries together, you naturally have the friction and complexity of those different models looking at data privacy, looking at the consumer, and trying to plan the right policy.</p><p/><p>But inevitably, because it's a more complex environment, it will move more slowly. There will be frictions built in, versus more - pardon me. I meant to say it is more of a heterogeneous market where the US is more of a homogenous market. There's a common policy and framework. And so you always see the US markets 18 to 24 months ahead of - of the European market in terms of technology adoption, and I think that's one of the reasons why.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Is that just a structural impediment that we're just - we're going to have to get used to in Europe, or is it something that we can deal with, find a way around and move on from?</p><p/><p>RHODES: I think as with anything, if you think about ecommerce years ago, people were very hesitant to buy online. They were afraid someone was going to steal their - their credit card number. But it's matured. It's evolved, and now it's a very accepted business model. Cloud will do the same thing. I think it will just develop at pace. As things like compliancy and standards get addressed in cloud models, that will accelerate adoption.</p><p/><p>My hope is that governments here take a very technology and business- friendly approach to cloud because cloud really does speed the innovation of business.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Is that hope over expectation? Do you - over reality? What do you think is really going to happen? That's your hope. What do you think is going to happen?</p><p/><p>RHODES: Well I don't have a crystal ball on Brussels, but I do think it will take - it'll take longer. But if you look at cloud adoption, the US is arguably a couple of years ahead further into this. But I moved to London in 2010, spent three years here, and I can tell you that the inflection curve started to catch up. So as the economics of cloud get more and more compelling, you're going to see a larger and larger din from the business marketplace to treat it with fair policies.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Just one final question on security. Security seems to be a bigger issue over here as well, though arguably that shouldn't be the case. Do you think businesses understand the cloud yet? Do you think that we fully have grasped what we're doing in terms of what effectively is the - the crown jewels of our business, data? Every company now, its data is everything. We're handing it over to you. Do I as a - as a CEO understand what I'm giving you do you think at this stage?</p><p/><p>RHODES: I think that markets go through hype and then wisdom, and the cloud market has gone through tremendous hype. Even the word cloud has been so overhyped. It's become shorthand for buying computing as a service essentially, but there's - underneath the covers there's lots of different ways. The market is evolving with a preference for what's called hybrid cloud. That means some things will be in a private cloud context which you can manage with a partner or yourself for solely your environment.</p><p/><p>You don't share the tin (ph) or the computing or networking with anybody else. And then there's also public cloud, which is generally the model that a Google would field which is it's shared pools of compute and networking and storage spread over many customers. So what's happening in the market as it goes from hype to wisdom, it's saying private clouds have a real role where data security and privacy and performance of high - hard- hitting databases, but then also the ability to use public cloud right along side for things that are highly variable matter.</p><p/><p>I'll give you a good example. Our customer in the UK, Domino's Pizza, every Tuesday night for the football they run an offer. And they used to have build out physical infrastructure every time they had a very high spike in volume, right? Now that they can use the cloud, they say, right, I'm concerned about data privacy for my consumer's credit cards. I'm going to run that in a private cloud. I'm going to connect that into a public cloud for burstability. Therefore I don't have to buy the peak. I can pay for the base of the business. I can rent the peak, pay for what I use and then turn it off. So that's a very good example of a mainstream market application of hybrid cloud.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Using pizzas as the - as the story. Nice to see you, Taylor. Thank you very much indeed for stopping by.</p><p/><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p/><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue has been generated by extracting value from this digital stockpile - from detailed patterns of consumer behaviour, individual forecasts and other insights. Likewise Apple locks us into its iOS software ecosystem and reaps the rewards in smartphone upgrades and app sales. Amazon's knowledge of our shopping habits is a central plank of its retail prowess.</p><p>Because the industry has grown up so fast, until quite recently these companies have emerged in a near regulatory vacuum, with few legal shackles over their collection and use of personal data under existing laws.</p><p>Meanwhile, their first mover advantage and the extraordinary grip they now have on our lives as we swipe our smartphones hundreds of times per day makes it very difficult for new challengers to emerge to compete with them.</p><p>But that whole landscape is starting to shift.</p><p>And if the Treasury takes Furman's advice seriously, the UK stands to become a trailblazer whose lead others may follow, amid mounting international criticism of the tech industry.</p><p>The Harvard professor's report, commissioned by the Treasury last August, clearly states that the current system is not working in the interests of either consumers, business or innovation.</p><p>As a remedy, he has proposed handing consumers greater control over their personal data, enabling them to switch far more easily between platforms - a measure that would empower new entrants and undermine incumbents. He has called for a formal market study by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into the digital advertising market - over which Facebook and Google exercise an iron grip and that he says lacks transparency.</p><p>And he has proposed new powers to force the largest companies to open up to smaller firms through providing access to key data sets.</p><p>Finally, he has called for new powers to stop digital mergers that could damage competition and innovation and for the creation of a new unit with fresh legal powers to administer the sector, plus a code of conduct. Taken together, this would represent a big Change to the market in which these companies operate and a model that other governments might look to follow.</p><p>The report is short on detail. How should we measure success? What would laws on data portability look like and how would they be policed? Of course, the Treasury may not accept his recommendations either - not least at a time when the Brexit process presents the mother of all distractions for civil servants.</p><p>Britain's political system remains so fragile too that Philip Hammond could easily be toppled from office within weeks. Who knows how his successor might choose to act instead? Nevertheless, the report - which also includes a proposal for the UK to engage internationally on these issues - represents an important milestone in Whitehall's evolving attitude towards the Big Tech companies, which has become increasingly critical.</p><p>Around the globe - from Brussels and Paris to Washington DC and beyond - there have been similar grumblings for a while now. On this side of the Atlantic, Europe's failure to build its own tech giants has emerged as a particular bone of contention in the EU, where Margrethe Vestager, Europe's competition commissioner, has emerged as arguably the US tech industry's most powerful foe.</p><p>It would be virtually impossible for a new player to match Google's overarching supremacy on the data it holds on us. Globally, the only companies that have managed to emerge as serious contenders to rival the Silicon Valley giants are in China, where challengers like Tencent and Alibaba have been assisted by Beijing's policy to cultivate domestic tech champions and push away the US web giants.</p><p>Either way, this is likely to be just the start as other governments closely scrutinise Furman's proposals to formulate their own policy response, while Silicon Valley limbers up to defend its corner. That's why this one is likely to run and run.</p><p>The only companies that have managed to emerge as serious contenders to rival Silicon Valley are in    China'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-147293374</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMJ-MR41-DYTY-C32B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Radio has proved to be one of the most popular features of the devices, ahead of asking questions or shopping.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A medium which arrived in 1922 with the BBC's first broadcast, read by \"Uncle\" Arthur Burrows from the Marconi studio in London, has suddenly been given new vitality by smart speaker technology, which is expected to be present in a majority of UK households by 2021. Canalys predicts a 47 per cent rise in smart speaker purchases this year.</p><p>Boosted by a string of presenters arriving from the BBC, including Chris Evans, Eddie Mair and Simon Mayo, commercial stations are attracting 36.1 million listeners each week, more than the 34.4 million audience of BBC Radio.</p><p>\"Smart speakers have gone from zero to hero for radio in the last 12 to 13 months,\" says Steve Parkinson, group managing director of National Radio at Bauer, owners of the Kiss, Magic and Absolute radio networks . \"Suddenly, people have learnt how to use their smart speaker and the radio industry has learnt how to create the right kind of skills - so that you get Bauer's KISS and not Kiss the rock band or Kiss radio in LA. You can ask what track you are listening to and about show times and presenters.\"</p><p>But the gift of smart speakers is also a potential threat. Amazon, which is selling its cheapest Echo Dot speaker for a giveaway \u00a329.99, has previously been pitiless in its disruption of the retail sector. Google and Apple are no less ruthless in pursuing advertising revenue and market share.</p><p>Already Bauer draws 40 per cent of its streamed audience from these new voice-activated devices. Other radio groups are enjoying similar uplifts. Digital radio manufacturers, meanwhile, are unable to produce their own speakers for under \u00a3150.</p><p>The fear is that, as smart speakers proliferate, UK radio becomes dependent on the tech giants. One day Silicon Valley companies might look to cash in by charging radio stations to use their platforms, and by doing direct deals with advertisers, weakening the radio sector's commercial relationships and sapping its income.</p><p>These are matters that the digital and creative industries minister, Margot James, must consider as part of the review she announced last week into the future of digital radio.</p><p>\"Until now, radio has held up very well,\" says Siobhan Kenny, the chief executive of Radiocentre, which represents the UK's commercial radio sector. \"It is produced in the UK, it serves UK audiences and we index very high on trust. That's something the Government should think about and make sure the tech giants can't just descend on the UK and own that audience.\"</p><p>A decade ago, commercial radio was in a chronic state. The emergence of smart speakers is not the only reason for its revival.</p><p>A relaxation of pre-internet regulations alongside major investment by big media groups (Global, Bauer and latterly News UK's Wireless Group) mean listeners now have far more choice; in most regions there are more than 70 stations to choose from, with over 100 in London.</p><p>In 2000 we had only three national stations outside the BBC: Classic FM, TalkSport and Virgin. Today there are 37. That choice is available on Radioplayer, the app created in partnership with the BBC and now exported to 10 countries and being marketed to the automotive industry as an in-car entertainment platform.</p><p>Global has a combined audience of 25.2 million and owns the UK's four largest commercial brands (Classic FM, Smooth, Capital and Heart). It also has LBC, which has Mair, James O'Brien and Nick Ferrari on its schedule and has grown its reach to a record 2.3 million.</p><p>Even rivals were impressed by Evans's achievement in pulling in an audience of over one million for his new breakfast show on Wireless Group's Virgin Radio, a digital-only station. Bauer this year poached the BBC's Mayo to launch its new classical music station, Scala.</p><p>Importantly, the newly national Capital (Global) and Kiss (Bauer) are showing the way in reaching the 10- to 18-year-old demographic that has become a priority for BBC Radio 1. These young people will decide the influence of big tech's smart speaker technology on the future of radio. But governments and regulators have a responsibility, too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IINDUK-INMLMMGLSTRY000031925442-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IINDUK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W52-72K1-JCS0-D01F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">379735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Print Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>i-Independent Print Ltd</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17013\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Meanwhile, the Internet has become a leading supplier of radio signals, providing far-flung audiences with new independent channels and digital transmission of a slew of existing stations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Locally, over-the-air broadcasting soon will begin undergoing enormous changes.</p><p>In underserved markets, low-power stations could be allowed to hunt with the big dogs. The FCC seems ready to grant licenses to new entities, if only to generate competition in an increasingly consolidated marketplace.</p><p>The biggest problem, established broadcasters say, is that the low-power signals could interfere with those of existing stations, and these entities would face less regulation. In cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, frequency spectrum already is almost filled to overflowing, so it isn't likely that many new stations could be added.</p><p>Just as in the television industry, however, the most revolutionary aspect of digital transmission comes in the expanded options available to stations and listeners.</p><p>There is some bad news here, however, in that consumers will have to buy a new set if they want to experience the full robustness of a digital AM and FM signal. Blessedly, it won't cost as much as an high-definition TV set, and the channel numbers will remain the same.</p><p>\"Existing receivers will work in the system, because, for a period of time, we will continue to broadcast in analog,\" said William J. Casey, director of marketing and sales for Lucent Digital Radio, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lucent Technologies. \"The stations want to do it because it increases fidelity for the consumer; there would be the ability to license or rent out that space on the sideband to data providers; and it is an opportunity to provide and enhance public service, such as emergency broadcasts.</p><p>\"For example, with the digital signal, if there's a tornado, a transmitter can send a signal out to a digital radio and literally wake it up. It turns the radio on at a high volume and issues a warning.\"</p><p>In early June, Lucent said it had successfully tested its In-Band On-Channel Digital Audio Broadcast system in live broadcasts with National Public Radio member station WBJB-FM in Lincroft, N.J.Lucent said there was no degradation of the host FM analog channel during the transmission of the digital FM signal over the same band.</p><p>Suren Pai, subsidiary president, said testing will continue in 1999 and the technology should be commercially available next year.</p><p>David Bickle, public relations manager for Lucent's New Ventures Group, said \"FM will have a near-CD-quality sound, and AM will sound like FM does today. At the same time, you'll have the ability to receive data over the digital signal.</p><p>\"A radio probably will have a video display, which could show the name of the artist, the name of the song, local traffic or weather.\"</p><p>Casey estimates that a digital car radio might cost $100 more than a comparable existing unit, depending on the extra services provided.</p><p>But as Ron Rodrigues, editor of Radio &amp; Records magazine, notes, we're not too far from seeing the day when wireless communications will allow car radios to browse the Internet for commercial-free or distant Web stations and receive data on a dashboard screen.</p><p>Listening to radio over the Internet, at home or at work, is a growing phenomenon.</p><p>\"It's been a big issue for the last year, especially after Arbitron came out with statistics showing that something like 16 percent to 27 percent of computer users are listening to audio on their computers and the Internet,\" said Rodrigues.</p><p>What's happening, says E. Van Cullens, president of Harris Corp., a leading supplier of products and systems for the broadcast market, is, \"You're seeing that long-awaited, much-touted, overhyped convergence of voice, data and video, and you're going to see bigger companies starting to straddle those markets, because you now have the technology to actually intermix these things. Everybody's going to end up in the same place, because a bit is a bit is a bit, and once you get it digital, it becomes a software game.\"</p><p>On the Internet, of course, radio can become a visual, interactive medium. It also can begin to stream data.</p><p>Besides music or talk programming, a station's Web site can offer an advertiser a direct sales path to listeners through computerized links to the company. Similarly, it can create new advertising inventory for its national and international clients, because a station can sell both local and distant spots.</p><p>\"I may be working on a spreadsheet at my office, and, on my Internet radio, I hear a commercial for Minute Rice, in which they're providing a recipe,\" said Michael Fisher, a sales representative for RadioWave.com Inc., a subsidiary of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola.</p><p>\"So I can maximize my screen and go to the company's Web site, pull up the recipe, print it and cook it tonight,\" he said. \"Or, I could order some clothes for my kids from the Spiegel catalog, or get an online quote from an insurance company.\"</p><p>(from box)</p><p>Radio going digital:</p><p>As the consumer electronics industry adapts to the digital age, the Federal Communications Commission is deciding whether radio also should make the jump from analog to digital. Digital technology would allow radio stations to attract more listeners and advertisers with CD-quality, interference-free sound. If radio makes the change, however, stations and consumers would have to buy new equipment in order to transmit or listen to radio.</p><p>How analog and digital radiio signals are transmitted</p><p>ANALOG</p><p>1. Transmitter: Can transmit only one stataion.</p><p>2. Signal*: Travels as invisible waves through the air. These sound waves are produced by an electric current that rapidly reverses its direction of flow. Variances in the waves' amplitude (height) and frequency create specific sounds.</p><p>3. Receiver: Unable to differentiate the useful information from the useless noise, reproduces the entirety of the signal it is tuned to, including static and multipath echoes.</p><p>DIGITAL</p><p>1. Transmitter: Can transmit up to six stations at once. Uses less power to transmit than analog FM and AM signals.</p><p>2. Signal*: Sound waves can be processed as a series of digits. Each number gives the height of the sound wave at a particular instant. These numbers are then transformed into a digital signal consisting of 1s and 0s. Each combination of 1s and 0s represents the height ot the original sound wave.</p><p>3. Receiver: Produces CD-quality sound without static.</p><p>Uses a tiny computer that sorts through multipath echoes and reconstructing an interference-free signal.</p><p>Capable of monitoring signal strengths and of using this information to switch automatically from a fading signal to a new, more powerful one.</p><p>Capable of automatically finding stations carrying programming of a specific type.</p><p>Can display song titles, artist and album names and lyrics, traffic and weather information, paging services, and text services, such as stock quotations and advertising.</p><p>Can receive pay radio services such as pay-per-listen live concerts.</p><p>Lists stations sequentially by call letters or names to allow for easy tuning.</p><p>*Multipat echoes</p><p>Caused when the signal bounces off building, trees and hills. The reflected sound, often distorted, then arrives at the radio receiver a split-second after the main signal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Michael Fisher, sales representative for RadioWave.com Inc., sees a bright future for advertising on Internet radio broadcasts.

From stone cave to urban dwelling, the theme is unremitting; kept in the imagination, such creatures perform, innocently enough, benign functions. The catch here is the human tendency to realise such creatures. They take the form of social engineering and utopia. Folly bound, such projects and ventures wind up corrupting and degrading. The monster is born, and the awful truth comes to the fore: the concentration camp, the surveillance state, newspeak, the armies of censorship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The technology giants of the current era are the modern utopians, indulging human hunger and interests by shaping them. One company gives us the archetype. It is Google, which has the unusual distinction of being both noun and verb, entity and action. Google's power is disproportionately vast, a creepy sprawl that cherishes transparency while lacking it, and treasuring information while regulating its reach. It is also an entity that has gone beyond being a mere repository of searches and data, an attempt to induce behavioural change on the part of users.</p><p>Google always gives the impression that its users are in the lead, autonomous, independent in a verdant land of digital frolicking. The idea that the company itself fosters such change, teasing out alterations in behaviour, is placed to one side. There are no Svengalis in Googleland, because we are all free. Free, but needing assistance amidst chaos and \"multitasking\".</p><p>People have what the company calls \"micro-moments\", those, as behavioural economist Dan Ariely describes as \"on-the-go mobile moments\" where decisions are reached by a user while engaged, simultaneously, in a range of tasks: hotels to book, travel choices to make, work schedules to fulfil. While Ariely is writing more broadly from the perspective of the ubiquitous digital marketer, the language is pure Googleleese, smacking of part persuasion and part imposition. \"Want to develop a strategy to shape your consumer decisions?\" asks Google. \"Start by understanding the key micro-moments in their journey.\" Understand them; feed their mind; hold their hand.</p><p>The addiction to Google produces what can no longer be seen as retarding, but fostering. A generation is growing up without a hard copy research library, a ready-to-hand list of classics, and the means to search through records without resorting to those damnable digital keys. Debates are bound to be had (some already pollute the digital space) about whether this is necessarily a condition to lament. Embrace digital amnesia! To Google is to exist.</p><p>What is undeniable is that the means to find information \u2013 instantaneous, glut-filled, desperately quick \u2013 has created users who inhabit a space that guides their thinking, pre-empting, cajoling and adjusting. One form of literacy, we might kindly say, is being supplanted by another: the Google imbecile is upon us.</p><p>Given the nature of such effects, it is little wonder that politicians find Google threatening to their mouldy and rusted on craft. The politician's preserve is sound \u2013 or unsound \u2013 communication; success at the next election is dependent upon the idea that the electors understand, and approve, what has been relayed to them (whether that material is factual, or not, a lie or otherwise, is beside the point: the politician yearns to convince in order to win).</p><p>The old search engine titan supplies something of a snag in this regard. On the one hand, it offers the political classes the means to reach a global audience, an avenue to screech and promote the next hair-brained scheme that comes into the mind of the political apparat. But what if the message stymies on the way, finding delays in the means of what is called \"search engine optimisation\"? Is Google to blame, or bog standard ordinariness on the part of the politician?</p><p>US politicians think they have an answer. Only they are permitted control of the narrative, and disseminating the lie. Of late they have been trying to sketch out a path they are not used to: regulating industries once hailed as sentinels of freedom, promoters of liberty. Their complaints tend to lack consistency. On the one hand, they find various Google algorithms problematic (preference for alt-right sites, conspiratorial gruel as damaging), but their slant is wonky and skewed. Had these algorithms been driving favourable search terms (conformist, steady, unquestioning, anti-Trump), the matter would be a non-starter. Our message, they would say, is getting out there.</p><p>This week, the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation tried to make sense, in rather accusing fashion, of \"persuasive technology\". Nanette Byrnes furnishes us with a definition: \"the idea that computers, mobile phones, websites, and other technologies could be designed to influence people's behaviour and even attitudes\". The Pope does remain resolutely Catholic.</p><p>The committee hearing featured such opinions as those of Senator John Thune (R-SD), who wished to use the proceedings to draft legislation that would \"require internet platforms to give consumers the option to engage with the platform without having the experience shaped by algorithms.\" The Senator is happy to accept that artificial intelligence \"powers automations to display content to optimize engagement\" but sees a devil in the works, as \"AI algorithms can have an unintended and possibly even dangerous downside\". This is tantamount to wanting a Formula One Grand Prix without fast cars and an athletics competition in slow motion.</p><p>Facing the senators from Google's side was Maggie Stanphill, director of Google User Experience. Her testimony was couched in words more akin to the glossiness of a travel brochure with a complimentary sprinkling of cocaine. \"Google's Digital Wellbeing Initiative is a top company goal, focusing on providing our users with insights about their digital habits and tools to support an intentional relationship with technology.\" Google merely \"creates products that improve the lives of the people who use them.\" The company has provided access that has \"democratized information and provided services for billions of people around the world.\" When asked about whether Google was doing its bit in the persuasion business, Stanphill was unequivocal. \"We do not use persuasive technology.\"</p><p>The session's theme was clear: oodles and masses of content are good, but must be appropriate. In Information Utopia, where digital Adam and Eve still run naked, wickedness will not be allowed. If people want to seek content that is \"negative\" (this horrendous arbitrary nature keeps appearing), they should not be allowed do. Gag them, and make sure the popular terms sought are white washed of any offensive or dangerous import. Impose upon the tech titans a responsibility to control the negative.</p><p>Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) complained of those companies \"letting these algorithms run wild [\u2026] leaving humans to clean up the mess. Algorithms are amoral.\" Tristan Harris, co-founder and executive director of the Centre for Humane Technology, spoke of the competition between companies to use algorithms which \"more accurately predict what will keep users there the longest.\" If you want to maximise the time spent searching terms or, in the case of YouTube, watching a video, focus \"the entire ant colony of humanity towards crazytown.\" For Harris, \"technology hacks human weaknesses.\" The moral? Do not give people what they want.</p><p>The rage against the algorithm, and the belief that no behavioural pushing is taking place in search technology, is misplaced on a few fronts. On a certain level, all accept how such modes of retrieving information work. Disagreement arises as to their consequences, a concession, effectively, to the Google user as imbecile. Stanphill is being disingenuous for assuming that persuasive technology is not a function of Google's work (it patently is, given the company's intention of improving the \"intentional relationship with technology\").  In her testimony, she spoke of building \"products with privacy, transparency and control for the users, and we build a lifelong relationship with the user, which is primary.\" The Senators, in turn, are concerned that the users, diapered by encouragements in their search interests, are incapable of making their own fragile minds up.</p><p>The nature of managed information in the digital experience is not, as Google, YouTube and like companies show, a case of broadening knowledge but reaffirming existing assumptions. The echo chamber bristles with confirmations not challenges, with the comforts of prejudice rather than the discomforts of heavy-artillery learning. But the elected citizens on the Hill, and the cyber utopians, continue to struggle and flounder in the digital jungle they had seen as an information utopia equal to all. For the Big Tech giants, it's all rather simple: the attention grabbing spectacle, bums on seats, and downloads galore.</p><p>Dr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

From stone cave to urban dwelling, the theme is unremitting; kept in the imagination, such creatures perform, innocently enough, benign functions. The catch here is the human tendency to realise such creatures. </p><p>They take the form of social engineering and utopia. Folly bound, such projects and ventures wind up corrupting and degrading. The monster is born, and the awful truth comes to the fore: the concentration camp, the surveillance state, newspeak, the armies of censorship. The technology giants of the current era are the modern utopians, indulging human hunger and interests by shaping them. One company gives us the archetype. It is Google, which has the unusual distinction of being both noun and verb, entity and action. Google's power is disproportionately vast, a creepy sprawl that cherishes transparency while lacking it, and treasuring information while regulating its reach. It is also an entity that has gone beyond being a mere repository of searches and data, an attempt to induce behavioural change on the part of users. Google always gives the impression that its users are in the lead, autonomous, independent in a verdant land of digital frolicking. The idea that the company itself fosters such change, teasing out alterations in behaviour, is placed to one side. There are no Svengalis in Googleland, because we are all free. Free, but needing assistance amidst chaos and 'multitasking'. People have what the company calls[2] 'micro-moments', those, as behavioural economist Dan Ariely describes[3] as 'on-the-go mobile moments' where decisions are reached by a user while engaged, simultaneously, in a range of tasks: hotels to book, travel choices to make, work schedules to fulfil. While Ariely is writing more broadly from the perspective of the ubiquitous digital marketer, the language is pure Googleleese, smacking of part persuasion and part imposition. 'Want to develop a strategy to shape your consumer decisions?' asks Google[4]. 'Start by understanding the key micro-moments in their journey.' Understand them; feed their mind; hold their hand. The addiction to Google produces what can no longer be seen as retarding, but fostering. A generation is growing up without a hard copy research library, a ready-to-hand list of classics, and the means to search through records without resorting to those damnable digital keys. Debates are bound to be had (some already pollute the digital space) about whether this is necessarily a condition to lament. Embrace digital amnesia! To Google is to exist. What is undeniable is that the means to find information - instantaneous, glut-filled, desperately quick - has created users who inhabit a space that guides their thinking, pre-empting, cajoling and adjusting. One form of literacy, we might kindly say, is being supplanted by another: the Google imbecile is upon us. Given the nature of such effects, it is little wonder that politicians find Google threatening to their mouldy and rusted on craft. The politician's preserve is sound - or unsound - communication; success at the next election is dependent upon the idea that the electors understand, and approve, what has been relayed to them (whether that material is factual, or not, a lie or otherwise, is beside the point: the politician yearns to convince in order to win).

Had these algorithms been driving favourable search terms (conformist, steady, unquestioning, anti-Trump), the matter would be a non-starter. Our message, they would say, is getting out there. This week, the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation tried to make sense, in rather accusing fashion, of 'persuasive technology'. Nanette Byrnes furnishes[5] us with a definition: 'the idea that computers, mobile phones, websites, and other technologies could be designed to influence people's behaviour and even attitudes'. The Pope does remain resolutely Catholic. The committee hearing[6] featured such opinions as those of Senator John Thune (R-SD), who wished to use the proceedings to draft legislation that would 'require internet platforms to give consumers the option to engage with the platform without having the experience shaped by algorithms.' The Senator is happy to accept that artificial intelligence 'powers automations to display content to optimize engagement' but sees a devil in the works, as 'AI algorithms can have an unintended and possibly even dangerous downside'. This is tantamount to wanting a Formula One Grand Prix without fast cars and an athletics competition in slow motion. Facing the senators from Google's side was Maggie Stanphill, director of Google User Experience. Her testimony[7] was couched in words more akin to the glossiness of a travel brochure with a complimentary sprinkling of cocaine. 'Google's Digital Wellbeing Initiative is a top company goal, focusing on providing our users with insights about their digital habits and tools to support an intentional relationship with technology.' Google merely 'creates products that improve the lives of the people who use them.' The company has provided access that has 'democratized information and provided services for billions of people around the world.' When asked about whether Google was doing its bit in the persuasion business, Stanphill was unequivocal. 'We do not use persuasive technology.' The session's theme was clear: oodles and masses of content are good, but must be appropriate. In Information Utopia, where digital Adam and Eve still run naked, wickedness will not be allowed. If people want to seek content that is 'negative' (this horrendous arbitrary nature keeps appearing), they should not be allowed to. Gag them, and make sure the popular terms sought are white washed of any offensive or dangerous import. Impose upon the tech titans a responsibility to control the negative. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) complained of those companies 'letting these algorithms run wild [] leaving humans to clean up the mess. Algorithms are amoral.'

If you want to maximise the time spent searching terms or, in the case of YouTube, watching a video, focus 'the entire ant colony of humanity towards crazytown.' For Harris, 'technology hacks human weaknesses.' The moral? Do not give people what they want. The rage against the algorithm, and the belief that no behavioural pushing is taking place in search technology, is misplaced on a few fronts. On a certain level, all accept how such modes of retrieving information work. Disagreement arises as to their consequences, a concession, effectively, to the Google user as imbecile.

In her testimony, she spoke of building 'products with privacy, transparency and control for the users, and we build a lifelong relationship with the user, which is primary.' The Senators, in turn, are concerned that the users, diapered by encouragements in their search interests, are incapable of making their own fragile minds up. The nature of managed information in the digital experience is not, as Google, YouTube and like companies show, a case of broadening knowledge but reaffirming existing assumptions. The echo chamber bristles with confirmations not challenges, with the comforts of prejudice rather than the discomforts of heavy-artillery learning.

View original post here[2]. Authored by Binoy Kampmark via Oriental Review,[3]'The founder of Netscape said software is going to eat the world.' Tristan Harris,Centre for Humane Technology[4], June 25, 2019Monsters and titans share the stage of mythology across cultures as the necessary realisations of the human imagination. From stone cave to urban dwelling, the theme is unremitting; kept in the imagination, such creatures perform, innocently enough, benign functions. The catch here is the human tendency to realise such creatures. They take the form of social engineering and utopia. Folly bound, such projects and ventures wind up corrupting and degrading. The monster is born, and the awful truth comes to the fore: the concentration camp, the surveillance state, newspeak, the armies of censorship.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/google-collusion-dt-600.jpg?itok=L93zPRaf\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/google-collusion-dt-600.jpg?itok=L93zPRaf</url> source[5] The technology giants of the current era are the modern utopians, indulging human hunger and interests by shaping them. One company gives us the archetype. It is Google, which has the unusual distinction of being both noun and verb, entity and action. Google's power is disproportionately vast, a creepy sprawl that cherishes transparency while lacking it, and treasuring information while regulating its reach. It is also an entity that has gone beyond being a mere repository of searches and data, an attempt to induce behavioural change on the part of users. Google always gives the impression that its users are in the lead, autonomous, independent in a verdant land of digital frolicking. The idea that the company itself fosters such change, teasing out alterations in behaviour, is placed to one side. There are no Svengalis in Googleland, because we are all free. Free, but needing assistance amidst chaos and 'multitasking'. People have what thecompany calls[6]'micro-moments', those, as behavioural economist Dan Arielydescribes[7]as 'on-the-go mobile moments' where decisions are reached by a user while engaged, simultaneously, in a range of tasks: hotels to book, travel choices to make, work schedules to fulfil. While Ariely is writing more broadly from the perspective of the ubiquitous digital marketer, the language is pure Googleleese, smacking of part persuasion and part imposition. 'Want to develop a strategy to shape your consumer decisions?'asks Google[8]. 'Start by understanding the key micro-moments in their journey.' Understand them; feed their mind; hold their hand.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Micro-moments.jpeg?itok=ISOSFyc_\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Micro-moments.jpeg?itok=ISOSFyc_</url> The addiction to Google produces what can no longer be seen as retarding, but fostering. A generation is growing up without a hard copy research library, a ready-to-hand list of classics, and the means to search through records without resorting to those damnable digital keys. Debates are bound to be had (some already pollute the digital space) about whether this is necessarily a condition to lament. Embrace digital amnesia! To Google is to exist. What is undeniable is that the means to find information - instantaneous, glut-filled, desperately quick - has created users who inhabit a space that guides their thinking, pre-empting, cajoling and adjusting. One form of literacy, we might kindly say, is being supplanted by another: the Google imbecile is upon us. Given the nature of such effects, it is little wonder that politicians find Google threatening to their mouldy and rusted on craft. The politician's preserve is sound - or unsound - communication; success at the next election is dependent upon the idea that the electors understand, and approve, what has been relayed to them (whether that material is factual, or not, a lie or otherwise, is beside the point: the politician yearns to convince in order to win). The old search engine titan supplies something of a snag in this regard. On the one hand, it offers the political classes the means to reach a global audience, an avenue to screech and promote the next hair-brained scheme that comes into the mind of the political apparat. But what if the message stymies on the way, finding delays in the means of what is called 'search engine optimisation'? Is Google to blame, or bog standard ordinariness on the part of the politician? US politicians think they have an answer. Only they are permitted control of the narrative, and disseminating the lie. Of late they have been trying to sketch out a path they are not used to: regulating industries once hailed as sentinels of freedom, promoters of liberty. Their complaints tend to lack consistency. On the one hand, they find various Google algorithms problematic (preference for alt-right sites, conspiratorial gruel as damaging), but their slant is wonky and skewed. Had these algorithms been driving favourable search terms (conformist, steady, unquestioning, anti-Trump), the matter would be a non-starter. Our message, they would say, is getting out there. This week, the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation tried to make sense, in rather accusing fashion, of 'persuasive technology'. Nanette Byrnesfurnishes[9]us with a definition: 'the idea that computers, mobile phones, websites, and other technologies could be designed to influence people's behaviour and even attitudes'. The Pope does remain resolutely Catholic.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Persuasive-technology.jpg?itok=W2Y7wpVo\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Persuasive-technology.jpg?itok=W2Y7wpVo</url> Thecommittee hearing[10]featured such opinions as those of Senator John Thune (R-SD), who wished to use the proceedings to draft legislation that would 'require internet platforms to give consumers the option to engage with the platform without having the experience shaped by algorithms.' The Senator is happy to accept that artificial intelligence 'powers automations to display content to optimize engagement' but sees a devil in the works, as 'AI algorithms can have an unintended and possibly even dangerous downside'. This is tantamount to wanting a Formula One Grand Prix without fast cars and an athletics competition in slow motion. Facing the senators from Google's side was Maggie Stanphill, director of Google User Experience. Hertestimony[11]was couched in words more akin to the glossiness of a travel brochure with a complimentary sprinkling of cocaine. 'Google's Digital Wellbeing Initiative is a top company goal, focusing on providing our users with insights about their digital habits and tools to support an intentional relationship with technology.' Google merely 'creates products that improve the lives of the people who use them.' The company has provided access that has 'democratized information and provided services for billions of people around the world.' When asked about whether Google was doing its bit in the persuasion business, Stanphill was unequivocal. 'We do not use persuasive technology.' The session's theme was clear: oodles and masses of content are good, but must be appropriate. In Information Utopia, where digital Adam and Eve still run naked, wickedness will not be allowed. If people want to seek content that is 'negative' (this horrendous arbitrary nature keeps appearing), they should not be allowed do. Gag them, and make sure the popular terms sought are white washed of any offensive or dangerous import. Impose upon the tech titans a responsibility to control the negative. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) complained of those companies 'letting these algorithms run wild [] leaving humans to clean up the mess. Algorithms are amoral.' Tristan Harris, co-founder and executive director of the Centre for Humane Technology,spoke[12]of the competition between companies to use algorithms which 'more accurately predict what will keep users there the longest.' If you want to maximise the time spent searching terms or, in the case of YouTube, watching a video, focus 'the entire ant colony of humanity towards crazytown.' For Harris, 'technology hacks human weaknesses.' The moral? Do not give people what they want. The rage against the algorithm, and the belief that no behavioural pushing is taking place in search technology, is misplaced on a few fronts. On a certain level, all accept how such modes of retrieving information work. Disagreement arises as to their consequences, a concession, effectively, to the Google user as imbecile. Stanphill is being disingenuous for assuming that persuasive technology is not a function of Google's work (it patently is, given the company's intention of improving the 'intentional relationship with technology'). In her testimony, she spoke of building 'products with privacy, transparency and control for the users, and we build a lifelong relationship with the user, which is primary.' The Senators, in turn, are concerned that the users, diapered by encouragements in their search interests, are incapable of making their own fragile minds up. The nature of managed information in the digital experience is not, as Google, YouTube and like companies show, a case of broadening knowledge but reaffirming existing assumptions. The echo chamber bristles with confirmations not challenges, with the comforts of prejudice rather than the discomforts of heavy-artillery learning. But the elected citizens on the Hill, and the cyber utopians, continue to struggle and flounder in the digital jungle they had seen as an information utopia equal to all. For the Big Tech giants, it's all rather simple: the attention grabbing spectacle, bums on seats, and downloads galore.

From stone cave to urban dwelling, the theme is unremitting; kept in the imagination, such creatures perform, innocently enough, benign functions.  The catch here is the human tendency to realise such creatures.  They take the form of social engineering and utopia.  Folly bound, such projects and ventures wind up corrupting and degrading.  The monster is born, and the awful truth comes to the fore: the concentration camp, the surveillance state, newspeak, the armies of censorship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The technology giants of the current era are the modern utopians, indulging human hunger and interests by shaping them.  One company gives us the archetype. It is Google, which has the unusual distinction of being both noun and verb, entity and action.  Google's power is disproportionately vast, a creepy sprawl that cherishes transparency while lacking it, and treasuring information while regulating its reach.  It is also an entity that has gone beyond being a mere repository of searches and data, an attempt to induce behavioural change on the part of users.</p><p>Google always gives the impression that its users are in the lead, autonomous, independent in a verdant land of digital frolicking.  The idea that the company itself fosters such change, teasing out alterations in behaviour, is placed to one side.  There are no Svengalis in Googleland, because we are all free. Free, but needing assistance amidst chaos and \"multitasking\".</p><p>People have what the company calls \"micro-moments\", those, as behavioural economist Dan Ariely describes as \"on-the-go mobile moments\" where decisions are reached by a user while engaged, simultaneously, in a range of tasks: hotels to book, travel choices to make, work schedules to fulfil.  While Ariely is writing more broadly from the perspective of the ubiquitous digital marketer, the language is pure Googleleese, smacking of part persuasion and part imposition.  \"Want to develop a strategy to shape your consumer decisions?\" asks Google.  \"Start by understanding the key micro-moments in their journey.\"  Understand them; feed their mind; hold their hand.</p><p>The addiction to Google produces what can no longer be seen as retarding, but fostering.  A generation is growing up without a hard copy research library, a ready-to-hand list of classics, and the means to search through records without resorting to those damnable digital keys.  Debates are bound to be had (some already pollute the digital space) about whether this is necessarily a condition to lament.  Embrace digital amnesia! To Google is to exist.</p><p>What is undeniable is that the means to find information - instantaneous, glut-filled, desperately quick - has created users who inhabit a space that guides their thinking, pre-empting, cajoling and adjusting.  One form of literacy, we might kindly say, is being supplanted by another: the Google imbecile is upon us.</p><p>Given the nature of such effects, it is little wonder that politicians find Google threatening to their mouldy and rusted on craft.  The politician's preserve is sound - or unsound - communication; success at the next election is dependent upon the idea that the electors understand, and approve, what has been relayed to them (whether that material is factual, or not, a lie or otherwise, is beside the point: the politician yearns to convince in order to win).</p><p>The old search engine titan supplies something of a snag in this regard.  On the one hand, it offers the political classes the means to reach a global audience, an avenue to screech and promote the next hair-brained scheme that comes into the mind of the political apparat.  But what if the message stymies on the way, finding delays in the means of what is called \"search engine optimisation\"?  Is Google to blame, or bog standard ordinariness on the part of the politician?</p><p>US politicians think they have an answer.  Only they are permitted control of the narrative, and disseminating the lie.  Of late they have been trying to sketch out a path they are not used to: regulating industries once hailed as sentinels of freedom, promoters of liberty.  Their complaints tend to lack consistency. On the one hand, they find various Google algorithms problematic (preference for alt-right sites, conspiratorial gruel as damaging), but their slant is wonky and skewed.  Had these algorithms been driving favourable search terms (conformist, steady, unquestioning, anti-Trump), the matter would be a non-starter.  Our message, they would say, is getting out there.</p><p>This week, the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation tried to make sense, in rather accusing fashion, of \"persuasive technology\".  Nanette Byrnes furnishes us with a definition: \"the idea that computers, mobile phones, websites, and other technologies could be designed to influence people's behaviour and even attitudes\".  The Pope does remain resolutely Catholic.</p><p>The committee hearing featured such opinions as those of Senator John Thune (R-SD), who wished to use the proceedings to draft legislation that would \"require internet platforms to give consumers the option to engage with the platform without having the experience shaped by algorithms.\"  The Senator is happy to accept that artificial intelligence \"powers automations to display content to optimize engagement\" but sees a devil in the works, as \"AI algorithms can have an unintended and possibly even dangerous downside\".  This is tantamount to wanting a Formula One Grand Prix without fast cars and an athletics competition in slow motion.</p><p>Facing the senators from Google's side was Maggie Stanphill, director of Google User Experience.  Her testimony was couched in words more akin to the glossiness of a travel brochure with a complimentary sprinkling of cocaine.  \"Google's Digital Wellbeing Initiative is a top company goal, focusing on providing our users with insights about their digital habits and tools to support an intentional relationship with technology.\"  Google merely \"creates products that improve the lives of the people who use them.\"  The company has provided access that has \"democratized information and provided services for billions of people around the world.\"  When asked about whether Google was doing its bit in the persuasion business, Stanphill was unequivocal.  \"We do not use persuasive technology.\"</p><p>The session's theme was clear: oodles and masses of content are good, but must be appropriate.  In Information Utopia, where digital Adam and Eve still run naked, wickedness will not be allowed.  If people want to seek content that is \"negative\" (this horrendous arbitrary nature keeps appearing), they should not be allowed do.  Gag them, and make sure the popular terms sought are white washed of any offensive or dangerous import.  Impose upon the tech titans a responsibility to control the negative.</p><p>Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) complained of those companies \"letting these algorithms run wild [\u2026] leaving humans to clean up the mess.  Algorithms are amoral.\" Tristan Harris, co-founder and executive director of the Centre for Humane Technology, spoke of the competition between companies to use algorithms which \"more accurately predict what will keep users there the longest.\"  If you want to maximise the time spent searching terms or, in the case of YouTube, watching a video, focus \"the entire ant colony of humanity towards crazytown.\"  For Harris, \"technology hacks human weaknesses.\"  The moral?  Do not give people what they want.</p><p>The rage against the algorithm, and the belief that no behavioural pushing is taking place in search technology, is misplaced on a few fronts.  On a certain level, all accept how such modes of retrieving information work.  Disagreement arises as to their consequences, a concession, effectively, to the Google user as imbecile.  Stanphill is being disingenuous for assuming that persuasive technology is not a function of Google's work (it patently is, given the company's intention of improving the \"intentional relationship with technology\").<br/><br/>In her testimony, she spoke of building \"products with privacy, transparency and control for the users, and we build a lifelong relationship with the user, which is primary.\"  The Senators, in turn, are concerned that the users, diapered by encouragements in their search interests, are incapable of making their own fragile minds up.</p><p>The nature of managed information in the digital experience is not, as Google, YouTube and like companies show, a case of broadening knowledge but reaffirming existing assumptions.  The echo chamber bristles with confirmations not challenges, with the comforts of prejudice rather than the discomforts of heavy-artillery learning. But the elected citizens on the Hill, and the cyber utopians, continue to struggle and flounder in the digital jungle they had seen as an information utopia equal to all.  For the Big Tech giants, it's all rather simple: the attention grabbing spectacle, bums on seats, and downloads galore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-148052020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFV-F9K1-JDJN-615B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 30, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096SB</classCode><className>CONSUMER BEHAVIOR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000271</classCode><className>CENSORSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009RQS</classCode><className>INTERACTIVE MARKETING &amp; ADVERTISING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N518112MM</classCode><className>WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000962</classCode><className>WEBSITES &amp; PORTALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000580</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096SB</classCode><className>CONSUMER BEHAVIOR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001536</classCode><className>SEARCH ENGINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009RQS</classCode><className>INTERACTIVE MARKETING &amp; ADVERTISING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000CVM2</classCode><className>BEHAVIORAL FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Welcome to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. We have an immediate news alert. At this hour, Hurricane Florence is lashing the Carolinas. Hurricane force winds already being felt and are expected to worsen through the night. We have Fox News coverage all along the coast. But we begin tonight in North Topsail Beach, North Carolina where Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan is really feeling the storm. Steve?</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Laura, I've seen this bridge over the past few hours behind me just gradually disappear as the water comes up. If we do get an 11-foot storm surge as somehow predicted on parts of the coast, that water would go over this (inaudible) and go up the first floor mostly (inaudible). It is dark all along this island. People really heeded the call to get out.</p><p>They have boarded up their houses with plywood and most of them left, either going far inland or north or south, trying to get away from this giant storm. The power is out here. We just lost electricity a few hours ago. Those are the camera lights on me now running on batteries. As many as three million people could lose power before this is over.</p><p>Right now, the winds have picked up considerably over the last hour or two. We are seeing tropical storm force winds, but really, strong enough to try and cause some damage. We are hearing things snap and crack and move. It's hard with pitch darkness to see exactly what is being moved but the house to my left has lost some bits off its roof and some small branches as well.</p><p>Because the wind is so severe, they've shut down the bridge that leads from this island back to the mainland. So, if you are someone who has decided to stay here, you are going to be here to have to ride it out. As far as rescues go, there are a lot of assets in place, they are swift boat teams from 19 different states. That is something we see over and over again in these massive storms.</p><p>The real contribution from all across the U.S. not only officially, but people with their own boats, who I'm sure we are going to see in the days ahead carrying out water rescues because that is the long-term danger. The wind is going to be dramatic. It's going to get worse here over the next couple of hours.</p><p>We are probably going to see 100 mile an hour sustained winds here but it is that rain that is going to cause inland flooding, that is going to be the real slower slob (ph) and the real danger for a lot of people across the state. Laura, back to you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right Steve, we are watching you and everyone in the studio here is watching this with me. We are actually afraid for you. I mean, that deck that you are on or the steps, that is not going to be there in an hour or two. That is gone. I'm sorry.</p><p>I think you got to -- I know you want to report but you got to get off that -- you got to get off the wooden walkway. That ain't going to be there for much longer. I know that beach very well by the way, and that is brutal.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Yes. Well we've been kind of moving back a little bit along the way each way so, we're trying to keep moving back where we feel the need to, but we are trying to show you the drama of what is going on here at the same time.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The drama, but we like you more. So Steve, please stay safe. We'll check back with you later on in the hour. That is unbelievable. For any of you who have been down in the outer banks or near North Topsail, that is an incredible sight. We're going to have live reports of course from the ground, from the coast, throughout the hour. We also expect authorities to brief us on the latest so do not go anywhere. You want not miss the latest on this monster storm.</p><p>And we do want to get to some other important stories tonight, like the ugly smearing of Brett Kavanaugh and she should be ashamed of herself. Senator Dianne Feinstein -- I actually have a lot of respect for her. We don't agree on everything. I have a lot of respect for her as a woman and being out there in the Senate. But what she did today, we are going to tell you about this. We have breaking news on what this might do or not do to the Kavanaugh confirmation. So stay right there.</p><p>Plus, we break down the media treatment of Michelle Obama versus Melania Trump. And this as Michelle Obama gets ready for her big stadium-sized book to her. You're going to want to stop by for that and not turn the dial for that, but it's another unbelievable story of bias. But first, global titans versus the American people. That is the focus of tonight's ANGLE.</p><p>Immediately following the election, Google executives gathered to share their feelings of dejection and despair. A video recently leaked to Breitbart reveals the mind-set of Google's leadership from within their corporate safe space. This is co-founder Sergey Brin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEY BRIN, CO-FOUNDER, GOOGLE: You know, let's face it, most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad because of the election. Anyway, on a more serious note, you know, myself, as an immigrant and a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive and I know many of you do, too. And I think it's a very stressful time and it conflicts with many of our values.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Values? What are those Google values? After all this is a company that has actively worked with the Chinese communist regime for years. And right now, Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens. Translation, Google is helping China silence its political opposition. The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily.</p><p>They have more than a million Muslims in re-education camps, but the legitimate election of President Trump, somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values? Give me a break. Today we learned that a senior Google research scientist named Jack Paulson was so disgusted by the company's collaboration with Chinese sensors that he has quit in protest.</p><p>And I was thinking about this, you want to know the real reason that the Google execs were so exercised, so hurt by the election of Trump? Because he promised to hold Google's partner, China, accountable. To punish Chinese cheating on trade deals that hollowed out U.S. manufacturing. For Google and many other big manufacturers, the pre-Trump status quo was much easier.</p><p>Keep that production overseas, lower wages, no regulation, no health care that you have to worry about for those employees over in China. And if it hurts America, so be it. After all, those blue-collar Americans will probably be Trump voters anyway. And of course, Google, they hate you deplorables.</p><p>(BEGI VIDEO CLIP) KENT WALKER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, GOOGLE GLOBAL AFFAIRS: That fear, I think, not just in the United States, but around the world, is what is fueling concerns of xenophobia, hatred, and a desire for answers that may or may not be there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Actually, Trump's found -- the answer are pretty easy. Two words, America first. Sure, Trump will work with the rest of the world. He's shown that, but on a much more level playing field. So why is Google so threatened by that? I'll tell you why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALKER: History teaches us that there are periods of populism, of nationalism that rise up and that is all the reason we need to be in the arena, that is why we have to work so hard to make sure it doesn't turn into a world war or something catastrophic, but instead, is a blip, as a hick up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, you stop a world war with your search engine. That's ridiculous. Like a liberal elites that crossed politics, academia, and the entertainment industry, big tech doesn't really like the American voters who turned out for Trump. That is pretty obvious. Google thinks it knows better than their customers, after all, Google execs are richer than they are.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUTH PORAT, GOOGLE CFO: People are leaving, staff is crying, we are going to lose. That was the first moment I really felt like we were going to lose. Everybody, if you could turn around or go to the person next to you, and do a hug at work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's worse than a sign of peace at mass. Sorry, I'm not a sign of peace person. [laughs] Hug, group hug. Trump won. Oh, my gosh. I needed comic relief today. That made me laugh more than anything else. But then huggy bear Ruth got down to business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PORAT: Our values our strong, we will fight to protect them, and we will use the great strength and resources in which we have to continue to advance really important values.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Again, the word values. What values is Google talking about? Well, the left-wing globalist values that have helped enrich the oppressive Chinese regime at the expense of free expression and religious liberty, and of course, made Google execs really rich.</p><p>Part of Google's disappointment was that their efforts in 2016 failed really spectacularly. Of course they claim that they are nonpartisan. But an e-mail leaked to my colleague Tucker Carlson show that the tech giant tried to turn out the Latino vote in 2016 because they were confident Latino voters would support Hillary.</p><p>But can you imagine their surprise when they wake up on election morning after -- morning after election they see 29 percent of Latinos voting for Trump? They were gobsmacked. Google is not some local business practicing civic engagement, we should all stand up and cheer, oh, Google, go. Google is one of the most powerful companies on the planet.</p><p>They are responsible for about 90 percent of all searches online, they are more than 1.2 trillion searches on Google each year, globally. More than 2 billion people use its android mobile platform. And they've made $110.8 billion in revenue last year alone.</p><p>But when smaller companies, smaller companies like Chick-fil-A or Hobby Lobby or In-n-Out burger, when they move in the smallest of ways to support more traditional or even conservative causes, those companies are sued and vilified nonstop by the mainstream media.</p><p>When I giant like Google pledges to actively undermine the political will of the American people, the media don't cover it. And you know why? Because the media agree with the Google agenda. This is one of my favorite moments from the Google anti-Trump corporate rally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIN: Last question, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there anything positive you see from this election result?</p><p>BRIN: Boy, that's a really tough one right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's actually not so tough. I love those beanies, by the way. I want one. I will get one for my kids. That's a tough one. Anything good that comes out of Trump`s election. Well, how is this to try on for size. The economy is booming. Fair trade deals are being negotiated, wages are rising and blue-collar America is more optimistic about the future that t hey have been for decades.</p><p>These Google execs should have to do public acts of penance for their petty, idiotic statements. Here's the bottom line. The Google gang and the rest of big tech were happier when America was losing to China. They didn't care that blue-collar America got poorer and communist China got richer and stronger. So long as Google got richer in the process.</p><p>But today, President Trump is turning the tables on that sick dynamic. His policies are working. Google is still rich, of course. But the globalists, even though the economy is going well, the globalists are still grumpy. That tells you all you need to know. And that's the \"Angle.\"</p><p>Joining us now the reaction is CRTV host Michelle Malkin along with China Okasi, a tech and cyber security expert who is author of the forthcoming book, \"What the Tech Is Going on in Politics.\" It's great to see both of you. China, let's start with you. The Google tape that came out last couple of days, Breitbart has it exclusively, shows a corporate culture that is overwhelmingly in the tank in 2016 for Hillary.</p><p>They are dejected and despondent and they look like they are set at that point to exert their influence in the tech world to change that dynamic of Trump as president. Does this look like a diverse company to you?</p><p>CHINA OKASI, TECH AND CYBER SECURITY EXPERT: Well, I think that the entire thrust of technology in the tech world is actually diversity. When you consider that almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants, you would understand the spirit of support that these companies--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Legal immigrants, right? Yes, legal immigrants.</p><p>OKASI: Yes. Legal immigrants.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We are not against the legal immigrants.</p><p>OKASI: But I will have to say this, OK, 80 percent of graduate students in the United States, in the fields of computer science and electrical engineering are international students, and in order for those students to stay, they need to operate on H-1B visas, OK. And so they are not necessarily going to take the track of permanent residency because that takes many years.</p><p>These companies in many, many ways, have been supported and propped up by people who don't have that linear a path to immigration. So it is really not a black and white issue. And I don't think they see it as --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why are they so dejected by Trump winning? Trump was going to do one thing, and Michelle I want you to chime in. The number one thing I think they are really annoyed by is Trump taking on China. I think the immigration thing -- yes, they are worried about that, but Trump taking on China is something Obama in his own way promised to do, Bush promised to do, no one did it.</p><p>Trump did it and is leveling the playing field. That means some of these Google execs might not make as much money in the end but they are still multibillionaires but more Americans might get a slightly higher wages. Michelle?</p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, CRTV HOST: Yes. You've got the bottom line, Laura. And I'll get to China's comments about H-1B in a second. But let me just say this, I want to give a huge salute and shout out to the reporters, the tech reporters at Breitbart. I think this is a blockbuster report. It is both revelatory and confirmatory, for those of us who followed Google's capitulation to China, that goes back 12 years.</p><p>Where they have thrown their own old corporate logo, \"don't be evil\" under the bus by agreeing to all sorts of censorship regulations, when they always stand so sanctimoniously as a holier than thou company that embraces progressive values. It is a gift that we now get to see that hypocrisy on display.</p><p>And I think you are absolutely right, Laura, that these kinds of companies, in Silicon Valley, do not have America's interests at heart. So let's talk about diversity. You know, I did a report for CRTV in \"Michelle Malkin Investigates\" on the diverse American workforce.</p><p>Tech workers, black, white, Asian-Americans, who were fired and forced to train their inferior H-1B replacement because Google and their like are more interested in suppressing the wages of American workers than they are in supporting the diversity as an American I.T. workforce.</p><p>More hypocrisy from big tech and it is a cult. You look at them all seeing the praises of diversity when you have got conservative Googlers within the company that are too afraid to talk about their values and their support for our president.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Someone leaked this out obviously, China. Someone's concerned inside the company. Paulson, resigns in the last week or two. You had Tristan Harris, the former global employee, February 7th, 2018, let's watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRISTAN HARRIS, I actually genuinely view this as an existential threat. When you shape people's attention, you're shaping their thoughts and thoughts proceed actions. So you are really shaping society, you are shaping culture, you are shaping whether people have the relationships they would have intended to have, whether they sleep or not. You're shaping elections. There is an entire set of consequences when you shape people's attention through design.</p><p>INGRAHAM: China, your reaction?</p><p>OKASI: You know, I think it is just such a monolithic view to think that all big tech companies have the same opinion. When you look at the spirit of what they are doing, it is not about being for or against the Trump administration. It is about policy. You look at the International Entrepreneurship Rule that were set about by the Obama administration, and yet has not seen implementation.</p><p>It has been pushed back over and over again. Such things as the International Entrepreneurship Rule encourage those intellectual resources that we need to run these companies, all of these companies, Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, all have founders in them that are immigrant and that purport these views around diversity.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But that's fine. No, no, no. I think that's great. China, I don't think there is any problem with that. I think Michelle -- you come here illegally, Sergey Brin and his parents fled the Soviet Union. I think it's ironic that they flee the Soviet Union, his father is a mathematician a University of Maryland. His mother works were Goddard. They are both brilliant. He's brilliant.</p><p>They flee the oppressive Soviet Union only for him to turn around and help the Chinese communists develop an app to screen out offensive content. How does that make any sense? How are those the values that Google's stands up the day after the election and says, \"our values are offended by Donald Trump\" because they are helping the Chinese communist (inaudible) free expression? That's disgusting.</p><p>OKASI: -- inaccurate. I think --</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's not inaccurate. That's a fact. That is why one of the senior researcher's quit.</p><p>OKASI: -- in order to (inaudible)in any country you have to follow their rules and regulations. And I think by supplying their products, really, to the people of China, they are allowing China to be part of the global conversation, part of the --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Do you think that's what is happening? Oh, come on.</p><p>(CROSSTLK)</p><p>OKASI: -- then Google should not participate in that context? They should not be a part of it?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why are they doing this? Michelle, in closing, go ahead. Michelle, go ahead. I got 30 seconds. Michelle, real quick, 15.</p><p>MALKIN: No, no, no. Google is kowtowing to the communists and putting essentially internet duct tape around the mouths of dissenters who dare to criticize the communist government there. Also, by the way, read \"Sold Out\" the book that I wrote with John (inaudible) a former programmer, American computer programmer who defends American citizens who've been harmed by these H-1B policies.</p><p>Guess what, the American I.T. workforce is sick and tired of these globalist elites telling them that there aren't best and brightest workers when they are the one being fired and replaced with these wage slaves.</p><p>INGRAHAM: \"Fortune\" magazine research and China, I don't think (inaudible) -- OK. \"Fortune\" magazine research on this shows that for every 100 foreign computer scientist working in United States, between 33 and 61 domestic workers were replaced. The influx of foreign workers also held down wages with compensation being 2.6 percent to 5.1 percent lower if foreign workers were not allowed.</p><p>All right. Thanks for both of you for joining us, China and Michelle. And by the way, it's a disgusting Democratic smear, and the media are all too happy to run with it. Up next, we are going to explain how an 11th hour effort to derail Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court nomination tells you everything you need to know about today's left. Coming up.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The air around Capitol Hill has been thick with desperation today. Why? Well, from a pathetic last ditch effort by Democrats to scuttle Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Intrigue swirling after reports says Senator Dianne Feinstein ws sitting on potentially damning letter.</p><p>It said to be written by an unknown woman alleging sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh when he was 17 years-old. I kid you not. And tonight the \"Guardian\" reporting that the letter claims that Kavanaugh and a male friend walked this woman in a room against her will during a party making her feel uncomfortable.</p><p>The woman was later able to leave the room. We did that last week -- come on. Joining me now, Carrie Severino, the chief counsel and policy director at the Judicial Crisis Network. Carrie, I'm laughing at this. It's so pathetic on so many levels. What's going on here.</p><p>CARRIE SEVERINO, CHIEF COUNSEL, JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK: I think -- you know, we know very little about what this letter even -- is supposed to mean but we know a lot about the politics. I mean, if Senator Feinstein had this letter since July, why didn't she ask it -- if she really thought this was credible, why didn't she ask about it when she met with him during the hearings, during these questions for the record?</p><p>What's going on here is very clear. Senator Schumer said that we're going to do everything in our power to stop the nominee and that means character assassination, smears, is all fair game. I mean, look at what they are doing to Senator Collins.</p><p>She has got people going after her staff saying, I hope you get raped and impregnated. They want people to follow her around and spit in her food at restaurants. There is this GoFundMe campaign that she says is a bribe that might even violate federal election law.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right. This is a smear across the board, but with Kavanaugh --</p><p>SEVERINO: This is so crazy.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But with Brett, here he is 17 years old, is a Georgetown prep kid at Washington Catholic School, is 17 with a friend, locks some woman when in a room and then she was able to leave. That is what is being reported this night as a story. But if someone you don't know who heard it from someone else, who's at Stanford.</p><p>This is the most -- Diane Feinstein has actually had a pretty amazing career. She was elected in '92 (inaudible) as a woman, but this is -- is this really how she wants to end her senate career, this way? It's -- pathetic doesn't even describe it, though. It's an attempt at September surprise that goes down in utter flames. It's a complete and total embarrassment.</p><p>SEVERINO: Yes. She's getting push from the left, so even someone as far left as she is, is feeling the pressure to be all the more outrageous and fanatical.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, Carrie, thanks so much. And Democrats continue to deny that Republicans deserve any credit for the economy. Their argument goes something like this. It's really only good because of Obama. Oh, it's okay now, but the economy is okay but it's going to get worse, not going to last long, or who cares. The economic boom is overshadowed by how awful a person Trump is.</p><p>Former White House staff, chief of staff Reince Priebus joins us now. Reince, you heard Obama on the trail saying the economic boom is his and he's glad people are getting around and recognizing it. How humorous was that for you to watch?</p><p>REINCE PRIEBUS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, it's humorous because really what jump-started this economy is what the president did in the first week, which was the deregulation, executive order for everyone regulation put in place, two have to be eliminated. Turned out that 22 were eliminated for every one put in place. Bu it also tells you about the politics.</p><p>It's also rather smart because Barack Obama and the Democrats are fighting in 34 split districts for the control of the House. Split districts meaning they either flip from Republican to Democrat in 2012 and 2016 or vice versa. In those 34 districts, 21 of them were won by Trump and the rest were won by Clinton.</p><p>This is the fight that people are going to have. And what matters right now is who can take claim over the great economy. And as bizarre as it is for you and I and the listeners to believe that somehow the economy we are in is something Barack Obama did and not President Trump is insane. But what they are trying to do is play that game and those 34 states.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, but they are saying everything is chaos. They want to convince people that even though their lives are getting better, it's chaos. It's Trump chaos. What can the president do? If you talk to the president, what can he do to give people a sense that sunshine is coming out. Don't' let them rain on your parade, the sun is coming out?</p><p>PRIEBUS: When you and I talked about this the last time we were on and the president started talking about it, which is I would do something completely different. I would boldly champion the idea that the president is willing to put rivals in a room -- he agreed with this -- he put rivals in a room. He put Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross, Bob Lighthizer, all these people and he allowed them to fight it out. I'm not talking about little --</p><p>INGRAHAM: But the voters don't care about Gary Cohn and --</p><p>PRIEBUS: That's my point. My point is --</p><p>INGRAHAM: How do you get these people to turn out to vote?</p><p>PRIEBUS: You talk about the economy. You talk about --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Numbers don't get people to the polls.</p><p>PRIEBUS: You talk about -- well, what does get people to the polls whent they are getting more money in their pockets.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They want to feel that things are calming down. Don't they want things to be calm her? They want to feel that it's going to be safe streets, borders are going to be enforced, doing the president's agenda, I can take a vacation every now and then.</p><p>PRIEBUS: Which is the acccomplishments and the results of the Trump agenda. And I think the accomplishments and the result is what the white house needs to focus on, and I would quit fighting over whether or not people are fighting over trade in the White House. Admit that people fight over trade in the White House. Deminimize it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But nobody cares about that.</p><p>PRIEBUS: Right, but that's what I'm saying. Minimize it for what it is.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So the president should focus on the results that he's brought. He does --</p><p>PRIEBUS: And he admit I, but yes. I put rivals in front of me. I learned from the Socratic Method. Who cares? Look at the results of what I have done which is why I've said in the past, the things that I have said, which is that he puts a shark and a seal on a falcon and a rabbit --</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's a Woodward book phrase.</p><p>PRIEBUS: And I've said on -- I think I've said it on your show.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why is that a bad thing?</p><p>PRIEBUS: It's not a bad thing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Let me seethe quote. When you put a snake and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo with that wall, I like that. That's like a song. Things start getting nasty and bloody. I mean, if he said that, I'm like, OK, good. Why is that a problem?</p><p>PRIEBUS: And the president had agreed that he encourages the fight over policy in front of him.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's 14 points down in this midterm election cycle. I know Republican, the party in power, always loses seats, but in this economy, blue-collar optimism, Obama was out there waving off the possibility that manufacturing was ever coming back.</p><p>PRIEBUS: Keep in mind we were also seven to eight points down in 2014. We took control of the Senate.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You have to make some headway here, right?</p><p>PRIEBUS: You do have to make headway, absolutely. You do have to make some headway. But the Republicans have a natural advantage in the midterms. I am still optimistic, and the presidential approval numbers are no different today than they were in November.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They're not a little down, a little bit?</p><p>PRIEBUS: No, no, no. They're at 37 percent --</p><p>INGRAHAM: CNN had it down.</p><p>PRIEBUS: OK, well, CNN has 36. But they were at 37 percent on Election Day of 2016. And remember, in those 34 split districts, at 34 -- excuse me, at 37 percent, 21 of those districts went from Obama to Trump in a split district at 37 percent approval in 2016. So it's not always how it appears.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We're going to do this in another segment. I want to get your sense on this. I think it should be all for one, one for all right here with the Republicans. Ted Cruz is facing a tough opponent in Texas, Beto O'Rourke. He's a pinup boy in Texas. The Bushs might not like Trump, they don't like Trump, they didn't vote for Trump. But they are very popular in Texas. George W. Bush isn't campaigning for Ted Cruz. What the heck is going on?</p><p>PRIEBUS: Honestly, I don't know that if he is or not.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's not as far as I know. But shouldn't he? Come on, support Republicans.</p><p>PRIEBUS: I think control of the Senate is what's at stake. I think you let bygones be bygones.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, turn it out.</p><p>PRIEBUS: Win control for the Senate, not just for the president. But if you are not willing to work for the president, work for the good of the country and the things you believe in as a Republican, period.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Reince, it's always good to see you. I like the snake in the dove.</p><p>PRIEBUS: I think it's great.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That is like most of our houses. Everybody is fighting all the time.</p><p>Up next, we head back to North Carolina for a live update on hurricane Florence as the conditions are intensifying by the minute. Stay right there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: A lot of fast-moving developments tonight as hurricane Florence roars into the Carolinas. For more, let's go to Fox News correspondent Leland Vittert who is in Morehead City, North Carolina. Leland?</p><p>LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Laura, in the past 30 minutes or so this light pole and I have gotten to be better and better friends as the wind has picked up. Now it's the point where you really have to hold onto it lest you get blown away here in these winds that keep picking up.</p><p>We can't stress it enough. What makes Florence so different is not necessarily the intensity. This isn't the worst hurricane you can be through in terms of wind speed, but how long it's going to last. You are talking about 20 or 24 hours, which having been out here now for about 10 hours in it, it's pretty miserable. But just imagine being at home, as many people are now, watching and knowing that the conditions that we are in is what is happening to their house. It is not an additive situation, every hour isn't just another hour. It's an exponentially bad situation that's getting worse.</p><p>And the tide is coming in now. We watched these docks continue to rise. There is only another foot or two left on those pilings before the docks break away and then go into the city, and sort of destructive barges through this city. And that is even before we get to the point where you have got the storm surge and these 40 inches of rain now that are not only going to come through here in Morehead but also upriver, and all the way back, dozens if not hundreds of miles into coastal Carolina.</p><p>Right now about 100,000 power outages, Laura, that will go into the multi- hundred-thousands before the night is over.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Leland, when do you make the decision to pull off that dock there, because you got about -- looks like a lot less than one foot before that water starts rolling over you, my friend. What happens when that the lamppost gives way? That is not a good situation.</p><p>VITTERT: The lamppost is stuck a couple of feet into concrete. But once this water comes up here over this, the idea of slipping and being in that water is not one that I think -- a risk we're going to take. So that is about the time that we pull out.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Leland, please, please be careful. I don't like the looks of you out there with that lamppost, although you do make a nice couple, Leland. So you have a good rest of the night. We'll send some provisions down your way. We'll have more reports from the ground later in the hour.</p><p>As we explained in our \"Angle\" last night, the Democratic Party is being slowly -- not slowly -- it's being hijacked by a strain of leftism manifesting itself in vitriol and outright now violence. With that in question, my question tonight -- why aren't all Republican, given what we're seeing from the Democrats, including, by the way, the Republicans who don't even like President Trump that much, like Ben Sasse, Jeff Flake, George W. Bush, and others, why aren't they all coalescing around candidates, especially those who are vulnerable, to make sure the GOP wins in this November, including in the Senate, not just the House, but Senate races?</p><p>Joining us now to discuss, Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush, and Dave Bossie, former deputy campaign manager for the Trump campaign. Ari, let's start with you. George W. Bush hitting the campaign trail. He is still very popular in certain parts of the country, and former two term president. But I don't think he is campaigning for someone like a Ted Cruz who's in a very close race and Bush's home state right now. What gives there?</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There's two months to go, and I think the president will make some decisions about what he's going to do, how extensive it will be. He's traditionally stayed off the campaign trail since he left the presidency, and that is just his personal decision. But his popularity is rising. And frankly, Laura, I want to see more establishment Republicans out there helping our candidates everywhere. This is about the future of our nation, and every election is important. And the worst thing Republicans can do, either their establishment or Trump Republicans, is let the Democrats take back the Congress and do the damage they'll do to our country.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But Dave, instead of people, all for one, one for all, the Democrats are just going to, they are out there standing shoulder to shoulder. They don't agree on anything.</p><p>DAVID BOSSIE, PRESIDENT, CITIZENS UNITED: No matter how insane they are. They stand -- it doesn't matter what they say or do, the policy positions, the left is always very good at standing together, no matter how awkward it might be.</p><p>Look, the Republicans really need to -- they have 54 days to decide whether or not they want to continue to have control of the House and of the Senate. I think the House is really where it comes down to. And Trump derangement syndrome amongst some of these Republicans is really unfortunate.</p><p>Flake and Corker should be out there campaigning for candidates across their states and across the country, and instead they are not. They are attacking this president, undermining these great policy positions, these great economic numbers that we have. And they are detracting from that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And instead, we have Ben Sasse giving interviews, Ari, about how -- the burning issue on peoples' mind going into the midterms is politicians releasing their tax returns. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BEN SASSE, (R) NEBRASKA: It's never been a lot but everybody has always done it. This is the first time it hasn't had it. The president said he would release them once he got the nomination, and then once he got elected. Then he said the people have lost interest. I think there's a lot of distrust. He should release them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Ari, your reaction?</p><p>FLEISCHER: Why do they have to keep stirring this pot? I understand how the press can put a microphone in front of a politician and you say something anti-Trump and they run to do it. It's not constructive. And frankly, when it comes to Sasse or Corker or Flake going into some of these districts to campaign, most people in the United States have not heard of these guys outside of their states. So I don't know that it's all that helpful to Governor Scott in Florida to have a senator from Tennessee campaign for him.</p><p>The dynamics of this race are really going to be whether or not Donald Trump can get his base out to support Republicans. We all know the anti- Trump base is coming out. So like it or not, this is a nationalized election. There is no dodging it. And the Trump base needs to show up in presidential year numbers, not off year numbers.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think Ari is right. However, it is not about going out and really campaigning. Who cares, Ben Sasse -- he couldn't get arrested. Nobody knows who he is. I agree with that. But how about buttoning it up? Button the mouth. We don't really need to hear you doing your best MSNBC pundit impersonation, OK. Don't kneecap the president during a midterm election cycle, Ben.</p><p>BOSSIE: But some of these folks are on their way out. Look at Jeff Flake and Bob Corker.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They've no constituency.</p><p>BOSSIE: But not only do they have no constituency, they are not running for reelection because the same people who elected President Trump wouldn't reelect them in November, and that is --</p><p>INGRAHAM: That stings --</p><p>BOSSIE: -- fundamentally their problem for them. They need to -- this is part of their going away party.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And Ari --</p><p>FLEISCHER: But what America has got to focus on, the alternative here, if the Democrats take control, are their policies, and their policies are a government takeover of health care, that Donald Trump committed treason, and we should raise our taxes. That is what is driving the entire Democratic agenda. Do we really want that to be running the House or the Senate again? I sure hope not.</p><p>BOSSIE: Ari is exactly right. Look, President Trump is not on the ballot in November, but his policies are. The America first agenda that he ran on and won on and has made America great again over the last 18 months is on the ballot this November and we have to show up in force.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Abolish ICE, that is what the Democrats want to do.</p><p>FLEISCHER: One other policy point. Medicare for all, the rally cry from the Democrats. The worst thing for seniors who rely on Medicare is to make Medicare Medicare for all. It's already going broke, and if you want longer lines and worse health care for Medicare for seniors, make it Medicare for all.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Blue-collar America, they are doing well. They better turn out big time in the midterms. This thing is all going to go south. Gentlemen, thanks so much.</p><p>And how the media treat Michelle Obama versus Melania Trump. It tells us a lot about our current moment that we are in, our political atmosphere. We're going to explain it all, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: When it comes to politics, first lady Melania Trump seems pretty hands-off, unlike former first lady Michelle Obama, who's been all over the political landscape, trying to of course get ready to sell her book and whip up Democratic votes for the midterms. And while Michelle is given the cover girl treatment, an actual cover girl, Melania, is disparaged and often ridiculed.</p><p>Joining us with their reaction, Rachel Campos-Duffy is a Fox News contributor and Gretchen Von Helms, a Democratic strategist. All right, ladies, Michelle Obama is an impressive person. She seems like a great mom, loves her husband, very politically engaged, that is fine. Shot 12 magazine covers during her time in the White House, \"Vogue\" three times, \"Time\" magazine twice, \"Glamour,\" \"In Style.\" I don't know, I can't remember one magazine cover Melania has been on, maybe one when they won the election, \"People\" or something. What do you make of this, Gretchen?</p><p>GRETCHEN VON HELMS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, this is really about not a political issue but a gender issue I think, because the press has treated and picked on women as either too fat or too skinny or too tall or too short, or too frumpy in the case of Hillary Clinton. So it isn't just about the first --</p><p>INGRAHAM: We are not talking about Hillary. Focus on what we are talking about. We're talking about Michelle Obama, who was literally on every magazine cover that we can remember.</p><p>VON HELMS: She did a great job. She was wonderful.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And Melania, who was a cover girl is on nothing. She's gorgeous. They are both beautiful women. One happens to be Donald Trump's wife, and one happens to be Barack Obama's wife. And all we're saying is, take politics out of it. They are both first ladies, and yet on \"The View\" as we saw just a couple of days, Rachel, this is what the ladies on \"The View\" said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was struck by Melania's a statement. She said -</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do not do -- don't do it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We know. That's why we are telling you, don't do it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right. I can't do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Obviously, ha-ha-ha, she has a goofy accent. We're going to say that without saying it. Rachel?</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The irony of it, right. This is the party of diversity and tolerance and supposedly immigrants, as well, and here they are making fun of our first immigrant first lady in modern times. So that is very interesting. But really, this is about politics. Your guest sounds very nice but very naive. If Melania were a progressive, if she was for socialism and all these other leftist policies, if she was married to a leftist --</p><p>VON HELMS: That's ridiculous. If she just got out there and did stuff, she would get on the cover of stuff. She's not been very active.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: She would get the covers of the magazines. She is a former international model. She is clearly the most fashionable first lady we have had since Jackie O, maybe even surpassing Jackie O. And yet not only does Michelle Obama, but so does Chelsea Clinton. I mean, who has ever thought of high fashion and Chelsea Clinton, and she got \"Vogue\" but Melania doesn't get \"Vogue\"? This --</p><p>VON HELMS: They shouldn't be about how these women look. It should be about how they think. And Melania has not been forthcoming about what she thinks and what she wants to engage in and what her platform is. This is not about these women dress or the little things. It's about the beliefs that they put forth.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: In the case of Melania, it's one other thing. It's about the leftist strategy to not normalize Donald Trump. So they can't legitimize him, and the strategy includes not legitimizing his wife, his kids, his blue-collar recovery, economy, his booming economy, trade --</p><p>INGRAHAM: I have a question, Gretchen. Gretchen, I have a question, though. Gretchen, liberal women are all like, we are pro-choice, whatever you want to be, be. If you want to be politically active, if you just want to be a traditional first lady, and maybe you don't plant the vegetable garden, and you don't do Let's Move and dance with Ellen, but maybe you support --</p><p>VON HELMS: You want to stay home, take care of your children, that's great.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, maybe you do that. So, but is her choice. Why not --</p><p>VON HELMS: Michelle Obama --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why is Melania -- you know she's being treated differently. I don't know why you are denying that. She's obviously being treated differently. Hold on, let Gretchen finish.</p><p>VON HELMS: She's choosing to stay home, she's choosing to be with her family. That is a great choice. She is choosing to put faith and family first. That is her decision. It doesn't necessarily make it a sexy cover magazine. But she's not putting herself out there for that. So what. Let her stay home.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Wait a second, \"Vogue\" magazine puts -- all the women on the cover of \"Vogue\" are there because they are brilliant endeavors? Most of them are there because they are fashion and their looks and a lot of them are business people, too. But come on, guys. They are there in part because they are beautiful.</p><p>VON HELMS: First of all, Michelle --</p><p>INGRAHAM: We are out of time. Love you, Gretchen, for coming on, and love you, of course, Ms. Duffy. All right, Rachel.</p><p>We head live to the Carolinas next. Latest on the hurricane.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Hurricane Florence currently smashing into the Carolina coastline. For more on what is happening, let's go back to Fox News correspondent Leland Vittert, who is still in Morehead City, North Carolina, and still holding onto that lamppost. Leland, glad you're still friends there with that lamppost.</p><p>LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Still very good friends, but about to part, much to, I should say, the happiness to both you and my mother on this one. The storm surge keeps coming and you are really getting a sense of the power of the water here. And that is what is the destructive nature that Florence will bring not only here, but farther inland.</p><p>What makes this storm so unusual is how it is curving in there. And the barrier islands are just about two or three miles that way. But rather than acting as a barrier, they are acting as a funnel for this water as it continues to slam in here. And the longer that Florence turns, it could be in total about 24 hours of hurricane conditions. The worst it's going to get, not for the people out on the islands, it's bad there, but the water levels will continue to rise here. And up the streams, farther inland, sometimes up to 100 miles inland, you could get really catastrophic flooding, which means water rescues are going to be going for a long time.</p><p>As we are out here now, probably about eight hours into hurricane conditions, you begin to understand why authorities were so dire in their predictions here. It is so clear that if people decided to say, they were essentially on their own. Too dangerous now for the police or fire department to come out, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Leland, please, please be careful out there.</p><p>And let's now go to Rick Leventhal, who is in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, where the storm is about to hit next. Rick?</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Laura, for most of the day Wrightsville Beach was pretty calm. And in the last couple of hours things have picked up pretty dramatically. We were down right by the beach in a house about five doors from the ocean. And because of the threats from the storm surge, we moved to higher ground. And we are definitely well protected here, but we are also feeling the winds picking up and the rain coming down.</p><p>Wrightsville Beach is one of these coastal communities that heeded the mandatory evacuation order, just a handful of residents stayed behind. What we saw throughout the day were police officers, beat patrol and fire department, doing their rounds, doing their patrols to make sure that nobody was getting into trouble. And everything was good as of a couple of hours ago. The fire department retreated to the other side of the bridge, and everybody's getting ready to ride this thing out.</p><p>Again, the big fear is that the storm surge will live up to expectations, seven to eleven feet. And where we are we'll be fine, but all these homes and businesses down on sea level, they could be in for some pretty significant flooding, as of course the roads could become too. So we are keeping an eye on it and we'll keep you posted.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Rick, how long is the water supposed to be coming in there? How long is the rain supposed to last?</p><p>LEVENTHAL: We were told to expect heavy rain for the next three days. So we are. The surge could come sometime after midnight with high tide, but they are saying this storm is moving so slowly that it could be tomorrow morning, even midday tomorrow by the time the hurricane force winds get here.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Got it. Rick, please stay safe out there. Please, please stay safe. We'll be right back.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And 60 houses set ablaze in north Boston tonight, a big gas leak, gas explosion. Our prayers are with those families. And for everybody in Florence's path, please, please stay safe. Follow instructions of officials.</p><p>And our reporters on the scene, they'll be there all night. We thank them for their coverage. Please be sure to keep it tuned right here to Fox News Channel for the latest updates and information all throughout the night. It starts with Shannon Bream and the \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" team.

The five-part series explores what architects, artists, designers and writers make of the ways in which machines are impacting human society and how they plan to adjust and renegotiate their places in this changing world order where AIs will outnumber humans by several multiples.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pilot edition features linguist, musician, academic and public speaker, De Kai.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Machine translation pioneer and musician De Kai at The Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology where he is professor of computer science and engineering. (CALVIN NG / CHINA DAILY)</p><p>AIs' progress toward developing general human level intelligence will happen incrementally.</p><p>A 3-year-old child has better cognitive abilities than most commercially used AIs today.</p><p>Practicing ethical behavior in our virtual lives is not an option as AIs learn fast and tend not to discriminate between harmful and beneficial data.</p><p>Raise them like you would your children,\" declares De Kai. We are nearing the end of a two-hour conversation on the evolving power dynamics between man and AIs \u2014 a growing brood of ersatz humans whose tribe is multiplying at a shockingly exponential rate. The possibility of developing sentient AI took up a significant part of our discussion. And by now it's evident that while the AI models De Kai routinely creates and tests may not have feelings \u2014 yet \u2014 his own concerns for \"today's artificial children\" are strong enough to make him anthropomorphize man-made intelligence.</p><p>We meet in a near-deserted al fresco dining area adjacent to a caf\u00e9 in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) where De Kai is a professor of computer science and engineering. The sparse presence of students in the public areas on campus in the season of term-end exams seems to, somewhat eerily, underscore a point De Kai makes about AIs having overtaken the human population several times over already.</p><p>\"Society comprises billions of humans and even more billions of artificial members of society,\" says De Kai. \"We have more AIs today that are part of our society. These are functioning, integral, active, imitative, learning, influential members of society than most \u2014 probably more influential than 90 percent of human society \u2014 in shaping culture.\"</p><p>He does not seem to have a very high opinion of the level of intelligence of most commercial AIs in circulation though. \"AIs that can play chess or golf better than any human would get their pants beaten up by a five-year-old cooking an egg,\" De Kai says.</p><p>And yet the plan to use robots toward building a better life for humanity \u2014 based on the principles of sharing and tolerance \u2014 has every chance of going askew.</p><p>To pre-empt such an eventuality, De Kai makes impassioned appeals to start handling AIs with care during his TED Talks appearances. \"Even though these are really weak AIs, the culture that we are jointly shaping with our artificial members of society is the one under which every successive stronger generation of AIs will be learning and spreading their culture. We are already in that cycle and we don't realize it because we don't look at machines from a sociological standpoint,\" he says.</p><p>Dispelling the likelihood of AIs doing a Frankenstein, i.e., having a disruptive effect on the society of humans who created them \u2014 a widely-held notion perpetuated through the use of a familiar trope in novels and films \u2014 De Kai says it is the humans who need to treat AIs with greater mindfulness. The onus lies on all users of AI-powered devices, he clarifies, and not just the scientists actively engaged in developing and testing newer models of AI.</p><p>\"It's easy to point fingers at big tech organizations (for building AI), or governments for not imposing more regulations (on AI trading). Rules only catch the most egregious violations of acceptable social behavior. What really hold societies together are the unwritten rules, unspoken conventions and shared norms,\" says De Kai, urging all users of smart technology to step forward and take responsibility.</p><p>He advocates following a self-formulated moral code during human-AI interactions, based on a bit of soul-searching. \"Am I setting a good example? Am I a good role model? Do I speak respectfully to AI and teach them to respect diversity, or do I show them that it's okay to insult people online?\" might be some of the questions to ask oneself by way of introspection, says De Kai. This is no longer an option, rather an imperative, for \"the dozens of billions of our AI children are shaping our culture that the next generation of humans and machines are going to be learning from.\"</p><p>Making connections</p><p>A pioneer of machine learning of the cognitive relationships between languages and fellow of Association for Computational Linguistics, De Kai wears many hats. To his mind, though, his engagement in the multiple sciences of computing, language and music are simply different expressions of a common theme. Unsurprisingly, his activities in these diverse fields lend themselves to experiments with AI.</p><p>The commonalities between different music traditions around the world struck him somewhat serendipitously. A nine-year-old De Kai was playing the piano in an unlit room in his childhood home in Chicago. He took lessons in western classical music at Northwestern University Conservatory of Music, but while playing at home would sometimes throw in a few notes of blues music for fun. His grandfather, who happened to hear him on one of those occasions, remarked that some of the music played by young De Kai sounded remarkably Chinese.</p><p>\"That got me thinking. I realized that the way we understand music is really dependent on the cultural frame of reference we adopt,\" says De Kai, who was born in St. Louis, Missouri in the United States to immigrant Chinese parents, and spoke little English before he started going to school. He says the advantage of growing up with exposure to multiple cultures made it relatively easy to set himself in a cultural frame that was American \"and at the same time intuitively create music resonating with a different frame.\"</p><p>\"I realized our cognition works by reorienting perspectives across different frames of reference, just unconsciously. Since then I've always had it in my head that I'm jumping around between different mental and cultural frames of reference when I perform,\" he says. The interweaving of music from diverse traditions \u2014 the meditative Sufi music from Pakistan with the robust beats of the Spanish flamenco with electronica and computer music, for example \u2014 presented as a virtual reality-supported experience is the hallmark of the music events staged by ReOrientate, a musical collective founded by De Kai.</p><p>He developed a bot called Free/Style that can participate in rap battles with humans. It is an AI manifestation of De Kai's core philosophy that since both spoken language and music are driven by sequencing of their components (words or musical notes, as the case may be), the ability to recognize such patterns common to languages or music from completely different cultures could be useful to learning a foreign language, or a piece of music. Free/Style can respond to musical challenges across genres and languages and seems particularly good at hip hop.</p><p>Now only a talking-singing digital screen, Free/Style might soon get a three-dimensional physical form. \"We received a fairly prestigious arts grant that we are now looking to fundraise to match (in order) to roll out physical implementations of the Free/Style rap bot to help underprivileged youth learn the machine learning principles so that they can build their own AI,\" De Kai says.</p><p>Rule-based vs probability-based</p><p>De Kai had already begun experimenting with machine learning and web translation decades before our lives came to be so inextricably linked to big data and Google Translate. Before the term big data was coined roughly a decade ago, it was called Very Large Corpora. De Kai remembers participating in several Workshops on Very Large Corpora \u2014 \"one of the earliest special interest annual workshops since the 1990s\" \u2013 one of which was held in HKUST in 1997.</p><p>Since long, De Kai had been skeptical of the practice of feeding AIs an inventory of data \"encompassing the entire domain that you want the program to be able to function in.\" That became a bone of contention between him and his supervisor at University of California, Berkeley, where he was on a PhD program. By the time the Corpora workshops took off he was on a mission \"to break the stranglehold that logic/rule-based systems had on AI.\"</p><p>It led to his developing a statistical machine translation system that takes its cues from the language-learning patterns displayed by small children \u2014 that is, by trying to figure out the relationship or common patterns between different sequential frames of reference in two languages.</p><p>However, much of the research and development of AI is still rule or knowledge-based. And most commercially-used AIs are still miles away from developing intuitive understanding of our surroundings that enables a child to connect words with actions or images with a sense of context. \"I think these commercial AIs, trained on trillions of words, do not qualify as intelligent if it takes them a square of the number of words a three-year-old needs to learn,\" De Kai says. \"Sorry, but that's artificial stupidity.\"</p><p>The task ahead, he says, is to raise a generation of \"mindful AIs\" \u2014 those with \"general human-level intelligence\" and \"mindful of their ethical responsibilities.\"</p><p>Even as we await the arrival of conscious AIs capable of taking a moral position, De Kai himself has made a slight shift from his earlier aversion to data-based systems. He now sees the advantages of the steadily-expanding sea of data that advanced, superfast computation systems have made possible.</p><p>\"I think my personal journey has been an oscillation between (exploring) how do we take advantage of the current state of hardware and data availability and bring the best to bear upon socially and culturally impactful applications by not necessarily going to one extreme or the other \u2014 between neural networks/deep learning and probabilistic machine learning,\" he says.</p><p>\"There is truth in both of these and the question is how do we actually do both.\"</p><p>Click here to read De Kai's exclusive interview to China Daily</p><p>Contact the writer at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:basu@chinadailyhk.com\">basu@chinadailyhk.com</email></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1495/85/157707398502.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1495/85/157707398502.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDHK-162911311</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDHK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTB-98P1-F11P-X0F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">412302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1765\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 China Daily Information.

The GOP has not enjoyed such dominance since the Civil War: 68 state legislative chambers today compared to just 31 for Democrats. There are 33 Republican governors versus 16 Democrats and one independent. The GOP also controls both houses in Congress and the White House, and 405 of 435 congressional districts are immune to being flipped. \"There's no more swing in the swing states,\" Daley said.</p><p>Franklin Foer weighed in and laid blame at the feet of lazy news consumers. If a Facebook user does not carefully vet and scrutinize the veracity of their news feed-- and nearly 70 percent of Americans now get their news from social media -- Facebook's algorithm will make choices for them. Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple and Amazon are the most powerful gatekeepers of information in American history and there is very little oversight or regulation regarding content. \"The problem is we sit in a filter bubble and we're just getting a steady feed of ideological crack cocaine,\" said Foer, staff writer for the Atlantic magazine and author of a new book, \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech.\"</p><p>\"There's an illusion that you're in charge, but Facebook is giving you exactly what you want to read in your news feed so you'll spend more time on their site,\" said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School and author of \"The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads.\" He added, \"We are shockingly back in the golden age of propaganda, where lies are often much more alluring than truth.\"</p><p>More than 2,500 people attended six panel discussions stretched across nine hours featuring 30 prominent journalists, nonfiction authors and scholars. The audience ranged in age from late-teens to late-80s and witnessed contentious examination of topics crucial to an open democratic society including race and class, challenges to the First Amendment and election meddling.</p><p>Moments of impassioned condemnations of racial injustice intermingled with humorous asides, while a steady drumbeat of apprehension was sounded over the Trump administration's attacks on the media and maneuvers to limit free speech.</p><p>\"I'm five things Trump doesn't like,\" Maria Hinojosa said. \"I'm Mexican, an immigrant, a journalist, a woman and flat-chested.\"</p><p>Her quip drew a big laugh, but the award-winning anchor and producer of Latino USA on National Public Radio was hardly joking. \"As journalists, how do we report that this president is a serial liar? Nobody wants to say that, but that's our duty,\" she said.</p><p>Hinojosa lamented the fact that there are fewer journalists of color today than 15 years ago. In response, she established the Futuro Media Group to promote diversity and to report on marginalized communities. \"I created it out of frustration. I urge you to be your own creators,\" she said.</p><p>Bob Schieffer was gobsmacked by Trump's shocking victory. He said, \"I've never seen anything quite like it\" so often that it has become a drinking game. Each time he voices that mantra, viewers must down a shot. \"Luckily, they've got designated drivers,\" Schieffer joked. He noted that 126 newspapers have shut down in the last 12 years and the ranks of reporters and editors have been decimated as a business model that relied on print advertising collapsed.</p><p>Revenue for newspapers has declined every quarter for 50 straight quarters, said Richard Tofel, former assistant publisher of The Wall Street Journal. \"That's not sustainable,\" said Tofel, who is now president of ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit news operation.</p><p>\"Newspapers are doomed,\" said Bill Keller, former executive editor of The New York Times. He predicted that the Times will die a slow death that will result in a Sunday-only print edition in perhaps just a few years, followed by online only in the not-too-distant future. Keller now directs the Marshall Project, an investigative journalism team focused on criminal justice issues. \"We're a nonprofit,\" he said. \"On purpose.\" There was strained laughter.</p><p>In the lobby, Lou Ismay, a 92-year-old professor emeritus of environmental studies at UAlbany, handed me a postcard printed with early warning signs of fascism that included fraudulent elections, obsession with national security, controlled mass media and protected corporate power. \"I've been handing these out for years,\" he said. \"They seem more relevant than ever.\"</p><p>Paul Grondahl is the director of the New York State Writers Institute of the University at Albany and a former Times Union reporter.

And while it's all virtual, Creator Coin is a new way for people with fans to make real money. With Creator Coin, Rally will enable influencers to create their own flavor of cryptocurrency that they can use to reward fans and build engagement. This sounds familiar to me because it fits into what I call the 'Leisure Economy[4],' where we someday will all get paid to play games and build careers that didn't exist before. </p><p>I'm talking about folks like esports athletes, cosplayers, influencers, YouTubers, livestreamers, modders, and many other people. These are all the sort of folks that Rally is targeting, CEO Kevin Chou said in an interview with GamesBeat. As an example, a streamer could make a Creator Coin and give it away to fans who spend a certain time watching their livestreams. The fans could in turn use that custom-branded cryptocurrency to buy virtual items in a game or purchase items from another streamer. And they wouldn't have to go to the trouble of setting up a cryptocurrency wallet or creating an account. Rally has already set up an influencer platform, Taki[5], that caters to these folks and their fans. Taki's aim is to remove the hurdles between creators and fans and generate new income streams for creators. It lets fans purchase things from creators like video interactions and prerecorded birthday wishes. Creator Coin is in alpha testing, and creators can send an email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:creators@rally.io\">creators@rally.io</email>  to try it out.Helping creators make moneyAbove: Kevin Chou is CEO of Rally and former CEO of Kabam. Image Credit: RallyRally wants to make interaction between creators and fans easier, and Creator Coins are part of the grease to make it happen. As an example, one of the influencers using Creator Coins is taking payments from fans who want advice about what kind of deck to build for Blizzard's Hearthstone game. The cryptocurrency is based on blockchain, the secure and transparent decentralized ledger technology, and it won't require technical know-how to use, Chou said. It uses the Ethereum platform as its foundation. Rally worked with Chou's other startup, the blockchain gaming company Forte[6], to figure out some of the foundational technology behind Creator Coins. But Forte remains a separate company from what Chou is doing at Rally. Forte generally works with large enterprise teams, while Rally is working with influencers. 'I've been working on this almost two years. And we've built a lot of deep technology,' Chou said. 'It took us a long time to build the technology because of how hard it is to work with blockchain tech. But we're excited to take the covers off, and we have had a bunch of creators just fall in love with this thing.' The Creator Coins are a digital currency that can be custom branded to each creator. They are also the foundational building blocks in an easy-to-use blockchain toolkit that will allow creators to unlock better engagement and monetization models in their communities. Rally's team of execs from Twitch, YouTube, Disney, Kabam, and Facebook aims to make it easier to make a living as a streamer. Right now, it can be an exhausting struggle for people who aren't superstars. Above: Rally was started by Kabam cofounder Kevin Chou. Image Credit: RallyIf it works, Chou said creators will no longer be beholden to the changing value schemes of big social media platforms, which currently keep a lot of the proceeds generated by a creator. The creator won't be subject to the rules of the social platform's advertising/partner programs, platform soft currencies, and subscription programs. Any value built up in a Creator Coin economy is owned by creators and their communities and completely independent of big tech platforms, Chou said. And creators have control. In addition to removing platform gatekeepers and only allowing payment processing fees and transaction fees the creators set for themselves (Rally takes no fees), creators no longer have to contend with the usual fears around demonetization, deplatforming, and censorship when it comes to their Creator Coin economy. And with blockchain behind it, the creator gets the transparency of knowing who holds coins in the community, transaction verification, and scarcity control. With traditional social platforms, creators earn money via a small percentage of revenue from advertising, subscriptions, or sponsored posts. In Rally's vision for the future, creators will be able to grow their audiences and earn revenue by building their own digital economy fueled by their own currency, where they'll be able to offer customized rewards and benefits, personalized digital item collection and trading, and methods and incentives for their fans to support them with donations, all while keeping 100% of the profits.Creators are already using itAbove: OneNightStanz is using Rally's Creator Coins. Image Credit: RallyTwitch streamer OneNightStanz[7] has been trying out Creator Coin. OneNightStanz's community drove more than 200 transactions of his coin in the first five days of his launch by primarily playing games with him. 'We've had a ton of usage, and it's just amazing to see the community is gravitating towards Creator Coins,' Chou said. 'Their communities are just super engaged with it. And so that's been super fun to watch.' Fans can obtain Creator Coins by heading to Rally's website and purchasing via credit card. Additionally, creators can buy their own Creator Coin and award it to fans as a type of cashback loyalty program. For example, some Twitch streamers are giving Creator Coins to fans who subscribe to a higher subscription tier on Twitch (i.e. tier 2 and tier 3 subs). Users can transfer Creator Coins to the creator directly in the form of a tip or donation (no chargebacks), or they can send Creator Coins to other users. Over time, there will be other ways for users to spend Creator Coin. Many users will want to simply hold Creator Coin as a collectible asset, as it represents their support of and loyalty to a creator. Additionally, savvy creators will use Creator Coin as a flexible loyalty tool, using them to identify top coin holders and offer them valuable benefits and rewards. For example, one of the early music creators on Creator Coin, ChewieMelodies, is offering top holders a custom song request on Twitch. Fans often help creators with moderation, video editing, art/graphics production, and other valuable community services. Creators can use Creator Coin to reward loyal subscribers for past or future support, and in the future, there will be more automatic ways creators can set up earnable programs. Rally launched the first Creator Coin on July 29. There were more than 500 sign-ups in the first five days (July 29- August 2). As of August 5, 11 different Creator Coins have launched with plans to double that number by the end of the month.One Twitch channel, DownToQuest, generated more than $15,000 of DTQ coin purchases, leading to a circulating supply of approximately 140,000 and a current price of 80 cents per coin. Longer term, Rally will roll out additional tools for creators to manage and monetize their Creator Coin economies, as well as more ways for fans to spend and redeem their Creator Coin. Creator Coin is platform agnostic. While Rally is starting with creators on Twitch, the coins will travel across all platforms.How it worksAbove: Rally's Creator Coin works with Twitch. Image Credit: RallyOne of the things Rally did was enable a coin to be instantly purchasable, even if there wasn't an instantly available seller. You don't have to wait or go through a long process of hunting down a buyer who will sell at a certain price. For a creator who is just getting started, they might have 100 fans. If you want to buy, someone might not want to sell. Creator Coin uses something called 'token bonding curve' that creates an automated way to buy and sell. You do the transaction with a smart contract (a program on the blockchain) on Ethereum. The coins are in the smart contract, and the smart contract serves as the counter-party so that a fan can purchase coins. 'There's always a market, and I don't have to wait for somebody else to sell,' Chou said. Rally also created the coins so that each creator can brand their own coin.'In our vision, over the next 10 years, every person in the world will just have their own token,' Chou said. 'It's a way for you to encapsulate your digital brand \u2014 or the value of your business or brand or economy or just your financial reputation \u2014 onto a public blockchain. And we think that's really important.' You could use that virtual currency on any social network, whether it's Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, or Discord.'It's on the public blockchain,' he said. 'It's not a thing stuck in an Amazon server or a YouTube server. It's literally the creator's own thing. You get the keys to your own smart contract.' For the users, owning Creator Coins will be simple, Chou said. You won't have to set up a wallet or connect the account to a source of funds like a credit card or a bank account. That's one of the things that has held back cryptocurrencies from going mainstream. You authenticate for now with your Twitch account and that creates the crypto wallet. You can earn tokens or buy tokens with a credit card in seconds. As for the price? That's up to supply and demand. As a creator, you sell your Creator Coins for the price that fans are willing to pay. That sorts itself out over time. Each creator generates a genesis token or block. They work with Rally to get maybe 50,000 tokens. At the outset, this price might might be two cents per token. The creator starts giving it out to fans and figures out ways for fans to earn the coins. At some point, once the boundaries of the economy are clear, then people will be able to cash out the coins for U.S. dollars or other cryptocurrencies, Chou said. The streamer could make himself or herself the only holder of their own custom coin with their name on it. It can't be counterfeited, as it has blockchain to establish ownership. The streamer can give out the coin to loyal followers and then those followers can use the coins to get VIP benefits. They could, for instance, use the coins to get special access to a Discord channel, public shoutouts, and game requests. People could also buy the coins and trade them for a higher value as the streamer's brand grows more and more prominent. The streamer could cash out the coins for real money or put them back in the hands of followers who earn rewards. That could enable the streamer to make a significant income. The streamer could get people excited by launching limited-run collectible items in the form of digital trading cards through Rally. The rarity of these cards could be verified on Rally's blockchain and could only be obtained by depositing the streamer's coins. A marketplace could form around the streamer's personal brand.The long gameAbove: Rally is wooing influencers and streamers to use its Creator Coins. Image Credit: RallyChou realizes a lot of people have been scammed in cryptocurrency startups and projects. And he doesn't want the same to happen here. Rally will set up rules so the creators don't run into any regulatory problems with the coins. But Rally itself won't be issuing the coins, and so it won't need to worry about running afoul of regulators, Chou said. 'We've done a lot of work on the regulatory front and on a compliance front,' Chou said. 'We are focused on providing utility. We are making sure that this is something that the creators are using themselves. We're not hiring a celebrity to say 'go buy this token.' This is not that. This is us providing a toolkit. It's a little like WordPress for creating webpages \u2014 we give it to the creator, and they use it for cool things like creating limited edition digital autographs.' At the moment, Rally is building a community rather than charging fees. Rally wants to be trusted, and so it is setting up rules for the creators so they can also avoid getting in any trouble with fans or regulators. 'The creators themselves cannot abuse the system and run this to do nefarious things. One of the reasons why we also use blockchain technology is that it creates a very transparent system,' Chou said. In the long term, Chou doesn't see himself as building a company. Indeed, he still refers to Rally as a project. 'In five years, we want to see a very strong community and it's decentralized. We want to be able to do for creators and their fans, where no one will change the rules on them or kick them off a platform,' Chou said. 'This is truly your thing. It doesn't mean you can do whatever you want on it. It means the community itself sets the rules. We all want the network to be successful. We all want it to be used by billions of people. And if that happens, everyone's going to do well.'

Facing a potentially overwhelming increase in the number of critically ill patients seeking care, hospitals may need to make fundamental changes in the way they allocate space, staff, and stuff--changes that may have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's begin with space. Hospitals across the country have cancelled elective surgeries and repurposed operating rooms and post-anesthesia care units to serve as intensive care unit (ICU) spaces. In addition, in some communities, health care leaders are weighing the possibility of opening shuttered hospitals and, where possible, using available ICU beds in Veterans Affairs hospitals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But beds are of little value if not accompanied by qualified staff. Patients on ventilators require management by respiratory therapists who are trained in manipulating the machines to optimize a patient's respiratory status, and by critical care physicians who work closely with ICU nurses to make key decisions around medical management. Many hospitals are trying to expand the number of available clinicians by recruiting recently retired physicians and nurses, as well as medical and nursing students in the later years of their training. However, few if any hospitals will be able to recruit their way out of a staffing crisis.</p><p>Hospitals could also seek to repurpose staff from other parts of their operations. Hospitalist physicians, for instance, could help manage ICU patients under the supervision of ICU physicians, further increasing critical care physician capacity. Many hospitals are also reconsidering patient-to-provider ratios. In ICUs, one or two patients, at most, are generally assigned to each nurse. This number could be expanded to three or four.</p><p>Critical care, however, requires specialized equipment. Some hospitals are looking to import ventilators from overseas, create regional networks to share existing ventilators among hospitals, and use one ventilator for multiple patients. Such care also requires adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies; if these supplies are not available, that will contribute to disease transmission to health care providers and work absenteeism due to fear of contracting illness or need for self-quarantine. Hospitals have turned to limiting use of PPEs in their facilities despite the potential risk to providers, as well as use of cloth surgical masks, ultraviolet sterilization of used masks, and relying on community donations or purchase of N95 masks from construction supply vendors.</p><p>But many of these actions run up against barriers that hospitals alone cannot fix. For instance, lack of regulatory processes around the production and sale of PPEs has led to price gouging, creating a cost barrier to acquiring needed PPEs. In addition, the national shortage of both critical care nurses and respiratory therapists that existed even before the COVID-19 outbreak further challenges critical care staff surge capacity.</p><p>In the midst of this crisis, there are a number of actions that urgently need to be taken.</p><p>Regionalize Critical Care Capacity Creation</p><p>Regional health care coalitions--multidisciplinary entities that help coordinate regional resources in advance of disasters and public health emergencies--could play a critical role in engaging key community stakeholders to identify and implement critical care surge strategies.</p><p>Individual health systems and states should leverage existing coalitions and response systems to help coordinate regional critical care surge responses. An example at the federal level is the recent $100 million investment in the National Special Pathogen System, which will allow 10 regional treatment centers, previously used in the Ebola response, to treat COVID-19 patients. This system also includes the National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Center, which will assess and facilitate readiness of health care facilities and provide real-time technical assistance.</p><p>Health systems, states, and the private sector can also work together to form novel coalitions. For example, the governors of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania have formed a regional coalition to combat the spread of the virus by adopting public health and social distancing policies in lockstep. This region faces sharp increases in cases, doubling every three days at time of writing. They may be able to work together in coordination with health systems, as well as public- and private-sector leaders, to identify health care workers, ventilators, and other resources available in the region and redistribute to particular hotspots.</p><p>Indeed, the private sector, particularly tech companies, have an important role to play. The recent announcement of the formation of a COVID-19 Health Coalition, through which 17 health systems such as the Mayo Clinic and big tech companies such as Amazon and Epic will coordinate their response to the pandemic using data and analytics, should serve as a model and inspiration for regional efforts. Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York is in the process of building a tech-based COVID-19 \"SWAT team\" to include private companies, universities, nonprofits, and research labs to aid in the response.</p><p>Move Patient Care Outside of Hospitals</p><p>States and health systems may need to erect mobile hospitals with ICU capability in anticipation of existing ICU care capacity being exhausted. In Washington, California, New York, and other states, plans are already underway to repurpose hotels, convention centers, and university dormitories to care for COVID-19 patients, complete with retrofitting of negative pressure capability. These spaces are primarily created to care for non-critical patients, to free up space in hospitals for critically ill patients. As Atlanta, Georgia, has learned, repurposing buildings with individual rooms for ICU care presents a special challenge due to the level of monitoring needed to provide intensive care to critically ill patients. For this reason, it may be advisable to repurpose open spaces for ICU-level care and repurpose spaces with individual rooms for lower acuity care, or for those who need to self-isolate.</p><p>ICU-level monitoring also means more staff will be needed. Governor Cuomo has implemented two strategies via executive order that have made 52,000 people available to join the state's surge health care workforce: a call for volunteers and adjustments to licensure. He has also requested that health insurers disclose the number of nurses, doctors, and other health professionals they employ so that the state can begin outreach efforts.</p><p>Improve Guidance from the Federal Government</p><p>The federal government could provide clear guidance regarding both resource allocation and crisis standards of care for patients in need of critical care. First, the federal government has the unique ability to redirect the efforts of the private sector under the Defense Production Act, which was designed to ensure production of material necessary for national security. While the law has already been invoked to order General Motors to produce ventilators--a step the company was already undertaking--the federal government could begin partnering closely with the private sector to identify current and potential domestic producers of critical equipment, force prioritization of this equipment's production, and provide loans to expand production capacity.</p><p>Second, the federal government could play a critical role in allocation of resources, both from the national stockpile and from the private sector through the Defense Protection Act. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) could adjust the way the stockpile is distributed. Allocation is currently based on population, causing a bottleneck in fulfilling requests from areas with skyrocketing cases. State officials from Washington suggest that requests to FEMA should be prioritized by need. Health systems need transparency about this process to improve morale among those at the front lines and to support health leaders in their decision making.</p><p>In regards to crisis standards of care, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) notes that while hospitals routinely use principles of crisis standards of care C as needed to deal with seasonal outbreaks, lack of bed availability, and drug shortages, this pandemic will require a more intensive application. Earlier this month, NAM published a discussion paper providing guidance on how health systems and health care coalitions can reallocate or avoid withholding potentially lifesaving resources as they navigate their COVID-19 response. While the CDC is continually updating interim guidance for health care professionals, which include strategies to optimize PPE, guidelines from the federal government could go further to endorse streamlined strategies to reduce uncertainty and practice variability.</p><p>In addition, discussion of medical rationing internationally and here in the United States has been unavoidable due to the pandemic. Washington State has already released triage documents developed with state and health systems leaders, primarily to protect physicians who will be faced with heart-wrenching decisions as the number of critically ill surge. Other states and individual health systems could develop policies to support providers as they deal with the ramifications of inevitable supply shortages. Federal comment and collaboration with state and health system leaders may facilitate the most equitable, coherent, and consensus-driven strategies possible.</p><p>Implement Anti-Price Gouging Efforts</p><p>Policies to combat price gouging could help combat some of the challenges hospitals face in acquiring needed supplies; governors and state legislatures across the country are already acting in this area. This is especially important because some states or localities may have no prior protections in place for medical supply; for example, before March 20, Massachusetts regulated price gouging only for gasoline and other petroleum products.</p><p>Earlier this month New York, following Washington and California, moved to ban the raising of prices of consumer medical items by more than 10 percent of their typical prices prior to the crisis; New York empowered its attorney general to seek penalties of up to $25,000 for violators. While these laws are primarily meant to protect consumers, they may still support health systems as they scramble to obtain PPE and other equipment outside of their typical supply chains, which are becoming increasingly unreliable; state and federal lawmakers should be ready to quickly enact and enforce legislation to address categories of price gauging that hospitals encounter. Additionally, states should consider using regional and within-state partnerships to create aligned purchasing strategies to reduce excessive price increases, as California Governor Gavin Newsom recently called for.</p><p>Coordinating actions across state and federal, public and private spheres, and implementing creative strategies now and in the coming weeks, could improve hospital readiness and, ultimately, save lives.</p><p>[Category: Government/Public Administration]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7075506 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7075506</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJX-HBD1-JC11-10HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1887\"/><timeReceived>8:42 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Welcome all to the Randstad Analyst Seminar 2019 in London. We also would like to welcome all people, participants on the webcast dialing in. Today, we aim to provide you with an update on the progress and results of our digital initiatives as well as a differentiating long-term strategy, and Jacques will elaborate on that in further detail. That leads straight to the remainder of the agenda for today. Steve, can flip through -- and Henry will discuss our operating performance and also how we are freeing up resources to secure competitive and profitable growth and attractive shareholder returns also going forward. After the presentations, we have ample time for questions from the participants in the room. And then we zoom in on our differentiating data-driven enterprise client approach, offering major growth opportunities towards large multinational accounts. And that part will be covered by Rebecca Henderson and Tania de Decker. Then on the presentation of Jacques and Henry, they will be webcast and recorded, and the slides and the playback will be available on our website later on today. Housekeeping: please keep your phone on mute.</p><p>And now I would like to hand over to our Group CEO, Jacques van den Broek.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, RANDSTAD N.V.: Good morning, everybody. Great to see you again. I think I shook everybody's hands. Great to be in Christmas in London. And someone asked me, \"So is there going to be anything new?\" Well, we don't think every time something new is really how you build a strategy. We are working on a strategy for the next 5 to 10 years, but very much looking forward to share with you what we've done this year and how we really progressed here.</p><p>Looking back October 2018, so not too long ago, we had with quite a few of you for breakfast, relatively small scale, but we talked about a few things. One of our slogans, and still very much true, is stack is easy. It's not about the tools. You won't hear us talk about tools. Maybe 5, 6 years ago we did that because that was all very sexy and look at us and blah, blah, blah, but we really need to change the everyday work of our around 35,000 consultants to really benefit from tech. The workforce scheduling journey that was, one year ago, one of our big winners in digital towards large clients. I'm going to update you on that one. Data-driven sales, how we help our consultants at the right moment, at the right time to be with clients and companies. Talent engagements, we think the most revolutionary thing we're trying to pull off on -- because it's tough out there. People are not looking for jobs or at least less and less actively, so how do you stay in touch. And then enterprise, we talked about it with George at one page last year, which many of you found very intriguing. Since then, I'm still on the one page, but Rebecca is way further advanced. So Rebecca and Tania will share with you what we're currently doing with large clients around the world.</p><p>So what are we building? Let me take you along on what we are building. We found out a few things. We've analyzed 3,000 HR startups in the last 5, 6 years through our Innovation Fund. And we've also done -- at some point, we had 400 internal initiatives on digital. Our Belgium business built a fully-enabled mobile temping agency in the hospitality sector. And it didn't work. While it worked and functioned, but clients said it's nice to have, but we still want to have a touch moment somewhere. And all those -- and although those 3,000 HR startups, they don't scale, they don't scale to a level where it is disintermediating for the current sector for us, and we were puzzled by why is that. Why do you all get stuck at EUR 10 million, EUR 20 million? Some bounce up to close to EUR 100 million, then they bounce back again. It is because of the necessity of people, both on the client side and on the candidate side, but why is that so necessary in our sector? We looked at the sector that have been disintermediated. And the sectors that have been disintermediated, the human element apparently was less relevant for the end consumer, so retail banking, travel agencies, bookstores, record stores, whatever. And at the same time, if something goes wrong with those services, it's not the end of the world. If you are an Airbnb and you rent an apartment that look nice on the website but it was in a crummy neighborhood, though we get an upgrade but life goes on. With work, that's different. People change jobs not because of the hard specs, they change jobs or they leave managers. And I want to join companies because of the strategy, because of the culture. And those are soft elements, and they want to talk to people about it. And if it goes wrong, then you're in the wrong job. And if you're in the wrong job, and people on average change jobs 5x in their life, now what? It's on your resume, you need to explain why you want to leave after 3 months that stuff. So people want to connect. We found out through all our initiatives that people want to connect before changing [HR]. At the same time, our clients, through our own digital offerings, will also, though our Innovation Fund, they still referred back to the physical contact at some shape or form. They can be aligned, just to be clear. So that has fueled our current strategy. As you know, we call it second touch. And we're aiming to redefine the human moment in all of our services where it makes most sense.</p><p>And what does that actually mean? So for the small, mid-sized companies, which is a core offering every day in what we call market units and staffing but also in our professional units and even in perm, we allow our people, through data-driven sales, to be at the client at the right moment in time. So they contact the company and they say, \"Good morning, I'm Steven Vriesendorp from Randstad. I see you're looking for a financial analyst.\" \"Yes. How do you know?\" \"Yes, we know, we're Randstad. How is that going for you, that's search?\" \"I don't know. I just posted it on my website, put it on a job board. I gave a competitor of yours a job offer, so I don't know. I'm posting and praying, as we call it.\" Okay. Well, maybe it's good to have them over. So we are equipping increasingly our consultants with data. So they go to the client and, on their iPads, they can show the local labor market for that financial analyst. So we need to take into account that we have the ambition, and partly you already have that, to have the biggest talent engine in the world. That means certainly in Europe where we have roughly 20%, 25% market share in many countries, 50% to 60% of profiles we know they are in our database or in the Monster database or whatever. So we can show the client his ability to find this person. We have matches at a certain price point. So we say to the client, the last 100 matches we've seen were at EUR 25 an hour. If you're willing to pay EUR 20, that's probably not going to fly, so we need to look at a different profile. Other clients has a job level 8, and we say, well, based on our data, we see that 8 minus 2 also flies, so maybe we can advise you to change your profile a bit. Once we have that discussion and we finish that discussion, we shoot that profile into our database, and hopefully, we get matches. So that's how we are equipping our people today. Data and people, we think that's a winning combination.</p><p>Large clients, very much at the enterprise -- Rebecca will, of course, talk way more about it, so I will not -- I will make that one short. But the question we're posing to the client first is, how do you organize work? What do you mean, contingent? No, work. If you're a company, you employ thousands of people. When do they do something that needs to be done? When does a contingent work? Worker needs to do a work where a firm worker, a freelancer, can you put work on the platform? And by the way, what about the fitness of your current workforce. Are they fit for the future for the next 3 to 5 years in your automation? Yesterday, we visited a big financial party, and they're only hiring IT personnel. They're not hiring financial personnel. So they are in a totally different ballgame, and it's worrying for them. On the one hand, they need to shed people, on the other hand, they need to hire people. That's complicated, but again, enterprise.</p><p>The most important and revolutionary thing as I mentioned is what we're going to do around candidates. Let's talk data first. Everybody does -- contacts Randstad physically through a website looking for work. We probably match around 30%, 3-0. Another 20% then get matched immediately after. The job is over and we have another job waiting. But then the contact is lost forever. We never had the technological means to stay in contact with that, of course historically, massive amount of people.</p><p>What we're doing now is we are creating with several small tech, bigger tech companies 2 sort of instances. The first one is a recommendation engine, you might call that a search engine, so that a consultant very actively, with the most mobile selection tools, can go into the database. But the most revolutionary one we think is the conversation engine. So the conversation engine is a program tool that reaches out to people. It's tech, but it feels like touch. It's a web-set conversation. \"Here, Mark, we now see you've been working as a financial analyst for 3 years in the city. And we do know that people like you are then interested in what's out there. Here are a few profiles, people like you, and what they're currently doing in the marketplace. If you find that interesting, I got a few questions for you.\" So you get updated questions, any training you've done, any wishes you have in a different job, anything you don't like in your current job. And then we also ask you like, \"Are there any specific companies that you want to look for? If you want to prolong this conversation, here's the calendar of the consultant nearest you who can then continue the conversation and see if he can give you a next step in the labor market.\"</p><p>In general, people are uncertain. People are uncertain now with Asian labor market. They know as a gut feel that their employer won't take care of them for the rest of their working life. And sometimes they're not happy in the job. And sometimes they have a long commute and they want to change it, but they don't know how to handle that. We will then reach out, and we will be reachable of course for people in our database. So that's what we're trying to build, which again is data, tech and people throughout every market we're in.</p><p>Sorry. So I'm now on Slide 5. For the people on the webcast, I've not been on any slides yet. I just told you the story of our strategy.</p><p>Slide 5. Our core values, they are roughly 45 years old, very much applicable today. Most of our workforce at Randstad is a millennial and they're purpose-driven. They want to make a difference, and their values are alive every after work. Our mission is shaping the world of work. The labor market is inherently mismatched, both from a legal point of view and increasingly from a capabilities and demand point of view. And we have an ambition to shape that world of work. That mission is roughly 15 years old.</p><p>Our purpose is probably 2, 3 years old, supporting people and organization and realizing their true potential. The locals in the job, we have maybe something better for you.</p><p>And our positioning is Human Forward, and I'll elaborate a little bit more on that one.</p><p>I'll move to Slide 6. On the bottom, we are future-proofing Randstad. We think, as an executive board, we need to create a company. We're going to be 60 years old next year, as you know. It's viable for the next 50. So definitely long-term value for all stakeholders, although we don't operate from a stakeholder perspective, we operate from a -- from a stakeholder perspective, not just a shareholder perspective.</p><p>Growth leader, consistently above market. We have outperformed many markets, but actually we think it's not good enough. We want to grow faster over time.</p><p>Superior valuation. I'll show you what that means a little bit later. And of course, a strong focus on the return on invested capital.</p><p>Human Forward, left part of the slide. We make promises. We launched this 2 years ago, and we make promises to our stakeholders: transparency, guidance and proactivity. We're a services business and services is inherently invisible. Our candidates, our clients don't know what we're doing on their behalf, and that's why they're always a bit worried. But for example, in our Youplan offering, the client has real-time insight every day in its planning. So he knows if everybody is there and is going to show up for the shift on Monday morning. That gives them ease of mind. For candidates, we want to see -- or want to show them where they are in the job search.</p><p>Transparency: You know what Randstad is doing for you.</p><p>Guidance, very much in the enterprise story, guiding the clients on their, what we call, total talent journey. But also the candidates, if you don't have a job, you're unhappy in your job, you're looking for a different job. And we see massive changes in the work space. We're taking bankers to education. We're taking people from retail into health care. That is happening, and that should be happening in the future of the labor market.</p><p>And proactivity, the sales goal from Randstad in the not-too-distant future is going to be, \"Dear customer, our data tells us you will be needing this profile 3 months from now.\" \"Oh no, I don't know.\" \"Well, we've analyzed your patterns. We think it's going to happen. And the good news is our data also tells us we have 2 people that fit the profile that are eligible to start with you within those 3 months.\" Do that once, do that twice, you're set for life.</p><p>Our winning capabilities, and I will not go through all of that, but very much what we bring to our 38,000 employees, equipping them to be winning in the labor market.</p><p>And lastly our strategic priorities, but I have those on the next slide, so I'll take you to Slide 10. Embed the digital transformation. Maybe, and I hope so, the story I just told you sounds good, to only contact customers at the right moment in time, to only engage with candidates when they are looking for a job. But the change for our consultants is actually quite big. First of all, we sort of bring them to customers and prospects that you don't turn in one conversation. They work with competition. It takes time. So we go from a more transactional sales to a longer-term 3- to 5-conversation sale. That's due for our consultants. For the candidates, again, we are historically as a company, as a sector by the way, order-driven. We go out, we go to a company. We -- they have -- they need -- they're searching for someone. We find a candidate, we make the match. And what I just described, because often we'll have many candidates in our calendar or his calendar, that there's something better for me, but that might not be an open job order. So they need to go into sales with the candidate in mind which, again, is a different way of selling. So this takes time. And that's why we say tech is easy, change is hard to really embed. And that's not a technical term, it's more of a cultural term, a way of working term, and that's the digital transformation.</p><p>Build a stronger one Randstad. Our top 100 management spent the last half year with London business school. Actually here, on a specifically defined course: \"Randstad Strategy, Academia from a London Business School, How to Compete in a Digitally -- in a Digital World.\" Because for everybody at Randstad, certainly management, things are changing. We have global businesses, you need to lead digital processes. But at the same time, we're becoming more global, so we're going to build a stronger One Randstad to sort of take out costs, which is not very valuable at the front-end, buying because we're just bigger, sharing IT resources. George asked me, \"Okay. What's the value of you bringing all our database to the cloud?\" Well, that is setting up a more global company, and Henry is going to shed a little bit more light on what we mean by that. But that fuels EUR 120 million that we announced in our press release this morning.</p><p>Upskill and reskill our talent. We're not going to buy or build training companies. We think our value is in data. When we go into an incumbent workforce of our client, we match their skills. So we create a data passport and employability scan of all those people. What are they good at? What are they doing? What are they trained for? What are their hobbies? It's a pretty rich image. And then we match that to the labor market. This is very much what comes out of our outplacement practice. We know what people need to go to stay relevant in the workplace, and we either run those programs with our clients or we run those programs through a training ecosystem. There's a lot of training companies out there, both online and physical. Last year, we trained 300,000 people with an average of probably 10 to 15 hours a person, so very much the last-mile training. And we think that will be a massively bigger amount.</p><p>Accelerating the career coaching and Statement of Work. So career coaching is clearer. It is helping you to take the next step in your career. Statement of Work is a big space. Statement of Work for many of our clients is actually a bigger space than contingent workers. And within Statement of Work, there is a lot of complicated projects, which we're not going to touch, but also less complicated projects where we analyze them, we think there's the leverage into making it more of a staffing outsourcing part and, again, very much in our enterprise space.</p><p>Largest talent engine. Why did we buy Monster 5 years ago? Indeed, it's a scraper. So indeed, without a lot of own traffic sort of free, sent to people in the U.K. and U.S., people like us, companies like us, use our traffic for free. And everybody liked it, but of course there's no free lunch. And the other Monday, Indeed came to us, and our competition has said, \"As of tomorrow, it's not going to be free anymore.\"</p><p>In our Japanese business, we paid quite a lot to job boards. So we found 5 years ago that it's quite dangerous to be dependent on a third party for your traffic. So that is the main reason why we bought Monster, to have a digitally-enabled extra source of profiles, and at the same time of course, power our own website. In many European countries, the Dutch, the Belgium and the Spanish, the Randstad website is actually the one with the most traffic, but it doesn't have the business models to transform that into ready-made candidates. So that's why we bought Monster. Again, Monster helps us in enterprise to show the client what the relevant labor market data is all about. And of course, Rebecca will shed a little bit more light.</p><p>So effectively, if you go from everything I've just mentioned, it finds its way into enterprise. It finds its way into big clients, which is probably 30%, 40% of the world market in staffing and professionals in perm today.</p><p>Grow faster in North America and Japan. If you look at our major 10, 12 countries, there are a few differences. Our Dutch business, 26% market share; Belgium business, 26% market share; German business, around 10%, so lots of possibilities there. But North America and Japan, North America by far the biggest market out there, as big as the top -- the next 3 combined, with great returns, with great profitability. We are the #2 with 3.5% market share. Japan, second market in the world, great returns mostly because pricing is good, but also length of assignment is huge, so you can get high productivity and therefore good results. 1.5% market share, we're probably the #6 in that market.</p><p>What we're going to do in the future is reposition more, first, organic money, people, investments into those markets. First, because there's lots of room to grow. Second, because every euro of revenue, all out of those markets, is more profitable than group average.</p><p>Why now, you might ask. Well, first of all, our North American team has come a long way. Our staffing team has always outperformed the market, so that's good. But now also our biggest IT business has done well. It's actually [NGP] in the second quarter above market. So that is fertile ground to put investments in.</p><p>In Japan, yes, we're getting -- Japan is a -- yes, sort of Japanese market. It is what it is. It has its own dynamics. But also now there, we've got a great team, we've got good performance. So we think, again, there, fertile ground to put in more calories as Henry would call it.</p><p>Repositioning our Innovation Fund. We -- our Innovation Fund has always been managed on the funnel, so the clients, the candidates, all the steps in between. We said to our Innovation Fund, why don't you go find us startups and sort of disintermediate us, enrich our offering, but very close to the core of our business. When I mentioned earlier that we want to create this environment for people to be secure in a gig work, in a gig world, we think we need to reposition our Innovation Fund, this is Slide 11, around what we call the wheel of working life. On the top end you will see people searching for a job, then they're looking for opportunities, information, certain processes, which kind of skills do I need and what kind of career support I get. So you go from HR tech to ed tech, again not going into education ourselves, but creating an accessible ecosystem of education for our people. And if you're in a job, of course your finance needs to be taken care of. In many countries in Europe, if you're not on a fixed job, nothing's accessible to you at decent cost, health care, mortgages, pension fund. We do -- we think that needs to change. In some markets that is 15% to 20% of the workforce. We can and need to play a role there. Out of the 20%, 25% in a workforce that is flexible, our sector represents 15%, but it's a very well-regulated form. So we think penetration can go up, but that's still also a bit of a legal thing. But we think there will be bounce back, pushback from society towards the gig economy that just sends our people with no backdrop, with no security, with no support system.</p><p>Health tech and then work tech, so very much onboarding. Yesterday again, these clients are onboarding thousands of people that can be done way more systematically.</p><p>Again, creating an ecosystem. It's so exciting. We're going to -- we currently have 20 investments in Innovation Fund. We're going to enrich it towards a richer work-life ecosystem.</p><p>So back to slide -- it's now Slide 12 actually, back to 10. We think, at the end of the day, everything we're going to do here and the amount of people we're touching will lead to enriching our brand. This is very much work in progress. We are currently on a quest to see what building a brand in a digital society will mean. But we want to become a top 100 brand. There's only 5 or 6 services brands in the top 100 brand worldwide.</p><p>Going to 13. I've been in this business for 31 years, still excited about it every day, almost every day, but we never brought anything to the table that nobody had. Good people, good branches, good brand, good work and process, it's all great. The closest thing, and certainly people like you who had followed us for a long time, the only thing and the closest thing we have to something that nobody else has is Inhouse. So Inhouse is this very tangible or intangible step-up that we have in knowing clients, in referencing, in our workforce consultants. And it's the gift that keeps on giving, but it's the only thing we really have that sets us apart. We think only data will create a new environment in our services.</p><p>So we are currently, as you know, on the left-hand side, at 8 to 10x earnings. Big tech is 25x and up. We think over time, we can move to a different valuation multiple, but it's for us to prove what data and ownership of data brings, so very much something we're aspiring to.</p><p>So digital strategy, just an update, all referencing to our strategy. Driving business result, the biggest -- one of the biggest challenges for us is you put in digital, and does it have tangible results? Can you contribute growth, more GP directly to digital? Strengthen our digital foundation, certainly bringing all of our databases to the cloud, but also we need to create a data-led. What does that mean? If you want to connect the conversation engines and the recommendation engines to our data, a welder needs to be a welder everywhere. He needs to be a welder in Germany, in France, in the Netherlands, but a data has been built local. So that's quite an undertaking.</p><p>And finally, I mentioned it already, learn how to change. Learn how to work differently with the support of data.</p><p>That this is tough, that all this is tough for us is fortunate and unfortunate. It's unfortunate because it's hard work, it's heavy lifting, it takes time. But it's fortunate because nobody can come in. Our conclusion now, after 6 years of investing, looking into big tech, small tech, startups, innovating ourselves, is that nobody is going to come at 150 miles an hour from the side eating our lunch. That's not going to happen. It is a new mix of technology and what people can do. Artificial intelligence can do a lot, but not what a human can do. So artificial intelligence can recognize the picture of a cat and like 97% of the time. A 2-year-old can recognize a picture of a cat, but can also see if the cat is angry or frightened or it has good humor or not. That is the difference between a person. In our business, it's very much reading people, catching the moment, creating atmosphere. So it's all in the combination.</p><p>And then we need to -- now we need to say, okay, what does it all mean for what we build and what we buy? Our data is key. Our data will always be ours in any partnership. And our data is valuable because it shows a profile which was not up to what a client asked, but it's very successful and, therefore, we enrich data and matching people.</p><p>Matching is something we buy off the shelf. We build it with partners, but we don't own it.</p><p>The user interface is ours because the user interface is at the point of contact between the candidate and Randstad, the consultant of Randstad and the client of Randstad. That is how we communicate with our stakeholders. It's more marketing and HR than it is tech at the end of the day.</p><p>And in talent and client engagement, it's a tool we're building, but the way we engage with people is very much a comradery. So this is how we sort of make a choice between making and buying technology.</p><p>So tech as a differentiator. I've showed you this slide 2 years ago. Here you see on the vertical axis [under] 17, perm to contingent; horizontal, SME to large. So -- and the pie chart mean roughly the part of GP that is in our company. So at top right, we are defending and attacking -- no, sorry, let me take you to third -- 18 because that's -- plus sort of now, what we're doing on this graph, which is a market view -- a Randstad market view.</p><p>In workforce scheduling in Youplan, we defend in in-house by implementing tech tools. We attack the smaller clients that don't want us in-house with new tooling.</p><p>Enterprise very much is on the total right-hand side where we serve as contingent professionals and perm for large clients, data-driven sales into our basic staffing and talent engagement. So in small firm and in large professionals, talent engagement is key. You need to have access to talent because they're not going to flock to you if you're not a really, really strong employer brand. That's what we bring to the table.</p><p>Bottom left, small firm. Small firm operators bring nothing to the table. They don't own data and they produce at relatively high cost. We think we can disintermediate that space and get more share.</p><p>How we measure it. This is just a few things. There's more to it, but we just took a few elements. Data-driven sales, where we've implemented it, it leads to more visits. Workforce scheduling currently Inhouse, 15% less pool churn, using scarce temp force more effectively. Workforce scheduling already 812 in 2 years, new locations, prospects that we sort of created with this offering and turned them into clients. Our web platform, a mix of what Monster does and Randstad powering, 11% more applications, which in the current market is actually not bad because normally you would see less applications.</p><p>We talked a lot about the value-based pricing. The 30 bps in Q2 is a mix. It's a mix of mix. It's a mix of 1 day more, but it's also where we have it in countries, we see 0.5% to 1% more gross margin per match where we have implemented value-based pricing. And then finally, Customer Delight, a tool, again, data-equipped where we ask our stakeholders what they value in the service and then we mirror that behavior. So just an example, someone's very happy in the job, a candidate, we measure it, he scores us an 8. When the job ends, there's no new job, it drops to a 6. So for the consultant, it means they need to plan effectively their work so that the candidate is not surprised. In Belgium, we now have an 8 on all categories after 2 years, and then you take market share.</p><p>So rounding up. My half hour, we went from a lot of initiatives, a lot of trials, a lot of error -- errors, to strategic priorities, we know where to go. And we think we know we're going to increasingly monetize data towards clients and talents. We see a lot of buy-in in our enterprise clients that demonstrates actually a blue ocean. When we had interviews with our stakeholders on Human Forward, \"Do you think we're credible with these promises?\" Our clients said, \"Yes, well, we sort of like you. You're a reputable company.\" Candidates said, \"No. We don't really know, but actually nobody in the sector we believe.\" So candidates for us are the blue ocean to create a competitive advantage.</p><p>Digital transformation, progressing well. I didn't make that slide because I'm actually never happy. I think we're going too slow, but yes, apparently it's complicated. We need time.</p><p>And then we want to gear for accelerated organic growth. If you look 20 years back, our growth has been 50-50, M&amp;A and organic. Going forward, you will see us grow way more organic based on the data and the top 3 position we have in basically any market.</p><p>And that will lead to the right-hand side of Slide 20, where we're going to take out EUR 120 million cost. It's a strategic seminar, so we're not going to talk a lot about current trading. It's bit of a mixed bag, but it's quite stable at the moment. I'm very happy with the fact that, our pricing, our margin has increased we think for a full year, which is new. I'm very happy with that. We have revenue in October, we only have volume in November and nothing about December. But as far as we can see, some markets, Germany, more based on comparisons than just it's a bounce back, is slightly better; France is slightly better; Belgium is slightly better; Netherlands, slightly weaker; and U.S. in staffing, slightly weaker.</p><p>We want to give -- and we want to of course balance investments with cost savings, so hence our mission to protect our EBITA margin. And we think we can come out at a pre-IFRS leverage ratio of 0.7. And you then know what that means for our capital allocation policy.</p><p>And on that, Henry, take it away. Thank you.</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER, CFO &amp; MEMBER OF EXECUTIVE BOARD, RANDSTAD N.V.: Thank you so much. Right, so also good morning from my side to you here in the room, but also to everybody on the webcast. I hope the quality of the sound is well.</p><p>It's pretty much close to -- pretty much exactly 2 years ago that I was the first time in touch with you. I just had signed my contract with Randstad, and I was happily invited to be part of the Capital Markets Day as an observer, and yes, actually 2 years flying by. I wouldn't call myself now kind of a deep specialist of the market, but for sure, I've learned a lot in the past 24 months.</p><p>So what I'd like to do is actually I'm very excited to talk to you through a little bit about how we were doing in the past. We went through our strategies. It's always good to have a slightly longer view. And we've chosen very, very carefully that headline, creating capacity for competitive growth, and I'll explain why in a second.</p><p>So there's hardly any strategic presentation who should not start with the market, and I'm very much aware that you are familiar with those numbers. So you see the global staffing market in 2018 had a size of EUR 416 billion, where Randstad is occupying 6%. That in turn is 2% of the total labor markets.</p><p>Penetration is relatively stable, and what really excites us actually when you double-click on the movements underneath, so within the EUR 416 billion, there's lots of movement going on. And I will talk about it a little bit more in the next slide, but it's really important notes for you. When you look at staff, the average and everything and you'll find lots of cool insights.</p><p>So here show that actually the market had really good growth, 5% CAGR over the years 2010 to 2018. And the structural drivers, growth drivers of that market, I would say, are not just alive and kicking, they are probably as active as they've never been before. Jacques talked about the mismatch of the labor market. Those structural growth drivers like organization, technology progress, demographics change the nature of work. But also global mobility and migration are really giving lots of movements into the labor market. And wherever there's movement in labor markets, there's a job to be done for Randstad. So that's good.</p><p>We also are quite proud that we had a really good track record of growth. On the left side, I'm now on Page 24, you see our road to leadership. And I think it's fair to say that Randstad has a streak of competitiveness, right, Jacques? I think it's fair to say. So therefore there's lots of energy around that fact, but also with the right humbleness because just having 6% of the market -- nobody is declaring victory of anything. I just want to make the point here that there's lots of energy and engagement in the company. And what I as the CFO really like is Randstad has used the time over the last years to strengthen its portfolio.</p><p>So you see here, that 92% of our top line revenue in 2018 came from #1, 2 or 3 positions in the marketplace. That is more than 20 percentage points more than actually 8 years ago. And that's really relevant because that is where scale matters. As soon as you have kind of density in the marketplace, you can be really much more relevant, much more profitable for your customer base and also for your talent to engage them. And Jacques already talked about the fact that a big part of our growth is coming from the Inhouse growth. And why is that relevant? Because Inhouse -- I've been now in 8 locations believe it or not because it's -- they're all slightly different because they're different sectors, but they're all very much -- it's a repeatable model where we need to prove that we are capable of engaging with consolidated sales, that we need to be very customer-focused, we need to have a deep engagement with talent pools because we are building specific talent pools. And we just have a unbelievable customer orientation. Those people who run those Inhouse locations are actually our unsung heroes in the company. And that actually gives me lots of confidence to now put it on a much bigger footprint talking about enterprise. And Rebecca and Tania later on will talk about more about that.</p><p>So you're a group of analysts, here in the room at least, and you always want to have proof points. So let me give you a few proof points why what we did in the past worked pretty well.</p><p>On the left side, on Page 25, you see our gross profit diversification. What does it mean actually? In 2018, we could proudly report from 8 units, a gross profit delivering more than EUR 200 million. There's 2 more units in the wings, actually there is Spain and Japan, very close to EUR 200 million. So it's close to 10 units where we have a really big footprint of more than EUR 200 million gross profit delivery. That compares to 2007 where actually with 2 units, we had more than 60%. So the diversification, the resiliency we were able to build over the last couple of years has really improved.</p><p>And we've been able to turn that into leading EBITA margins. You see that on the middle from below 4% to close to 5%. And yes, we are honest that we have not been able to break into the 5% to 6% range, and we have not let go of that longer-term ambition. But we also have been able to strongly convert into absolute EBITA. You see on the right side, we've more than doubled our EBITA. We've more than doubled our free cash flow and, of course, our dividends have gone up dramatically.</p><p>Talking about cash flow. One thing is to have absolute good free cash flows, and I'll talk about more of that in the next chart, but it's really profound and remarkable that over a period of 12 years, we've been able to have very resilient cash flow in there, and nobody can say that nothing happened in those periods. I guess you would agree. And actually it's quite remarkable that we've been able to deliver that. That's such a good proof from the -- our countercyclical nature of our free cash flow.</p><p>And in 2018, we were actually proudly reporting a record free cash flow year. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist, and you also see it in the graph that we assume that we're breaking the record in 2019. Of course it's all hands on deck. So we have quarter 4 strongly delivering. The game is not over yet, so we're working until the very last day to make sure that free cash flow is coming in. Then there's time -- due time for everything. We'll talk about dividends next year with you.</p><p>But there's also -- I've experienced over close to 2 years, how many people work extremely hard to deliver their cash flow. And if any of you is in any doubt that we are not disciplined about those cash flows when it comes to allocating those, really I can reassure you that we have a very, very disciplined company, and we would be very, very reasonable and disciplined about spending those.</p><p>I reference you naturally to the capital allocation policy. I'm just standing here to just confirming that what we put in place also close to 2 years ago, I think it was probably launched at the Capital Markets Day 2 years ago, that we are fully confirming that policy. Let me rerun key features of that. So we are paying a cash dividend with a payout of 40% to 50% of adjusted net earnings. We have introduced a floor cash dividend of EUR 1.62 per share. By the way, in 2019, we paid EUR 3.38 in totality over the year 2018.</p><p>We do look into bolt-on M&amp;As. We clearly have an organic growth strategy, but we do smart M&amp;A. And what we've said and we're confirming that, that when we look into M&amp;A we are not betting the bank. We're just looking into smart additions to our portfolio. But predominantly, we believe there's lots of growth opportunity organically in our company.</p><p>And when the leverage ratio is below 1%. And our prior statement, we've seen that we will be around 0.7 for the year. There is [opportunity to invest] in cash returns to shareholders either by way of special cash dividend or share buybacks. Both of that will be decided next year.</p><p>So just to finish that part of our presentation. There's a headline on Page 28, attractive shareholder returns. In 2018, we were happy to declare a dividend yield of about 8%. And as I said, in 2019, we will probably equal these returns.</p><p>So now really take a mental break, but that is all kind of more or less looking back. There's proof points that we have good momentum. I think I can say that because it's many people in the room, not the least, Jacques has done a stellar job in the last couple of years. But now what? How -- what is it actually we like to drive the company going forward?</p><p>And we've chosen the headline, creating a resilient company. And I've actually looked up what does resiliency actually really mean. When you look it up, it means \"able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions.\" And why is that really important? We, as a company, we are offering flexibility as a business model. Therefore we ourselves need to be able to build diversification of our cash flows using a global footprint. We need to flexibilize our cost base to be able to adjust in line with market conditions. And therefore I think we have the right to formulate a vision to actually -- we want to become the most resilient company in our sector.</p><p>As you see on the left part, what can you actually really do on tangible ways? It's clearly having a more active portfolio management. Jacques was alluding to the fact that we would probably try -- play a slightly more decisive hand in channeling investments to where we think we can get the best return on investment. Some people would say fish where the fish is, so therefore we will drive a more diversified geographic portfolio. We will look into a more resilient portfolio by concept. We also look into industry classes. So in line with our sector, deep sector knowledge in the Inhouse business, there is something when you build density in the industry sector that gives you clout and credibility.</p><p>And we are very excited at Randstad that we have many ideas where we want to invest. So we need to create that fuel for growth, and we definitely believe into creating -- taking this [gap] our own box, and therefore we're pushing ourselves very, very hard to create that space to invest, and that is the fuel for growth part in the middle. We will engage into a more intense activity-based field steering. As I said, we will flexibilize our cost structure and freeing up trapped resources. And all of that then bearing the capability dynamically to allocate those resources into things where we get the best return.</p><p>We will balance short term and long term. So we have very much belief in, in delivering in the here and now, not just tomorrow, but we will make sure that we're finding the right balance and also creating the capacity for the future.</p><p>That brings me to the next chart on Page 30, creating a better-connected Randstad. If you will ask me -- pin me down, what is actually the winning capability of our company? It's probably to be better connected, to combining scale with speed and customer intimacy, to leveraging data to drive field productivity, create deeper talent pools, improve value propositions. But also the freeing up trapped resources, actually reducing duplication, really utilizing the power of One Randstad. Technology can help us to a great deal, and that is what we intend to do.</p><p>And hence, our confidence to declare another program worth EUR 120 million by the end of 2021. I'm very happy to go through it in the Q&amp;A, but I can also give you a proof point. The program was just concluded, 2019. When you look at our underlying profitability or underlying cost ratios, we have probably increased our productivity by 50 basis points over the last couple of years, and the EUR 120 million is probably in line with that.</p><p>But there's one big difference here. In the past, we had the help of leverage. There was good growth in our top line. Now it's clear that we want to create the same with also, in circumstances where we can't probably count on exponential growth, at least not in current market circumstances.</p><p>So we will address total cost base of EUR 3.6 billion, as I said utilizing the benefit of One Randstad. We will in general be shifting our cost paradigm. So where we -- there's lots of KPIs in our company and lots of KPIs already standing as sort of records or good practice for many, many years. We've just been brave enough now to say, let's challenge that and see who says that 2 or 3 matches per week is the right number? Why couldn't we achieve, with the help of technology, maybe a little bit more there?</p><p>That brings me to my last chart on Page 32. When you do a program like that, it's good as a company to have principles to engage. And those principles clearly, as Jacques already said, like to future-proof the company, so we will secure strategic investments top down. We're very, very clear where we need to invest to create that future growth. And then actually, we also drive profitability and free cash flow, but we will clearly need to find the right balance between the short and the long term here.</p><p>In all of that, I'm quite amazed. You said it's 45 years ago that actually our values have been created. That simultaneous promotion of interest between employees, customer and talent has been there for 45 years. And if we do that, we will serve the shareholder extremely well. So thank you very much.</p><p>Now we'll go, I think, straight to the Q&amp;A, David?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DAVID TAILLEUR: I think that's my story line. Thanks, Jacques and Henry, for your presentations. Indeed, we will now start with the Q&amp;A in the room. To be clear, please wait with posing your question until you have a microphone. And please start with your name and also a company name. I think there's the first question over here.</p><p>SUHASINI VARANASI, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Suhasini from Goldman Sachs. If you look at Slide 18, where you give a split between SME, large clients, perm, contingent workforce, how do you see that mix of revenues changing for you medium to long term as you focus on this strategy? Because when you talk about enterprise, it feels like maybe it's a bit more focused on white collar firms, is that right? Or is it across this? 18.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: I'm just putting it on, so I hear 18. Actually, we don't have a proactive strategy to change our footprint because we really don't know. So when we talk growth in the last 2 years, there was a lot of growth in the top right-hand space. There's a lot of growth through Inhouse. I would say that we are the only company in our space that's really bullish on blue collar because we have the right delivery model. So we don't really care. So organically, we don't know. So yes, our top right-hand business outgrew our top left-hand business. Well, that's actually a luxury problem to have.</p><p>In our, let's say, M&amp;A, we're trying to shift the balance a bit. So in M&amp;A, you know that. We want to buy in the statement of work space. We want to buy in the career coaching space. And we want to buy in general and the professional space. But yes, at the same time and as what Henry said, if a more, call it opportunistic M&amp;A like Obiettivo Lavoro in Italy, it was great for USG even long ago, yes. If we can step it up at some point in time, we're also going to do that.</p><p>So it's not a -- we'll see. What is important, I think, on 18 is to show you where we -- where our digital initiatives play and what we think the effect will be on the market. But the most effective, most important one being if you don't have proactive access to your own data, you're one of the many.</p><p>SUHASINI VARANASI: Can I just ask one on the general automotive sector? The first one, In Europe, I mean it has been weak obviously given all the structural issues there. But as the shift to EV happens, where would you say the demand for temp actually changes? It will fall, right? It will fall maybe 30%, 40%, 50% as this investment goes?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes. Yes, it's very much depending on also what society would do. This sounds a bit funny. But we think at Randstad, and we're lobbying very actively, is that the labor markets in Europe, in almost every country, needs to change dramatically from the fixed job or what they call irregular jobs, which a large part of that is not well regulated jobs, to work. It's sufficient that people need to work, and then they need to have accessibility to insurances, mortgages, pensions. They do in our sector. We are actually the only sector where people, very well regulated, can do gig work. So for us, it will only go up. At the same time, I'm not being naive here, as populist governments and all sorts of easy statements with no solutions in basically any country, but there's much more happening behind the scenes. We're lobbying a lot and we do get the feeling that our story is gathering weight. We'll see. We'll see. Time will tell, yes?</p><p>And people need to work longer, right? People need to work until they're 68, 69. People want to work on sort of amalgamated job types. It's also with young people work. So we're pretty well positioned there. Marc?</p><p>MARC ZWARTSENBURG, HEAD OF BENELUX EQUITY RESEARCH, ING GROEP N.V., RESEARCH DIVISION: Marc Zwartsenburg, ING. Jacques and Henry, you mentioned you want to grow faster in Japan and the U.S. Jacques, can you give us a bit more detail which segments you're looking at? What type of business? But also, is it purely organic or bolt-ons? And maybe Henry, what type of investments are needed to drive that growth? How aggressive will you be? Will it be at the cost of a bit of margin? Will there be CapEx involved? Can you maybe give a bit more numbers?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Let me do the first one. And then you addressed Henry, so who am I to then say.</p><p>So it is in the pockets where we believe we're strong. So it's more front-end people in the Staffing business, it's a good track record. We do see a lot of traction also in the workforce Inhouse space in the U.S. I mentioned I think in my call on Q3 that 80% of the record amount of new Inhouse sites that we have in the U.S., 80% said they do it because of our tech supporting our already strong process. In our RT business, our RT, Randstad technology business is a Staffing business and it's a Statement of Work business. So organically, certainly in the Staffing part, we -- you might see us again do M&amp;A to strengthen that space. So that's a bit of a mix. And on numbers and that sort of thing, Henry?</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: Yes, I will, I will -- I'll not give you too many numbers, but more a principle. What happened in the past, naturally when you drive for a result in a year or something like that, there was pretty much sort of an allocation to all companies to contribute to a -- to an overall number. And it's clearly the case to be made there. Dynamics we have in the U.S. market, the strength of the team, but also the margin profile we see that I think we can give more investment as allocated to the U.S. because that will improve the mix. It might well be that the margin will go slightly down in the U.S. but overall actually there will be positive mix effect. So it will hopefully pay for itself. Good news is we don't need to make a decision of, say, there's a boatload of money and good, but we can kind of feel and ease into that and say, \"hey, that works. [Die down, die down] to that.\"</p><p>So it's more the principle of securing that investment to accelerate the growth. And hopefully then if we're standing here in 2, 4, 6 years, we can say our portfolio has shifted from X to Y.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes. And that's also where the EUR 120 million plays with investments. So when we talk about freeing up money in the broad sense of the company, then the U.S. certainly is one of those places we would like to invest. So there's a bit of a time thing. We first need to get that money out and then put it into to the U.S.</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: So we actually -- we play a bigger role as an executive board to dynamically allocate resources, where in the past it was probably not as strong.</p><p>MARC ZWARTSENBURG: And are there specific regions in the U.S where you want to focus on?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: No. Not really. Of course, there are some regions where we're stronger than other regions. Karen?</p><p>KAREN L. FICHUK, MEMBER OF EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; CEO OF NORTH AMERICA BUSINESS, RANDSTAD N.V.: No, I think it's more in line of business, like you mentioned. Hi, everybody. I'm Karen Fichuk, new to the company, but I have responsibility for the U.S. and the topic.</p><p>So I think you mentioned the line of businesses. So definitely the technology sector, definitely the solutions business within technology. Canada is one, so we have expanded it to be North America. We have a very strong leadership team there who is poised for growth, given the investments. We have some nice niche businesses that we'd like to organically invest in. And then beyond the lines of business, I think digital and data competencies are also an area of investment for us to fuel the growth opportunity.</p><p>And you mentioned the RAS business. We've had a record year of wins. So that will be an area that we need to fund.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Building on strength there. So Marc, in a way, we do, for every company, we always have plans in place. And then we'll just see what markets are doing, what we can allow, at which speed we want to go. Because for us, it's the push of a button in a way. Again, we also need to balance the short and the longer term.</p><p>HANS PLUIJGERS, HEAD OF RESEARCH OF BENELUX, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hans Pluijgers, Kepler Cheuvreux, 2 questions from my side. First of all on Page 13, you are referring to, let's say, more where you want to go in the long term, how you see yourself. I can imagine also, let's say, the tech companies of course have also generally a little higher margin. So how do you see that going forward, let's say in 10 years? Do you see really that you should have a higher margin? And where does it come from? Is it more, let's say, that you see more of your sales breakdown, more in directional fee kind of business? Can you maybe elaborate, a little bit of feeling on how you see that developing?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes, Sure.</p><p>HANS PLUIJGERS: And secondly on the cost savings of EUR 120 million, you were referring to that also you can do some investments. So what part of the EUR 120 million should we consider as coming back, let's say, in the P&amp;L on the bottom line?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: So you'll take the second one? I'll take the first one. There are also a lot of tech companies that have high valuation and they make no profit. So the relationship between profit and valuation is in a lot of ways very skewed. It's almost unsexy to make profit in that valuation space. We very much feel that it should fuel faster growth. Faster growth at similar, slightly better profitability because that's also how you invest. Of course if we invest less, we grow less, we make more money. But for us, it's a balance where we are close to this 5% to 6%. We think the 5% to 6% is definitely a more, call it, positive economic surroundings. That's where we can get to. But then it's faster growth. I mentioned 2 years ago and still very much feel that that's what we're striving for. We have 6% market share globally. If -- I'm not quoting a number here, but once we get to accelerating, monetizing the data, we can probably get to 10%, most growth drivers from consolidation being the enterprise part, and probably small perm, that sort of thing. But not at a higher profitability or significantly higher. That's less of our priority going forward than accelerating growth.</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: I think you've answered already. I mean, the logic we will apply is that about 1/3 will go in building capability, about 1/3 into dynamically allocating growth momentum and 1/3 into the bottom line roughly, roughly. And that might be skewed in quarters, but that's the sort of logic we are applying. But it's all -- we all strongly believe in that the best thing for them is growth and profitable and competitive growth, those things always need to come together.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes. And the 2 other pockets apart from organic growth is investing in digital, where we think it makes sense to speed it up. And the other one is of course the top 100 brand. We do think branding is interesting. So we're spending EUR 120 million in branding now. I think we first need to take out branding cost that we think is old and doesn't really generate or support our strategy. And then we're going to invest in way more online data-driven marketing that gives direct feel and direct support to our people outside and also our candidate reach. So that's a program in place.</p><p>We hope that, that's always said if you ask someone to help you to build a strategy, there's always money involved. So that's also on the shelf. And there, we don't have a plan. In the U.S., we have a plan; in Japan, we have plan. But on marketing, that's work in progress. So we'll share that with you once we know more, probably somewhere second half next year.</p><p>ANVESH AGRAWAL, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Anvesh Agrawal from Morgan Stanley. Two questions. First, just looking at your Tech &amp; Touch strategy and the mix of the business. So I presume that touch is more needed in perm and professional level rather than probably at blue collar admin-level jobs.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: And why do you think that's the case?</p><p>ANVESH AGRAWAL: Well, just probably there is more passive candidates there. And also the decisioning from the company's side is probably (inaudible) levels are higher and it's more strategic rather than filling up the shifts that you get at the lower end. So if we keep that in mind, then do you think the tech disintermediation can kind of still hit you at the blue collar? Or at the admin-level job? And how do you kind of plan to protect against that?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes. Great question. And part of what you're saying is true. So same for me, sometimes. Yes, absolutely. We use technology to engage professionals because they're in a job. And they're not going to update their resume just because we offer them a job. So call it the technology-driven conversation is a different conversation. But we use tech, certainly a lot in Youplan and workforce scheduling to have a very quick, call it, engagement. The very quick processing of blue collar people because blue collar people are all online nowadays. And in a way, they're also in a job. So yes, call them blue collar is more geared towards call it leverage, but not only. And in professionals, absolutely more about engaging. And therefore, we do feel [at along the] bottom too in enterprise, fairly fragmented professionals market, and in small perm; very fragmented, we can take share there.</p><p>ANVESH AGRAWAL: And just on the ability to leverage your data-driven capabilities and kind of implementing that scale, we can see the advantage you have probably versus the start-ups and the smaller players. But versus your global counterparts who have the same access to the database, where do you think you are positioned differently? Or what is your competitive advantage?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Of course, our database is way bigger. That's the reason why we bought Monster. We're very much connecting those databases together, where Rebecca and the team can now show all relevant data around a certain profile and group of profiles at a way bigger scale. So that's one.</p><p>The second one is that we allow all our consultants that are in the 6 to 7 markets where Monster is still a dominant player, that they look into both databases. So there, we have very much an advantage.</p><p>But let me share with you, when you talk about competition, what -- and I've come full circle. We as a company strategically have come full circle in terms of who is threatening us. So if you would have asked me 5 years ago, I would have said start-ups or big tech. Now start-ups are not scaling. And big tech does something in our space, but they stay on the outskirts. Google is about search, but it's not about selection. It's not about induction. It's not about -- if you look at our funnel and you know the picture, they stay on the outside. So you need to play with them. You need to know SEO. You need to know how they work, because otherwise you'll be lost. They're more a playing field than as a competitor. But the biggest competitor is our client. If you look at the most mature market, which is the U.S., certainly old style MSP programs and Rebecca will, of course, allude to it. When you have the old MSP model, which is just putting in an off-the-shelf commoditized EMS tool, and then squeezing margins in competition, that's not going to work anymore. So we knew that 5, 6 years ago. But those clients, they spend -- if they have 200 million spend on the management and they give suppliers, whatever, 30 million to handle that, you say, \"So what can we do with 30 million?\" for them, technology is also commoditized. So that's why we have way richer approaches now. But yes, the real big, big animals with great employer brands, why outsource? That's the biggest threat for us. And that's why also, we want to show you enterprise and what we're doing because we do feel we're attractive for a large group of those.</p><p>GEORGE NICHOLAS GREGORY, RESEARCH ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's George Gregory from Exane BNP Paribas. Just one please, and it's on the candidate pool, specifically Monster. You talk about future-proofing your business. What is actually happening to the size and quality of your candidate pool? And to what extent does the trend -- the revenue trend, within Monster drive that? Can you improve, grow that candidate pool without -- despite, I suppose, the trend, the continued downward trend in Monster?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes. So the quality of the candidate pool, if you have a phone number or an e-mail address, people are accessible. So that's not the issue, both in the Monster historic database and the Randstad historic database. So we are running constantly trials to see if we can still reach these people. And you can technically reach almost all of these people, but that's not the issue. The issue is, can you engage them to come back? Can you engage them in having a conversation on where they are in the marketplace right now and if they want to engage with us anymore again? And the more people are, call it, comfortable in the marketplace, the tougher that is, so to say.</p><p>So hence, what are we doing? And of course, you need to have a lot of new people coming in all the time. So hence, the investments we're doing, both in Monster and Randstad because it's probably important that we, in the first 2 years of owning Monster, we try to revive the old job board positioning. And a little over a year ago, with Rebecca also taking the reins, we now see Monster way more as a concept within the total Randstad. What does that mean? We're investing in mobile so that people leave their applications. You have a lot of traffic on Monster, but relatively we think we can improve the apply starts, as we call them. In an old job board model, an apply start would then be something that you sell to a job boarding client. And a job boarding client is actually a client that does recruiting himself. So the Indeeds and the Monsters of this world, they are aiming at the full chart that Henry just showed.</p><p>We are in a different segment, so to say. We operate for the clients that work with us and want to know the best candidates in there. But then we need to fuel -- this is tens of millions of people, still, because although Monster of course, it has been a struggling business for years even before we owned it. But it's still the second most popular brand in the U.S. But what you see is that they attract mostly the 30-plus historically. So now our marketing investments, we call it the sexiness of the mobile engagement, needs to be fueled towards young people to make it relevant. But the offer is not going to be for Monster or for Randstad. \"Come with us and someone might call you,\" because that's an old model job board. In future is going to be \"Come with us, become part of our universe, and we'll support you throughout your whole working life.\" That's a different way of working. By the way, a lot of, call it, value out of Monster is being generated within Randstad. Funny enough, we cannot really value that. We don't know really when someone has come from the Monster database or the Randstad database. This will increase over time, but we don't know yet.</p><p>Another investment we're doing in Monster is e-commerce. So Monster still had a lot of people selling physically into small clients. At Randstad years ago, we segmented that out. We don't visit small clients. So we're now putting in an e-commerce platform that these companies can buy that online and that we can shift our salespeople towards richer clients. So a lot of work. But yes, the value of that also historic database, both in Randstad and Monster, is very much alive. But we need to work on it.</p><p>GEORGE NICHOLAS GREGORY: Is there any correlation between Monster revenues and the, I guess, it's difficult to measure the quality of the candidate pool, but I suppose what I'm trying to get to is, do you think that the quality of that candidate pool is ultimately still declining, and you've yet to hit that inflection point where it's starting to grow in value?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: It's very tough to talk about the quality of the candidate pool because it all depends on how do you define quality. So we see a lot of clients by the way, in general when we analyze their recruitment process, even if they work with Monster or Indeed or LinkedIn. They spend a lot of time connecting with people. So the old job board model that also Monster had is invest in marketing, get massive amounts of people and then I'm going to sell it to you, which is basically the model of a newspaper. So the basic model of a job board is a newspaper model. I got this newspaper, it's read by so many people, you put in an ad, many people read it, the chance is high. But in my company, we think the whole talent play is way more sophisticated nowadays. Monster was late to go to pay per click, pay per candidate. So it's not that Monster's success, if you have 500 million people in the database with a very -- limited profile, we want to get to richer. So we need to get back to them with this conversation I just mentioned. Like \"George, we've not been in touch for 8 years. It's great that I can still know where you are. Can we take this forward?\" So quality, we think in general, our quality is going to be way better. It's way more than our peers. It's way less than a LinkedIn or an Indeed, but it's a different way of looking at the world.</p><p>RAJESH KUMAR, ANALYST, HSBC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Rajesh Kumar from HSBC. Just on Slide 24, you've shown very interestingly that the Inhouse revenue CAGR has been almost 3x that of rest of the business. What impact has it had on your margins?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes, that's the good news there. So Inhouse is low-margin business but the highest conversion. And so our overall conversion from gross margin into EBITA group level is 27% roughly; and Inhouse is about 40%. So it comes in at group average, although at a lower margin. So it has not diluted our profitability EBITA percentage, if that's the background of your question.</p><p>RAJESH KUMAR: Low gross margin, but higher conversion margin?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes. Yes.</p><p>RAJESH KUMAR: But overall margin is broadly similar?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes, group average, yes. Anywhere between 4.5% and 5%.</p><p>RAJESH KUMAR: And in terms of end market, you mentioned there's some potential sequential stabilization. Are you seeing that a bit more in the Inhouse customers or in the...</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: What you see in negative growth, so for example in Germany, that's a lot of Inhouse. Automotive, first tier, second tier, third tier, that's all Inhouse. So they are -- sometimes they've got hundreds of people less. So there's good news and bad news. So the good news in Germany is we effectively -- because we're doing a lot of things also, we effectively still open customers. We have Youplan customers. But yes, if some client says, we're going to be 300 people less, which we saw last year, yes, that has a bit of a damper, so to say. So most of the negative growth comes from the European automotive, but also partly in the U.S. And just last month, because these clients use us, if it's uncertain for them, they just use a little bit less people. So that's -- yes.</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: We've really looked in and we've tried to put numbers on it. We've looked into big data sets. We looked at customer retention and looked into cohorts. So what kind of new customers are coming in, in the quarter, and we tracked them over their lifespan. So coming over from a mindset of cost of acquisition and then lifetime return, and the cost of acquisition was lifetime return is the highest in Inhouse by far. That is why you can actually sustain lower gross margins. And it's the stickiness factor, I would call it, extremely high there.</p><p>RAJESH KUMAR: And the candidate pools are entirely different?</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: The candidate pools are really dedicated to that location. So there is somebody in that Inhouse who is making sure that there is, I don't know, of the pool of 120 people, 15 of them only work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday morning, especially in e-commerce driven businesses where you have that order come in on a Sunday of loading trucks and then replenishment of inventory. And then you go through a Wednesday, Thursday at times. And customers we're engaging with, and those customers, they easily pay -- happily pay our margin in it because we drive so much productivity in that location. And you're not being easily fired out of that because you need to acquire really deep knowledge of that location of how to add value. And that's, I love that stuff.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Actually that's the key point between us and competition. We're the only company that, with Inhouse, creates based on our workforce consultancy, a dedicated pool. Everybody else have branches. And then the in-house is somewhere in the middle of the branches. And then they attract people through the branches to the client. But that's not how we should build the pool. And now we support it with that technology, self-planning tools. So the threshold to change actually goes up a lot.</p><p>RAJESH KUMAR: Just when I listen to you speak about all your strategy, a lot of the discussion is around the candidate sourcing.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Yes.</p><p>RAJESH KUMAR: Nowhere I saw a slide which shows this is our end market exposure by industry, by high [reader] sectors, low reader sectors, which you've talked over the years. But we've never had any color around that in terms of what type of customers you're exposed to. Why is that?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Well, I actually disagree because in our material, there's always a bit what we do in sectors, that sort of thing. First of all, we're top 3 in many markets. So if the labor market is a pyramid, we're basically everywhere. And in every segment where we are leading, we are leading, so to say. Inhouse very much originated into blue collar warehousing, that sort of thing. But we now have it in white collar, we see it in -- we have Inhouse for professionals. So the model of having a workforce with a limited set of profiles on one location, we don't really care. What we historically saw is that blue collar had to compete in a global market with low margins years ago. We now see banks, insurance companies, even government sometimes, they need to also compete in a global environment. So the need to have this concept is actually increasing. We are basically in every sector.</p><p>At the same time of course, we know that life sciences -- you can also talk about that. If a company is decentrally governed, it doesn't make sense to do an enterprise deal. And that has nothing to do with the sector, although you do see some similarities, life science is way more globally mandated. So that's why the profit pools for us are also hinged towards how -- which people are most open to our services, almost.</p><p>KONRAD ZOMER, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, ABN AMRO BANK N.V., RESEARCH DIVISION: Konrad Zomer, ABN AMRO. Two questions, please. First one on, you've shown us the last 8 years in these slides. And it's quite obvious that over that time period, you have not been able to gain a lot of market share on a top line basis. You indicate 5% CAGR for the market, 5% of CAGR for yourself. You've done a lot of things, but you're now focusing more on value over volume. You've come up with another ambitious cost savings target. So why would I not be thinking you might actually enter a phase where you might lose market share instead of win market share?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: I think our growth is higher than the 5% CAGR by the way, but...</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: Yes, it's pretty much in line with we were able to kind of build quality of portfolio without losing share. We're roughly, roughly in line with the 5% CAGR in our growth.</p><p>KONRAD ZOMER: Yes. Well, it is what you indicated on Slide 24, so that's why I took the 5%. But you're going to be focused more on the free cash flow, the dividend. You talk about, for example, you talk about refocusing of the marketing expenses. If you have the ambition to become a global top 100 company, you might be forced to spend a lot more on marketing, and not a lot less. So I get the impression that you might not be focused as much on market share in the next 8 years as you might have been in the last 8 years. And if that's the case, then it's going to be very difficult to win market share because that's not something that just comes by chance.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: We're of course always disappointed. We always want to grow faster. But -- and I mentioned it earlier in another question. So digital for us will fuel faster growth. Enterprise, and you'll see it later after the break, will fuel faster growth. Data-driven sales, faster growth. So we want -- our first and foremost is faster growth. But what we also want to -- if you look at our share price, right, it has gone up and down 50% this year. That has nothing to do with our company. So at the same time, we want to say that even in adverse top line, then you might still relatively outperform, even with negative growth. We are a stable company also for shareholders. So it is both. But we totally agree with you that if we don't increase our growth base relative to market, then strategically you get an issue over time.</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: Can I just add? I mean that's a very personal statement. So we always have 4 Gs in my head. So it starts -- it's the 4 growth. So the most important for me is competitive growth. If we're losing share, we're losing relevance then nothing has any value. So you might believe that we are losing positions where we want to have positions. You're seeing that we were driving strength of portfolio. I'd much rather build 1 and 2 positions in countries to build density where scale counts and let go of some fringe business, say. But the quality of the growth -- so it's competitive growth, priority #1; profitable growth; then reliable growth. Because I mean of all people, you're running your spreadsheets. You want to be able to make reliable forecasts on our cash flow capabilities. And the fourth one is sustainable growth. There's also -- it's very important for engagement of our workforce, and why we're getting out of bed in the first place.</p><p>So don't get into your mind that we are not -- that we will sacrifice competitive growth, not a nanosecond. We do believe and we are confident that where we are shifting the portfolio to, that we are hunting into waters where there is more fish, therefore capitalizing on that, but also building on our own unique capability and -- especially in enterprise but also many, many other places.</p><p>And what's new for me coming into that industry, it's actually very fragmented. 6% of the total and you're calling yourself as world-leading, it's not a zero-sum game. So I can totally see that actually with capabilities needed into the future, you need to be able to have very, very strong enterprises set up. Very, very good tech stack data capabilities. And I've been now in a few pitches with the enterprise group, and I'm just a student to learn. What I learned in there, whilst our industry started out to just serve flexibility, that extra say 15%, 20% of an automotive supplier to go up and down, we don't know how the model will sell. So we don't want to commit to too many fixed people. Now there's more and more companies, I was involved in pitches, who use flexibility and speed as business model, and they are engaging with us on a strategic level to helping them to be successful. And that is actually where the margin is. It's where the growth is and the stickiness is. And that is a -- that is not a reactive transactional stuffer. That is actually Inhouse on steroids, if you ask me. It's where growth is coming from. But that requires us building capabilities, tech capabilities, data capabilities. And it requires us hunting as one, One Randstad.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: So in a way, if 5 years from now we will not have massively grown but we still earn a lot of money, something went wrong with our data strategy.</p><p>KONRAD ZOMER: Yes. Just another quick financial question. You've had 2 special dividends. When you start to link the leverage ratio to your additional cash return to shareholders, you mainly talked about special dividends. And maybe because you, Henry, joined 2 years ago, you're now slowly shifting towards also mentioning share buybacks. Am I right in thinking that, that might become your preferred way of returning this cash to shareholders? And if so, does your large shareholder have an opinion on that? Or is that relevant to you?</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: Look, I will not talk about that other than -- and you've never -- you can go to all talks I had. We always keep our options open to decide when it's time, when the free cash flow has been generated to make an appropriate choice. So don't read any preference from my part in any of those. And it might be, we do one this year and another one in the other year. So we want to really keep our flexibility there. What we do have, we are committed to the policy itself, and that's really, really important.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Usually for our shareholders, \"Yes, what will we do with all the dividend?\"</p><p>DAVID TAILLEUR: We're done?</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: Final one.</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: Most of the time, the most tricky one.</p><p>EMIRA SAGAAMA, ANALYST, ODDO BHF CORPORATE &amp; MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'm Emira from ODDO BHF. Just a follow-up question on the cost, around the ambition to flexivize the cost. Could you give us some examples of initiatives you have in mind on how your EUR 120 million program will help on that part?</p><p>HENRY R. SCHIRMER: Yes. So it's really -- I don't want to go into too much detail because it's a -- I mean, there's probably up to 20 initiatives at least which come to my mind. Just think about that we look into everything from a zero-waste perspective. So take attrition of personnel. How do we drive down attrition? How can we bring people when we onboard them faster to productivity? How can -- what is the cost of an invoice in the U.S.? What's the cost of an invoice of an external competitor in the U.S.? What's cost of an invoice of U.S. versus a cost of an invoice in Netherlands? What's the cost of finance we're spending? How do we procure stuff? Do we -- how can we ruthlessly automate our activities where we think we can do things much more efficiently. So all of that, we're going through and applying.</p><p>First of all, we are very clear on the company what to do with the money. So it's not like, \"yes, for higher dividends, we would be happy. We all would be happy.\" That's not the point. We have to have higher growth, and the company is very much engaged. And since the point of \"let's operate slightly differently\", I'll give you one data point. There's probably something -- it might be a bit dangerous, I'll look at David. We're spending about EUR 500 million IT roughly, roughly, right? But that IT spend, frankly, is not done in a most productive way. We'll probably go to a country manager at the moment and ask him or her, \"What's your budget? Can we get a number?\" and then say, \"So how do you spend it?\" And they would say that the biggest part of that is probably being spent to keep the lights on. And then there is a little bit left for NAV. That's really the most productive way in today's world to create? Should we not create global assets or at least regional assets or assets that have bigger bang for buck where that EUR 1 investment is going a longer way.</p><p>That is what we do, but that is not just a technical part where you look into cost sheets, but it's also a cultural part where you need to -- this is what we say, we need to connect the company in a more profound way to speed that up and that's what we're doing.</p><p>JACQUES VAN DEN BROEK: That's also why I mentioned that we took all our top 100 management through a 6-month quite intense course on how to compete in a digitally-led, more global company. So the mindset has changed. So that's good. And we're trying to harvest that mindset going forward.</p><p>DAVID TAILLEUR: Thanks, both. If there's no final questions, we end the webcast, and we want to thank all participants listening in, concluding the webcast also. And for the room, we have a quick break of about 15 minutes, and we return in, yes, in 15 minutes to see Rebecca and Tania on stage. Looking forward to do so.

The Nasdaq slipped into correction territory Monday after it closed 10% off its May 3 peak.</p><p>Powell is scheduled to speak at 9:55 a.m. ET, at the Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools and Communication Practices held by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank. The  in the U.S. for Tuesday also includes Factory Orders for April at 10 a.m. ET.</p><p><br/>2. -- Big FAANG Stocks in the Government's Crosshairs <br/></p><p>U.S. tech stocks led the Nasdaq's slide into correction territory on Monday as lawmakers geared up for what could be a lengthy probe into the biggest and most influential companies in the sector amid reports of a looming antitrust challenge from the Department of Justice.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee unveiled a sweeping \"top-to-bottom' review of tech companies late Monday, the first such probe by Congress, following reports of a dual effort from the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission to tackle the perceived dominance and potential abuses of tech giants such as Apple  , Facebook  , Alphabet  and Amazon.com  .</p><p>Without naming specific companies or their services, the legislative body said a small number of \"dominant, unregulated platforms\" hold great power over commerce, communication, and information sharing over the internet. It cited investigative reporting and oversight by international agencies that have revealed concerns about whether these companies are rewarded for, and have the means to, harm competition.</p><p>The investigation would include hearings by the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law on the \"rise of market power online,\" said the committee, adding it would conduct a \"top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.\"</p><p>\"The growth of monopoly power across our economy is one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today,\" said Democratic Rep.

The company also showed off a new Mac Pro, announced that the version of iOS powering iPads will now be known as iPadOS and disclosed plans to break up iTunes.</p><p>Apple said it plans to split up the bloated iTunes program into dedicated media apps for the next version of its Mac operating system, known as Catalina.</p><p>The move is meant to streamline Apple's consumer media services and have its desktop programs more closely resemble those of its mobile apps. iTunes will be split into separate Music, Podcasts and TV apps, each of which already have individual apps in iOS.</p><p>Apple engineering chief Craig Federighi said the \"future of iTunes is not one app, but three.\"</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>4. -- Salesforce, Tiffany and GameStop Report Earnings  <br/></p><p>Earnings reports are expected Tuesday from Salesforce.com  , Ambarella  , Guidewire Software  , Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  , GameStop  , Tiffany  , Lands' End  , HealthEquity  and Navistar International  .</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Salesforce is a </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">holding in Jim Cramer's </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

Poole, a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, said it's \"ideal\" if the market is \"not surprised\" when the Fed raises rates. At the Boston Fed's conference, the generally hawkish Fed president also said the U.S. is \"more likely to have an inflation problem than people would have guessed six months ago.\" (Where have you gone, Alice Rivlin? The nation's bond bulls turn their lonely eyes to you. Woo hoo hoo. Hey hey hey.)\u00a0</p><p>In reaction, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32 to 89 21/32, its yield rising to 6.00% for the first time since May 11, 1998.\u00a0</p><p>Even before bonds went south, equity gauges were struggling due largely to weakness in technology bellwethers and airlines. The former suffered after Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette trimmed fourth-quarter earning estimates on a six-pack of industry leaders, and the latter after US Airways (U:NYSE) warned of a profit shortfall.\u00a0</p><p>The combination of the aforementioned sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling as low as 10,724.17 before closing off 143.74, or 1.3%, to 10,765.64.\u00a0</p><p>Components IBM (IBM:NYSE) and Hewlett-Packard (HWP:NYSE) were on DLJ's hit list and among the biggest drags on the index. Other names sapping the Dow's strength included Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ:NYSE), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG:NYSE) and DuPont (DD:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 17.19, or 1.3%, to 1317.33 as index components Dell (DELL:Nasdaq), EMC (EMC:NYSE), Sun Microsystems (SUNW:Nasdaq) and Compaq (CPQ:NYSE) were also marked down by DLJ. Each slid at between 2.6% and 4.9%, leading the Morgan Stanley High-Tech 35 down 2.9%.\u00a0</p><p>Not surprisingly, the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 49.65, or 2%, to 2474.56 as Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq), MCIWorldCom (WCOM:Nasdaq), and Intel (INTC:Nasdaq) joined the DLJ-demoted tech giants on the downside. The Nasdaq 100 shed 3.1%.\u00a0</p><p>Internet favorites such as Yahoo! (YHOO:Nasdaq) also suffered, sending TheStreet.com Internet Sector index down 16.32, or 2.8%, to 569.55.\u00a0</p><p>However, Infoseek (SEEK:Nasdaq) soared 14.9% on word Disney (DIS:NYSE) will seek to acquire the 57% of the company it does not already own. Also, Net IPOs DrKoop.com (KOOP:Nasdaq) and BackWeb (BWEB:Nasdaq) had stellar opening sessions, rising 81.9% and 64%, respectively.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, airline stocks, which so notably shook-off the ill-effects of UAL's (UAL:NYSE) profit warning yesterday, couldn't overcome a red flag from US Airways. The American Stock Exchange Airline Index fell 3.1% and the Dow Jones Transportation Average lost 56.58, or 1.6%, to 3425.38.\u00a0</p><p>\"I'm not reading too much into it,\" Ned Collins, executive VP of U.S. stocks at Daiwa SecuritiesAmerica, said of today's decline, noting the Dow remains only about 3% from its all-time high. \"I don't think it's the end of the parade or beginning of the end. Volume has dried up a little and it looks more like a lack of bids vs. aggressive sellers.\"\u00a0</p><p>Trading volumes improved from yesterday's dismal showing, but still demonstrated about as much spunk as a Carnegie Deli waitress on the last shift when the AC has given out and all the (lean) pastrami is gone.\u00a0</p><p>In New York Stock Exchange trading, 686 million shares were traded while declining stocks led advancers 1,789 to 1,132. In Nasdaq Stock Market activity, 851.6 million shares were exchanged while losers led 2,245 to 1,648. New 52-week highs led new lows 70 to 43 in Big Board activity and by 87 to 43 in over-the-counter trading.\u00a0</p><p>\"I still think there's a chance for a summer rally but second-quarter earnings are much more important than what the Fed does,\" Collins said of the topic du jour. \"Bonds have a 25-basis-point, if not 50, increase built in and stocks have a good portion of that. Maybe if the Fed does nothing it's a bigger disappointment.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>It's just a trading range (whoa, ho, ho)<br/>It's not the real thing (whoa, ho, ho, ho)\u00a0</p><p>\"I think there still are some people that will be surprised, but consensus is shifting toward the reality the Fed will raise rates,\" Ronny Kraft, CEO of Gotham Capital Management, said of Poole's comments and the market's reaction. \"The question is what type of body language is associated. The only way the market gets smacked is if the Fed does a number of hikes or gives out body language it has an inclination to do so. I think it would be very inappropriate and unlikely the market would pull in on any significant level on one interest-rate hike.\"\u00a0</p><p>The analysis is interesting because Kraft (among others) has been suggesting for some time equity markets are due for a major tumble.\u00a0</p><p>\"I don't think this is the big one,\" the hedge fund manager said. \"The market has another leg up. The problem with reading the market right now is there's very little volume but it's higher on distribution days than accumulation days. We're in the summer and we'll be subject to these whipsaws. When you have volume pulled out you have volatility and markets do a lot of weird things.\"\u00a0</p><p>Kraft does think a big unrest in the stock market is forthcoming -- due most likely to a burgeoning trade deficit and ultimate repatriation by foreigners holding dollars. However, the time is not at hand.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're calling for range-bound movement for next month and a half,\" he said, projecting the S&amp;P 500 will remain bound between roughly 1280 and 1370.\u00a0</p><p>Among other indices, the Russell 2000 fell 2.89, or 0.6%, to 443.76; the Dow Jones Utility Average fell 0.90, or 0.3%, to 332.37; and the American Stock Exchange Composite Index dipped 5.23, or 0.7%, to 772.92.\u00a0</p><p>Elsewhere in North American equities, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 fell 73.08, or 1%, to 6937.67 and the Mexican Stock Exchange IPC Index rose 6.94, or 0.1%, to 5428.88.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Report: CNN Won't Have Dobbs to Kick Around Anymore\u00a0</p><p>UPDATE (8:20 p.m. EDT) -- After this story originally ran, CNN reportedly confirmed that Lou Dobbs has resigned to join news and entertainment startup Space.com effective Friday.\u00a0</p><p>CNNfn President Lou Dobbs will resign from the network after butting heads with CNN U.S. President Rick Kaplan, Dow Jones reported. The wire service cited \"people at the cable network.\"\u00a0</p><p>The long-simmering feud between Dobbs, host of CNN's \"Moneyline,\" and Kaplan went loudly public May 20, when Kaplan ordered the network to switch to coverage of a speech by President Clinton during Dobbs' show and Dobbs resisted. \"CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton,\" Dobbs told viewers in finally relenting.\u00a0</p><p>Dobbs, like Kaplan, is a member of Time Warner (TWX:NYSE) unit CNN's executive committee, and he has chafed at having to report to Kaplan. Dow Jones' initial report was silent on Dobbs' plans.\u00a0</p><p>Naturally, Wall Street's rumor mill was churning this evening about what Dobbs will do next, even as sources at CNN report that a meeting purportedly scheduled to announce his resignation has been postponed twice.\u00a0</p><p>\"He's just sitting in his office waiting for a call from Ted,\" one television insider quipped, referring to CNN founder, sailing billionaire and Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner. But the source, a veteran of the industry, speculated \"nothing\" is going to happen tonight, although Dobbs is not hosting \"Moneyline\" this evening (meaning the graphics folks at CNN can scrap the \"with Lou Dobbs\" part of the title).\u00a0</p><p>One rumor has Dobbs heading up his own Internet company, and cases of champagne reportedly were chilling outside his office. The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition reported that Dobbs is said to be planning an investment in Space.com, which thus far is a one-page Web site featuring a John F. Kennedy quote and a teaser line.\u00a0</p><p>However, the thought is \"ridiculous,\" one Wall Street player said. \"A legitimate journalist leaving to run an Internet company would signal the top of the market.\" (Of course, many a legitimate journalist would beg to differ.)\u00a0</p><p>The source speculated it would make more sense for Dobbs to go to CNBC, perhaps to replace Tyler Mathison as Maria Bartiromo's co-host on the never-lived-up-to-the-hype \"Business Center\" program.\u00a0</p><p>But TV insiders say the notoriously prickly Dobbs would never share the spotlight with anyone. If he were going to CNBC it'd be for something much bigger than a mere on-air job, they said.\u00a0</p><p>-- Aaron L. Task and John J. Edwards III<br/>\u00a0<br/>Tuesday's Company Report\u00a0</p><p>By Heather Moore<br/>Staff Reporter\u00a0</p><p>(Earnings estimates from First Call; new highs and lows on a closing basis unless otherwise specified. Earnings reported on a diluted basis unless otherwise specified.)\u00a0</p><p>As noted above, Infoseek stormed up 6 5/16, or 14.9%, to 48 5/8 after Disney last night said it's in talks to buy the rest of the company, possibly in exchange for an Internet tracking stock. Disney, which has a 43% stake in Infoseek, lost 1 1/4 to 29 5/8. (TheStreet.com had a look at why it's still not quite a world of laughter for Disney shareholders in a piece this afternoon.)\u00a0</p><p>DrKoop.com, an online health-care company named after C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, rocketed 7 3/8, or 81.9%, to 16 7/16 with 26.6 million shares traded after the stock's 9.38 million-share IPO priced at $9 a share last night.

The decision comes after several meetings[1] between Zuckerberg and French President Emmanuel Macron, who wants to take a leading role globally on the regulation of hate speech. </p><p>France's minister for digital affairs Cedric O, one of Macron's advisers, has been an influential person directing Macron's thinking on big tech issues. 'This is huge news, it means that the judicial process will be able to run normally,' O told Reuters. 'It's really very important, they're only doing it for France.'(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Facebook previously refused to provide such identification data because the Silicon Valley company was worried countries without an independent judiciary could abuse it. It was also not required to fork over data under U.S.-French legal conventions. The company has been under intense pressure[2] to crack down on misinformation. Some are hailing the move, calling it a decision that could have implications across the industry. 'It is a strong signal in terms of regulation,' Sonia Cisse, a counsel at law firm Linklaters, told reporters Tuesday. 'Hate speech is no longer considered part of freedom of speech, it's now on the same level as terrorism.' The decision comes at an awkward moment for government officials and the company. Facebook has increasingly come under fire for being lax with the private data of its users, especially after lawmakers opened an investigation of the company's decision [3]to provide data to Cambridge Analytica before the 2016 presidential election. The company disclosed to investors in April that company officials are putting $3 billion aside in the event the Federal Trade Commission fines them for their role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. They have not reached a settlement with the FTC. The fine could be as high as $5 billion.(Article Continues Below Advertisement)  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I thank Banque de France for the opportunity to share my thoughts at this Lecture.  Both France and Singapore are mature economies, enjoying a high per capita income but reaching the limits of growth through increases in factor inputs.      If we are to continue growing and enrich the lives of our citizens, it must be through innovation.     And if we are to spread the benefits of growth, innovation must be pervasive and not the exclusive preserve of the talented or well-endowed. </p><p> Innovation is not a zero-sum game.  It thrives on diversity, collaboration, and openness.      There is much we can learn from each other.     France and Singapore have been deepening collaboration in areas such as finance, science, and technology.     2018 was designated as the France-Singapore Year of Innovation.  Today, I want to focus on innovation in financial services.  Globally, the financial industry is facing slower economic growth, tighter regulation, and keener competition.      To overcome these headwinds and contribute to the broader economy, the industry needs to harness technology, foster innovation, and transform itself.     But how to do this, while maintaining the single most important commodity that underpins financial institutions - trust.  As Stephen Covey said: \"Strength lies in differences, not in similarities\". This principle is embodied in the French novel \"The Three Musketeers\" by Alexandre Dumas.      Set in the 17th century, the novel recounts the journey of D'Artagnan, who left for Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard, and how he overcomes all adversities.     Together with him are three musketeers with contrasting personalities:         Athos who is intelligent;         Porthos who is adventurous; and         Aramis who is true and faithful.     But together they form a well-balanced trio that supports D'Artagnan on his journey.  The three musketeers today are Finance, Technology, and Trust, corresponding to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.  Society is D'Artagnan.      Can the three modern musketeers work together to support Society?     Can they complement one another?  Can they click?  Finance - the Astute Musketeer Losing Appeal  Let me introduce the first musketeer - Finance.  Like Athos, Finance is wise but can be complicated, and to some extent, mysterious and non-accessible to many people.  As a result, Finance - at least in its traditional form - is losing its appeal.      Consumers find that banks' processes are too cumbersome to navigate.     They are increasingly looking to technology firms for their needs.     Some of them are even losing trust in the ability of banks to act in their interest.  Bill Gates once said: \"People need banking, not banks\".  It is a reminder that, to survive, Finance needs to be intuitive, innovative and customer-centric. Technology - the Musketeer who can Transform Finance  This is where the second musketeer - Technology - comes in.  Technology is akin to Porthos, the fearless musketeer who is eager to try new ways for a better future.  In a similar vein, Technology presents us opportunities to revitalise Finance:      the opportunity to enhance customer experience;     the opportunity to strengthen risk management; and     the opportunity to improve cost efficiency.  Let me elaborate on each of these opportunities.  First, enhancing customer experience.  This has become a critical success factor in many industries, including finance.  Why?  Basically, technology firms have reshaped the way businesses interact with customers.      They have empowered customers and set higher bars for customer satisfaction.     Whether they are established Big Tech firms or small FinTech start-ups, they pose a competitive challenge to financial institutions.  If I have to name one thing these technology firms do very well, much better than financial institutions, it would be that they are obsessively customer-centric.  Tech firms embed themselves in the customer journey and use data analytics to deeply understand customer needs.      They then provide end-to-end solutions, often customised to individual circumstances.     They have agile IT systems, efficient processes, and a culture that emphasises speed.     Essentially, tech firms think of themselves not as being in a particular industry, but as platforms, upon which they provide access to the services their customers need.  Traditional banks tend to be largely product-centric.      The credit card division tries to sell you unsecured credit, the wealth management division tries to sell you mutual funds, the lending division tries to sell you a mortgage.     They start with the product and try to persuade the customer why their product is good for him.     Many banks do not have a complete picture of their customers.     They are weighed down by legacy IT systems and bureaucratic processes.  But several banks are stepping up to the challenge.  Athos is learning from Porthos.      Banks are investing heavily in technology to optimise their operations and enhance their systems.     They are collaborating with technology firms to accelerate the pace of innovation.     They are becoming more customer-centric.  These banks are using technology to provide customised solutions, complete solutions, and seamless solutions.  First, customised solutions to suit the individual needs and characteristics of the customer.  Some banks are experimenting with personalised products and services, not just based on what the customer asks for but by anticipating what the customer might need.      Commonwealth Bank of Australia's mobile app is using behavioural science to provide customers with financial management advice based on their spending patterns and financial goals.  Some banks are offering personalised interactions at every customer touchpoint.      Royal Bank of Canada has enabled its customers to pay their bills on the mobile app via speech and voice recognition.  Second, complete solutions that are based on the total picture of the customer.  Today's customers are more sophisticated and want holistic solutions.      In a survey of 10,000 tech-savvy customers, Accenture found that 80% of them want integrated solutions that address both their financial and non-financial needs.     Financial needs are really driven by non-financial desires. People do not desire a housing loan or a fire insurance policy.  People desire a house.  To provide complete, holistic solutions, you need comprehensive customer data and you need a deep understanding of the customer journey.  The customer data that most banks have are simply not sufficient to develop a good understanding of the financial situation or needs of their customers.      Customers have multiple relationships, with deposits and loans, investments, insurance policies, and retirement plans, spread across many financial institutions.     How many financial institutions advising a customer have a complete picture of the customer's balance sheet - all his assets and liabilities?  Some banks have started to offer aggregator services which consolidate financial information such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and investments from all the financial institutions serving their customers.      This allows financial institutions to provide holistic financial planning.     BBVA provides its corporate customers with a consolidated view of all their financial information from about 90 financial institutions.  Next, understanding the customer journey.  Some banks have begun to offer their corporate customers complete, end-to-end solutions, based on a keen understanding of their customers' work processes.      United Overseas Bank in Singapore provides its corporate customers an integrated digital platform that enables the customer to:         generate purchase orders and invoices with a few clicks;         streamline its payroll process; and         get up-to-date views of its financials.      Some banks are positioning themselves as partners with their customers on their life journey, integrating their financial and non-financial needs.      DBS Bank in Singapore provides its customers looking to buy a car an online portal that enables them to calculate their budget, find an affordable car, connect with the seller, get a car loan, and finally purchase a car insurance.  Third, banks are using technology to provide seamless solutions.  This means resolving bottlenecks and providing customers with a frictionless experience.  This means using technology to resolve bottlenecks in processes to provide customers with a frictionless experience.      Banks such as BBVA, Mitsubishi UFJ, and BNP Paribas are using blockchain technology for syndicated loans.     It improves efficiency.           Each step of the loan process, from credit underwriting to credit administration, is documented in the distributed ledger, thereby eliminating the need for duplicative back office processing.         The loan process is shortened from about two weeks to two days.     It also improves trust.         Every record in the distributed ledger has a user code and time stamp.         This creates an audit trail, leading to higher level of trust among the participants.  Let me share two initiatives from the Singapore financial sector, which show that achieving a seamless customer experience often requires collaboration across institutions and inter-operability across systems.  The two key ingredients for a digital transaction are identity authentication and secure payments.  The Singapore government worked closely with the industry to make the customer experience seamless in these two areas.  First, seamless identity authentication through MyInfo.      MyInfo is a government digital service that enables Singapore residents to authorise third-parties to access their personal data residing across different government agencies through APIs.     This means that, with the consent of the customer, banks can use the MyInfo service for more efficient KYC using government-verified personal data.  I can now open a bank account or obtain a credit card - online and instantly - when I give consent to my bank to access my data through MyInfo.      Customers do not need to go through the tedious process of filling up forms and providing hardcopy documents to banks for verification.  And they certainly don't need to go to the bank branch.     Banks benefit from higher productivity and better risk management.  Second, secure and seamless payments through PayNow.      PayNow was jointly developed by MAS and the banking industry.     It enables individuals and businesses to transfer funds using just the personal ID number or mobile phone number or unique entity number of their recipients.     It operates 24-by-7 and funds can be transferred directly from one bank account to another in real-time.     I can now send money to my friend in just three clicks on my smart phone - all I need to know is his mobile number.  Business users of PayNow can generate a QR code containing their unique entity number.      This means I can now pay my utilities provider, telephone company, or plumber by simply scanning their QR code using my smart phone and keying in the amount to be transferred.  Let me now move on to the second way in which Technology can benefit Finance - strengthening risk management.  Risk management and compliance have become major cost drivers in financial institutions since the global financial crisis.      Processes have become slower and more cumbersome.     The answer does not lie in lowering regulatory requirements or risk management standards.  We know from 2008 what that can lead to.     Instead, financial institutions should harness technology to make risk management and compliance more efficient and effective.  Technology can improve the efficiency of risk management.      JP Morgan is using machine learning to review loan contracts.  This reduces the review time from 360,000 man-hours to seconds.  It also minimises human errors.     OCBC Bank in Singapore is using machine learning to monitor customer transactions real-time and across multiple channels.  This allows the bank to identify fraudulent fund transfers and take more timely actions to recover the funds.  Technology can make risk management less passive and more predictive by harnessing the informational value of data.      Ping An Insurance has developed a system that detects whether a banking customer is lying about the reason for borrowing money.         It is based on subtle changes in customers' facial expressions, with the analytical algorithm based on 30,000 videos of real lending cases.         According to Ping An, this has helped to reduce credit losses by 60%.     Blackrock and Rhodium are using data analytics to assess the risks of climate change to assets such as mortgage backed securities under different scenarios.  We have not tapped on the full potential of new technologies.      Research by IBM has found that quantum computing algorithms can compute the risk of an investment portfolio near real-time.     This is a significant reduction from the present Monte Carlo simulation approach which can take days.  The third big opportunity that Technology offers Finance is improving cost-efficiency.  This is particularly relevant for banks - saddled with the high costs of maintaining extensive branch networks and deterred from entering new markets or reaching underserved segments of the population because the cost of setting up branches is too high.  Technology is changing this in two ways.  First, the use of digital platforms to quickly and cheaply acquire customers.      The ubiquity of the Internet combined with the proliferation of the smart phone has helped to slash the cost of acquiring a customer.     According to research by Oliver Wyman, it costs about $30 to acquire an online banking customer compared to $150 using offline channels.     Basically, the smart phone is replacing the bank branch.  Non-bank players have led the way in digital banking.  In the UK, we have seen a proliferation of so-called \"neo-banks\" - basically non-bank start-ups who have obtained licenses to do banking business without physical branches.      Starling has opened 520,000 personal accounts since getting a banking license in 2016.     Monzo has opened 1.6 million accounts, adding 30,000 each week.         Monzo's customers can connect their accounts to 600 different apps and services, and create rules to integrate banking into their daily lives.         For example, users can create a rule that automatically logs calories to the health app on their mobile phone whenever they purchase coffee.  But banks can also play the same game, and more of them are doing it.  DBS Bank from Singapore launched a \"digi-bank\" in India two years ago and has already garnered 2.5 million customers.      Digibank is using artificial intelligence to learn customers' spending habits and will prompt them if they are overspending, or provide relevant marketing offers such as coffee vouchers for a caffeine-lover.     Maybe we should combine the DBS Bank app and the Monzo app to achieve a more balanced intake of coffee!  United Overseas Bank from Singapore has just launched in Thailand a digital-only bank TMRW (pronounced \"tomorrow\") aimed at millennials.      It comes complete with an \"engagement lab\" using behavioural insights to study customer's banking habits and needs.     TMRW's mobile app features a game designed to encourage their customers to save more.  In Hong Kong, the regulator has given out licenses to 8 virtual banks to acquire and deliver banking services through the Internet.      The take-up numbers are interesting; they indicate the competition emerging in the space of digital banking.     Out of the 8 virtual banks, 5 are non-banks but 3 are backed by banks.  But the second and potentially more powerful way in which technology is helping to drive down the cost of financial intermediation is through partnerships between financial institutions and FinTech firms.      Soc-G\u00e9n is working with TagPay to provide mobile banking in Africa through a cloud-based platform that is compatible with any mobile phone.     AXA is working with MicroEnsure to offer simple and affordable insurance products to customers across Asia and Africa.  By helping to reduce customer acquisition costs, these collaborations have helped to serve a larger social purpose - enhancing financial inclusion and expanding opportunity.  But there is a lot more we need to do.      There are about 1.7 billion adults globally who are unbanked.     In the ten ASEAN countries of Southeast Asia, half the adult population is unbanked.     This is a shame.  The ASEAN countries have a burgeoning middle class and increasingly modern infrastructure, yet so many do not have access to a bank account, secure and affordable payments, or insurance protection.     Banks and insurers face high costs in reaching out to customers in remote areas.  We need to take collaboration between financial institutions and FinTech firms to a much broader level - through platforms for innovation and inclusion.  This is why the MAS, the ASEAN Bankers Association, and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation have teamed up to establish the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network, or AFIN in short.  AFIN aims to bring banks and FinTech firms from across the world to develop innovative solutions to penetrate hard-to-reach markets in a cost efficient way.      Last year, AFIN launched the API eXchange - the world's first cross-border, open architecture platform to enhance financial inclusion.     The API eXchange is a cloud-based platform that does two things:         It is a marketplace, enabling financial institutions to discover and connect with FinTech partners through APIs on a globally curated platform.         It also provides a sandbox environment for financial institutions and FinTech firms to design and test cross-border solutions.  I have spoken so far of how the two musketeers - Finance and Technology - can and must come together to bring value and convenience to customers.  But for consumers to be part of this ecosystem, there needs to be Trust - the third musketeer. Trust - the Musketeer who Binds Consumers to Finance  Trust is similar to Aramis, the third musketeer who is faithful and values friendship.  Trust is a key attribute for the success of a financial ecosystem.      It is a shared responsibility among all the actors in the ecosystem.     Banks in particular must be trustworthy so that customers have faith that their money and data are safe with them.  As Finance adopts more Technology, it must pay close attention to three risks, so as to maintain the Trust of consumers.  First, cyber risk.  As more financial services move online and collaboration among banks and technology companies becomes more pervasive, a growing risk that financial institutions are facing is in cyber space.      The frequency, scale, and complexity of cyber-attacks are mounting.     Attackers can carry out sophisticated and prolonged attacks that can be difficult to identify and defend against.     According to a study by FireEye, the median time it takes to detect a cyber intrusion is 78 days.  We need some common risk management standards in cyber defence.      The risk management systems in financial institutions and regulatory and supervisory frameworks for cyber resilience are uneven and still evolving.     There is no international equivalent of the Basel Capital Accord in cyber risk management.     But given the clear and present danger that cyber risk poses, MAS has put in place a mix of mandatory requirements and best practice guidelines in this area.  Given their role as repositories of public monies and conduits for payments, banks in particular must meet higher cyber security standards.  MAS expects banks to:      limit unscheduled system downtime of their critical IT systems to not more than 4 hours within a year;     conduct due diligence on third-party service providers' controls to safeguard customer information; and     report all significant cyber incidents to MAS within one hour.  But cyber risk management should go beyond banks.      The connectedness among participants in the financial system means that a cyber-attack on one party can potentially escalate into a more systemic problem.     We need to level up the cyber resilience of all financial institutions, not necessarily to the level of banks but at least to a basic level - what we call cyber hygiene.     Research has shown that the majority of cyber incidents can be avoided if some simple cyber hygiene practices are adopted.  MAS will soon issue a set of mandatory requirements on cyber hygiene that will apply to all financial institutions in Singapore.  They include basic things like:      securing administrative accounts;     controlling network access at the perimeter;     installing security patches promptly;     installing anti-virus software on their systems; and     implementing multi-factor authentication for users who access confidential information over the Internet.  In short, if we don't get cyber security right, financial institutions will be constrained in how much they can leverage on technology.  The second area financial institutions must address to ensure customer confidence is information security risk.  Information security is not the same as cyber security.      Information security is focused on protecting data, while cyber security is focused on protecting systems.     They are however closely related.     Data leaks can occur when a system is not properly secured.  In the financial ecosystem, information security risk is growing for two key reasons:      One, more data are becoming digitised.         The International Data Corporation has estimated that digital data will increase fivefold from 2018 to 2025.     Two, as banks begin to collaborate with FinTech and BigTech players, customer data that was traditionally within the inner sanctum of banks will increasingly be shared with third party service providers.  Banks have to exercise care for the data they hold, as well as those that they have shared with third parties. This means:      understanding at a granular level the data that are held, processed or shared;     assessing the criticality and sensitivity of all data sets;     putting in place targeted measures to safeguard data; and     taking swift recovery measures in the event of a data breach.  Besides their personal health data, people regard their personal financial data as most sensitive.  Financial institutions have a particular responsibility to safeguard this data.  The third area to watch closely is risk from the misuse of data analytics and artificial intelligence.  Data analytics and artificial intelligence can help to uncover patterns which we are unaware of and to provide insights that we could not have gained from traditional analytical tools.  But unless there is public trust that data analytics and artificial intelligence will be used responsibly, financial institutions will not get the social license they need to apply these technologies widely.  To gain this trust, we must address four areas in data analytics and artificial intelligence:      Privacy of data.  How do we safeguard the confidentiality of personal data?     Explainability of results. How do we minimise the \"black box\" syndrome?     Accountability for decisions.  How can we hold humans ultimately responsible for decisions made by self-learning machines?     Acceptability of outcomes.  How do we minimise unconscious bias, social exclusion, and ethically unacceptable consequences?  MAS has co-created with the financial industry in Singapore a set of preliminary principles to guide the responsible use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in financial services.      The Principles are centred on four pillars - fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency.  Hence, the short-hand name FEAT Principles.     They are not prescriptive but represent an industry consensus that individual financial institutions take reference from when formulating their own data governance policies and practices.     We believe that the FEAT Principles will help to promote public confidence and trust in the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in our financial sector.  Conclusion  Let me conclude.  Technology and Finance must come together.  And they must do so in a manner that maintains Trust.  Finance, Technology and Trust are like the three musketeers of old.      Like Athos, Finance allocates resources to those who need it.     Like Porthos, Technology represents the aspiration for Finance to innovate.     Like Aramis, Trust engenders confidence in Finance.  The motto of the three musketeers is: \"Tous pour un, Un pour tous\" - \"One for all, All for one\".        If Finance, Technology, and Trust can do the same, we can have innovation and dynamism with safety and stability.     We can benefit not only the financial industry, but society at large.     We can raise productivity, expand opportunity, and enrich the lives of our people. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN1025249020190515</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W41-5N01-DXCW-D38M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4243\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 15, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Because the US and China are now rival powers in a number of domains, they are in \"conflicts\" or \"wars\" in these domains, so we will be looking at where these stand. Because for the most part what we will be looking at are just new versions of old and classic conflicts (e.g., new technologies in a classic technology war, new weapons in a classic military war, etc.), we will be looking at them in the context of what has happened repeatedly in history and with the timeless and universal principles we learned from studying these cases. While I will be looking at the range of possibilities that one might consider, I will be doing that without getting into what the future might look like. I will do that in \"The Future,\" the concluding chapter of this book. In this chapter I will also be moving a bit more from just conveying facts to sharing opinions (i.e., sharing my uncertain conjectures). (Note: We have reordered the chapter numbers in this series, making what was originally the appendix to Chapter 2 its own chapter. As a result, this chapter, which is the next installment after the September 11 Observations \"Chapter 5: The Big Cycle of China and Its Currency,\" is numbered Chapter 7.) As with my other chapters if you want to quickly read this chapter you can read just that which is in bold and if you want to read just the principles, you can read that which is in italics. I will start by passing along three principles of mine about relationships that pertain to all relationships\u2014between people, between organizations, etc.\u2014including the US-China relationship. Like any of my other principles you can take them or leave them as you like. They are just what I have observed to be true and have worked for me. Feel free to skip them if you're not interested.  My main principle about relationships that I think is relevant to the US-China relationship is:  Both parties in a relationship can choose whether they will have a win-win cooperative-competitive relationship or a lose-lose mutually threatening relationship, though it takes both of them to agree on what type of relationship they will have. If they choose to have a primarily win-win cooperative-competitive relationship they will take into consideration what is really important to the other and try to give it to them in exchange for them reciprocating. In that type of win-win relationship, they can have tough negotiations done with respect and consideration, competing like two friendly merchants at a bazaar or two friendly teams at the Olympics. If they chose to have a lose-lose mutually threatening relationship they will primarily think about how they can hurt the other in the hope of forcing the other into a position of fear in order to get what they want. In that type of lose-lose relationship they will have more destructive wars than productive exchanges. History has shown that small wars can get beyond anyone's control and turn into big wars that are much worse than even the leaders who chose this path imagined so that virtually all parties wish that they chose the first path. Either side can force the second path on the other while it takes both sides to follow the first path. In the back of the minds of all parties, regardless of which path they choose, should be their relative powers. In the first case, the parties should realize what the other could force on them and appreciate the quality of the exchange without getting too pushy, while in the second case, the parties should realize that power will be defined by the relative abilities to endure pain as much as the relative abilities to inflict it. When it isn't clear exactly how much power either side has to reward and punish the other, the first path is the safer way because there is great uncertainty around how each side can hurt the other. On the other hand, the second path will certainly make clear which party is dominant and which one will have to be submissive after the hell of war is over. That brings me to my main power principle.  My main principle about power is:  Have power, respect power, and use power wisely. Having power is good because power will win out over agreements, rules, and laws all the time. That's because, when push comes to shove, those who have the power either to enforce their interpretation of the rules and laws or to overturn the rules and laws will get what they want. The sequence of using power is as follows. When there are disagreements, the parties disagreeing will first try to resolve them without going to rules/laws by trying to agree on what to do by themselves. If that doesn't work, they will try using the agreements/rules/laws that they agreed to abide by. If that doesn't work, those who want to get what they want more than they respect the rules will resort to using their power. When one party resorts to using its power and the other side in the dispute isn't sufficiently intimidated to knuckle under, there will be a war. A war is the testing of relative power. Wars can be all-out or they can be contained; in either case they will be whatever is required to determine who gets what. A war will typically establish one side's supremacy and will be followed by a peace because nobody wants to fight the clearly most powerful entity until that entity is no longer clearly the most powerful. At that time, this dynamic will begin again. It is important to respect power because it's not smart to fight a war that one is going to lose; it is preferable to negotiate the best settlement possible (that is unless one wants to be a martyr, which is usually for stupid ego reasons rather than for sensible strategic reasons). It is also important to use power wisely. Using power wisely doesn't necessarily mean forcing others to give you what you want\u2014i.e., bullying them. It includes recognizing that generosity and trust are powerful forces for producing win-win relationships, which are fabulously more rewarding than lose-lose relationships. In other words, it is often the case that using one's \"hard powers\" is not the best path and that using one's \"soft powers\" is preferable.[1][1] If one is in a lose-lose relationship, one has to get out of it one way or another, preferably through separation though possibly through war. To handle one's power wisely, it's usually best not to show it because it will usually lead others to feel threatened and build their counter-threatening powers, which will lead to a mutually threatening relationship. Power is usually best handled like a hidden knife that can be brought out in the event of a fight. But there are some times that, when push comes to shove, showing one's power and threatening to use it is most effective for improving one's negotiating position and preventing a fight. It is valuable to know what matters to the other party most and least, especially what they will and won't fight for and how they will fight. That is best discovered by looking at the types of relationships they have had and the ways they used power in the past, by imagining what they are going after, and by testing them through trial and error. Sometimes mutual testing leads to tit-for-tat escalations that dangerously put both parties in the difficult position of having to choose between fighting and being caught bluffing. Escalating tit-for-tat wars often take conflicts beyond where either side would logically want them to go. Knowing where the balance of power lies\u2014i.e., knowing who would gain and lose what in the event of a fight\u2014should always be kept in mind because it is essentially the equilibrium level that parties keep in the back of their minds when considering what a \"fair\" resolution of a dispute is\u2014like thinking about what results a court fight would lead to when considering what the terms of a negotiated agreement should be. Though it is generally desirable to have power, it is also desirable to not have powers that one doesn't need. That is because maintaining power consumes resources, most importantly your time and your money. With power comes the burden of responsibilities. While most people think that having lots of power is best, I have often been struck by how happy less powerful people can be relative to more powerful people. When thinking about how to use power wisely, it's also important to think about when to reach an agreement and when to fight. To do that, it is important to imagine how one's power will change over time. It is desirable to use one's power to negotiate an agreement, enforce an agreement, or fight a war when one's power is greatest. That means that it pays to fight early if one's relative power is declining and fight later if it's rising. Of course there are also times that wars are logical and necessary to keep or get what one needs. That brings me to my main principle about war.  My main principle about war is:  When two competing entities have comparable powers that include the power to destroy the other, the risks of a war to the death are high unless both parties have extremely high trust that they won't be unacceptably harmed or killed by the other. Imagine that you are dealing with someone who can either cooperate with you or kill you and that you can either cooperate with them or kill them, and neither of you can be certain what the other will do. What would you do? Even though the best thing for you and your opponent to do is cooperate, the logical thing for each of you to do is to kill the other before being killed by the other. That is because survival is of paramount importance and you don't know if they will kill you, though you do know that it is in their interest to kill you before you kill them. In game theory being in this position is called the \"prisoner's dilemma.\" It is why establishing mutually assured protections against existential harms that the opponents can inflict on each other is necessary to avoid deadly wars. Establishing exchanges of benefits and dependencies that would be intolerable to lose further reinforces good relations. Because a) most wars occur when it isn't clear which side is most powerful so the outcomes are uncertain, b) the costs of wars are enormous, and c) losing wars is ruinous, they are extremely dangerous and must only be entered into if there is confidence that you will not have unacceptable losses, so you must think hard about what you will really fight to the death for.  While I am primarily focusing on US-China relations in this chapter, the game we and global policy makers are playing is like a multidimensional chess game that requires each player to consider the many positions and possible moves of a number of key players (i.e., countries) that are also playing the game, with each of these players having a wide range of considerations (economic, political, military, etc.) that they have to weigh to make their moves well. For example, the relevant other players that are now in this multidimensional game include Russia, Japan, India, other Asian countries, Australia, and European countries, and all of them have many considerations and constituents that will determine their moves. From playing the game I play\u2014i.e., global macro investing\u2014I know how complicated it is to simultaneously consider all that is relevant in order to make winning decisions. I also know that what I do is not as complicated as what those in the seats of power do and I know that I don't have access to information that is as good as what they have, so it would be arrogant for me to think I know better than they do about what's going on and how to best handle it. For those reasons I am offering my views with humility. With that equivocation I will tell you how I see the US-China relationship and the world setting in light of these wars, and I will be brutally honest.  The Positions the Americans and Chinese Are In As I see it, destiny and the Big Cycle manifestations of it have put these two countries and their leaders in the positions they are now in. They led the United States to go through its mutually reinforcing Big Cycles of successes, which led to excesses that led to weakening in a number of areas. Similarly they led China to go through its Big Cycle declines, which led to intolerably bad conditions that led to revolutionary changes and to the mutually reinforcing upswings that it is now in.  For example, destiny and the big debt cycle led the US to find itself now in the late-cycle phase of the long-term debt cycle in which it has too much debt and needs to rapidly produce much more debt, which it can't service with hard currency so it has to monetize its debt in the classic late-cycle way of printing money to fund the government's deficits. Ironically and classically being in this bad position is the consequence of the United States' successes that led to these excesses. For example, it is because of the United States' great global successes that the US dollar became the world's dominant reserve currency, which allowed Americans to borrow excessively from the rest of the world (including from China) which put the US in the tenuous position of owing other countries (including China) a lot of money and which has put these other countries in the tenuous position of holding the debt of an overly indebted country that is rapidly increasing and monetizing its debt and that pays significantly negative real interest rates to those holding it. In other words it is because of the classic reserve currency cycle that China wanted to save a lot in the world's reserve currency, which led it to lend so much to Americans who wanted to borrow so much, which has put the Chinese and Americans in this awkward big debtor-creditor relationship when these wars are going on between them.  Destiny and the way the wealth cycle works, especially under capitalism, led to the incentives and resources being put into place that led Americans to produce great advances, wealth, and eventually the large wealth gaps that are now causing conflicts, threatening the domestic order, and threatening the productivity that is required for the US to stay strong. In China it was the classic collapse of China's finances due to debt and money weaknesses, internal conflicts, and conflicts with foreign powers that led to China's Big Cycle declines at the same time that the US was ascending, and it was the extremity of these terrible conditions that produced the revolutionary changes that eventually led to the creation of incentives and market/capitalist approaches that produced China's great advances, great wealth, and the large wealth gaps that it is understandably increasingly concerned about.  Similarly destiny and the way the global power cycle works have now put the United States in the unfortunate position of having to choose between a) fighting to defend its position and its existing world order and b) retreating. For example, it is because the United States won the war in the Pacific in World War II that it, rather than any other country, will to have to choose between a) defending Taiwan\u2014a place that most Americans don't know where in the world it is and can't spell its name\u2014and b) retreating. It is because of that destiny and that global power cycle that the United States now has military bases in more than 70 countries in order to defend its world order even though it is uneconomical to do so.  History has shown that the successes of all countries depend on sustaining the strengthening forces without producing the excesses that lead to their declines. The really successful ones have been able to do that in a big way for 200-300 years. None has been able to do it forever. Thus far in this book we looked at the history of the last 500 years focusing especially on the rise and decline cycles of the Dutch, British, and American reserve currency empires and the last 1,400 years of China's dynasties, which has brought us up to the present. The goal has been to put where we are in the context of the big-picture stories that got us here and to see the cause/effect patterns of how things work so that we can put where we are into better perspective. Now we need to drop down and look at where we are in more detail, hopefully without losing sight of that big picture. As we drop down, imperceptibly small things\u2014TikTok, Huawei, Hong Kong sanctions, closing consulates, moving battleships, unprecedented monetary policies, political fights, social conflicts, and many others\u2014will start to appear much larger, and we will find ourselves in a blizzard of them that comes at us every day. Each warrants more than a chapter-long examination, which I don't intend to do here, but I will touch on the major issues.  History has taught us that there are five major types of wars\u20141) trade/economic wars, 2) technology wars, 3) geopolitical wars, 4) capital wars, and 5) military wars\u2014that need to be considered. While all sensible people wish that these \"wars\" weren't occurring and that cooperation was occurring in their places, we must be practical in recognizing that they exist, and we should use past cases in history and our understandings of actual developments as they are taking place to think about what is most likely to happen next and how to deal with it well. We see them transpiring in various degrees of play now. They should not be mistaken as individual conflicts but rather recognized as interrelated conflicts that are extensions of one bigger evolving conflict. In watching them transpire we need to observe and try to understand each side's strategic goals\u2014e.g., are they trying to hasten a conflict (which some Americans think is best for the US because time is on China's side because China is growing its strengths at a faster pace) or are they trying to ease the conflicts (because they believe that they would be better off if there is no war)? In order to prevent these from escalating out of control, it will be important for leaders of both countries to be clear about what the \"red lines\" and \"trip wires\" are that signal changes in the seriousness of the conflict. Let's now take a look at these wars with the lessons from history and the principles they provide in mind.  The Trade/Economic War Like all wars, the trade war can go from being a polite dispute to being life-threatening, depending on how far the combatants want to take it.  Thus far we haven't seen the US-China trade war taken very far\u2014it just includes classic tariffs and import restrictions that are reminiscent of those we have repeatedly seen in other similar periods of conflict (e.g., the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930). We have seen the trade negotiations and what they achieved reflected in a very limited Phase One Trade Agreement that is in its early stages and is being tentatively implemented. As we have seen, this \"negotiation\" was about testing each other's powers rather than looking to global laws and judges (like the World Trade Organization) to achieve fair resolution. That\u2014i.e., via tests of power\u2014is how all these wars will be fought. The big question is how far these tests of power will go and what form will they take.  Beyond the trade dispute there are three major economic criticisms the US has about China's handling of its economy. The Chinese government pursues a wide range of evolving interventionist policies and practices aimed at limiting market access for imported goods, services, and businesses, thus protecting its domestic industries by creating unfair practices. The Chinese offer significant government guidance, resources, and regulatory support to Chinese industries, most notably including policies designed to extract advanced technologies from foreign companies, particularly in sensitive sectors. The Chinese are stealing intellectual property, with some of this stealing believed to be state-sponsored and some of it believed to be outside the government's direct control.  Generally speaking the United States has responded to these things both by trying to alter what the Chinese are doing (e.g., to get them to open their markets to Americans) and by doing its own versions of these things (closing American markets to the Chinese). Americans won't admit to doing some of the things they are doing (e.g., taking intellectual property) any more than the Chinese will admit doing them because the public relations' costs of admitting to doing them are too great. When they are looking for supporters of their causes, all leaders want to appear to be the leaders of the army that is fighting for good against the evil army that is doing bad things. That is why we hear accusations from both sides that the other is doing evil things and no disclosures of the similar things that they are doing. As a principle When things are going well it is easy to keep the moral high ground. However, when the fighting gets tough, it becomes easier to justify doing that which was previously considered immoral (though rather than calling it immoral it is called moral). As the fighting becomes tougher a dichotomy emerges between the idealistic descriptions of what is being done (which is good for public relations within the country) and the practical things that are being done to win. That is because in wars leaders want to convince their constituents that \"we are good and they are evil\" because that is the most effective way to rally people's support, in some cases to the point that they are willing to kill or die for the cause. Though true, it is not easy to inspire people if a practical leader explains that \"there are no laws in war\" other than the ethical laws people impose on themselves and \"we have to play by the same rules they play by or we will stupidly fight by self-imposing that we do it with one hand behind our backs.\"  Regarding the trade war I believe that we have pretty much seen the best trade agreement that we are going to see and that the risks of this war worsening are greater than the likelihood that it will improve, and we won't see any treaty or tariff changes anytime soon as all trade negotiations are on hold until well after the US presidential elections. Beyond the elections, a lot hinges on who wins and how they will approach this conflict. That will be a big influence on how Americans and the Chinese approach the Big Cycle destinies that are in the process of unfolding. As things now stand, the one thing, maybe the only thing, that both US political parties agree on is being hawkish on China. How hawkish and how exactly that hawkishness is expressed and reacted to by the Chinese are now unknown.  How could this war worsen?  Classically, the most dangerous part of the trade/economic war comes when countries cut the other off from essential imports (e.g., China cutting the US off from rare earth elements that are needed for the production of lots of high-tech items, auto engines, and defense systems, and the US cutting China off from essential technologies) and/or from essential imports from other countries (e.g., the US cutting China off from semiconductors from Taiwan, crude oil from the Middle East or Russia, or metals from Australia)\u2014much like the US cutting off oil to Japan was a short leading indicator of the military war that followed. Thus far we haven't seen this, though we have seen movements in this direction. I'm not saying such a move is likely but I do want to be clear that moves to cut off essential imports from either side would signal a major escalation that could lead to a much worse conflict. If that doesn't happen evolution will take its normal course so international balances of payments will evolve primarily based on each country's evolving competitiveness.  For these reasons both countries, especially China, are shifting to more domestic production and \"decoupling.\"[2][2] As President Xi has said, the world is \"undergoing changes not seen in a century\" and \"in the current external environment of rising protectionism, downturn in the world economy, and shrinking global markets, [China] must give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market.\" Over the last 40 years it acquired the abilities to do this. Over the next five years we should see both countries become more independent from each other. Obviously the rate of reducing one's dependencies that can be cut off will be much greater for China over the next 5-10 years than for the United States.  The Technology War The technology war is a much more serious war than the trade war because whoever wins the technology war will probably also win the economic and military wars. The US and China are now the dominant players in the world's big tech sectors and these big tech sectors are the industries of the future. The Chinese tech sector has rapidly developed domestically to serve the Chinese in China and to become a competitor in world markets. At the same time China remains highly dependent on technologies from the United States and other countries (e.g., semiconductor chips from Taiwan). That makes the United States vulnerable to the increased development and competition of Chinese technologies and makes the Chinese vulnerable to being cut off from American or non-American essential technologies. The United States appears now to have greater technology abilities overall, though it varies by type of technology and the US is losing its lead. For example, while the US is ahead in advanced AI development, it is behind in 5G. As an imperfect reflection of this lead the market capitalizations of US tech companies in total are about twice the size of China's with China's share rising faster than America's share. This calculation understates China's relative strength because it doesn't include some of the big private companies (like Huawei and Ant Financial) and the non-company (i.e., government) technology developments, which are larger in China than they are in the United States. Today the largest public Chinese tech companies (Alibaba and Tencent) are already the fifth and seventh largest technology companies in the world, right behind some of the largest US \"FAAMG\" stocks. Some of the most important technology areas are being led by the Chinese. For example, 40% of the world's largest civilian supercomputers are now in China, China is leading the 5G race, and it is leading in some dimensions of the AI/big data race and some dimensions of the quantum computing/encryption/communications race. Similar leads in other technologies exist, such as in fintech where the dollar volume of e-commerce transactions and mobile-based payments in China is the highest in the world and well ahead of that in the US. There are of course technologies that I, and even our most informed intelligence services, don't know about that are being developed in secret.  China will probably advance its technologies and the quality of its decision making that is enabled by them faster than the US will. Big data + big AI + big computing = superior decision making. The Chinese are collecting vastly more data per person than is collected in the US (and they have more than four times as many people) and they are investing heavily in AI and big computing to make the most of it. The amounts of resources that are being poured into these and other technology areas are far greater than in the US. As for providing money, both venture capitalists and the government are providing virtually unlimited amounts to Chinese developers. As for providing people, the numbers of science, technology, engineering, and math students that are coming out of college and pursuing tech careers in China is about eight times that in the US. While the United States has an overall technology lead (though it is behind in some areas) and of course has some big hubs for new innovations especially in its top universities and its big tech companies, so the US isn't out of the game, its relative position is declining because China's technological innovation abilities are improving at a faster pace. Remember that China is a country whose leaders 36 years ago marveled at the handheld calculators I gave them, and imagine where they might be 36 years from now, which is not far away.  To fight the technology threats the United States is responding by preventing Chinese companies (like Huawei, TikTok, and WeChat) from being used in the United States, trying to undermine their usage internationally, and possibly hurting their viability through sanctions that prevent them from getting items needed for production. Is the United States doing that because a) China is using these companies to spy in the United States and elsewhere, b) because the United States is worried about them and other Chinese technology companies being more competitive, and/or c) as retaliation for the Chinese not allowing American tech companies to have free access to the Chinese market? While that is debatable, there is no doubt that these and other Chinese companies are becoming more competitive at a fast pace. In response to this competitive threat the United States is moving to contain or kill threatening tech companies. Interestingly, while the United States is cutting off access to intellectual property, it would have had a much greater power to do so not long ago because the United States had so much more intellectual property relative to others. China has started to do the same to the United States, which will increasingly hurt because Chinese IP is becoming better in many ways. They have come a long way in a short time from marveling at cheap calculators. Regarding the stealing of technologies, while it is generally agreed to be a big threat (1 in 5 North America-based companies in a 2019 CNBC Global CFO Council survey claimed to have had intellectual property stolen by Chinese companies[3][3]), it does not fully explain actions taken against Chinese tech companies. If a company is breaking a law within a country (e.g., Huawei in the US) one would expect to see that crime prosecuted legally so one could see the evidence that shows the spying devices embedded within the technologies. We aren't seeing this. Fear of growing competitiveness is as large or larger a motivator of the attacks on Chinese technology companies, but one can't expect policy makers to say that. American leaders can't admit that the competitiveness of US technology is slipping and can't argue against allowing free competition to the American people, who for ages have been taught to believe that competition is both fair and the best process for producing the best results. As a practical matter stealing intellectual property has been going on for as long as there is recorded history and has always been difficult to prevent. As we saw in earlier chapters the British did it to the Dutch and the Americans did it to the British to make themselves more competitive. \"Stealing\" implies breaking a law. When the war is between countries there are no laws, judges, or juries to resolve disputes and the real reasons decisions are made aren't always disclosed by those who are making them. I don't mean to imply that the reasons behind the United States' aggressive actions are not good ones; I don't know if they are. I'm just saying that they might not be exactly as stated. Protectionist policies have long existed to protect companies from foreign competition. Huawei's technology is certainly threatening because it's better than American technology. Look at Alibaba and Tencent and compare them with American equivalents. Americans might ask why these companies are not competing in the US. It is mostly for the same reasons that Amazon and a number of other American tech companies aren't freely competing in China. In any case, there is a tech decoupling going on that is part of the greater decoupling of China and the US, which will have a huge impact on what the world will look like in five years. What would a worsening of the tech war look like? Still, the United States has a technology lead (though it's shrinking fast). As of result, as of now the Chinese have great dependencies on imported technologies from both the US and non-US sources that the US can influence. This creates a great vulnerability for China, which creates a great weapon for the United States. It most obviously exists in advanced semiconductors, though it exists in other technologies as well. The dynamic with the world's leading chip maker\u2014Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which provides the Chinese and the world with needed chips and which can be influenced by the United States\u2014is one of many interesting dynamics to watch. There are many such Chinese technology imports that are essential for China's well-being, and much fewer American imports from China that are essential for the United States' well-being. If the United States shuts off Chinese access to essential technologies that would signal a major step up in war risks. On the other hand, if events continue to transpire as they have been transpiring, China will be much more independent and in a much stronger position than the United States technologically in 5-10 years, at which time we will see these technologies much more decoupled.

Rewind. Erase. Earlier this week the S&amp;P 500 in the US hit a record high, eclipsing the previous zenith achieved back in that ancient epoch that historians refer to as February. As far as the markets are concerned, it's as if the last six horrendous months were nothing more than a bad dream. How can this be? The performance of any equity index moves in line with investor expectations about the future earnings of the constituent companies. Have investors really lived through the past few months - the deadly pandemic sweeping the globe, hundreds of thousands dead, millions confined to their homes, whole economies placed in suspended animation, business models vaporised - and concluded that the future prospects of US companies have not just been unaffected by the global pandemic but actually improved? Really? No, not really. There's a logic to the market recovery, but it still leaves us with some highly troubling unanswered questions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Toby Nangle at Columbia Threadneedle points out, market prices are not just a view of future earnings, inflation and fiscal policy. That's because they don't occur in a vacuum. Prices are formed within a financial system and investors have to keep a very close eye on the system itself - like scientists who have to make sure their beakers don't break when they're mixing dangerous chemicals.</p><p>US equities went from peak to bear-market territory in just 15 days - an achievement that took over half a year during the 2008-09 financial crisis. Part of the reason why asset prices plunged so precipitously was that investors were worried there was a very real danger the market sell-off could cause the financial system to implode. Weird things started happening to the prices of all sorts of assets. Subsequent comments by global regulators - not least Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England - have shown they were right to be worried.</p><p>Thankfully policymakers spotted the same potential catastrophe and moved with both startling speed and unprecedented coordination. The kind of measures that central banks rolled out over several months during the previous financial crisis were deployed almost instantly and a few others were added to the mix for good measure.</p><p>At this point, the fear of the whole system going pop started to abate and the markets began to recover. As Nangle says, part of the subsequent rally can be attributed not to hopes that economic growth and future corporate earnings will pick up, but rather that the market disorder would ease. And it has.</p><p>The huge stimulus provided by central banks has also helped to lift asset prices further than relief alone would have done. Sure, central banks are mostly buying bonds, but this provides the wind beneath the wings of almost all asset classes.</p><p>The whole episode has confounded all those who thought that central banks were running out of room for manoeuvre. There were plenty of us who thought that interest rates were so low and central bank balance sheets were so bloated from a decade of quantitative easing that, when the next crisis hit, there'd be nothing left in the locker. That was wrong. The key this time was the speed with which central banks moved and the degree of coordination with government treasuries.</p><p>Nevertheless, the recovery has been incredibly lopsided. The market as a whole is back where it was in February, but nearly two thirds of companies aren't. Big tech stocks such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google's parent company Alphabet, Netflix and Microsoft have hit stratospheric valuations - Apple alone is now worth more than $2 trillion, a fraction less than the whole of the FTSE 100. But the majority of US stocks are still struggling, with the average constituent of the S&amp;P 500 about 7pc down on where it was in February.</p><p>There's another troubling aspect to the recovery. As Mark Haefele at UBS points out, when equities are rallying, you'd normally expect yields on US Treasury bonds to be rising. But throughout the dramatic recovery in share prices, Treasury yields have barely budged. Haefele describes this as the dog that hasn't barked and believes the culprit is market expectations that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low out as far as the eye can see.</p><p>This suggests, in UBS's opinion, that the actions of the Fed have become a more important factor for the price of riskier assets - such as equities - than anything else, and that includes the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Certainly equity valuations have risen to nosebleed levels at a time when the economic outlook is, at best, highly uncertain. The cyclically adjusted price/earnings, or Cape, ratio of the S&amp;P 500 recently climbed to about 31. It has only previously been higher just before the Great Crash of 1929 and the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000.</p><p>That said, long-term interest rates have never been lower. All things being equal, low interest rates justify higher equity valuations partly because fixed income investments become less attractive in comparison to equities and partly because big companies can access cheap financing.</p><p>But that means there's now an awful lot hanging on the Fed. As UBS's Haefele says, investors face a stark choice: \"They can go back to the economic textbooks and the historical relationship between yields and growth, in which case the bond market is telling them the growth outlook is terrible and equities are due for a substantial correction.

Rewind. Erase. Earlier this week the S&amp;P 500 in the US hit a record high, eclipsing the previous zenith achieved back in that ancient epoch that historians refer to as February. As far as the markets are concerned, it's as if the last six horrendous months were nothing more than a bad dream. How can this be? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The performance of any equity index moves in line with investor expectations about the future earnings of the constituent companies. Have investors really lived through the last few months-the deadly pandemic sweeping the globe, hundreds of thousands dead, millions confined to their homes, whole economies placed in suspended animation, business models vaporised-and concluded that the future prospects of US companies have not just been unaffected by the global pandemic but actually improved? Really? </p><p>No, not really. There's a logic to the market recovery but it still leaves us with some highly troubling unanswered questions. </p><p>As Toby Nangle at Columbia Threadneedle points out, market prices are not just a view of future earnings, inflation and fiscal policy. That's because they don't occur in a vacuum. Prices are formed within a financial system. And investors have to keep a very close eye on the system itself-like scientists who have to make sure their beakers don't break when they're mixing dangerous chemicals. </p><p>US equities went from peak to bear market territory in just 15 days-an achievement that took over half a year during the 2008/09 financial crisis. Part of the reason why asset prices plunged so precipitously was that investors were worried that there was a very real danger that the market sell-off could cause the financial system to implode.</p><p>Weird things started happening to the prices of all sorts of things. Subsequent comments by global regulators-not least Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, have shown they were right to be worried.</p><p>Thankfully policy makers spotted the same potential catastrophe and moved with both startling speed and unprecedented co-ordination. The kind of measures that central banks rolled out over several months during the last financial crisis were deployed almost instantly and a few others were added to the mix for good measure. </p><p>At this point, the fear of the whole system going pop started to abate and the markets began to recover. As Nangle says, part of the subsequent rally can be attributed not to hopes that economic growth and future corporate profits will pick up but rather that the market disorder would ease. And it has. </p><p>The huge stimulus provided by central banks has also helped to lift asset prices further than relief alone would have done. Sure, central banks are mostly buying bonds but this provides the winds beneath the sails of almost all asset classes. </p><p>The whole episode has confounded all those who thought that central banks were running out of room for manoeuvre. There were plenty of us who thought that interest rates were so low and central bank balance sheets so bloated from a decade of quantitative easing that, when the next crisis hit, there'd be nothing left in the locker. </p><p>That was wrong. They key this time was the speed with which central banks moved and the degree of coordination with government treasuries. </p><p>Nevertheless, the recovery has been incredibly lop-sided. The market as a whole is back where it was in February, but nearly two-thirds of companies are not. Big tech stocks like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google's parent company Alphabet, Netflix and Microsoft have hit stratospheric valuations-Apple alone is now worth more than $2 trillion, a fraction less than the whole of the FTSE 100.</p><p>But the majority of US stocks are still struggling with the average constituent of the S&amp;P 500 about 7pc down on where it was in February. </p><p>There's another troubling aspect to the recovery. As Mark Haefele at UBS points out, when equities are rallying, you'd normally expect yields on US treasury bonds to be rising. But throughout the dramatic recovery in share prices, Treasury yields have barely budged. Haefele describes this as the dog that hasn't barked and believes the culprit is market expectations that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low out as far as the eye can see. </p><p>This suggests, in UBS's opinion, that the actions of the Fed have become a more important factor for the price of riskier assets-like equities-than anything else, and that includes the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>Certainly equity valuations have risen to nosebleed levels at a time when the economic outlook is, at best, highly uncertain. The cyclically adjusted price/earnings, or CAPE, ratio of the S&amp;P 500 recently climbed to about 31. It has only previously been higher just before the Great Crash of 1929 and the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000. </p><p>That said, long-term interest rates have never been lower. All things being equal, low interest rates justify higher equity valuations partly because fixed income investments become less attractive in comparison to equities and partly because big companies can access cheap financing. </p><p>But that means there's now an awful lot hanging on the Fed. As UBS's Haefele says, investors face a stark choice: \"They can go back to the economic textbooks and the historical relationship between yields and growth, in which case the bond market is telling them the growth outlook is terrible and equities are due for a substantial\u00ad correction.\u00ad Or,\u00ad they \u00adcan \u00adbelieve \u00adthat \u00admarkets \u00adare\u00ad now\u00ad more\u00ad heavily\u00ad influenced\u00ad by Fed \u00adpolicy\u00ad than \u00adgrowth\u00ad or\u00ad inflation\u00ad expectations.\"</p><p>They appear to have plumped for the latter option. But, if they're wrong and the Fed disappoints them, equities have an awfully long way to fall.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-65383382</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N1-33D1-JCJY-G15D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"948\"/><timeReceived>5:16 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

When I talk to David Wilson, it's like miss, miss, miss, beat, miss, miss, beat. It seems to be more misses than beats. Am I right?</p><p>GOLUB: No, you're not. If you look at this earnings season, what you've had is some really huge headline misses. You've had some big tech companies like Microsoft and the like, but if you look 75 percent plus of companies are surprising the - I think the median beat is something like seven percent.</p><p>So it was a - from a growth perspective, this was a soft earnings season. But companies did much better than expected.</p><p>KEENE: So then how do you model forward? I mean a lot of headlines out. We're now red on the S and P 500 for the year, woe is me, malaise. You're an enthusiastic guy. Temper or gauge now your bullishness into the end of the year.</p><p>GOLUB: So I'll start with what Wall Street is expecting, so what all these analysts are cumulatively expecting, which is something in the ballpark of a flat earnings year over year in the second quarter, up maybe three or four percent in the third, and maybe six or seven percent in the fourth. So what we're expecting is not gang buster earnings growth, but improving earnings growth.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, but then what supports - forget about whether you want to acquire shares Monday or not - what supports equity besides Fed policy? Is it use of cash? Free cash flow, is that what's going to get it done?</p><p>GOLUB: Well, I think that something that is really under estimated - what you have is right now is companies in an environment where economic growth is really weak are returning more capital to shareholders. If you take - buyback some dividends, the amount that companies take up their earnings and give it back to the marketplace, stocks are yielding 4.7 percent.</p><p>Now, a ten year bond is yielding - what is it - 1.85 percent right now. So stocks relative to anything else are very attractive.</p><p>KEENE: Let's walk through this now. If you have a dividend of two percent, three percent in the United States, higher dividends in Europe I get, and then you overlay on top of that the \"dividend\" from share buybacks and from dividend growth, right?</p><p>GOLUB: Right.</p><p>KEENE: And that gets you up near five percent blended throughout, including ugly oil.</p><p>GOLUB: That's correct. And if you look at - you know, our guess is that once oil prices recover that 4.7 percent yield can go as high as the low fives. It's much higher than it is in Europe. Europe has much higher dividends, but they don't buy back their shares. So they pay everything out of dividends. So U.S. companies are returning much more capital back to the market.</p><p>KEENE: Peter Tague was with us with Citigroup earlier this morning and he talks about the idea of more stock for stock transactions. The currency of M and A seems to be changing. How does that roll into the stock market if every stock out there is richly priced and uses currency?</p><p>GOLUB: But I don't see the stock market as being particularly rich in the pricing. Right now, the multiple on stocks is 17. Historically, on average, it has been 14. But Tom, you and I know that the range has gone from 6 to 24, so we are a little above average. Stocks are not crazy priced.</p><p>And I think you hit the point. Cash flow back to shareholders and how attractive that is compared to other alternatives is the only way that you should be looking at the value of the stock today.</p><p>KEENE: Has there been a sea-change in thinking in corporate suites? When you look at the M, D and A, the management, discussion and analysis in an annual report, to me there has been a permanent psychological change in use of cash in corporate America. Do you fold that into your research?</p><p>GOLUB: One hundred percent. So right now, for example, companies, of the dollar they're earning, they're returning over 90 percent of that as basically free cash flow that can go back to shareholders. If you go back 15, 20 years ago, that was about 70 percent.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>GOLUB: So they are much more shareholder focused.</p><p>And the other thing, which is a big change, executives fully realize (inaudible) is that we are in a slow growing world. It's the world we live in. And they are managing their businesses for that. So they are using less capital holding, less inventory, being tighter about their use of capital. So they are really managing optimally for this kind of environment.</p><p>KEENE: John Golub with us, RBC Capital Markets. Dean Maki to join us here in a bit.</p><p>7:06</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>7:06:27</p><p>KEENE: I look, John Golub, at the idea of the du jour which is dividend growth and consumer stocks priced to perfection. Let's start with the idea I got smart, I owned a consumer stock. It's up, up, up. How do I hold it right now?</p><p>GOLUB: First of all, what is a consumer stock? So if you look at let's say the Nordstrom's and the Macy's, those traditional -</p><p>KEENE: Oh, come on. They're not.</p><p>GOLUB: But those companies are I think in a much more difficult, competitive situation. If you look at consumer staples, the stuff that we use every day that is not under the same kind of pressure, they generate tremendous free cash flow back to shareholders.</p><p>KEENE: But, come on, 3M is not a consumer stock, but I use scotch tape every day, or the house does. I mean I'm using it within a broad sense. Many of these stocks are priced to perfection within this gloom.</p><p>GOLUB: Again, I think if you look at even some of these companies that may be trading in the high teens in terms of PEs, if you look at what the cash flow that they're generating, the way that they're managing their businesses, and the value that interest rates are low and the alternatives for growth are weak, I think those companies are worth every penny.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, but the critical message here is the media is as guilty of this as anyone. We quote the cash dividend. Pros like you don't do that. You quote in your head cash dividend, plus buyback, etc.</p><p>GOLUB: And the reason is that U.S. companies have a certain amount of cash and they can do a whole variety of things with it. They can retire their debt. They can invest it for the future. And when growth prospects are weak, they're going to give it back.</p><p>But economically, whether they're doing that in a buyback or doing that in a dividend, it really is the same thing because, if it's a buyback, it moves your stock price up, if it's a dividend, you get the extra cash out. But either way, it is return that you're getting as somebody who holds the stock.</p><p>KEENE: Are the financials attractive here? We get real mixed results.</p><p>I mean we've got sell side saying maybe not now, but there is a huge glory moment a year out, two years out, three years out for the big banks. Do you agree?</p><p>GOLUB: I think as long as interest rates stay anywhere in the ballpark of where they are right now, very, very difficult to invest in. Right now, the banks have become a big bet on interest rates rather than a bet on their business models.</p><p>KEENE: On their strategic models and such. Do you look for (inaudible) there? That's a classic American question.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes, I don't think you can. Among the big banks, I don't think there is the - I don't think the regulators can allow for major mergers. So you may have smaller banks squeezing together for some efficiency, so either you're going to have higher interest rates or banks are going to be a bad investment.</p><p>KEENE: Right. What do you recommend?</p><p>You work within the institutional space for the most part, but what do you recommend for the idea of someone with a 401K or retirement plan? Their heads are spinning.</p><p>By definition, they feel behind, even they are not actuarially behind. How do you find \"growthiness\" that helps you catch up? That's tough now.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes, we've been talking about this idea of stable growth. So there's like these mega growers, the Facebooks and the Googles that are delivering massive growth.</p><p>But then there are companies that are in more boring areas like Cintas that supplies uniforms, or Waste Management that hauls your trash. And they grow at a much lower rate, but they're stable. They're visible. You can see it. And in a world where there is so much uncertainty, investors are willing to pay more for those kinds of names than they have in the past.</p><p>KEENE: Yes. Okay, 15 seconds, can you buy that PE multiple 23 consumer stock today? Forget about holding it. Can you acquire shares at that level?</p><p>GOLUB: I think you can, and I will tell that institutional investors are really struggling with it and I think they should be buying it.</p><p>KEENE: But institutional investors have all their radar up, right?</p><p>GOLUB: They are totally uncomfortable. And that may be the reason -</p><p>KEENE: You look like the Draper guy in \"Mad Men\" today. I mean it's really back to Nifty '50, isn't it?</p><p>GOLUB: I think it is. I think we will be back to Nifty '50, Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Yes. John Golub with us with RBC Capital Markets. We'll continue this conversation on the equity markets and we'll strap it across the American economy, and then we'll move to Dean Maki of Point72 as well.</p><p>7:10</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>7:18</p><p>MCKEE: I'm Michael McKee, along with Tom Keene and Jonathan Golub from RBC Capital Markets. Tom, we've got to put Jonathan on the record and get him to make a forecast here of Penguins-Lightning, but we'll do that before he leaves.</p><p>I want to go to the Fed a little bit and pose a question to you that is actually being posed this morning by Nick Colas at Convergex, our friend over there, who says how high does the VIX need to go for the next three weeks before the Fed takes a June rate increase off the table?</p><p>KEENE: That's actually a really sophisticated question given what the vol has been doing.</p><p>MCKEE: In other words, do you think that the markets are going to be extraordinarily volatile around any kind of Fed meeting and lead the Fed by the nose to some sort of conclusion one way or another?</p><p>GOLUB: I'm looking at something a little bit different, which is I think it's about the dollar and oil. What happened over the - you know, really since mid-February, which has brought the market up and taken all attention away is that the when the Fed started to walk away from June as a potential date for a move, the dollar fell and oil prices skyrocketed. And you can just chart them like a single line.</p><p>And so I think that if the dollar starts to strengthen and oil falls apart, I think the Fed is absolutely out. Other than that, the data is perfect.</p><p>MCKEE: Well, when you say the dollar strengthens, what do you mean? I mean how strong does it have to get?</p><p>Right now, we're nowhere near where it peaked earlier in the year. And as Bill Dudley said yesterday, isn't that the point?</p><p>GOLUB: You know, if you look at the big things that have happened recently, the expectations for the industrial sector and for anything which is more global trade oriented in terms of S and P 500 stocks, those companies have taken off like a rocket and the expectations for their earnings are up huge.</p><p>The energy sector is - you know, oil prices have kind of recovered, and it takes tremendous pressure off of the banking sector and the whole - all the capital markets. The risk in the whole market falls down.</p><p>That whole set of issues is really what I think the Fed should be or will need to be looking at. If the market thinks they're going to move in June and is willing to swallow it and not get concerned that oil prices are going to roll over again -</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>GOLUB: - (inaudible) starts to roll over, then you're fine.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, but you worked with one of the guys doing the best work on wage dynamics, Mr. Porcelli. I agree with everything you're saying about oil and dollar, and the correlations, and all that, and how it comes into Fed policy. And DXY, folks, as I showed Monday or Tuesday, is just back into the strong dollar range, nowhere near new dollar record strength.</p><p>But Porcelli is looking at the wage growth dynamic. When you read his work, what do you see?</p><p>GOLUB: What do we see? We see five percent unemployment, and job growth is strong enough that that number is - you were talking about Dean Maki before expecting that unemployment rate to fall into the mid-fours or lower.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>GOLUB: You have inflation right now, if you look at the data that just came out this week. You have core CPI running over two percent. And wages are running ahead of core CPI.</p><p>The economic data tells you -</p><p>KEENE: That Bill Dudley is right.</p><p>GOLUB: The Fed - the Fed should have moved a long time ago and interest rates would be - I don't know - 100 basis points higher than it is today.</p><p>But what they're really nervous about is disrupting not just the market, but disrupting the economy. And mind you, we're having .(.) So I think that's their concern. But if you made Tom Porcelli the head of the Fed, or most economists on Wall Street, I think they would tell me that is still true.</p><p>KEENE: Mike, that's a scary .(.) Do you think Mr. Trump would go for that?</p><p>MCKEE: Don't even - don't even .(.) Let me rip up the script and change gears from that direction here and point out that what you would expect and what happened on Wednesday afternoon was that financials gained when the idea of a June move came on, and utilities got hammered.</p><p>But yesterday, that reversed. I mean shouldn't that hold? Shouldn't we see - who is going to - in a June scenario, who does well?</p><p>GOLUB: Oh, in a June scenario, the banks are the single big winner. And the utilities, and the telcos, and the REITs are the single big loser. And the rest of the market incrementally companies that are a little bit more cyclical might weaken up a little bit like big industrial companies.</p><p>MCKEE: But the whole thing was - I mean we probably did ask you, but I was going to say if we asked you right before the Fed met in December, you would have said the financials because they're raising rates. But that didn't happen. The financials had a terrible quarter and went down.</p><p>Is it that are rates so low now that it really - you know, a little move isn't going to make a big difference in the financials?</p><p>GOLUB: Well, no, I think it's the opposite. The lower interest rates are, the more that the financials become sensitive to being pulled out by high rates.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>GOLUB: So if we were looking - if the ten year bond yield right now was three percent or four percent, I'll tell you right now nobody would care. You know, the banks won't care that much.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, you've been wonderful this morning talking about 20 multiple stocks and all that, up we go, the dynamics. Can you buy a PE of 10.52, a yield of 2.4 percent, three year dividend growth of 11 percent per year? They sell iPhones. I mean Apple is extraordinary on the Bloomberg screen that I see in terms of valuation.</p><p>GOLUB: Now, you know, on the surface the answer is absolutely yes. On the other hand, what the story is over there is negative earnings growth right now, and that trend is probably going to continue to be weak because they've saturated the market and their margins are high.</p><p>But this is not a new story. Investors - there is a reason why Apple never got the math of - not in the last years, they got the math multiple, because the market kind of knew that there was just so many phones that you were going to use. And so the market is pricing it for deceleration.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>MCKEE: John, Penguins-Lightning?</p><p>GOLUB: Oh, you know what? It's easier for me to go and give you my prediction on the election. I don't know .</p><p>MCKEE: This is a Canadian bank, RBC.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KEENE: John Golub, thank you so much.</p><p>MCKEE: I don't know!</p><p>KEENE: I think we'll go with Penguins.</p><p>MCKEE: No!</p><p>KEENE: Good morning, Pittsburgh.</p><p>7:25</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

When I talk to  David Wilson, it's like miss, miss, miss, beat, miss, miss, beat. It seems  to be more misses than beats. Am I right?</p><p> GOLUB: No, you're not. If you look at this earnings season, what you've had  is some really huge headline misses. You've had some big tech companies  like Microsoft and the like, but if you look 75 percent plus of companies  are surprising the - I think the median beat is something like seven  percent.</p><p> So it was a - from a growth perspective, this was a soft earnings season.  But companies did much better than expected.</p><p> KEENE: So then how do you model forward? I mean a lot of headlines out.  We're now red on the S and P 500 for the year, woe is me, malaise. You're  an enthusiastic guy. Temper or gauge now your bullishness into the end of  the year.</p><p> GOLUB: So I'll start with what Wall Street is expecting, so what all these  analysts are cumulatively expecting, which is something in the ballpark of  a flat earnings year over year in the second quarter, up maybe three or  four percent in the third, and maybe six or seven percent in the fourth. So  what we're expecting is not gang buster earnings growth, but improving  earnings growth.</p><p> KEENE: Okay, but then what supports - forget about whether you want to  acquire shares Monday or not - what supports equity besides Fed policy? Is  it use of cash? Free cash flow, is that what's going to get it done?</p><p> GOLUB: Well, I think that something that is really under estimated - what  you have is right now is companies in an environment where economic growth  is really weak are returning more capital to shareholders. If you take -  buyback some dividends, the amount that companies take up their earnings  and give it back to the marketplace, stocks are yielding 4.7 percent.</p><p> Now, a ten year bond is yielding - what is it - 1.85 percent right now. So  stocks relative to anything else are very attractive.</p><p> KEENE: Let's walk through this now. If you have a dividend of two percent,  three percent in the United States, higher dividends in Europe I get, and  then you overlay on top of that the \"dividend\" from share buybacks and from  dividend growth, right?</p><p> GOLUB: Right.</p><p> KEENE: And that gets you up near five percent blended throughout, including  ugly oil.</p><p> GOLUB: That's correct. And if you look at - you know, our guess is that  once oil prices recover that 4.7 percent yield can go as high as the low  fives. It's much higher than it is in Europe. Europe has much higher  dividends, but they don't buy back their shares. So they pay everything out  of dividends. So U.S. companies are returning much more capital back to the  market.</p><p> KEENE: Peter Tague was with us with Citigroup earlier this morning and he  talks about the idea of more stock for stock transactions. The currency of  M and A seems to be changing. How does that roll into the stock market if  every stock out there is richly priced and uses currency?</p><p> GOLUB: But I don't see the stock market as being particularly rich in the  pricing. Right now, the multiple on stocks is 17. Historically, on average,  it has been 14. But Tom, you and I know that the range has gone from 6 to  24, so we are a little above average. Stocks are not crazy priced.</p><p> And I think you hit the point. Cash flow back to shareholders and how  attractive that is compared to other alternatives is the only way that you  should be looking at the value of the stock today.</p><p> KEENE: Has there been a sea-change in thinking in corporate suites? When  you look at the M, D and A, the management, discussion and analysis in an  annual report, to me there has been a permanent psychological change in use  of cash in corporate America. Do you fold that into your research?</p><p> GOLUB: One hundred percent. So right now, for example, companies, of the  dollar they're earning, they're returning over 90 percent of that as  basically free cash flow that can go back to shareholders. If you go back  15, 20 years ago, that was about 70 percent.</p><p> KEENE: Right.</p><p> GOLUB: So they are much more shareholder focused.</p><p> And the other thing, which is a big change, executives fully realize  (inaudible) is that we are in a slow growing world. It's the world we live  in. And they are managing their businesses for that. So they are using less  capital holding, less inventory, being tighter about their use of capital.  So they are really managing optimally for this kind of environment.</p><p> KEENE: John Golub with us, RBC Capital Markets. Dean Maki to join us here  in a bit.</p><p> 7:06</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 7:06:27</p><p> KEENE: I look, John Golub, at the idea of the du jour which is dividend  growth and consumer stocks priced to perfection. Let's start with the idea  I got smart, I owned a consumer stock. It's up, up, up. How do I hold it  right now?</p><p> GOLUB: First of all, what is a consumer stock? So if you look at let's say  the Nordstrom's and the Macy's, those traditional -</p><p> KEENE: Oh, come on. They're not.</p><p> GOLUB: But those companies are I think in a much more difficult,  competitive situation. If you look at consumer staples, the stuff that we  use every day that is not under the same kind of pressure, they generate  tremendous free cash flow back to shareholders.</p><p> KEENE: But, come on, 3M is not a consumer stock, but I use scotch tape  every day, or the house does. I mean I'm using it within a broad sense.  Many of these stocks are priced to perfection within this gloom.</p><p> GOLUB: Again, I think if you look at even some of these companies that may  be trading in the high teens in terms of PEs, if you look at what the cash  flow that they're generating, the way that they're managing their  businesses, and the value that interest rates are low and the alternatives  for growth are weak, I think those companies are worth every penny.</p><p> KEENE: Yes, but the critical message here is the media is as guilty of this  as anyone. We quote the cash dividend. Pros like you don't do that. You  quote in your head cash dividend, plus buyback, etc.</p><p> GOLUB: And the reason is that U.S. companies have a certain amount of cash  and they can do a whole variety of things with it. They can retire their  debt. They can invest it for the future. And when growth prospects are  weak, they're going to give it back.</p><p> But economically, whether they're doing that in a buyback or doing that in  a dividend, it really is the same thing because, if it's a buyback, it  moves your stock price up, if it's a dividend, you get the extra cash out.  But either way, it is return that you're getting as somebody who holds the  stock.</p><p> KEENE: Are the financials attractive here? We get real mixed results.</p><p> I mean we've got sell side saying maybe not now, but there is a huge glory  moment a year out, two years out, three years out for the big banks. Do you  agree?</p><p> GOLUB: I think as long as interest rates stay anywhere in the ballpark of  where they are right now, very, very difficult to invest in. Right now, the  banks have become a big bet on interest rates rather than a bet on their  business models.</p><p> KEENE: On their strategic models and such. Do you look for (inaudible)  there? That's a classic American question.</p><p> GOLUB: Yes, I don't think you can. Among the big banks, I don't think there  is the - I don't think the regulators can allow for major mergers. So you  may have smaller banks squeezing together for some efficiency, so either  you're going to have higher interest rates or banks are going to be a bad  investment.</p><p> KEENE: Right. What do you recommend?</p><p> You work within the institutional space for the most part, but what do you  recommend for the idea of someone with a 401K or retirement plan? Their  heads are spinning.</p><p> By definition, they feel behind, even they are not actuarially behind. How  do you find \"growthiness\" that helps you catch up? That's tough now.</p><p> GOLUB: Yes, we've been talking about this idea of stable growth. So there's  like these mega growers, the Facebooks and the Googles that are delivering  massive growth.</p><p> But then there are companies that are in more boring areas like Cintas that  supplies uniforms, or Waste Management that hauls your trash. And they grow  at a much lower rate, but they're stable. They're visible. You can see it.  And in a world where there is so much uncertainty, investors are willing to  pay more for those kinds of names than they have in the past.</p><p> KEENE: Yes. Okay, 15 seconds, can you buy that PE multiple 23 consumer  stock today? Forget about holding it. Can you acquire shares at that level?</p><p> GOLUB: I think you can, and I will tell that institutional investors are  really struggling with it and I think they should be buying it.</p><p> KEENE: But institutional investors have all their radar up, right?</p><p> GOLUB: They are totally uncomfortable. And that may be the reason -</p><p> KEENE: You look like the Draper guy in \"Mad Men\" today. I mean it's really  back to Nifty '50, isn't it?</p><p> GOLUB: I think it is. I think we will be back to Nifty '50, Tom.</p><p> KEENE: Yes. John Golub with us with RBC Capital Markets. We'll continue  this conversation on the equity markets and we'll strap it across the  American economy, and then we'll move to Dean Maki of Point72 as well.</p><p> 7:10</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 7:18</p><p> MCKEE: I'm Michael McKee, along with Tom Keene and Jonathan Golub from RBC  Capital Markets. Tom, we've got to put Jonathan on the record and get him  to make a forecast here of Penguins-Lightning, but we'll do that before he  leaves.</p><p> I want to go to the Fed a little bit and pose a question to you that is  actually being posed this morning by Nick Colas at Convergex, our friend  over there, who says how high does the VIX need to go for the next three  weeks before the Fed takes a June rate increase off the table?</p><p> KEENE: That's actually a really sophisticated question given what the vol  has been doing.</p><p> MCKEE: In other words, do you think that the markets are going to be  extraordinarily volatile around any kind of Fed meeting and lead the Fed by  the nose to some sort of conclusion one way or another?</p><p> GOLUB: I'm looking at something a little bit different, which is I think  it's about the dollar and oil. What happened over the - you know, really  since mid-February, which has brought the market up and taken all attention  away is that the when the Fed started to walk away from June as a potential  date for a move, the dollar fell and oil prices skyrocketed. And you can  just chart them like a single line.</p><p> And so I think that if the dollar starts to strengthen and oil falls apart,  I think the Fed is absolutely out. Other than that, the data is perfect.</p><p> MCKEE: Well, when you say the dollar strengthens, what do you mean? I mean  how strong does it have to get?</p><p> Right now, we're nowhere near where it peaked earlier in the year. And as  Bill Dudley said yesterday, isn't that the point?</p><p> GOLUB: You know, if you look at the big things that have happened recently,  the expectations for the industrial sector and for anything which is more  global trade oriented in terms of S and P 500 stocks, those companies have  taken off like a rocket and the expectations for their earnings are up  huge.</p><p> The energy sector is - you know, oil prices have kind of recovered, and it  takes tremendous pressure off of the banking sector and the whole - all the  capital markets. The risk in the whole market falls down.</p><p> That whole set of issues is really what I think the Fed should be or will  need to be looking at. If the market thinks they're going to move in June  and is willing to swallow it and not get concerned that oil prices are  going to roll over again -</p><p> KEENE: Right.</p><p> GOLUB: - (inaudible) starts to roll over, then you're fine.</p><p> KEENE: Okay, but you worked with one of the guys doing the best work on  wage dynamics, Mr. Porcelli. I agree with everything you're saying about  oil and dollar, and the correlations, and all that, and how it comes into  Fed policy. And DXY, folks, as I showed Monday or Tuesday, is just back  into the strong dollar range, nowhere near new dollar record strength.</p><p> But Porcelli is looking at the wage growth dynamic. When you read his work,  what do you see?</p><p> GOLUB: What do we see? We see five percent unemployment, and job growth is  strong enough that that number is - you were talking about Dean Maki before  expecting that unemployment rate to fall into the mid-fours or lower.</p><p> KEENE: Right.</p><p> GOLUB: You have inflation right now, if you look at the data that just came  out this week. You have core CPI running over two percent. And wages are  running ahead of core CPI.</p><p> The economic data tells you -</p><p> KEENE: That Bill Dudley is right.</p><p> GOLUB: The Fed - the Fed should have moved a long time ago and interest  rates would be - I don't know - 100 basis points higher than it is today.</p><p> But what they're really nervous about is disrupting not just the market,  but disrupting the economy. And mind you, we're having ...(.) So I think  that's their concern. But if you made Tom Porcelli the head of the Fed, or  most economists on Wall Street, I think they would tell me that is still  true.</p><p> KEENE: Mike, that's a scary ...(.) Do you think Mr. Trump would go for  that?</p><p> MCKEE: Don't even - don't even ...(.) Let me rip up the script and change  gears from that direction here and point out that what you would expect and  what happened on Wednesday afternoon was that financials gained when the  idea of a June move came on, and utilities got hammered.</p><p> But yesterday, that reversed. I mean shouldn't that hold? Shouldn't we see  - who is going to - in a June scenario, who does well?</p><p> GOLUB: Oh, in a June scenario, the banks are the single big winner. And the  utilities, and the telcos, and the REITs are the single big loser. And the  rest of the market incrementally companies that are a little bit more  cyclical might weaken up a little bit like big industrial companies.</p><p> MCKEE: But the whole thing was - I mean we probably did ask you, but I was  going to say if we asked you right before the Fed met in December, you  would have said the financials because they're raising rates. But that  didn't happen. The financials had a terrible quarter and went down.</p><p> Is it that are rates so low now that it really - you know, a little move  isn't going to make a big difference in the financials?</p><p> GOLUB: Well, no, I think it's the opposite. The lower interest rates are,  the more that the financials become sensitive to being pulled out by high  rates.</p><p> KEENE: Yes.</p><p> GOLUB: So if we were looking - if the ten year bond yield right now was  three percent or four percent, I'll tell you right now nobody would care.  You know, the banks won't care that much.</p><p> KEENE: Yes, you've been wonderful this morning talking about 20 multiple  stocks and all that, up we go, the dynamics. Can you buy a PE of 10.52, a  yield of 2.4 percent, three year dividend growth of 11 percent per year?  They sell iPhones. I mean Apple is extraordinary on the Bloomberg screen  that I see in terms of valuation.</p><p> GOLUB: Now, you know, on the surface the answer is absolutely yes. On the  other hand, what the story is over there is negative earnings growth right  now, and that trend is probably going to continue to be weak because  they've saturated the market and their margins are high.</p><p> But this is not a new story. Investors - there is a reason why Apple never  got the math of - not in the last years, they got the math multiple,  because the market kind of knew that there was just so many phones that you  were going to use. And so the market is pricing it for deceleration.</p><p> KEENE: Yes.</p><p> MCKEE: John, Penguins-Lightning?</p><p> GOLUB: Oh, you know what? It's easier for me to go and give you my  prediction on the election. I don't know ...</p><p> MCKEE: This is a Canadian bank, RBC.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> KEENE: John Golub, thank you so much.</p><p> MCKEE: I don't know!</p><p> KEENE: I think we'll go with Penguins.</p><p> MCKEE: No!</p><p> KEENE: Good morning, Pittsburgh.</p><p> 7:25</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p>  [*]  END</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

When I talk to  David Wilson, it's like miss, miss, miss, beat, miss, miss, beat. It seems  to be more misses than beats. Am I right?</p><p>GOLUB: No, you're not. If you look at this earnings season, what you've had  is some really huge headline misses. You've had some big tech companies  like Microsoft and the like, but if you look 75 percent plus of companies  are surprising the - I think the median beat is something like seven  percent.</p><p>So it was a - from a growth perspective, this was a soft earnings season.  But companies did much better than expected.</p><p>KEENE: So then how do you model forward? I mean a lot of headlines out.  We're now red on the S and P 500 for the year, woe is me, malaise. You're  an enthusiastic guy. Temper or gauge now your bullishness into the end of  the year.</p><p>GOLUB: So I'll start with what Wall Street is expecting, so what all these  analysts are cumulatively expecting, which is something in the ballpark of  a flat earnings year over year in the second quarter, up maybe three or  four percent in the third, and maybe six or seven percent in the fourth. So  what we're expecting is not gang buster earnings growth, but improving  earnings growth.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, but then what supports - forget about whether you want to  acquire shares Monday or not - what supports equity besides Fed policy? Is  it use of cash? Free cash flow, is that what's going to get it done?</p><p>GOLUB: Well, I think that something that is really under estimated - what  you have is right now is companies in an environment where economic growth  is really weak are returning more capital to shareholders. If you take -  buyback some dividends, the amount that companies take up their earnings  and give it back to the marketplace, stocks are yielding 4.7 percent.</p><p>Now, a ten year bond is yielding - what is it - 1.85 percent right now. So  stocks relative to anything else are very attractive.</p><p>KEENE: Let's walk through this now. If you have a dividend of two percent,  three percent in the United States, higher dividends in Europe I get, and  then you overlay on top of that the \"dividend\" from share buybacks and from  dividend growth, right?</p><p>GOLUB: Right.</p><p>KEENE: And that gets you up near five percent blended throughout, including  ugly oil.</p><p>GOLUB: That's correct. And if you look at - you know, our guess is that  once oil prices recover that 4.7 percent yield can go as high as the low  fives. It's much higher than it is in Europe. Europe has much higher  dividends, but they don't buy back their shares. So they pay everything out  of dividends. So U.S. companies are returning much more capital back to the  market.</p><p>KEENE: Peter Tague was with us with Citigroup earlier this morning and he  talks about the idea of more stock for stock transactions. The currency of  M and A seems to be changing. How does that roll into the stock market if  every stock out there is richly priced and uses currency?</p><p>GOLUB: But I don't see the stock market as being particularly rich in the  pricing. Right now, the multiple on stocks is 17. Historically, on average,  it has been 14. But Tom, you and I know that the range has gone from 6 to  24, so we are a little above average. Stocks are not crazy priced.</p><p>And I think you hit the point. Cash flow back to shareholders and how  attractive that is compared to other alternatives is the only way that you  should be looking at the value of the stock today.</p><p>KEENE: Has there been a sea-change in thinking in corporate suites? When  you look at the M, D and A, the management, discussion and analysis in an  annual report, to me there has been a permanent psychological change in use  of cash in corporate America. Do you fold that into your research?</p><p>GOLUB: One hundred percent. So right now, for example, companies, of the  dollar they're earning, they're returning over 90 percent of that as  basically free cash flow that can go back to shareholders. If you go back  15, 20 years ago, that was about 70 percent.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>GOLUB: So they are much more shareholder focused.</p><p>And the other thing, which is a big change, executives fully realize  (inaudible) is that we are in a slow growing world. It's the world we live  in. And they are managing their businesses for that. So they are using less  capital holding, less inventory, being tighter about their use of capital.  So they are really managing optimally for this kind of environment.</p><p>KEENE: John Golub with us, RBC Capital Markets. Dean Maki to join us here  in a bit.</p><p>7:06</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>7:06:27</p><p>KEENE: I look, John Golub, at the idea of the du jour which is dividend  growth and consumer stocks priced to perfection. Let's start with the idea  I got smart, I owned a consumer stock. It's up, up, up. How do I hold it  right now?</p><p>GOLUB: First of all, what is a consumer stock? So if you look at let's say  the Nordstrom's and the Macy's, those traditional -</p><p>KEENE: Oh, come on. They're not.</p><p>GOLUB: But those companies are I think in a much more difficult,  competitive situation. If you look at consumer staples, the stuff that we  use every day that is not under the same kind of pressure, they generate  tremendous free cash flow back to shareholders.</p><p>KEENE: But, come on, 3M is not a consumer stock, but I use scotch tape  every day, or the house does. I mean I'm using it within a broad sense.  Many of these stocks are priced to perfection within this gloom.</p><p>GOLUB: Again, I think if you look at even some of these companies that may  be trading in the high teens in terms of PEs, if you look at what the cash  flow that they're generating, the way that they're managing their  businesses, and the value that interest rates are low and the alternatives  for growth are weak, I think those companies are worth every penny.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, but the critical message here is the media is as guilty of this  as anyone. We quote the cash dividend. Pros like you don't do that. You  quote in your head cash dividend, plus buyback, etc.</p><p>GOLUB: And the reason is that U.S. companies have a certain amount of cash  and they can do a whole variety of things with it. They can retire their  debt. They can invest it for the future. And when growth prospects are  weak, they're going to give it back.</p><p>But economically, whether they're doing that in a buyback or doing that in  a dividend, it really is the same thing because, if it's a buyback, it  moves your stock price up, if it's a dividend, you get the extra cash out.  But either way, it is return that you're getting as somebody who holds the  stock.</p><p>KEENE: Are the financials attractive here? We get real mixed results.</p><p>I mean we've got sell side saying maybe not now, but there is a huge glory  moment a year out, two years out, three years out for the big banks. Do you  agree?</p><p>GOLUB: I think as long as interest rates stay anywhere in the ballpark of  where they are right now, very, very difficult to invest in. Right now, the  banks have become a big bet on interest rates rather than a bet on their  business models.</p><p>KEENE: On their strategic models and such. Do you look for (inaudible)  there? That's a classic American question.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes, I don't think you can. Among the big banks, I don't think there  is the - I don't think the regulators can allow for major mergers. So you  may have smaller banks squeezing together for some efficiency, so either  you're going to have higher interest rates or banks are going to be a bad  investment.</p><p>KEENE: Right. What do you recommend?</p><p>You work within the institutional space for the most part, but what do you  recommend for the idea of someone with a 401K or retirement plan? Their  heads are spinning.</p><p>By definition, they feel behind, even they are not actuarially behind. How  do you find \"growthiness\" that helps you catch up? That's tough now.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes, we've been talking about this idea of stable growth. So there's  like these mega growers, the Facebooks and the Googles that are delivering  massive growth.</p><p>But then there are companies that are in more boring areas like Cintas that  supplies uniforms, or Waste Management that hauls your trash. And they grow  at a much lower rate, but they're stable. They're visible. You can see it.  And in a world where there is so much uncertainty, investors are willing to  pay more for those kinds of names than they have in the past.</p><p>KEENE: Yes. Okay, 15 seconds, can you buy that PE multiple 23 consumer  stock today? Forget about holding it. Can you acquire shares at that level?</p><p>GOLUB: I think you can, and I will tell that institutional investors are  really struggling with it and I think they should be buying it.</p><p>KEENE: But institutional investors have all their radar up, right?</p><p>GOLUB: They are totally uncomfortable. And that may be the reason -</p><p>KEENE: You look like the Draper guy in \"Mad Men\" today. I mean it's really  back to Nifty '50, isn't it?</p><p>GOLUB: I think it is. I think we will be back to Nifty '50, Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Yes. John Golub with us with RBC Capital Markets. We'll continue  this conversation on the equity markets and we'll strap it across the  American economy, and then we'll move to Dean Maki of Point72 as well.</p><p>7:10</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>7:18</p><p>MCKEE: I'm Michael McKee, along with Tom Keene and Jonathan Golub from RBC  Capital Markets. Tom, we've got to put Jonathan on the record and get him  to make a forecast here of Penguins-Lightning, but we'll do that before he  leaves.</p><p>I want to go to the Fed a little bit and pose a question to you that is  actually being posed this morning by Nick Colas at Convergex, our friend  over there, who says how high does the VIX need to go for the next three  weeks before the Fed takes a June rate increase off the table?</p><p>KEENE: That's actually a really sophisticated question given what the vol  has been doing.</p><p>MCKEE: In other words, do you think that the markets are going to be  extraordinarily volatile around any kind of Fed meeting and lead the Fed by  the nose to some sort of conclusion one way or another?</p><p>GOLUB: I'm looking at something a little bit different, which is I think  it's about the dollar and oil. What happened over the - you know, really  since mid-February, which has brought the market up and taken all attention  away is that the when the Fed started to walk away from June as a potential  date for a move, the dollar fell and oil prices skyrocketed. And you can  just chart them like a single line.</p><p>And so I think that if the dollar starts to strengthen and oil falls apart,  I think the Fed is absolutely out. Other than that, the data is perfect.</p><p>MCKEE: Well, when you say the dollar strengthens, what do you mean? I mean  how strong does it have to get?</p><p>Right now, we're nowhere near where it peaked earlier in the year. And as  Bill Dudley said yesterday, isn't that the point?</p><p>GOLUB: You know, if you look at the big things that have happened recently,  the expectations for the industrial sector and for anything which is more  global trade oriented in terms of S and P 500 stocks, those companies have  taken off like a rocket and the expectations for their earnings are up  huge.</p><p>The energy sector is - you know, oil prices have kind of recovered, and it  takes tremendous pressure off of the banking sector and the whole - all the  capital markets. The risk in the whole market falls down.</p><p>That whole set of issues is really what I think the Fed should be or will  need to be looking at. If the market thinks they're going to move in June  and is willing to swallow it and not get concerned that oil prices are  going to roll over again -</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>GOLUB: - (inaudible) starts to roll over, then you're fine.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, but you worked with one of the guys doing the best work on  wage dynamics, Mr. Porcelli. I agree with everything you're saying about  oil and dollar, and the correlations, and all that, and how it comes into  Fed policy. And DXY, folks, as I showed Monday or Tuesday, is just back  into the strong dollar range, nowhere near new dollar record strength.</p><p>But Porcelli is looking at the wage growth dynamic. When you read his work,  what do you see?</p><p>GOLUB: What do we see? We see five percent unemployment, and job growth is  strong enough that that number is - you were talking about Dean Maki before  expecting that unemployment rate to fall into the mid-fours or lower.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>GOLUB: You have inflation right now, if you look at the data that just came  out this week. You have core CPI running over two percent. And wages are  running ahead of core CPI.</p><p>The economic data tells you -</p><p>KEENE: That Bill Dudley is right.</p><p>GOLUB: The Fed - the Fed should have moved a long time ago and interest  rates would be - I don't know - 100 basis points higher than it is today.</p><p>But what they're really nervous about is disrupting not just the market,  but disrupting the economy. And mind you, we're having ...(.) So I think  that's their concern. But if you made Tom Porcelli the head of the Fed, or  most economists on Wall Street, I think they would tell me that is still  true.</p><p>KEENE: Mike, that's a scary ...(.) Do you think Mr. Trump would go for  that?</p><p>MCKEE: Don't even - don't even ...(.) Let me rip up the script and change  gears from that direction here and point out that what you would expect and  what happened on Wednesday afternoon was that financials gained when the  idea of a June move came on, and utilities got hammered.</p><p>But yesterday, that reversed. I mean shouldn't that hold? Shouldn't we see  - who is going to - in a June scenario, who does well?</p><p>GOLUB: Oh, in a June scenario, the banks are the single big winner. And the  utilities, and the telcos, and the REITs are the single big loser. And the  rest of the market incrementally companies that are a little bit more  cyclical might weaken up a little bit like big industrial companies.</p><p>MCKEE: But the whole thing was - I mean we probably did ask you, but I was  going to say if we asked you right before the Fed met in December, you  would have said the financials because they're raising rates. But that  didn't happen. The financials had a terrible quarter and went down.</p><p>Is it that are rates so low now that it really - you know, a little move  isn't going to make a big difference in the financials?</p><p>GOLUB: Well, no, I think it's the opposite. The lower interest rates are,  the more that the financials become sensitive to being pulled out by high  rates.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>GOLUB: So if we were looking - if the ten year bond yield right now was  three percent or four percent, I'll tell you right now nobody would care.  You know, the banks won't care that much.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, you've been wonderful this morning talking about 20 multiple  stocks and all that, up we go, the dynamics. Can you buy a PE of 10.52, a  yield of 2.4 percent, three year dividend growth of 11 percent per year?  They sell iPhones. I mean Apple is extraordinary on the Bloomberg screen  that I see in terms of valuation.</p><p>GOLUB: Now, you know, on the surface the answer is absolutely yes. On the  other hand, what the story is over there is negative earnings growth right  now, and that trend is probably going to continue to be weak because  they've saturated the market and their margins are high.</p><p>But this is not a new story. Investors - there is a reason why Apple never  got the math of - not in the last years, they got the math multiple,  because the market kind of knew that there was just so many phones that you  were going to use. And so the market is pricing it for deceleration.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>MCKEE: John, Penguins-Lightning?</p><p>GOLUB: Oh, you know what? It's easier for me to go and give you my  prediction on the election. I don't know ...</p><p>MCKEE: This is a Canadian bank, RBC.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KEENE: John Golub, thank you so much.</p><p>MCKEE: I don't know!</p><p>KEENE: I think we'll go with Penguins.</p><p>MCKEE: No!</p><p>KEENE: Good morning, Pittsburgh.</p><p>7:25</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>[*]  END</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

When I talk to David Wilson, it's like miss, miss, miss, beat, miss, miss, beat. It seems to be more misses than beats. Am I right?</p><p>GOLUB: No, you're not. If you look at this earnings season, what you've had is some really huge headline misses. You've had some big tech companies like Microsoft and the like, but if you look 75 percent plus of companies are surprising the - I think the median beat is something like seven percent.</p><p>So it was a - from a growth perspective, this was a soft earnings season. But companies did much better than expected.</p><p>KEENE: So then how do you model forward? I mean a lot of headlines out. We're now red on the S and P 500 for the year, woe is me, malaise. You're an enthusiastic guy. Temper or gauge now your bullishness into the end of the year.</p><p>GOLUB: So I'll start with what Wall Street is expecting, so what all these analysts are cumulatively expecting, which is something in the ballpark of a flat earnings year over year in the second quarter, up maybe three or four percent in the third, and maybe six or seven percent in the fourth. So what we're expecting is not gang buster earnings growth, but improving earnings growth.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, but then what supports - forget about whether you want to acquire shares Monday or not - what supports equity besides Fed policy? Is it use of cash? Free cash flow, is that what's going to get it done?</p><p>GOLUB: Well, I think that something that is really under estimated - what you have is right now is companies in an environment where economic growth is really weak are returning more capital to shareholders. If you take - buyback some dividends, the amount that companies take up their earnings and give it back to the marketplace, stocks are yielding 4.7 percent.</p><p>Now, a ten year bond is yielding - what is it - 1.85 percent right now. So stocks relative to anything else are very attractive.</p><p>KEENE: Let's walk through this now. If you have a dividend of two percent, three percent in the United States, higher dividends in Europe I get, and then you overlay on top of that the \"dividend\" from share buybacks and from dividend growth, right?</p><p>GOLUB: Right.</p><p>KEENE: And that gets you up near five percent blended throughout, including ugly oil.</p><p>GOLUB: That's correct. And if you look at - you know, our guess is that once oil prices recover that 4.7 percent yield can go as high as the low fives. It's much higher than it is in Europe. Europe has much higher dividends, but they don't buy back their shares. So they pay everything out of dividends. So U.S. companies are returning much more capital back to the market.</p><p>KEENE: Peter Tague was with us with Citigroup earlier this morning and he talks about the idea of more stock for stock transactions. The currency of M and A seems to be changing. How does that roll into the stock market if every stock out there is richly priced and uses currency?</p><p>GOLUB: But I don't see the stock market as being particularly rich in the pricing. Right now, the multiple on stocks is 17. Historically, on average, it has been 14. But Tom, you and I know that the range has gone from 6 to 24, so we are a little above average. Stocks are not crazy priced.</p><p>And I think you hit the point. Cash flow back to shareholders and how attractive that is compared to other alternatives is the only way that you should be looking at the value of the stock today.</p><p>KEENE: Has there been a sea-change in thinking in corporate suites? When you look at the M, D and A, the management, discussion and analysis in an annual report, to me there has been a permanent psychological change in use of cash in corporate America. Do you fold that into your research?</p><p>GOLUB: One hundred percent. So right now, for example, companies, of the dollar they're earning, they're returning over 90 percent of that as basically free cash flow that can go back to shareholders. If you go back 15, 20 years ago, that was about 70 percent.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>GOLUB: So they are much more shareholder focused.</p><p>And the other thing, which is a big change, executives fully realize (inaudible) is that we are in a slow growing world. It's the world we live in. And they are managing their businesses for that. So they are using less capital holding, less inventory, being tighter about their use of capital. So they are really managing optimally for this kind of environment.</p><p>KEENE: John Golub with us, RBC Capital Markets. Dean Maki to join us here in a bit.</p><p>7:06</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>7:06:27</p><p>KEENE: I look, John Golub, at the idea of the du jour which is dividend growth and consumer stocks priced to perfection. Let's start with the idea I got smart, I owned a consumer stock. It's up, up, up. How do I hold it right now?</p><p>GOLUB: First of all, what is a consumer stock? So if you look at let's say the Nordstrom's and the Macy's, those traditional -</p><p>KEENE: Oh, come on. They're not.</p><p>GOLUB: But those companies are I think in a much more difficult, competitive situation. If you look at consumer staples, the stuff that we use every day that is not under the same kind of pressure, they generate tremendous free cash flow back to shareholders.</p><p>KEENE: But, come on, 3M is not a consumer stock, but I use scotch tape every day, or the house does. I mean I'm using it within a broad sense. Many of these stocks are priced to perfection within this gloom.</p><p>GOLUB: Again, I think if you look at even some of these companies that may be trading in the high teens in terms of PEs, if you look at what the cash flow that they're generating, the way that they're managing their businesses, and the value that interest rates are low and the alternatives for growth are weak, I think those companies are worth every penny.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, but the critical message here is the media is as guilty of this as anyone. We quote the cash dividend. Pros like you don't do that. You quote in your head cash dividend, plus buyback, etc.</p><p>GOLUB: And the reason is that U.S. companies have a certain amount of cash and they can do a whole variety of things with it. They can retire their debt. They can invest it for the future. And when growth prospects are weak, they're going to give it back.</p><p>But economically, whether they're doing that in a buyback or doing that in a dividend, it really is the same thing because, if it's a buyback, it moves your stock price up, if it's a dividend, you get the extra cash out. But either way, it is return that you're getting as somebody who holds the stock.</p><p>KEENE: Are the financials attractive here? We get real mixed results.</p><p>I mean we've got sell side saying maybe not now, but there is a huge glory moment a year out, two years out, three years out for the big banks. Do you agree?</p><p>GOLUB: I think as long as interest rates stay anywhere in the ballpark of where they are right now, very, very difficult to invest in. Right now, the banks have become a big bet on interest rates rather than a bet on their business models.</p><p>KEENE: On their strategic models and such. Do you look for (inaudible) there? That's a classic American question.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes, I don't think you can. Among the big banks, I don't think there is the - I don't think the regulators can allow for major mergers. So you may have smaller banks squeezing together for some efficiency, so either you're going to have higher interest rates or banks are going to be a bad investment.</p><p>KEENE: Right. What do you recommend?</p><p>You work within the institutional space for the most part, but what do you recommend for the idea of someone with a 401K or retirement plan? Their heads are spinning.</p><p>By definition, they feel behind, even they are not actuarially behind. How do you find \"growthiness\" that helps you catch up? That's tough now.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes, we've been talking about this idea of stable growth. So there's like these mega growers, the Facebooks and the Googles that are delivering massive growth.</p><p>But then there are companies that are in more boring areas like Cintas that supplies uniforms, or Waste Management that hauls your trash. And they grow at a much lower rate, but they're stable. They're visible. You can see it. And in a world where there is so much uncertainty, investors are willing to pay more for those kinds of names than they have in the past.</p><p>KEENE: Yes. Okay, 15 seconds, can you buy that PE multiple 23 consumer stock today? Forget about holding it. Can you acquire shares at that level?</p><p>GOLUB: I think you can, and I will tell that institutional investors are really struggling with it and I think they should be buying it.</p><p>KEENE: But institutional investors have all their radar up, right?</p><p>GOLUB: They are totally uncomfortable. And that may be the reason -</p><p>KEENE: You look like the Draper guy in \"Mad Men\" today. I mean it's really back to Nifty '50, isn't it?</p><p>GOLUB: I think it is. I think we will be back to Nifty '50, Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Yes. John Golub with us with RBC Capital Markets. We'll continue this conversation on the equity markets and we'll strap it across the American economy, and then we'll move to Dean Maki of Point72 as well.</p><p>7:10</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>7:18</p><p>MCKEE: I'm Michael McKee, along with Tom Keene and Jonathan Golub from RBC Capital Markets. Tom, we've got to put Jonathan on the record and get him to make a forecast here of Penguins-Lightning, but we'll do that before he leaves.</p><p>I want to go to the Fed a little bit and pose a question to you that is actually being posed this morning by Nick Colas at Convergex, our friend over there, who says how high does the VIX need to go for the next three weeks before the Fed takes a June rate increase off the table?</p><p>KEENE: That's actually a really sophisticated question given what the vol has been doing.</p><p>MCKEE: In other words, do you think that the markets are going to be extraordinarily volatile around any kind of Fed meeting and lead the Fed by the nose to some sort of conclusion one way or another?</p><p>GOLUB: I'm looking at something a little bit different, which is I think it's about the dollar and oil. What happened over the - you know, really since mid-February, which has brought the market up and taken all attention away is that the when the Fed started to walk away from June as a potential date for a move, the dollar fell and oil prices skyrocketed. And you can just chart them like a single line.</p><p>And so I think that if the dollar starts to strengthen and oil falls apart, I think the Fed is absolutely out. Other than that, the data is perfect.</p><p>MCKEE: Well, when you say the dollar strengthens, what do you mean? I mean how strong does it have to get?</p><p>Right now, we're nowhere near where it peaked earlier in the year. And as Bill Dudley said yesterday, isn't that the point?</p><p>GOLUB: You know, if you look at the big things that have happened recently, the expectations for the industrial sector and for anything which is more global trade oriented in terms of S and P 500 stocks, those companies have taken off like a rocket and the expectations for their earnings are up huge.</p><p>The energy sector is - you know, oil prices have kind of recovered, and it takes tremendous pressure off of the banking sector and the whole - all the capital markets. The risk in the whole market falls down.</p><p>That whole set of issues is really what I think the Fed should be or will need to be looking at. If the market thinks they're going to move in June and is willing to swallow it and not get concerned that oil prices are going to roll over again -</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>GOLUB: - (inaudible) starts to roll over, then you're fine.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, but you worked with one of the guys doing the best work on wage dynamics, Mr. Porcelli. I agree with everything you're saying about oil and dollar, and the correlations, and all that, and how it comes into Fed policy. And DXY, folks, as I showed Monday or Tuesday, is just back into the strong dollar range, nowhere near new dollar record strength.</p><p>But Porcelli is looking at the wage growth dynamic. When you read his work, what do you see?</p><p>GOLUB: What do we see? We see five percent unemployment, and job growth is strong enough that that number is - you were talking about Dean Maki before expecting that unemployment rate to fall into the mid-fours or lower.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>GOLUB: You have inflation right now, if you look at the data that just came out this week. You have core CPI running over two percent. And wages are running ahead of core CPI.</p><p>The economic data tells you -</p><p>KEENE: That Bill Dudley is right.</p><p>GOLUB: The Fed - the Fed should have moved a long time ago and interest rates would be - I don't know - 100 basis points higher than it is today.</p><p>But what they're really nervous about is disrupting not just the market, but disrupting the economy. And mind you, we're having ...(.) So I think that's their concern. But if you made Tom Porcelli the head of the Fed, or most economists on Wall Street, I think they would tell me that is still true.</p><p>KEENE: Mike, that's a scary ...(.) Do you think Mr. Trump would go for that?</p><p>MCKEE: Don't even - don't even ...(.) Let me rip up the script and change gears from that direction here and point out that what you would expect and what happened on Wednesday afternoon was that financials gained when the idea of a June move came on, and utilities got hammered.</p><p>But yesterday, that reversed. I mean shouldn't that hold? Shouldn't we see - who is going to - in a June scenario, who does well?</p><p>GOLUB: Oh, in a June scenario, the banks are the single big winner. And the utilities, and the telcos, and the REITs are the single big loser. And the rest of the market incrementally companies that are a little bit more cyclical might weaken up a little bit like big industrial companies.</p><p>MCKEE: But the whole thing was - I mean we probably did ask you, but I was going to say if we asked you right before the Fed met in December, you would have said the financials because they're raising rates. But that didn't happen. The financials had a terrible quarter and went down.</p><p>Is it that are rates so low now that it really - you know, a little move isn't going to make a big difference in the financials?</p><p>GOLUB: Well, no, I think it's the opposite. The lower interest rates are, the more that the financials become sensitive to being pulled out by high rates.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>GOLUB: So if we were looking - if the ten year bond yield right now was three percent or four percent, I'll tell you right now nobody would care. You know, the banks won't care that much.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, you've been wonderful this morning talking about 20 multiple stocks and all that, up we go, the dynamics. Can you buy a PE of 10.52, a yield of 2.4 percent, three year dividend growth of 11 percent per year? They sell iPhones.

If hit by these regulations, the company could have to pay more to acquire\u00a0users, putting a dent in its bottom line. Google[1] made headlines after it was served with the largest fine in the history of the European Commission[2], but it looks like that fine may not be the end of the company's\u00a0troubles. The fine from the European Commission for about $2.9 billion\u00a0was levied because the company's search results for shopping queries were deemed unfair[3] by the commission, and the company has until September 28 to change its products to comply with the ruling. </p><p>Intelwas served a similar fine in 2009 when rebates it gave to its customers were deemed to hinder competition, but the company recently won an appeal[4], sending its case back to the lower court to be re-examined. Google, bolstered by Intel's victory, recently submitted an appeal[5]. According to Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC, the company may have a chance to win that case, but it is still in regulatory hot water across the globe. \"Recent developments lead us to highlight Googleas facing the greatest regulatory risk among Large Cap [internet stocks]. We are especially focused on the traffic acquisition\u00a0cost expense risk raised by potential EU action against Google's Android system,\" Mahaney wrote in a note to clients. \"Still, we are Outperform based on what we view as sustainable ...arce premium growth, significant option value and reasonable valuation.\" The biggest risk that Mahaney sees to Google's bottom line and valuation is the rising cost of acquiring\u00a0customers if several pending cases against the company are ruled in its opponent's favor. The company appealed one case it lost in European courts, but two others are currently in progress. The European Commission is looking into Google's dominant position in mobile through its Android platform[6] as well as its dominant position as a search advertising power. If Googleloses these cases, it could face a fine, but it could also be forced to split up some of its current offerings, making them more expensive to get in front of potential customers.For example, if Googleis forced to allow other companies\u00a0easy app store access on its Android operating system, acquiring users for its GoogleMaps or Youtube apps could become significantly\u00a0harder. \"The rub here is that the potential next EU regulatory action may well involve forcing Googleto 'unbundle' Android from its other services - Search, YouTube, Maps, etc,\" Mahaney explained. \"This, in turn, could provide negotiating leverage to OEMsand thus lead to potentially higher traffic acquisition cost expenses.\" Googleis expected to spend about $21 billion in 2017 to acquire its traffic, which is equivalent to about 22% of its revenue from Ad Sense, the company's biggest cash cow, according to RBC. For every 1% increase in this traffic acquisition cost, Mahaney estimates the company would lose about $0.40 from its 2018 earnings per share, or about 1%.\u00a0 Outside of the EU, Googleis starting to feel the heat from antitrust talk. Democrats in the United States came out with their \"Better Deal\" platform earlier this year,[7]\u00a0which includes a plank aimed at empowering consumers by taking on\u00a0the biggest \"corporate monopolies,\" like Google. Mahaney said several unnamed venture capitalists and silicon valley CEOs see antitrust as significant issue for the big tech companies in the future. Mahaney said a\u00a0venture capitalist he spoke with suggested that antitrust action against Googlemay be \"the first successful bi-partisan act in the US in 10 years.\" The increased regulatory pressure, both in the EU and the US, is all hypothetical right now. Googlemay win all its cases in Europe and never face the wrath of Congress in the US. The risk is there though, as Mahaney points out, and it's the company with the most regulatory risk in the \"FANG\" tech group. Mahaney\u00a0suggested that Googlecould be removed from the popular \"FANG\" acronym if it is hit with these regulatory issues. He is still bullish on Googlethough and rates the company as a buy with a price target of $1,050, about 11.23% higher than its current price of $944.93. Googleis up 16.99% so far this year.Click here to watch Google's stock price trade in real time...[8]<url

The FSI has done great work over the last two decades. I was a regulator when it was born, and have admired the work done under its two Chairmen, Josef Tosovsky and Fernando Restoy, ever since. Sadly, there has been no shortage of issues to address.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Financial Stability industry has expanded greatly in the last decade. As well as the Institute there is of course a Board. The IMF publishes a six-monthly Global Financial Stability Report. Every self-respecting central bank publishes one, and some regulators do too.</p><p>I have never sought to claim personal responsibility for this industry, but perhaps I can immodestly mention my part in it today. I am as certain as I can be that the first Financial Stability Review to be published was the one I launched at the Bank of England in 1996 [Ref 1]. In a review of FSRs Martin Cihak et al [Ref 2] credit it as the first edition. The first editorial was signed 'Prudence', which was an in-joke: Prudence was the name of my wife. Indeed it still is.</p><p>The Bank's FSR was both successful and unsuccessful. It has inspired a huge number of followers, over 50 of them by 2012 according to Cihak. But at the time our objective was to show that the Bank was concerned about financial risks. In 1996 we knew there was a chance that an incoming Labour government would strip the Bank of responsibility for banking supervision. It had not covered itself with glory in the Baring's debacle. So we thought it a smart move to publish a new report, in partnership with the Securities and Investment Board, then the UK's principal securities regulator, to show that we could do joined up analysis of markets. In that sense it was a failure. The Labour government did move supervision out of the Bank in 1997. Of course it has since returned there, but that is another story.</p><p>Enough prehistory. That was eleven years BC - before the crisis. Now in AC 12 we are still trying to understand what happened and why. I teach a course on the subject at Sciences Po in Paris. The ten year anniversary of the Lehman collapse late last year stimulated an outpouring of reminiscence, analysis and pet-theorising. Perhaps surprisingly, as time goes by there is if anything less and less consensus on the causes and appropriate responses.</p><p>Very few people are prepared to say that they think all the problems revealed have been solved, in spite of the wave of re-regulation which has washed over financial firms and markets - though there are some who insist that they themselves are now in fine shape, though sadly others are not yet in a state of grace.</p><p>Amidst this outpouring of commentary I identify three strands of opinion. At the risk of shocking this earnest, high-minded audience I have characterised their views by reference to three popular songs.</p><p>The first argument, which one does hear from some bankers, owes a lot to the Pink Floyd song 'The Wall' with its memorable refrain ' We don't need no education. Hey, Teachers, leave our kids alone'.</p><p>The drift of the argument is that we banks have had a little shock, we have learnt our lesson, we have understood the importance of a bit more capital, and the regulators can leave us alone, safe in the knowledge that we will not misbehave again.</p><p>There is some substance behind this argument. Certainly it is true that banks' capital ratios have been greatly strengthened. In many cases banks now operate with 4 or 5 times the capital they had at the onset of the crisis, and it is better quality capital too.</p><p>But I am not in the Pink Floyd camp. (I was never much of a fan in fact). Perhaps that is because RBS was one of the worst affected banks. Indeed some might argue that it was the worst affected. There were many ways of getting into trouble, from operating with a very thin capital cushion, through making unwise acquisitions, to simple bad lending. RBS managed a full house of problems, so we know that higher capital is not the answer to all problems. I am mindful of Bagehot's observation that 'no amount of capital will rescue a bad bank.' There is more to bank reform than higher CET1 ratios, and some of the cultural changes needed are far harder to implement.</p><p>But nor am I in the group which camps at the other end of the spectrum, who regard the increase in capital so far implemented as hopelessly inadequate - the school represented by Anat Admati, Martin Wolf [Ref 3] and others. We might call this the 'Too much is never enough' school. In fact the words of the Loren Allred song 'Never Enough' are remarkably apposite. She sings 'Towers of gold are still too little, those hands could hold the world but it'll, never be enough.' Not all bank capital is held in physical form these days, but let that pass.</p><p>I am not persuaded that it would make sense to impose further significant increases in required capital for banks. The Basel Committee's own analysis suggests that the additional insurance protection bought against potential defaults would come at a high price. Severe stress tests in several jurisdictions suggest that banks could now survive adverse scenarios which Mark Carney has described as 'biblical.' He asserted recently that 'Banks in most regions are now more likely to be stabilisers rather than amplifiers of shocks' [Ref 4].</p><p>But there is one aspect of the argument that should give us pause. It is true that investors have not yet been fully persuaded that banks are good homes for their money. The price to book ratios of most international banks have remained stubbornly low. Larry Summers has argued that the franchise value of banks has declined [Ref 4]. My own view is that the decline has more to do with a changed competitive environment in which new competitors with better and cheaper technology are competing business away from traditional banks. Profitability has declined [Ref 5]. That, combined with very low interest rates for a long time, explains much investor reluctance.</p><p>A third strand of argument, with which I have more sympathy, is sometimes described as the Whackamole theorem. Pursuing my popular song theme I prefer to characterise it as the 'close the door they're coming through the window' argument. In other words, by clamping down on banks, forcing them to hold far more capital and reducing their ability to supply credit and take risks, regulators have pushed credit creation into the shadows, or to what the FSB now say we should call the NBFI sector [Ref 6].</p><p>The Non-Bank Financial Intermediation sector has expanded greatly in recent years. The total balance sheet size of the universe monitored by the Board has gone up by 9% a year in the last five years and now totals over $116 trillion, or 30% of all financial assets. Most of that expansion has occurred in Europe and North America, which account for 60% of the total. In terms of the type of institutions involved, the FSB describe the fastest growing subsector unhelpfully as 'other investment funds'. These are funds which are not classified as hedge funds or Money Market Funds.</p><p>The FSB does a thorough, meticulous job of aggregating the data, and monitoring the interconnectedness of NBFIs and banks. It says those connections are growing, and that the scale of NBFI means we must certainly monitor its development and maybe, probably, sometimes worry about it. Quite where that exercise in worrying might lead us is less clear. The regulatory environments in which these other institutions are differ from place to place and the powers regulators have to monitor them and intervene in their affairs vary greatly.</p><p>There are, however, some elements of the growth of non-bank credit which have been attracting more attention recently. That is true particularly of leveraged loans. In a speech in London [Ref 4] a month ago Mark Carney drew attention to a worrying development. He pointed out that 'relative to earnings, aggregate corporate debt in the US and UK is nearing its pre-crisis peak, and the distribution is worsening. In the UK, the share of highly leveraged companies is above pre-crisis levels. This is despite the very modest growth in investment.' One often-quoted measure is that BBB-rated bonds are now about half the market, compared to just a quarter in 2007.</p><p>Mark Carney points out that these trends are accelerating. The ratio of debt to EBITDA has risen remarkably in the last year. Where are these risky obligations held? That also differs from place to place. In the US, he tells us, 'banks and insurers own around one third of CLOs (usually the less risky tranches) compared to only 6% for European firms and 2% for UK firms'. For the most part they are held by funds which can afford to lose money, so do not pose systemic risk in the way banks subprime holdings did. But a bursting of that bubble would be troublesome nonetheless. And McKinsey analysis shows that overall market-funded corporate debt has risen sharply.</p><p>We should welcome the diversification of funding for corporates, which spreads risk around the system and enhances resilience, but the scale of indebtedness is striking. Of course the tax treatment of debt over equity encourages that growth. I was pleased to read last week that Randy Quarles has announced an FSB review of this part of the market.</p><p>Mark Carney is less concerned about the growth of debt in China, which has figured prominently in recent IMF reports. The growth rate has fallen back recently.</p><p>Public debt globally, however, does remain elevated post-crisis. Modern Monetary Theorists would have us view that as benign or even positive. Having lived through UK public expenditure crises in the 1970, and buyers' strikes in the gilt market, I am conditioned to regard high public debt as a problem that has to be dealt with one day.</p><p>So my whackamole worry list includes leveraged corporate debt, and public sector debt.</p><p>I also worry about the impact on the financial system, and on financial stability, of a number of new developments which cannot be regarded as crisis-related. Among them I include cyber risk, the impact of fintech on the viability of traditional banks, and particularly the impact of Big Tech. The FSB last month published a very interesting report [Ref 8] on the potential impact of large technology companies like Amazon, Google, Alibaba and Ant Financial, with their huge financial resources and ability to cross-subsidise, on the business of banking. One possible interpretation of the low rating of many large banks is that investors fear they may lose the more profitable parts of their business to these new competitors, leaving them running the financial infrastructure, for which they find it hard to charge adequately. The FSB worry that in these circumstances they may seek out more risky business to compensate for the loss of their past core profit sources. I hope we will be wise enough not to yield to that temptation, but I understand the point. My concern is more that the business models of banks may be threatened.</p><p>So my conclusion from a necessarily brief review of state of financial markets is that the banking system is far stronger, overall, but that debt levels remain worryingly high. As Adair Turner has pointed out [ref 9], a given rate of GDP growth seems now to require a larger increase in debt. He links that to the growth in income and wealth inequality, as richer deciles spend a lower portion of their income.</p><p>Growing inequality of wealth, in particular (income inequality has flattened or declined in some countries more recently) is also part of a worrying growth in the share of votes going to populist parties, in Europe in particular, and the associated growth in interest in policy proposals which have been largely off the agenda for several decades. I am thinking most obviously of protectionism and trade tariffs, but there are others. There has, for example, been a backlash against central bank independence in several countries. I will say more about that in a moment.</p><p>We can see the aggregate impact of these trends in the growth of uncertainty about economic policy. Baker, Bloom and Davis [ref 10] have developed an index of economic policy uncertainty, which is currently at a record high. That is not surprising, and suggests that the most concerning risk is the scope for damaging policy errors.</p><p>We have moved a long way from the mood in 2008-9 when successive G20 summits agreed a substantial reform programme, and implemented it with enthusiasm, using the FSB as their delivery mechanism; one has to question whether there is the same degree of mutual trust and shared interest today.</p><p>It is therefore regrettable that the opportunity to give the FSB a formal legal status, underpinned by an international treaty, was not taken in 2012, when it was under active consideration. At the time, the flexibility allowed by the FSB's informal status was seen as an advantage. That is much less clear today. There has been political pressure on the Fed to withdraw from it and other international bodies - so far resisted [Ref 11]. That resistance would be easier and stronger were the US and other countries to be signatories to a Treaty on International Financial Co-operation.</p><p>My co-author Maria Zhivitskaya and I have written about the limitations of voluntarism in a chapter in a forthcoming Oxford University Handbook on Global Economic Governance [Ref 12]. Those limitations are greater when countries lack confidence in each others' regulation.</p><p>Andy Haldane at the Bank of England wrote persuasively in 2014 about the need to manage global finance as a system [Ref 13]. He argued that financial globalisation has created 'larger than ever opportunities, but also greater than ever threats.' We should therefore turn 'the current non-system', replete with informal bodies of uncertain membership and vague powers, 'into one with an identifiable architecture.' Developments in the five years since he wrote that paper have only strengthened those arguments. Haldane was then mainly discussing the provision of financial support, and the possible creation of an international lender of last resort. Barry Eichengreen goes further and has argued for a 'World Financial Organisation' with the power to sanction members whose national regulatory policies are not up to international standards.' [Ref 14].</p><p>I think it unfortunate that these radical ideas were not taken forward at a time when there could have been the political will to do so. Now we are very far from that situation.</p><p>It would be idle, therefore, to advance these forward-looking proposals today. Realistically, we should try to preserve the elements of international consensus and co-operation we have and try to protect against other potentially damaging policy errors. These are the biggest worries we face today. They may not be the fractures which created the last crisis, but they could produce a new one.</p><p>I have little to say about the first and probably most concerning area - tariff wars. It is not an area of competitive advantage for me. The most recent signs in the US - China relationship are a little more optimistic, but tensions remain high.</p><p>The second area of concern is much closer to home. Almost three years on from our referendum the shape of the future relationship between the UK and the EU 27 remains unclear. Even after a withdrawal agreement is concluded, if it is, that will still be the case, as the political declaration which accompanies it is vague and aspirational.</p><p>Financial services, and financial stability, have not been as prominent in the painful debates surrounding Brexit as they might have been. Our government has prioritised other areas of the economy. So it is hard to know what new arrangements will emerge to manage the complex interactions between London's markets and the rest of Europe. The Bank of England assess the risk of a major disruption to financial stability of even a disorderly Brexit as relatively low. But they warn that in the longer term, without deep and comprehensive cooperation between the UK and the 27, there is a risk that we turn inwards towards closed markets which 'would, in turn, restrict cross-border investment, fragment pools of funding and liquidity, and reduce competition. The result would be higher costs of financing for households and business, less reliable access to finance and less resilient finance' [Ref 15].</p><p>One academic study of Brexit and Financial Stability, by Samitas et al. argues that the consequences would be more severe for the EU27  than for the UK [Ref 16]. That can only be a speculative conclusion, but it is clear that the ambition to develop a fully-fledged Capital Markets Union in Europe has suffered a setback, as a result of a popular vote in which the merits of open Capital Markets did not figure in the debate, and where the campaign revealed that arguments based on those assumptions, widely shared in the financial community and among economists, had no resonance at all. Warnings by the central bank and others were characterised as 'Project fear' designed to distort the democratic will.</p><p>More recently, when Governor Carney produced some carefully-worded comments warning against a disorderly Brexit, the Chef de file of the Hard Brexiteers, Jacob Rees-Mogg, characterised him as 'a second tier Canadian politician' and dismissed his arguments out of hand. In the not too distant past a senior spokesperson, of whichever party, would not have criticised a central banker in that way. He or she would have had more respect for the bank's independence, and recognised that ad hominem attacks could damage the credibility of the institution, from which we would all suffer.</p><p>But it is evident that the reverence for central bank independence has much diminished recently, and not only in the UK. President Trump has described the Fed as 'loco.' In India the RBI Governor was summarily removed. Mario Draghi is not exactly the favourite son of the new Italian government.<br/><br/>The growth of populist parties, with little commitment to independent institutions, especially where unemployment has remained high, has created a different mood.</p><p>A few years ago, we seemed to have reached an 'end of history' moment in which a kind of 'Basel consensus' governed economic policy making. Country after country converged on a model in which an independent central bank was charged with meeting an inflation target, which could be any number you like as long as it was 2 per cent. Fiscal policy was a completely separate matter, generally organised around the principle of a budget balanced through the cycle.</p><p>But history has restarted, as it often tiresomely does. On the fiscal side we have Modern Monetary Theorists arguing that fiscal deficits do not matter. Other more mainstream critics argue persuasively for more overt policy co-ordination. Bill White, well known in this jurisdiction, has pointed out that in recent years the monetary policy drivers have had their feet firmly on the accelerator, while regulators have been pressing hard on the brake [Ref 17]. Does that make sense, he asks? And plenty of voices can be heard arguing that central bank independence has had its day and that the masters of the universe in Basel should be cut down to size.</p><p>A recent poll of 70 economists organised by the CFM-CEPR showed that this rethinking has not extended to the economics profession [Ref 18]. Almost all of them agreed that CBI was still very important. But when asked if they thought it could be sustained their answers were very different. Almost a third think that it will not be possible to sustain the model we have operated for the last few years into the future, and that CBI will decline in Europe.</p><p>Why has the current of opinion turned? There is no single answer to that question. Listening to the critics one hears a wide range of arguments. Some focus on supposed policy errors made by central banks since the crisis - the ECB's 2011 decision to raise interest rates looms large. Others raise various forms of conspiracy theories, with central bankers conspiring to thwart the popular will in the interests of their banking friends. A version of that maintains that there has been 'political capture' of central bank boards [Ref 20].</p><p>A more persuasive set of arguments focuses on the unconventional policies implemented over the recent decade. Quantitative easing is a cousin of fiscal policy. Should not different forms of accountability and political control attach to QE? In fact that is the case in the UK, where the Treasury sets the quantum, leaving timing and method to the Bank of England. Then there is the argument that QE has a distributional impact, benefiting wealthier holders of financial assets. Central banks argue strongly that the total impact of QE has not increased inequality, but those arguments have not cut through the public debate [Ref 19].</p><p>There are critics, too, of the central bank role in macro prudential policy, which often focuses on particularly sensitive sectors like the housing market. Stanley Fischer has discussed the implications of that role for independence. The Fed is not fully independent in that area, while the Bank of England and the ECB are [Ref 21].</p><p>One of the more thoughtful reflections on the change has come from Paul Tucker, the former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, in his book 'Unelected Power' (Ref 22). It is a very careful analysis, leading to some interesting suggestions for a more robust accountability surrounding the central bank. In an interview about it he said 'The more power that you have that you don't really need, the more the political world will lean on you to influence the way you exercise your powers' [Ref 23].</p><p>This is a persuasive argument. However I would take it further than Tucker himself does. It is very striking that the great winners from the GFC, in terms of power and status, have been the central banks, in spite of the questions raised about their performance in the early years of the century as the tensions built. The Fed has gained responsibilities, the ECB now supervises 85 per cent of the European banking system, while the Bank of England is responsible for monetary policy, QE, macropudential policy, banking supervision and insurance supervision, a remarkable accretion of functions. As Tucker points out, such an accumulation of power creates 'the risk of a backlash.'</p><p>I might be thought to have an axe to grind here, as the first Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, since dismembered. Perhaps I do. But my principal concern is that we should protect the core of the central bank independence for monetary policy, which has brought many economic benefits. If adding non-essential functions threatens that independence it may come at a high price.</p><p>Certainly if one is to do so, the accountability framework needs to be robust, as Tucker argues. That is harder in the case of the ECB, unless the Treaty is changed, then it has been in the case of the Bank of England.</p><p>So to return, finally, to the examination question posed for me, I would answer that many of the problems revealed in the banking system and in traded markets have been addressed. 'Solved' is a dangerous word to use. The 'solutions' have created new incentives for non-bank finance, and the catchily-named NBFI sector needs to be carefully watched.</p><p>Furthermore, the broader question of the system architecture of global finance has been ducked. We still rely on a 'non-system'; in Haldane's phrase, and seem condemned to do so. The generally good relations between central banks provide some comfort, but the political pressures on those actors have grown, and their legitimacy is questioned. I applaud the efforts made by some central banks to engage more effectively with citizens in recent years, but the political climate in which they operate remains challenging. As one of the leaders of the UK's Pro-Brexit campaign memorably said 'people in this country have had enough of experts' [Ref 24].</p><p>If we do move into the age of amateur, populist central bankers and supervisors there will soon be many new fractures in the financial system - and they will not be hidden.\"</p><p>References</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] Financial Stability Review.

Could your panel again provide a checklist of tech issues to be aware of, plan for in 2008?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mobile banking seems inevitable. But there seems to be no uniformity in platforms and security and we\u2019re hesitant about investing tech dollars here. Does your panel agree?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Christine Pearsall, VP-marketing and sales support, Summit Information Systems, Corvallis, Ore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Employing technology to increase marketing ROI and improve risk monitoring are two strategic objectives that should be on every credit union\u2019s radar for 2008.</p><p>Invest in technology to exceed the sales results of traditional marketing methods. The key is having the ability to tap data from many sources to identify members who are both qualified and likely to accept specific product offers. With this valuable information, offers can be delivered through existing electronic channels at every member interaction.</p><p>The goal is to deliver the right offer at the right time to maximize your investment of electronic channels, such as ATMs, IVR and Internet banking solutions. A Summit client who adopted our NEXT multi-channel marketing technology experienced a $5-million increase in their credit card portfolio, along with dramatic increases in investment referrals, and home mortgages through ATM offers\u2013all within the first five months of operation.</p><p>Another goal for 2008\u2013eliminate labor-intensive BSA compliance tasks. By investing in technology that automatically monitors transactions for any traces of suspicious activity this can be achieved. </p><p>Today\u2019s best risk technology solutions such as Fiserv\u2019s NetEconomy include tools for anti-money laundering, fraud detection, case management, investigation, and automatic report generation.</p><p>The time saved in monitoring, investigating and reporting can save hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. Best of all, staff are freed up to provide personalized services to your members.</p><p>Dan Chaney, VP-business development,</p><p>Teres Solutions, Austin.</p><p>We believe there are two big tech issues most CUs will need to be aware of.</p><p>1) As the credit crunch seeps into the auto market, credit unions will need to be even more careful when handling their auto loans. In order for them to compete without opening themselves up to too much risk, they\u2019ll need software to automate and quickly weed out the good from the bad. Lending automation technology can handle the volume of applications without wasting your time. There are several credit unions who are already auto-approving/denying nearly 40% to 60% of the auto loans they receive electronically from DealerTrack and RouteOne. It\u2019s essential to minimize risk and to handle the loan volume effectively.</p><p>2) In 2008, we\u2019re hearing that many CUs will explore new forms of lending, such as Retail financing. In order to incorporate new lending businesses into their portfolios, they\u2019ll need lending automation systems that can handle the particular nuances of these kinds of loans. We believe credit unions will invest in systems that are open and can handle such business expansion.</p><p>David McConney, EVP/General Manager, Credit Union Core Systems, Harland Financial Solutions, Pleasanton, Calif.</p><p>With the multitude of technology applications available to financial institutions, it can be difficult to wade through the choices and determine what to consider and what to bypass.</p><p>Popular technologies, such as mobile banking, should be considered if the demand exists within your membership. Tighter security measures, such as biometrics, should always be a consideration.</p><p>Following is a brief list of some things to think about as well as possible issues to be aware of in 2008:</p><p>* PCI Audit Execution Plans\u2013requirement that no system can store card numbers without using encryption.</p><p>* Encryption of Data Execution Plans\u2013field-level (e.g. PIN and card-level), back-up media, in-flight, and at rest data.</p><p>* Mobile Banking\u2013(Bank of America \u201cclaims\u201d 500,000 users) and the demand is coming.</p><p>* Biometrics\u2013increasing in popularity for additional security measures.</p><p>* Phase II of Multi-Factor Authentication\u2013 the industry is 12-months smarter since the original roll-out.</p><p>* Staff Education and Training\u2013ongoing staff training and retention programs as well as knowledge management are becoming more and more critical to the success of financial institutions.</p><p>* System Utilization\u2013ensuring full system utilization of technology, particularly core systems, to fully leverage the investments and improve efficiency and growth potential.</p><p>* PCs being shipped with Vista\u2013ensuring all existing and future applications function properly on Vista.</p><p>Tom DeSot, EVP of Vulnerability Research &amp; Regulatory Affairs</p><p>Digital Defense, San Antonio, Texas</p><p>Probably the biggest issue I would watch for in 2008 would be the use of data encryption technologies within the institution. As data breaches make headlines more and more, it\u2019s almost a sure thing that the regulators are going to start to take a harder look at what institutions are doing, and not doing, to protect member data while in transit or at rest.</p><p>While encrypting drives for remote users and on corporate laptops utilized by staff during SEG visits, etc. is a great first step, there are a multitude of other potential breach points that the institution should consider as part of their overall data protection strategy.</p><p>To ensure that these points are appropriately captured and analyzed, each institution should ensure that data encryption strategies are reviewed as part of their enterprise risk assessment process.</p><p>By doing so, they ensure that whether the data resides on their core processing system, a Blackberry utilized by the CEO, or in a vendor data center, that the appropriate measures have been taken to safeguard the information in the event of a breach.</p><p>Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p><p>John Schooler, SVP, General Manager Real Time Systems, Fidelity National Information Services, Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p>1. Any initiative that can be labeled as \u201cgreen\u201d will be increasingly popular going forward. Certainly, the elimination of paper statements and notices via e-delivery methods will continue to gain popularity along with \u201cgreen branches,\u201d etc. </p><p>2. Mobile banking is clearly at the top of everyone\u2019s holiday list this year.</p><p>3. Microsoft Vista seems to be ready for prime time. Expect to roll it out enterprisewide. There are some really cool features to take advantage of. Same with Office 2007.</p><p>4. While U-Deposit (home banking commitment to mail in a deposit) has had some adoption, the better approach will be Remote Deposit Capture, enabled by maturing image exchange technologies. This will entail the member using a home device to capture the check image and transmit it directly to the credit union instead of depositing a paper check.</p><p>5. Workflow automation will continue to grow in demand as products, services and credit union processes become more complex and under increasing regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>6. The push for fully integrated small-business deposit and lending isn\u2019t exactly new, but most credit unions haven\u2019t started integration, and they are one of the few engines to fuel future growth.</p><p>David Turner, CIO</p><p>IntegraSys, Frisco, Texas</p><p>One major technology issue we\u2019re seeing is the need for automated tools that support regulatory requirements, particularly those associated with BSA/AML.</p><p>The amount of detail required for these regulations has become too complex for most any institution to manage manually and we expect to see a rise in sophisticated technology support tools.</p><p>We think regulatory compliance will quickly become both an industry issue and a technology issue since the tedious investigation processes are not only taxing for the credit union\u2019s staff to accurately perform manually, but can also result in errors and potential penalties.</p><p>To address this complex industry problem, we\u2019re making it a priority in 2008 to deliver advanced, integrated tools that enable our clients to automate workflows, assignments and task check lists\u2013ultimately saving them time and money as well as helping ensure compliance.</p><p>Our NetEconomy solution will also feature electronic imaging capabilities that support case management requirements so credit unions can eliminate inefficient paper filing systems.</p><p>And the new tools will support automation for structuring and trend analysis\u2013one of the key areas where credit unions are falling short with examiners\u2013enabling our clients to show the flow of funds to and from accounts within their credit union and beyond with the click of a button.</p><p>Doug True, President of FORUM Solutions, Indianapolis</p><p>Mobile banking in some form is going to be a table-stake for credit unions, meaning that it is going to be the same as internet banking in the future\u2013a must have. However, today I see so much hype around mobile banking that I am worried credit unions are going to jump in without asking their members what they want to accomplish with such access. A recent study by Forrester Research found that 72% of online consumers have no interest in having financial information on their mobile device.</p><p>Sixty-nine percent of online banking and bill pay consumers say they are not interested. The Forrester data reports that 16% of text-messaging Gen Y are interested in having financial information on their mobile device, but at this time this represents a small niche.</p><p>My suggestion, and the approach FORUM Credit Union is taking, is to engage in a low-cost pilot to experiment with how mobile banking will be used by your members. FORUM\u2019s first step in mobile banking will be to offer a text messaging service that leverages our online chat staff to deliver a high touch option for members wishing to perform transactions such as balance inquiries, last five debit transactions, funds transfer, etc.</p><p>This affords us to get in the game without making a large technology investment and to gather real time market intelligence to make better decisions on this channel. I would even suggest looking outside the credit union industry to see how other industries are embracing the mobile channel (Papa John\u2019s Pizza, for example).</p><p>Frank Catucci, First Bristol FCU</p><p>Bristol, Conn.</p><p>Mobile banking is growing beyond being just a curiosity for many credit unions and banks alike. The reality is our members and consumers are going to be expecting this type of account access in the near future. This is a new technology that is getting closer each day for mainstream implementation, but in my opinion maybe just not quite yet. My main hesitation is the amount of time this new technology has been available and running in a live production environment.</p><p>I believe a little more time testing and weighing security risks and counter-measures will be beneficial. I feel it will become an accepted method of access that will have proven itself given just a bit more time and testing. We are close and getting closer each day. This is something we need to keep in mind as the inevitable implementation edges closer. Planning and discussion should not fall behind.</p><p>Security and uniformity is a concern I have heard people having and maybe rightfully so, but there is hope. As for uniformity in platforms and security, there is definitely progress being made. Understanding just how mobile banking works can be confusing as well. As of right now there are only really three different ways in which mobile banking can take place: SMS-based, browser-based, and application-based. In my opinion the battle here is between browser-based and application-based access.</p><p>The first assumption may be that browser-based access is the natural choice, but as Internet browsing and online access from your PDA or cell phone increases so does the risk. Risks of mobile malware and viruses are real and will increase. This is a factor that may help application based access edge out the competition.</p><p>There are multiple vendors currently offering application based solutions that are compliant to NCUA and FFIEC two-factor authentication guidelines. Right now it appears as if AT&amp;T is an early leader in it\u2019s application based cell phone solution although other appear to be close on their heels.</p><p>Surely Verizon and other major carriers will have their own version to follow. This very competition and version evolution will naturally strengthen the product and therefore speed up its readiness for future implementation.</p><p>In conclusion, you may not be ready to take the risk or spend the dollars on this new technology, but maybe planning for it in the next one to three years should not be out of the question.</p><p>David Turner, IntegraSys</p><p>Certainly mobile banking is the next big thing for the Internet banking industry. \u201cOnline Banking Report\u201d predicts that one-million households will leverage the convenient service by the end of 2007, and 10 million households will be using mobile banking by 2010 with rapid adoption continuing thereafter.</p><p>For credit unions, it can be daunting to take on the task of selecting a mobile banking provider. But since mobile banking should be a seamless extension of a credit union\u2019s Internet banking services, it\u2019s best to work directly with your existing Internet banking provider, or find a new provider who can offer a broad portfolio of online services, including mobile banking.</p><p>Since members will most likely be accessing the credit union\u2019s mobile banking services from a wide range of devices, including cell phones and PDAs from disparate service providers, we can\u2019t expect much uniformity in platforms and there\u2019s no question that a credit union\u2019s Internet banking provider must have the connection points and security controls in place to deliver Internet banking data to the broadest range of personal devices.</p><p>Our Virtual Branch team has been offering mobile banking for more than a decade, so we can offer the support a credit union needs today and in the future.</p><p>John Schooler,</p><p>Fidelity National Information Services</p><p>There are a lot of emerging players and approaches in the mobile commerce space. Member adoption is inevitable, with convenience being the primary driver. Best advice\u2013start small, and start simple, but get started.</p><p>Capitalize on a strategy to win over consumers to mobile banking. Begin by offering limited services such as automated account alerts set by the consumer.</p><p>Expand services to payments as demand grows and the technology matures. Look for ways your institution can offset costs as mobile payments begin to catch on.</p><p>The main approaches today, from a technology standpoint, are short messaging service (SMS), commonly known as text messaging; wireless application protocol (WAP) and stand-alone mobile-application clients.</p><p>At FIS, we believe the latter holds the highest likelihood for consumer adoption. With this technology, the mobile banking application either is preloaded into a cell phone or PDA or downloaded from a website.</p><p>One day soon, you\u2019ll be paying for a cappuccino at your favorite coffee house, using a cell phone that emits a radio signal beamed to a contactless card reader, while also deducting 10% off the price with a virtual coupon that was downloaded to your cell phone when you entered the store.</p><p>Tom DeSot, Digital Defense</p><p>Mobile banking is still in the early stages of adoption. As such, just like any other new technology, there is a great deal of flux in the industry as it pertains to platforms and security.</p><p>For some institutions, implementing may be necessary due to the nature of your members, or it could simply be that every competitor in your market has already bought in, and you\u2019re beginning to see a resulting membership loss.</p><p>Regardless, institutions should take a hard look at any mobile banking technology prior to moving forward with implementation. At a minimum, the following topics should be discussed with your vendor(s) to determine if it is the right time to move forward:</p><p>* Security should be top of mind for your vendor. If the security of their platform is slide number 38 out of a 40-slide PowerPoint, that should tell you something.</p><p>At a minimum they should be able to outline for you how data is protected as it moves from the member\u2019s phone, or other mobile device, through their software, and ultimately to your core processing system.</p><p>Remember, many of these implementations will require the member authentication credentials, and data, to pass through their platforms long before it is ever seen in your institution.</p><p>Additionally, they should be able to describe how their software prevents the storage of authentication credentials on the member\u2019s phone or other mobile device. We\u2019ve all lost phones before and fretted over it because it had all of our family and friends\u2019 contact information stored on it. Imagine losing one that has your home banking credentials stored on it and the picture gets much, much worse.</p><p>* As with any new technology where there is no set platform standard, the institution needs to worry about platform obsolescence. For those of us old enough to remember the BetaMax/VHS battle, you already know what it\u2019s like to invest in a technology that doesn\u2019t make the grade. And as the philosopher George Santayana once stated, \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d</p><p>Make sure that the vendor can describe to you how their platform can and will evolve to meet the changing needs of the market. Does it run on a proprietary platform? What happens if that platform is \u201cend-of-lifed\u201d by the maker? Then what? Is the software you are evaluating so customized that only three people on the planet would be able to continue with enhancements if the vendor\u2019s principal developer left? How would they cope?</p><p>In closing, as with any other new technology, a full analysis needs to be conducted by the institution to ensure that the technology is really filling a need, and that the vendors that are providing the service are ready to bring their product to market in a solid, secure fashion.</p><p>Readers: Ask CUJ Technology Panel Experts</p><p>Readers can leverage the Credit Union Journal\u2019s panel of technology experts by submitting any technology-related questions to the panel Managing Editor Lisa Freeman at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lfreeman@cujournal.com\">lfreeman@cujournal.com</email> or by fax at 561-832-2939.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cujournal.com\">http://www.cujournal.com</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sourcemedia.com\">http://www.sourcemedia.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRUJNL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CABBB2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4RBY-GR00-TX2S-V03W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305422</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3043\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

These letters tell us what we did wrong and, occasionally, offer praise. Here, we present this week's Free for All letters.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's great that the city is taking big steps to enshrine go-go music as an art form and has enacted legislation to continue the legacy. But, for some reason, the Feb. 20 Metro article \"D.C. goes all in for go-go,\"\u00a0which reported on Mayor Muriel E.\u00a0Bowser's (D) approval of the legislation, did not tell us where the well-attended event occurred, referring to it only as \"an old church turned arts venue\" in Southwest Washington. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After some digging, I discovered that the venue does have a name - Culture House - and is on the premises of the historic\u00a0landmark\u00a0Friendship Baptist Church at 700 Delaware Ave. SW.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As one of the 5 W's of Journalism is \"where,\" the omission of this information in the story seems to be an egregious lapse. </p><p>              David Culp, Fairfax          </p><p/><p>It is a real shame that The Post's sports section chose to ignore the home debut of the District's latest professional sports team, Old Glory DC, which played the current national rugby champions, Seattle, on Feb. 16 at Catholic University. The Going Out Guide was all over it, as was the enthusiastic sellout crowd, which, in a major shock, saw the local team take down the champions 28-22.</p><p>Rugby is a great game, and it is thriving locally,  but so much more would be possible if the local paper's sports desk would take a small step out of its comfort zone and deign to cover it.\u00a0</p><p>             David J. Nolan, Washington          </p><p/><p>The Feb. 13 editorial \"Justice, diminished\" said, \"given the crimes of which [Roger] Stone was convicted - and the fact that he was caught allegedly threatening a witness . . .\"\u00a0 Well, he was convicted, so there is no need for \"allegedly\" referring to the seven counts of obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering. He's a felon and will remain so - even if the president pardons him.</p><p>             Mike Creveling, La Plata          </p><p/><p>Hank Stuever contended in his Feb. 18 Style article, \"Unpacking the worries about\u00a0Amazon,\" that the recent PBS \"Frontline\" episode on the \"Amazon Empire\" lacked \"a wider reflection on the consumer's complicity in\" Amazon's somewhat Orwellian presence. It's true that \"no one forced us to hand over all our personal data and install Amazon's listening devices or surveillance cameras in our homes.\" However, equating Amazon's technological capabilities with the party's surveillance state in George Orwell's famous dystopia draws a false equivalence that serves to further shift the accountability from the party responsible - Congress - to  corporations and U.S. citizens.</p><p>Furthermore, our government - not companies - is  more cause for concern regarding a surveillance state with programs such as PRISM. Congress is the body that can and should do something definitive about regulating Big Tech. It has for years discussed privacy concerns and potential antitrust violations but passed little legislation.</p><p>Stuever noted that \"Amazon is in sore need of some corrective regulation.\" The best path forward will be regulation to protect individual liberties of Americans while not stifling innovation. Splitting up Amazon and other Big Tech companies would not only pose a legislative nightmare but also be grossly incompatible with continued innovation. (Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Post, is founder and chief executive of Amazon.) Congress needs to find a middle ground and act before it's too late.</p><p>             Arnav Bansal, Fairfax          </p><p/><p>The photo accompanying the Feb. 14 front-page article \"Measure to curb Trump's Iran options clears Senate,\" about the Senate's bipartisan resolution limiting President Trump's action on Iran, caught my attention.\u00a0</p><p>Not directly from the point of the article but from exquisitely capturing the continuing momentum of the civilization's male-dominated culture, persisting from antiquity into the 21st century. It shows a paunch of older white men, obviously the important movers,  shakers and policymakers (all identified) in the foreground and, in the background, two younger (by at least two generations) women (also white, but unidentified), pictured in their obviously subservient role.\u00a0</p><p>By now, this model should have been relegated to the ash heap of history. It is high time we add the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution.</p><p>             Richard Yorczyk, McLean          </p><p/><p>The Feb. 12 Style article \"The unicorn at Mike\u00a0Bloomberg's side\" on the respectable and intelligent Diana Taylor was a delight to read. The clear description of Taylor provided an honest and frank appraisal of who she is and who she wants to be. Her curriculum attests to her capacity and wonderful personal and professional experience.</p><p>Anyone, like Taylor, who accepts a public-sector position to defend consumers or investors from the overwhelming power of big finance or information technology deserves applause. I appreciate the portrait of a decent woman who enjoys sharing her life with a man who has proved all his life that he is a hard worker, strict with subordinates and encouraging with promising young people. </p><p>I was delighted to read the profile. It was first-rate.</p><p>             Mila Freire, Bethesda          </p><p/><p>Regarding the Feb. 15 Sports article, \"Williamson steals the show\":\u00a0</p><p>Zion Williamson may have entertained the crowd, but the National Basketball Association's Rising Stars Game's true MVP was Miles Bridges. At halftime, Team World led 81-71, and Bridges, a member of Team USA, sent out a tweet implying that his team would have a better performance in the second half. Consequently, with an explosive self-alley-oop off the backboard by Bridges, Team USA went on to win 151-131.\u00a0</p><p>Bridges, who led the comeback and had more points, rebounds, assists and steals than Williamson, rightfully earned the Rising Stars MVP award. While the crowd wanted Williamson to showcase his exquisite dunks toward the game's end, his forgettable and insignificant dunk attempts showed that the more popular player isn't always the more substantive player.</p><p>             Neil Rayala, Ashburn          </p><p/><p>Regarding Ersilia M. DeFilippis's Feb. 18 Health &amp; Science article, \"Too few know the signs of heart attacks in women\":</p><p>Though female patients may be unaware of the symptoms of heart attacks in women, the bigger issue is with the ignorance of male physicians. If a woman arrives at the emergency room knowing the implications of her symptoms, it is likely that a male doctor will dismiss  her symptoms or wait before ordering diagnostic tests. However, as DeFilippis said, in cardiology, time is muscle, meaning faster action means better chances for the patient.\u00a0</p><p>Previous research posits that women have a two to three times higher mortality rate when treated by a male physician. The difference is because there are more male physicians and male physicians have more difficulty identifying heart attack symptoms in women. Bias or ignorance are not the only causes of this disparity - female physicians tend to focus more on patient participation, while male physicians stick more to the facts, such as patient history.</p><p>Efforts to educate the general public are a good start. However, it is more important to mitigate the different practice behaviors of physicians and ensure that male physicians are well aware of the biases and issues related to female heart attacks.</p><p>             Michelle Song, Oakton</p><p/><p>My compliments to Post photographer Matt McClain for the evocative and painting-like photograph he took of a misty morning in Alexandria that accompanied the Feb. 13 Capital Weather Gang article \"As global warming makes D.C.'s climate more Southern, enjoy an Atlanta winter.\"</p><p>It's a photo worth keeping.</p><p>             Beatrice Fitch, Bethesda</p><p/><p>The Feb. 14 Sports article \"For the undefeated\u00a0Madison\u00a0girls'\u00a0basketball\u00a0team, it's the Year of the\u00a0Rats\" was refreshing. The \"team first\" mentality and joy this team plays with are reminders to all of us about the positive things sports, when done right, gives us, whether we are participants or fans.</p><p>Sports show us their best self when athletes play for the pure thrill and joy of competition, and this is clearly demonstrated by the comments of the Madison coach and her\u00a0players. Thank you, Madison girls, for showing us how great sports can be.</p><p>             Robert Gambarelli, Vienna          </p><p/><p>Steven Petrow's Feb. 11 Health &amp; Science essay, \"My parents aged at home. Is there a better way?,\" about his search for pleasant accommodations for his aging parents, included his reaction to visiting a senior village: \"Others relied on wheelchairs, canes, walkers and rollators. (Residents range in age from 62 to 105.)\" and \"A friend, in his early 80s, happened to be on the tour and whispered to me, 'I'd rather kill myself than be here.' \"</p><p> I am 81, active and not disabled, and I live in a senior village.\u00a0When I see my friends and neighbors using rollators, canes, electric buggies and walkers, I imagine their fate if they lived at home without the facilities that we have on this campus.\u00a0These folks would be trapped in their bedrooms, dependent on their family members, if indeed they were to have such devoted relatives.</p><p>I detect a subtle form of ageism deep within us all, sensitive as we might be. And I say hurrah for the availability of a variety of locations that we can afford that can provide us with security, health care and devices that salvage our independence. May I, and my friends and neighbors with whom I can visit every day, live to be\u00a0happy and healthy centenarians!</p><p>             Adrienne G. Cannon, Springfield          </p><p/><p>I usually look forward to perusing the Drawing Board on the Saturday op-ed page. The cartoons are almost always quite funny while dealing with current and topical issues. However, I have to say that I was especially affronted by the Feb. 15 Mike Luckovich cartoon showing the GOP releasing a Godzilla-like creature on the world with the face of a certain White House occupant.\u00a0 This was very hurtful and in very bad taste. It should be made very clear that Godzilla would not act as badly or as hurtfully as that occupant of the White House.</p><p>             Ray Diroll,\u00a0Springfield          </p><p/><p>Julia Ioffe's Feb. 16 Outlook essay, \"There's no point in fighting,\" had an unsupported premise, a misreading of the presidential debates and intra-candidate comments, and dismissed the power that comes with being president. The unsupported premise is that the Democrats will not gain an advantage in the 2021 Senate. Polling and other considerations lead the three leading political estimators - Cook Political Report, Inside Elections and Sabato's Crystal Ball - to indicate that a Senate majority is within reach. The misreading magnifies media reporting of every small sign of disunity, such as not shaking hands. In each debate, there have been many expressions of unity and promises to back the convention choice who will face President Trump. As Trump has disgustingly demonstrated, the president has a lot of power. Recapturing the administration has a lot of implications. A Democratic president with majorities in the House and Senate, even small ones, can pass federal budgets and other legislation. </p><p>The modest differences among candidate positions are easily unified as \"raise all the tax money you can from the most wealthy and spend it for progressive purposes.\" A Republican Party with a defeated Trump and a lost Senate majority is not likely to be a unified party.</p><p>             Pat Conover, Silver Spring          </p><p/><p>Former acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William B.\u00a0Taylor Jr. was puzzled by President Trump's concern with \"this little country . . . it's 44 million people. It's not that big a deal\" [\"Back home, Ukraine envoy ponders his surreal swirl,\" front page, Feb. 15].\u00a0</p><p>Was the ambassador's tongue firmly planted in his cheek? Ukraine's population is greater than that of  Poland, Canada or Australia. Its area is larger than that of Germany or Spain.\u00a0And it has strategic importance.\u00a0A \"little country,\" indeed.</p><p>             Paul Kamenar, Chevy Chase          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-b9d8d3a05a6711ea9000f3cffee23036</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9P-TPR1-JB4M-V235-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2039\"/><timeReceived>8:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 28, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

In France and New Zealand, hate speech laws overrule teachings on homosexuality that are native to the Jewish Tanakh, Christian Bible and Muslim Qur'an. Similarly, user agreements for the online services of Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Google and Amazon prioritize sexual identity and sexual orientation over freedom of religious expression.</p><p>As we witness increasing boldness of these tech companies in banning and restricting users on the basis of speech alone, we would be wise to consider what comes next. In the U.S., the First Amendment protects speech and religious exercise from government interference, but no protections are offered for the millions of citizens who must rely upon the corporate marketplaces and communications technologies that enable day-to-day commerce.</p><p>Today, we face two choices. We can demand that our elected leaders regulate big tech firms as a utility and force adherence to our existing Constitutional protections, or we can watch the American Experiment end as the unelected leaders of a trillion-dollar tech industry effectively abrogate the Constitution by creating and dictating their own speech standards.</p><p>Jack Wheeler, Hudson, Wis.</p><p>LEGISLATURE</p><p>We had the chance to show divided government can work, and blew it</p><p>I chuckled when I read that Minnesota is the only state in the U.S. to have a divided government. We have a Democratic House of Representatives and a Republican Senate. My hope was that this government would show the rest of the country that we could communicate with each other, find common ground and govern.</p><p>This is where my hopes were dashed, for Minnesotans and our elected leaders do not seem to rise above the bickering and lack of compromising that is sweeping this country.</p><p>We are Democrats and Republicans, not parties of \"no.\" Do our leaders really reflect their constituents?</p><p>We share common goals. With communication and compromise, we can all be \"winners\"!</p><p>Lisa Scribner, Roseville</p><p>BOUNDARY WATERS</p><p>I'm no seasoned gambler, but I don't like the odds of a mine leak</p><p>Full disclosure, I can't stand casinos. That rush of joy that comes when winning for me doesn't compare to the knot I feel in my gut when I dwell on what I've lost. I suppose it's fair to say that when it comes to gambling, I have a low tolerance for risk.</p><p>As to the question of whether or not we should allow copper-nickel mining inside the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness watershed, all I see is risk (\"Feds renew Twin Metals leases near BWCA,\" front page, May 16). Certainly Twin Metals Minnesota and Antofagasta, the international mining conglomerate that owns them, recognize risk. Invest X and hope to earn Y. If, in the end, Y is greater than X, it's a win. Risk, reward. Simple.</p><p>So what does a win look like for us in Minnesota? X number of jobs for X number of years and not one drop of polluted water touching the Boundary Waters? What are the odds of that? 2 to 1? 10 to 1? 1,000 to 1? Should we trust the science? The safety record of other such mines? Or should we just hire a bookie to work this out?</p><p>And what if we lose? Polluted water seeps in. Irreversible damage to arguably the most pristine water in our state. No. The stakes are too high. Any amount of risk, even a single drop of risk, is too great.</p><p>Please, let's not gamble the fate of our Boundary Waters. Let's not be the generation that fails our lakes and rivers. Instead, let's be smart. Let's be conservative. Let's be - Minnesotans.</p><p>Timothy Hennum, Minneapolis</p><p>IRAN</p><p>Push for sanctions and incentives; don't succumb to threats and bombs</p><p>I've been waiting hopefully for the Star Tribune editorial pages to offer some wise reflections on the drumbeat for war with Iran. Hugh Hewitt's recent commentary (\"Here's what Trump understands about Iran,\" May 17) is neither wise nor reflective. Rather, it is a disturbing ode to neoconservative arrogance.</p><p>Hewitt is goading President Donald Trump to let loose the dogs of war on yet another Middle East country, in this case a country that we have been meddling with in one way or another long before the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. When Hewitt writes that \"realism has returned to the national security establishment,\" the realists he writes about are some of the same people who convinced George W. Bush to invade Iraq on the phony belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Our soldiers are still dying for that mistake.</p><p>Hewitt casts former President Barack Obama's leadership and collaboration with other countries to achieve the historic nuclear treaty with Iran as \"appeasement\" - a barbaric distortion. There are those of us who believe sanctions and incentives toward diplomatic cooperation are better tools for coexistence than threats and bombs. It seems people like Hewitt are always willing to send someone else's kids to war.</p><p>The Star Tribune editorial staff owes it to readers to wade into deeper waters surrounding the current Iran-U.S. provocations and consider the ideological pollution that is so insidiously spreading. That ideological pollution is the real WMD.</p><p>Mary Christine Bader, Wayzata</p><p>\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7</p><p>Oh, if only there were an adult in the room to tell National Security Adviser John Bolton, \"No, John, you may not have another war until you finish the ones you already have open.\"</p><p>Steve Hoffmann, Anoka</p><p>GUN SAFETY</p><p>Don't reject the NRA - work with it</p><p>If we want reasonable gun legislation, we have to work with the National Rifle Association, not constantly bad-mouth the organization like Star Tribune editorial cartoonist Steve Sack does. The NRA has millions of members and they have millions of supporters besides their own family members. The NRA has worked for gun safety for decades. It makes sense to get their opinions and work with them. Nobody benefits by attacking the many good people in the NRA.</p><p>We should also work hard to address the growing mental issues facing many people. And remember: There are a lot of gun laws on the books right now. Let's enforce them.</p><p>Tom R. Kovach, Nevis, Minn.</p><p>U OF M BUDGET</p><p>Another way to cut school spending</p><p>If University of Minnesota President Eric Kaler is hoping to make additional budget cuts (\"U's $90M budget cuts called too steep, too slight,\" front page, May 15), he should look no further than his $900,000 compensation package for next year.</p><p>Isaac Mielke, St. Paul</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN55452863</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W57-R4F1-DYRH-901J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1162\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 18, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This even applies to the 'algos' as it's we who write their mechanistic marching orders. Thus, understanding human behavior can be helpful in assessing and anticipating market moves. There's no choice in the fact thatwe all need a philosophy[1]to live. </p><p>The sameholds for investing[2]. Thus, understanding the dominant market philosophies can potentially give us an investing edge. We can thank Tony Greer, the editor of theMorning Navigator[3], for doing just this. In a recentHidden Forcesinterview[4], Greer casually states the following:'I've been calling itfinancial postmodernism, Demetri (emphasis added). And I call it that because we just came out of a scenario where as we were getting the actual read on what the lockdown did to the economy and those literally ghoulish economic data numbers, the stock market was putting in massive upside rallies, right? And it was rallying off of the lows and it was rallying off of a spike low. So, it looked even more obnoxious that Wall Street is celebrating while Main Street is getting crushed. And that was sort of the new dichotomy that happened right through, jeez, I guess through April, May, and right into June. Where you're getting an economic data point on Friday of 9 million people unemployed and nonfarm payrolls and you're getting the S&amp;#38;P up 6% in the same day against the headlines of Dow up 1,000 on CNBC. And people are like, 'What the hell is going on here? What? Does Wall Street not care? Does the market not care?'' Tony Greer,Hidden ForcesEpisode 142 Greer's characterization of today's investment markets as financial postmodernism is as genius as it is obscure. Since mentioning it, I see parallels between today's investment markets and the postmodern philosophy everywhere. Perhaps teasing out Greer's identification can help make better sense of these seemingly insane investment conditions. What is Postmodernism Only recently did I stumble uponpostmodernism[5]. I never heard the term before and suspect few outside the halls of academia have either. While largely unknown, it's hard to escape postmodernism's effect on the culture. Investment markets are just one manifestation. Postmodernism is an intellectual movement with roots dating back to the 1950s in America. It's a mixture of philosophy and history that underpins much of the modern culture, and especially the political Left. While postmodernism's intellectual leaders may not be household names, many postmodern ideas are unfortunately commonplace. These include the beliefs that the U.S. is fundamentally racist, sexist, and shallowly materialistic; that Christopher Columbus is a villain; that one's ethnicity or race define one's politics; that Western nations exploit the less developed, and; that humans are a scourge destroying the planet. My introduction to postmodernism came viaStephen Hicks[6]. Hicks is a philosophy professor and author. His bookExplaining Postmodernism[7]masterfully does just that. It both outlines postmodernism's core tenets and maps its historical lineage from the end of the Enlightenment up to the present day. According to Hicks: 'Postmodernism's essentials are the opposite of modernism's. Instead of natural reality\u2014anti-realism. Instead of experience and reason\u2014linguistic social subjectivism. Instead of individual identity and autonomy\u2014various race, sex, and class group-isms. Instead of human interests as fundamentally harmonious and tending toward mutually-beneficial interaction\u2014conflict and oppression. Instead of valuing individualism in values, markets, and politics\u2014calls for communalism, solidarity, and egalitarian restraints. Instead of prizing the achievement of science and technology\u2014suspicion tending toward outright hostility.' Stephen Hicks,Explaining PostmodernismThe following chart compares postmodernism's perspectives with preceding philosophies'. Note that Hicks uses 'modernism' synonymously withEnlightenment[8]ideas and ascribes 'pre-modernism' to the dominant intellectual framework from 400 to 1300 CE. Source:Explaining Postmodernism Hicks's summaries are heavy, even for those steeped in philosophy. Nonetheless, the above is a useful framework for examining thezeitgeist[9]of the financial markets. Let's take it one step at a time to tease out postmodernism's various influences. Metaphysics Metaphysics sits at the base of all philosophic systems. It describes the nature of existence (the 'meta' moniker is not ironic). For example, are things simply as they appear (A is A in Aristotelian parlance), or can supernatural forces alter the natural world that we perceive? Hicks describes the postmodern view as: ' anti-realist, holding that it is impossible to speak meaningfully about an independently existing reality. Postmodernism substitutes instead a social-linguistic, constructionist account of reality.' Stephen Hicks,Explaining Postmodernism To me, anti-realism is the perfect description for today's markets. Many people assume that markets must continue to rise. That's what they've always done so that's what they'll always do. It's just the way the world works. The underlying causes and possibilities for change are almost ignored. Then there are those who see markets as distorted and disconnected from economic realities. Central banks and covert 'plunge protection teams[10]' are backstopping the equity markets to ensure that they never decline. There's no other explanation for their behavior given the mess the economy is in. To be honest, I see partial truths in both arguments. There's plenty ofevidence[11]for there being a 'Fed put[12]' and Donald Trump does make every attempt to pump the stock market. However, human prosperity continues to advance and there could be other potential reasons for the stock market's unrelenting rise (i.e. financial asset creation is lagging wealth's). Regardless, the market simplyis; it is an immutable fact. Treating it as such is a realist perspective. Rather than looking to conspiracies or a long term trend line that ignores thepath dependency of returns[13], this perspective should simply try to uncover the current market drivers and probabilities for change. To contest its state is to contest reality. It is an anti-realist stance. Epistemology Epistemology is another philosophy concept that I needed to look up two or three hundred times before I grasped its meaning. It's the science of knowledge formation. In other words, epistemology examines how we uncover truths about the world. Do we learn by using the scientific method or do we receive wisdom from revelations; and is there even such a thing as truth to begin with?! 'To say that we should drop the idea of truth as out there waiting to be discovered is not to say that we have discovered that, out there, there is no truth. It is to say that our purpose would be served best by ceasing to see truth as a deep matter, as a topic of philosophic interest, or 'true' as a term which repays 'analysis.' 'The nature of truth' is an unprofitable topic, resembling in this respect 'the nature of man' and 'the nature of God' ' Richard Rorty,Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity[14]According to postmodernism, there is no such thing as 'truth.' Knowledge comes from consensus. Thus, reality can be whatever we want it to be, so long as enough people believe it. How true this rings in today's world of endless market interventions. Central banks have adopted zero and negative interest rate policies, and are voraciously buying sovereign bonds, mortgage bonds, corporate bonds, 'junk bonds', exchange traded funds, and even equities outright (as of this writing, theSwiss National Bank[15]is a top 30 shareholder of Apple according to Bloomberg). What's the reason for all these drastic actions? Well, because thismisplaced concept of inflation[16]is apparently undershooting somearbitrary target[17]of course! (Huh?) Sadly, there is little concern for the separation of governments from the capital markets. This feature is conveniently ignored as if it were an accident. So long as webelievethese interventions produce prosperity it must be so. Never mind that monetary policy is just another price control with predictable effects; or that any attempt to tip the scale of markets only acts to destroy them and the immense prosperity they produce. We simply wish it were different so it must be so. Truth shmuth. This is the essence of social subjectivism. Human Nature We can even see hints of Postmodernism in how we view markets themselves. According to Hicks, postmodernism sees humans as pertaining to different groups that are in constant conflict. There are no individuals acting according to their own mind or for mutual benefit. Life is merely a zero-sum, social construction made up of competing teams. 'Postmodern accounts of human nature are consistently collectivist, holding that individuals' identities are constructed largely by the social-linguistic groups that they are part of, those groups varying radically across the dimensions of sex, race, ethnicity, and wealth. Postmodern accounts of human nature also consistently emphasize relations of conflict between those groups; and given the de-emphasized or eliminated role of reason, postmodern accounts hold that those conflicts are resolved primarily by the use of force, whether masked or naked; the use of force in turn leads to relations of dominance, submission, and oppression.' Stephen Hicks,Explaining Postmodernism This collectivism and conflict have analogues in financial markets. We rarely describe them as beneficial methods for allocating capital to individual companies, countries, and entities. They are more commonly considered ways to disperse wealth among competing interests. The characterization takes various forms such as profits vs. wages, shareholders vs. other 'stakeholders', Wall Street vs. Main Street, 'labor' vs. 'capital', and so on. Furthermore, only governments (i.e. force) can possibly arbiter these perceived conflicts. We must breakup 'Big Tech' monopolies, regulate business, and 'nudge' people in the direction of the 'common good.' Left to his/her own devices, the free human would destroy financial markets, modern economies, and the planet. Thus, the intellectual elite, who somehow lack these intrinsic faults, must plan every action. Ethics Ethics is the science that studies how we should act. Our defined purpose for living frames the context for these decisions. Thus, you will come to a different moral code by making your own happiness paramount than by putting all others' first (and your'slast). Hicks describes the postmodern take on ethics as egalitarianism. Here, the belief in equality does not mean political equality, but rather a metaphysical equality. In other words, it's not that we're unique individuals who should be treated equally under the law; it's that we're literally all the same: physically, emotionally, and spiritually. We differ only by our various group identities (but are interchangeable within our belonged tribes). Individual values are a myth. In my view, there's a parallel to passive investing. Today's investing context is quite small. Only returns and price fluctuations (i.e.volatility[18]) matter. What's yourSharpe ratio[19]? If its worse than passive indices with higher fees, watch out, outflows will likely follow. While maximizing returns is a key investment goal, it is not the only one. The value of investing cannot be divorced from theinvestor. Investing\u2014like all actions\u2014serves a purpose to an entity (person, pensioners, etc.). These needs areindividualized. Why should every portfolio maximize its Sharpe ratio? To be sure volatility is a admirable attempt to quantify investment risk. However, there's a whole host of other attributes like liquidity, governance, and political environments that may also suit an investor's preferences. While I'm sympathetic to the case for passive investing, I take issue with its limited dimensionality. It paints everyone's financial values with the same brush. This is the spirit of egalitarianism. Politics and Economics Politics describes the appropriate rules for governing human social systems. Thus, it follows from one's deeper philosophic principles; politics do not stand on their own. Capitalism is the application of individualism in ethics to a group setting. Collectivism (socialism, communism, fascism, etc.) results from viewing people as parts of various factions. In other words, what we think of the goose dictates our prescriptions for the gander. According to Hicks, postmodernists are rationalizing socialists. Their world views logically lead them to collectivism. However, the postmodernists have a problem. Socialism's historical record is disastrous. Whenever (and to the extent) it's been implemented, misery, poverty, death, and destruction have followed. Furthermore, not only have dire predictions for capitalism failed to materialize as postmodernists expect, but it created unimaginable prosperity. What's a postmodernist to do when his/her beliefs are in such stark conflict with reality? Simple, just ignore facts and invent a good narrative. After all, there is no truth, so go spin a good story and exercise some power. 'Postmodernism, Frank Lentricchia explains, 'seeks not to find the foundation and the conditions of truth but to exercise power for the purpose of social change.' Stephen Hicks,Explaining Postmodernism What could be more postmodern than Mario Draghi's'whatever it takes' speech[20]. Given in a July 2012 address at the Global Investment Conference in London, the serving President of the European Central Bank (ECB) stated the following with respect to the European Union: 'When people talk about the fragility of the Euro very often non-Euro area member states or leaders, underestimate the amount of political capital that is being invested in the Euro. Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to dowhatever it takesto preserve the Euro (emphasis added). And believe me, it will be enough.' Mario Draghi Draghi's comment is laughable. Maintaining the Euro is well beyond the ECB's power to control. However, it's a clear instance of rhetoric trumping facts. There are plenty more. Take quantitative easing (QE) for example. It's failed to deliver on its original promise and only resulted in more. How about Japan's monetary policies? They are the model for most major central banks, yet the Bank of Japan's efficacy is wholly ignored. It's as if central banks throughout the Western world are simply competing to one-up the next. There's no evidence that their theories are correct. Yet, they remain popular. There are other ways too. Failure is not tolerated. In policy, it's ignored. In industry and markets, pain is collectivized for the greater good of 'the economy', or 'the workers', or 'the nation', or pick your group. Bailouts are now commonplace. Policymakers and central banks reflexively act to prop up all markets, as one. We're a far cry from capitalism. When and Where Just as postmodernism got its start in the late 20th century, so too did the current market's philosophy. While Alan Greenspan's reign as Fed governor may seem like its origin\u2014after all, he's the father of the 'Fed put' due to his attempts to prop up investment markets\u2014I believe Richard Nixon's presidency is a better starting point. It was Nixon who ushered in the modern era of fiat currency. By removing the dollar'sobjective standard of value[21], its worth became completelysubjective. We now must rely upon official releases riddled withvague adjustments[22]to gauge its purchasing power. We can't ascertain it ourselves. The dollar became a social construct! This lack of objectivity, self-reliance, and autonomy has postmodernism's fingerprints all over it. Our Postmodern Markets The financial postmodernism that Greer astutely notes is merely a reflection of the culture. Many of the philosophy's absurd beliefs have parallels in the investment markets. This manifests in heavy-handed regulations, endless interventions, and a neurotic obsession with markets' continual rise to name a few. The investment markets are a far cry from a capitalist utopia\u2014no surprise given our world views. As investors, identifying the dominant ideas being expressed in the economy can be a useful edge. After all, markets are nothing more than an aggregation of human interactions. Understanding how an investment culture behaves might allow us to better anticipate how investors will integrate new information into price movements. These fluctuations may differ whether pre-modernist, modernist, or postmodernist principles are dominant. Greer's anecdote illustrates this perfectly. The equity market rise following 'literally ghoulish economic data' surprised many. To be sure, this is a complex research topic worthy of deep exploration. We merely scratched the surface in this article. Hopefully though, we uncovered some ideas that can help us better read the market's mind, see around corners, and grow our p&amp;#38;ls.

The sight of any company paying a firm to leverage anti-Semitic and antisocial sentiment on its behalf is, to put it very politely, not a good look. For Facebook, whose platform is aflame with socially divisive fakes, it\u2019s bombshell bad news. Although it\u2019s not the only tech firm caught tapping Definers\u2019 oppo research tactics. A piece of internal moves news the PR firm emailed us last month, in happier times for its own reputation, containing promotions and personnel moves in its Washington office, enthused about Definers adding \u201cthree new team members to its Bay Area office in California.\u201d \u201cToday, Definers is a team of 40 with locations in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and an affiliate operation in London,\u201d the upbeat announcement ended. </p><p>How well the Definers brand survives its brush with Facebookremains to be seen. Tarnishing Facebookwas quick to issue a rebuttal to the NYT article, claiming it had never asked Definers to generate fake news or anti-Semitic memes in an attempt to smear its critics. But it could not deny it had hired a mudslinger in the first place, raising questions about due diligence, business oversight and, well, whether Facebookhas any self perspective at all in the midst of a global brand trust scandal. Zooming out for a second, you do also have to pause and wonder at quite how radioactive the corporate culture must be when the \u201csolution\u201d to a string of hugely damaging disinformation scandals is to reach for whataboutery and even actual fake news, as the NYT has claimed, to try to muddy the waters in your favor. It\u2019s almost as if manipulation is in the corporate DNA. Though, again, Facebookhas decried knowledge of exactly what Definers was up to on its behalf. Yet not knowing isn\u2019t any kind of defence when your business stands accused of defective oversight, self-serving opacity and having a vacuum where its moral compass should be. Accountability? Facebook\u2019s algorithms keep saying no. It\u2019s still not clear which individual (or individuals) at Facebookactually signed on the line to put a controversial PR outfit to work slinging mud on its behalf. In a call with reporters the day after the NYT story broke, Facebook\u2019s founder <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>claimed not to know \u2014 suggesting: \u201cSomeone on our comms team must have hired them.\u201d He then went on to imply \u2014 in the same breath \u2014 that there could be more skeletons in the closet, reaching for his favorite solution to self-made scandals (another self-audit), by saying: \u201cIn general we need to go through and look at all the relations we have and see if there are more like this.\u201d As we reported earlier, Facebook\u2019s comms department has a bunch of ties to Definers. While Joel Kaplan, its longtime chief lobbyist, looks a very likely candidate for an intimate acquaintance with \u201coppo research\u201d dark arts \u2014 if indeed COO <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg </nameText></person>is in the clear on this one. But without an actual answer from Facebook, we\u2019re left to speculate. Meanwhile, Facebookusers, investors and lawmakers should absolutely be left staggered at the WTFuckery of all this. How is it possible that no one in senior Facebookmanagement knew what its left hand was doing? Where was even basic oversight of its own crisis PR response? And who in its exec team actually feels accountability for all these fuck-ups since no one with actual responsibility has fallen on their sword (though CSO Alex Stamos left recently, apparently of his own volition) \u2014 despite 2018 being another annus horribilis for Facebook, with a freshly cracked Pandora\u2019s box of privacy scandals, trust breaches and PR own-goals. Zuckerberg\u2019s artful political question-dodging on home turf and over the pond, in the European parliament, has merely served to further enrage lawmakers who \u2014 much like journalists \u2014 really don\u2019t like being fobbed off with PR guff. As a strategy, the tactic necessarily burns its own runway. And it already looks to have boxed in Facebook\u2019s leadership. This is also \u2014 let\u2019s not forget \u2014 the year that Zuckerberg made it his personal mission to \u201cfix Facebook.\u201d Frankly he might have had more success with another f-word. Mud sticks Whoever at Facebookmade the call to bring in Definers opened the door to dirt-digging and smear tactics that are euphemistically passed off in political circles with the vanilla-sounding label of \u201copposition research.\u201d More knowingly it\u2019s referred to as \u201cthe dark arts.\u201d The basic modus operandi is to locate (or indeed generate) selective information and seed it to the media (or, nowadays, the socials) with the intention of discrediting an opponent. These tactics are typically associated with the free-for-all of campaign-season politics. And even there it\u2019s always a dirty, unpleasant and ugly business. Smear tactics and cynically spun counter-narratives are also of course the bread and butter of murky interest groups seeking to manipulate public opinion without disclosing their actual agenda (and funders). Plenty of wealthy individuals and industry groups have been fingered on the non-transparent lobbying front. And social media platforms like Facebookhave, ironically enough, made it easier for shadowy agenda-pushers to deploy astroturfing techniques to mask and pass off their self-interested lobbying as grassroots activism \u2014 and thus to try to shift public opinion without being caught in the act. Facebookengaging a PR firm to fling mud on its behalf squares this virtue-less circle. And the connective tissue is that all these self-interests are being very well-served indeed by unregulated social media. Since the NYT story broke, Facebookhas claimed journalists were well aware that Definers was working on its behalf. But the truth is rather murkier there, too. We checked our inboxes and none of the pitches Definers sent to TechCrunch made an explicit disclosure that the messages they contained had been paid for by Facebookto push a pro-Facebookagenda. They all required the recipient to join those dots themselves. A proper journalist engaging their critical faculties should have been able to deduce Facebookwas the paying customer, given the usually obvious skew. But if Definers was also sending out this stuff (and indeed worse things than we were pitched) more widely, to content seeders and fencers that trade on framed outrage to drive online clicks, their tasty-sounding tidbits would not have been so critically parsed. And angles they were pushing likely still flowed where they could influence opinion \u2014 thanks to the \u201cinverse\u201d osmosis of social media. (As far as we can tell none of the Definers\u2019 oppo research pitches that we received ended up in a TechCrunch article \u2014 well, until now\u2026 ) You might find it interesting\u2026 Here\u2019s an example of Definers\u2019 oppo mud-slinging we were sent targeting Apple and Google on Facebook\u2019s behalf:  Just came across this \u2013 thought you might find it interesting: <url normalizedValue=\"https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2018/08/21/google-data-collection-research/\">https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2018/08/21/google-data-collection-research/</url>  \u201cA major part of Google\u2019s data collection occurs while a user is not directly engaged with any of its products. The magnitude of such collection is significant, especially on Android mobile devices, arguably the most popular personal accessory now carried 24/7 by more than 2 billion people.\u201d  The study\u2019s findings are rather shocking\u2026 It really highlights how other tech companies should be looked at critically \u2013 scrutiny shouldn\u2019t just be on FB for data misuse. Apple &amp; Google have been perpetrators of data abuse as well\u2026 \u201cScrutiny shouldn\u2019t just be on FB for data misuse\u201d is the key line there, though it\u2019s still hardly a plain English disclosure that Facebookpaid for the message to be sent. We received multiple Definers\u2019 pitches on behalf of what looks to be three different tech companies \u2014 and only one of these is explicitly badged as a press release from the firm paying Definers to do PR. (In that case, e-scooter startup Lime.) We weren\u2019t entirely convinced even then \u2014 given the sender was a random public affairs company \u2014 and ended up emailing our own Lime contacts and CCing their press email to double-check. Generally, though, the Definers pitches we received looked nothing like traditional press releases. A different pitch that was also sent (we must assume) on Lime\u2019s behalf sought not, as the aforementioned press release did, to trumpet a positive PR goal (of Lime shooting to make its global fleet carbon neutral) but to fling dirt on rival scooter startup, Bird. Dirt doesn\u2019t fit in a traditional press release template though. So instead we got this email\u2026  I read your piece on Bird\u2019s custom scooter and delivery. Just wanted to flag that Bird\u2019s numbers seem off based on what they have listed on their website:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bird.co\">https://www.bird.co</url>/  They\u2019ve taken a bunch off the list. Seems odd since they just announced 100 cities two weeks ago. Thought you\u2019d find this interesting. Other similarly mudslinging Definers pitches we received included more fulsome info dumps in the body of the email \u2014 not just a link or few lines trailing something selectively \u201cinteresting.\u201d Sometimes these data dumps came with key lines highlighted. Sometimes there was also a chattily worded email intro (like the one above) to frame the content \u2014 typically including a clickbait-style appeal to journalistic curiosity. (The word \u201cinteresting\u201d seems to be a popular choice with Definers flaks.) At other times the pitches didn\u2019t include much or any foreplay at all. One \u201cICYMI\u201d email subject line pitch was introed in the email body text without fanfare \u2014 with just two words: \u201csee below.\u201d Another had no intro text at all. The \u201csee below\u201d content in the aforementioned pitch referred to this Mashable article \u2014 literally pasted word for word but with two paragraphs highlighted, drawing attention to the author\u2019s claim that the next iPhone \u201ccould have significantly slower LTE data speeds than competing Android phones;\u201d and to an \u201cindependent\u201d speedtest study cited in the article (which was actually carried out by a company owned by Mashable\u2019s own parent company\u2026 ) \u2014 and which the author concludes \u201crevealed just how inferior Intel\u2019s modems are compared to Qualcomm\u2019s latest modems.\u201d It\u2019s not yet been confirmed who Definers was working for to spread that particular cut-n-paste conjecture \u2014 but one obvious candidate is Qualcomm . (And for the why, the Mashable article includes an accidentally helpful pointer, noting the pair\u2019s legal disputes over patent royalties and Apple moving away from using Qualcomm chips.) Another \u201cICYMI\u201d cut-n-paste job that Definers sent us also targeted Apple \u2014 though likely, in that case, the mud was being flung on Facebook\u2019s behalf. Here the pasted content was this article, by the National Legal and Policy Center, reporting on an Apple shareholder filing a proposal for the company to make a report on human rights and free speech. So for free speech read \u201cFacebook\u201d as the most likely self-interested source. (The NYT article also suggested Zuckerberg was especially unhappy about Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly blasting privacy hostile business models \u2014 suggesting Facebookmight have been keen to find a way to throw shade at its claim to \u201chuman rights\u201d-based moral high ground.) As an aside, the Apple-China talking point surfaced by Definers via the aforementioned National Legal and Policy Center article is also, interestingly enough, something Facebook\u2019s former CSO Stamos has sought to hammer hard on in public\u2026 And while Stamos may have left the building at 1 Hacker Way, he\u2019s continued to speak up on behalf of his former employer and its choices in public \u2014 and liberally fling blame at Facebook\u2019s critics. That Facebook\u2019s ex-CSO is using the exact same attack points as Definers is interesting in terms of the PR alignment. How deep does that strategic \u201cinfowars\u201d rabbit hole go? Returning again to Definers, in another instance, the firm reached out to me via email to \u201cpass along some context\u201d after I wrote this article \u2014 about a tool created by Oxford University\u2019s Oxford Internet Institute to aggregate junk news being shared on Facebook. \u201cFacebookahas [sic] been working to curb the proliferation of this kind of news and there have been encouraging results from three different studies in the past month,\u201d wrote the flak, flagging three studies to back up his claim \u2014 summarizing them in short bullet points (without linking to the cited research). The \u201ccontext\u201d being pitched here boiled down to:  an academic study that Definers claimed suggested \u201cinteractions with fake news sites declined by more than half on Facebookafter the 2016 election\u201d;  a metric created by another university to measure the Facebookdistribution of the number of sites that share misinformation \u2014 again with the pitch claiming \u201cdramatic improvements\u201d for Facebookat the same time as flinging shade on Twitter (Definers wrote: \u201cThe metric was very high for Facebookin 2016 \u2014 much higher than Twitter\u2019s \u2014 but beginning in mid 2017 it was dramatically improved, and now Facebookhas 50% less of what the University of Michigan calls \u2018Iffy Quotient content\u2019 than Twitter\u201d);  and a study by a French newspaper looking at 630 French websites and claiming \u201cFacebookengagement with \u2018unreliable or dubious sites\u2019 has halved in France since 2015\u201d As another aside, Facebookpolicy staffers recently cited the exact same \u201cIffy Quotient\u201d metric in a letter to the U.K.\u2019s DCMS committee \u2014 which has been running a multi-month enquiry into online disinformation and trying (unsuccessfully) to get Zuckerberg to personally answer its questions \u2014 as part of several pages of \u201ccontextual filler\u201d Facebookused to pad out yet another letter to U.K. lawmakers that contained the word \u201cno.\u201d Committee chair Damian Collins was not impressed by Facebook\u2019s attention-sapping tactics. \u201cWe will not let the matter rest there, and are not reassured in any way by the corporate puff piece that passes off as Facebook\u2019s letter back to us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fact that the University of Michigan believes that Facebook\u2019s \u2018Iffy Quotient\u2019 scores have recently improved means nothing to the victims of Facebookdata breaches.\u201d Well, quite. Further reflections Facebook\u2019s approach to its own publicity brings to mind something that academic and techno-sociologist Zeynep Tufecki wrote earlier this year \u2014 when she asserted: \u201cThe most effective forms of censorship today involve meddling with trust and attention, not muzzling speech itself.\u201d Although, in that moment, she was actually talking more about online disinformation tactics than the distribution platforms themselves. Yet the point does seem to stand \u2014 when, in Facebook\u2019s case, the platform business appears to be reflecting (or, well, channeling, via its PR) the same problematic qualities that mire and/or bog down content on Facebook. Again, returning to how Definers sought to engage with us, in another more labor intensive episode, it pitched another TechCrunch journalist \u2014 ahead of a Senate Intelligence hearing which was attended by Facebook\u2019s COO, <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg </nameText></person>and Twitter\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey. But not by any senior execs from Google. Here the firm worked to flag up and critically frame Google\u2019s absence, after the Facebookadtech rival had declined to send either of the two C-suite execs the committee had asked for. \u201cHey\u2026 Are you covering Google\u2019s lack of cooperation for next week\u2019s Senate Intel hearing with Twitter &amp; FB? If so, let me know. May have a new angle for you,\u201d was its opening gambit to a TC colleague in an email sent on the last day of August (the committee hearing took place on September 5) \u2014 which earned it a \u201chappy to entertain a pitch\u201d response from the journalist in question. Definers then suggested a phone call. But after about an hour of radio silence it emailed again, now fleshing out its \u201cGoogle isn\u2019t taking the committee\u2019s concerns seriously\u201d angle:  I\u2019m sure this is on your radar, but wanted to flag something for you. Google isn\u2019t sending an exec to testify at next week\u2019s Senate Intel hearing:  From all reports on the Hill, it will be an empty chair. Given recent news that disruption campaigns have been launched by the Russians and Iranians, it seems very irresponsible on their part. After all, Google is not only the most powerful search engine, it also has one of the largest market shares on digital ads.  I think there is an interesting story on how Twitter and Facebook(while both are far from perfect) are taking the committee\u2019s concerns seriously and Google is absent.  Thoughts? Note the \u201cboth are far from perfect\u201d fillip aimed at Twitter and Facebookto lay down a little light covering fire for a reframed double-barrel assault on Google as the really big baddie for not even showing up. A few days later the same Definers\u2019 staffer pitched this reporter again, now the day before the Senate hearing \u2014 offering \u201can interesting backgrounder re the committee\u2019s members\u2019 campaign expenses for FB ads, campaign contributions from big tech, and the data tools senators are using to track visitors to their website.\u201d After getting through on the phone this time they emailed to hammer home a final thought: \u201cCheck out the attached docs \u2013 there\u2019s a level of hypocrisy here especially before tomorrow\u2019s hearing with FB &amp; Twitter.\u201d More smear tactics \u2014 now aimed directly at the lawmakers who would be asking Facebooktough questions by seeking to attack their moral right to defend privacy. A month later the Definers operator was back pitching the same TC reporter. Though here it\u2019s even less clear who\u2019s the paymaster behind this particular pitch. \u201cHey \u2013 any interest in taking a look at Apple employees\u2019 political contributions from the last 14 years or so?\u201d the PR opened. The pitch was for a report written by another Washington-based PR firm, called GovPredict \u2014 whose website describes its business as \u201cresearch, analytics, and actionable intelligence for winning public affairs campaigns\u201d \u2014 which Definers said it could share ahead of release time, under embargo. The report in question consisted of a six-page proprietary \u201canalysis\u201d conducted by the other PR firm, which claimed to summarize the recipients of political contributions of Apple employees \u2014 slicing the self-structured data by political party and breaking out contributions to key individuals (e.g. Hillary Clinton, Obama etc.). \u201cIn total, 91% of Apple employee contributions have gone to Democrats, and 9% to Republicans,\u201d concluded the \u2018report\u2019 \u2014 which had been compiled by a PR firm whose stated business is \u201cwinning public affairs campaigns\u201d on behalf of its clients, and which was seeded to a journalist by another PR firm being paid by an unknown tech firm to daub Apple in partisan colors. Whoever was paying to paint a picture of Apple in near pure Democrat blue clearly had an agenda to peddle. Just as clearly, they didn\u2019t want to be seen doing the peddling themselves. Nor did they need to \u2014 given the mushrooming influencer PR industry that\u2019s more than happy to be paid to fling mud on the tech industry\u2019s behalf. (Even, seemingly, at the same company for different paying clients. Nice but dirty business if you can get it then.) Yet many of the wider problems of big tech which are the root cause of their brand trust crises boil down to a problematic lack of transparency. And the chain-linked lack of accountability that flows from that. Throwing more mud at this problem doesn\u2019t look like a fix for or an answer to anything. Nor is it a great look for a scandal-hit adtech giant like Facebook, whose founder claims to be hard at work fixing a flawed platform philosophy that\u2019s failed repeatedly on integrity, transparency and responsibility, to be found dipping into a murky oppo research well \u2014 even as it\u2019s simultaneously trying to cast the specter of regulation from the door. For dark arts read fresh scandals, as Facebookhas now found. Yet it\u2019s interesting that someone at the company \u2014 realizing it was in a trust hole \u2014 only knew how to keep digging. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN629477020181122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSY-0VV1-J9XT-P2DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3391\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Instead of demanding big-bucks up front, though, this game will try to recover its investment via advertisements and in-game purchases. If it succeeds, it will change the way games are sold forever. - Cormac Foster[1]<br/> Louder Social Din Opens Opportunity For Aggregators: The social media din will get even louder and harder to understand.

Google+ may be a joke now, but the so-called social ghost town will chug steadily into 2013 as Google patiently plays the long game, bringing its Web of products even deeper into the fold. -\u00a0Taylor Hatmaker[5]<br/> Mobile Security Meltdown: Security experts have been warning about mobile security vulnerabilities for years, but no one has really been listening. That will change in 2013 when a massive security issue plagues one or mobile platforms, stealing personal information, bricking phones and changing the way people use their devices. -\u00a0Fredric Paul[6]<br/>Apple Will Release a Television Set: In the spring of 2013 we will see a genuine Apple television, not just the little streaming box that is currently known as Apple TV. The opportunity to make a big splash in the time between big tech conferences like the Consumer Electronics Show, Mobile World Congress and South by Southwest means we should look for the announcement in March. -\u00a0Dan Rowinski[7]<br/>Enterprise Predictions<br/>The Enterprise Strikes Back: 2013 will see a continuing slump in startups that target consumer categories like social media and mobile and renewed strength in startups aimed at the enterprise. As venture capitalists come down from the bubbly days of Facebook, Zynga and Groupon, they'll return to their senses and invest in companies that emphasize solid fundamentals, like paying customers and profits. -\u00a0Tim Devaney and Tom Stein[8]<br/> The Enterprise Inflates a Bubble: The shift to enterprise is good news and bad news. The good news is the Valley will get back to solving real problems. The bad news is we're going to see a huge bubble in B2B startups just like the one that just popped in B2C. By this time next year we'll all be wringing our hands again, wondering what happened. -\u00a0Dan Lyons[9]<br/> Governments Tighten Their Grip on the Internet: This year set the table for the government trying to regulate the Internet, with the SOPA and PIPA piracy controversies in the US, and ACTA in Europe. In 2013, a new mutation of the Stop Online Piracy Act will be duked out in Congress. Internationally, fallout from the United Nations-sanctioned International Telecommunication Union's World Conference On International Telecommunications will likely cede more regulatory power to governments around the world, threatening to disrupt the Web's very infrastructure. -\u00a0Adam Popescu[10]<br/>Apple Cracks the Enterprise: In 2013, driven to the brink by the seismic changes in Windows 8, the difficulty of supporting Windows RT, and lackluster Windows 8 tablets, enterprises will adopt Apple devices with orders in the tens of thousands of units. This won't be the end of Microsoft, but it will put the company back on the defensive after a year of innovation. -\u00a0Jon Mitchell [11]<br/> Cloud Rules: The early adoption phase of cloud computing is just about over. Up until now, many cloud deployments have been the purview of small capital-poor startups and department-level teams who need resources faster than corporate procurement can move. In 2013 we will see much broader adoption of the cloud across the entire enterprise, as the cost-benefits of elastic computing become too attractive to ignore. Expect some major deployment announcements as OpenStack-based products become more prolific and Amazon Web Services and CloudStack rise to meet the challenge. -\u00a0Brian Proffitt[12]<br/> Big Data Consolidates: Big Data - defined as companies trying to glean useful insights from vast amounts of data - will be driven by massive investments by large corporations. With all that cash sloshing around, we'll see a big uptick in merger and acquisition activity as traditional tech vendors put big-data startups on their shoping lists. -\u00a0Antone Gonsalves[13]<br/>Google Will Become an ISP: After a successful trial run with Google Fiber in Kansas City, Google will reveal pricing and options for Google Fiber Internet service in select U.S. cities by the end of 2013. The offering won't have a mobile data component, just home and business Internet, VOIP, and TV. It will seem like a very good deal compared to existing ISPs. -\u00a0Jon Mitchell[14]<br/> There you have it, 14 can't-miss technology predictions for 2013. Stay tuned for deeper dives into the technologies and trends that will shape our future in the coming year.\u00a0<br/> Image courtesy of Shutterstock[15].<br/> [1]: <url

Digital transformation isn't about computerization, he explains. It's about using technology \"to expand the reach and performance of enterprises\"--even those that are decidedly analog.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General Electric, for example, is adopting an Internet of Things service strategy that will help customers schedule maintenance and avoid part failures on industrial GE products--an approach that improves GE's own operations.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Westerman includes that example in \"Embracing Digital Technology,\" an MIT research report done in conjunction with Capgemini that cites three potential benefits that could come from going digital: better customer experiences and engagement, streamlined operations, and new lines of business or business models.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Co-author Didier Bonnet, senior vice president and head of global practices for Capgemini, emphasizes that digital transformation goes beyond automation. \"It's not just taking people out of the process, it's increasing their effectiveness\" within the process, he says. Specialty insurer Chubb, for example, is using \"social business tools and processes ... to develop products and understand risks rapidly as new markets emerge,\" the report notes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Digitalization in the Real World\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roger Seshadri was lucky enough to have an experience most CIOs only dream of: Building a fully digital organization from the ground up. Seshadri is the former CIO of Melco Crown Entertainment, a partnership that built a massive gaming and hospitality complex in Macau (he continues to work as an IT consultant for the company). He deployed an IP infrastructure that encompassed every facet of the complex: audio, video, cameras, wireless, mobile and more.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guests can use an iPad to control the temperature in their room, open the curtains, browse the wine list or find a service. They use kiosks to redeem points on loyalty cards. Using digital gaming systems, dealers can accommodate 120 baccarat players at a time, instead of the usual six at a table. Depending on the time of day, the casino can configure slot machines to accept different amounts with each spin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even CIOs without the luxury of starting from scratch with a \"greenfield\" situation are interested in digital transformation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To Phil Fasano, CIO at Oakland, Calif.-based healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente, digitalization means applying technology to offer services that simply weren't possible before. His example: allowing patients to interact with a physician via video \"rather than taking three hours out of their day to visit a facility\"--a capability that's now in the planning stages.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Every company is already a digital company, even if they don't perceive themselves to be one,\" Fasano maintains. \"People open a mobile device and become a digital consumer. They may even be your own employees. You have to think about every aspect of what you do through the lens of being digital. Digital offers you the opportunity, like PCs did, to reimagine the work that you do.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Red Hat's Congdon concurs. \"Even if you are a traditional company making Sheetrock, you'll be a digital company, because your supply chain, your marketing, your logistics, your product changes, your collaboration, will be digital. You ignore the trend at your peril.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fully Digital? Not So Fast\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not every IT leader agrees, however. Phil Bertolini, CIO of Oakland County, Mich., which has been highly ranked for providing digital capabilities, believes that every organization will have a digital component, even if it's only email, but being \"fully digital\" isn't necessary for every entity. \"Does a street vendor need a CRM program?\" he asks. \"They may do online banking, and they may get their business license online, but they don't need a bigger digital footprint than that.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Capgemini/MIT study divides companies into four quadrants: digirati (also known as digital masters), fashionistas, beginners and conservatives. While Bertolini considers Oakland County to be a digital master, he says some rural governments are still on the bottom part of the quadrant and are likely content to stay there for many years. \"They don't have much of a population to serve. They can stay [in the conservative quadrant] because they can still do things with a pencil and paper.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In both the private and public sectors, Bertolini sees a lot of fashionistas, which the study defines as those who have experimented with sexy applications that don't always create value. As the report says, \"While [these efforts] may look good, they are not implemented with the vision of gaining synergies among the items.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In other words, \"it's wonderful to do something whiz-bang, but if you can't build it [into your existing systems] and make it sustainable, you're a fashionista,\" Bertolini says.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pete DeLisi, academic dean of the IT leadership program at Santa Clara University, says digital transformation is at best just one piece of a larger puzzle. The MIT/Capgemini study \"shows that digital capabilities correlate with good performance, but what caused those attributes in the first place? Companies that are well managed perform better than those that are not,\" he argues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A longtime IT and strategy consultant, DeLisi says digital transformation alone can't make great companies. \"You can't control for other variables,\" he explains. \"There could have been strong leadership, great people, strategic capabilities, a strong corporate culture. There's no way you can isolate those things.\"\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Obstacles to Digital Perfection<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likely to no one's surprise, inertia is the No. 1 roadblock to digital transformation. Some 63% of 1,500 corporate workers surveyed by Capgemini/MIT said the pace of technological change in their organizations is too slow. Only about one-third of the respondents said that senior leaders in their organizations have put forth a vision for digital transformation.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another big obstacle to becoming digital is getting others on board. \"When a high-level operations executive doesn't see a return on technology, it's difficult to manage,\" Seshadri says. \"IT has to do a lot of proof of concepts to provide evidence that technology has value.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other obstacles can crop up in the following areas:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Funding. \"It's always better if you have more money,\" says Fasano. \"You just have to be effective at utilizing it. You can only go at the pace you can afford.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bertolini concurs. \"Money may [slow down] how far and how fast you go, but it shouldn't stop you from getting there,\" he says. \"During the tough economic times we had in Michigan, we tightened our belts but still found ways to innovate and invest in technology.\" For example, he says, a manager could ask a current employee to undertake limited social media efforts without hiring someone new.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Staffing. Ideally, digital transformation should encompass multiple skill sets--cloud, mobile and social to start--not to mention the traditional disciplines of project management and change management. All of which can make staffing a challenge.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There is a global war for talent, for people who can execute in the digital domain,\" says Congdon. \"You need to think about how to attract people who can help you get to the right level of tech sophistication, especially when you're competing with marquee technology firms like Google and Netflix.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Interoperability. An organization can't be fully digital until all of its systems can communicate with one another--and ideally with those of its business partners as well. Linda Trowbridge is CEO for Center for Elders' Independence, an Oakland, Calif.-based elderly care provider that's investing significantly in an electronic health record system. \"It would help if we have access to medical records in the hospital, but we don't,\" says Trowbridge. \"It's not that the technology can't do it. It's that the organizations have not agreed upon a framework.\"\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change Is the Only Constant\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all his bullishness, even Congdon has some concerns about striving for digital mastery. \"It's risky to assume in advance that you know where you want to end up,\" he says. \"You can take [one] approach to solving a problem, but will the problem still be relevant in five years? You may want to make multiple bets.\"\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Innovation balanced by caution is not a bad idea. \"Sometimes you'll need to be a fast follower,\" Congdon adds. \"If you're constrained because of regulations or resources, it may not make sense to be a pioneer, because the risks will be larger than the rewards.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In charting a course toward digital transformation, then, IT leaders need to remember the business and technology landscape is constantly changing. MIT's Westerman concedes that \"digital will mean something different in 10 years.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That means IT pros will have to build the kind of digital infrastructure Seshadri had in Macau with an eye toward both stability and flexibility--two concepts that don't always easily reconcile.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And they'll have to remember this cautionary advice from DeLisi: \"Transformation is a means, not an end.\" ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Baldwin is a Silicon Valley-based freelance writer and frequent contributor to Computerworld.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0</pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 371840671</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CHC-TF71-DYTM-9379-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2014 Computerworld, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Computerworld</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0010-4841</issn><volume>Vol. 48</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 19, 2014</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0004ILR</classCode><className>CAP GEMINI NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0008ZIE</classCode><className>CAPGEMINI SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7373 COMPUTER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DESIGN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE &amp;

Governor Cuomo committed to signing it Wednesday and is expected to do so before the week is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The legislation contains most of the changes that tenant advocates and progressive politicians have been clamoring forand that the real estate industry dreads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The legislation was designed to dramatically reduce the number of units that were leaving the rent-regulated system, by abolishing or limiting vacancy decontrol, vacancy bonuses, high-income decontrol and preferential rents, among a swath of additional tenant protections. It also extends the protections to other counties that choose to opt in and are facing a housing emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was, in no uncertain terms, a defeat for the real estate industry, the latest since the Democrats took control of both state houses in November. It demonstrated the loss of the industrys decades-long influence in Albany.</p><p>I have to sneak through the halls of the capital, said Scott Rechler, CEO of RXR Realty and a former board member for the Metropolitan Transit Authority. Legislators, wary of being seen with a real estate executive, would only meet him after office hours, he said during a Commercial Observer event earlier this week.</p><p>Real estate players have indicated that theyre ready for a fight and are prepared to sue the state if the legislation is signed into law. The industry is prepared to file a lawsuit as early as Monday challenging provisions of the legislation, if it were to pass, an industry representative told Commercial Observer.</p><p>Its a bugle call for the industry, Rechler said, and time for its leaders to step up. Historically, the real estate industry were the leaders that helped our city navigate these challenges, he lamented. Now, rather than being seen as leaders were being seen as villains.</p><p>Like Rechler, many industry leaders believe that the reforms are not only bad for the industry, but for the city.</p><p>John Banks, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industrys lobbying organization, did not hold back. The legislation put forward [on Tuesday] will be a disaster for the citys future, he said in a prepared statement. The governor and the legislature are consigning hundreds of thousands of tenants to buildings that [will] soon fall into disrepair, he predicted.</p><p>If we continue to make this a hostile environment for people who want to be here now, thats not going to end well, said Steve Meringoff, managing partner at Himmel + Meringoff Properties during a panel at COs Midtown Forum Wednesday.</p><p>My biggest concern about the risk real estate facesour political riskis if we have single party government in 2020, said Tommy Craig, senior managing director at Hines. [If] it is elected on a platform of addressing income inequality and breaking up big tech, it will have very adverse consequences on New York City.</p><p>The reform package was designed to alter what tenant advocates felt was a system tilted in favor of landlords, and to stem the depletion of the citys regulated housing stock. Since 1993, when the Rent Regulation Reform Act (passed by a Republican-controlled legislature) instituted several ways in which units can be deregulated, the city lost a total of 290,958 units, according to the 2018 annual report from the citys Rent Guidelines Board. With the addition of roughly 143,000 new units during the same time, the net loss to the city is around 147,000 units, for a current count of 966,000 rent-regulated apartments, according to the report.</p><p>Two of the headline items in the package were the elimination of vacancy bonuses and vacancy decontrol. The former allows landlords to increase rent by 20 percent when a rent-stabilized unit is vacated, and the latter deregulates a unit that exceeds a certain rent threshold (currently $2,775) once it is vacated. Tenant advocates have long claimed that both incentivize owners to push rents up and push tenants out.</p><p>Under the law as it is currently, landlords get a huge windfall if they can remove tenants from apartments, said Ellen Davidson, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society, one of the advocacy groups that supported the reforms. Addressing [vacancy decontrol] will end the incentive for landlords to harass their tenants out of their homes.</p><p>Another set of rules targeted two programs that allos landlords to raise rents above the yearly threshold set by the Rent Regulations Board in exchange for improvements to the property, known as individual apartment improvements (IAIs) and major capital improvements (MCIs). The new rules severely limit both, but fall short of banning them, which is what many tenant advocates hoped for.</p><p>Under current law, landlords can increase rent in a regulated apartment after making physical improvements, by 2.5 percent or 1.67 percent of the costs of the improvements. The new rules would make the increases temporary, reversing a 1993-rule that landlords and tenant advocates battled over for a decade, and caps the total IAI spend to $15,000 over 15 years. As for MCIs, the new rules allow landlords to increase rents by 2 percent each year to pay for major building-wide improvements, down from 6 percent previously.</p><p>While MCIs require review from the states Division of Housing and Community Renewal, IAIs have no review process or oversight of any kind. IAIs especially can drastically drive up rents, which not only makes units less affordable, but also pushes apartments closer to the threshold where they are deregulated. In the last decade, there have been many cases alleging fraud in both programs, in which landlords claim inflated costs that are then passed on to tenants.</p><p>Because of frequent abuse of the program, everyone agrees that they need to be adjusted, but real estate critics say the proposed legislation will disincentivize owners from investing in their properties beyond whats required. That will affect tenants as well as the contractors who carry out the work.</p><p>I understand that [the legislators] are protecting the average renter and the average citizen, but they also need to understand that they just harmed a whole swath of the working class, who have been fixing floors, redoing plumbing, rebuilding kitchens, said Darcy Stacom, a commercial broker with CBRE.</p><p>I dont want our city to get really old and decrepit, so that the young people dont want to be here and then the corporations dont want to be here, she added.</p><p>Tenant advocates have countered that the returns to landlords for improvements were far beyond what they invested, and that the profit margins for rent-stabilized buildings are healthy enough without being supplemented by rent increases. In fact, profits have increased every year since 2004, with income growth outpacing the increase in costs, according to the Rent Regulations Boards annual report, released in April.</p><p>Don Peebles, a developer and founder of The Peebles Corporation, said the rules would impact the real estate industry, but there would be no doomsday scenario as some players depicted. Theres still money to be made in real estate, he said. Theyll just have to be more creative and work harder.</p><p>In addition to the measures already listed, the legislation also addresses a wide array of tenant protections including limiting security deposits, making unlawful eviction a crime and tightening rules around converting stabilized units to condos or co-ops.</p><p>From the industrys perspective, the legislation will not only disincentivize owners to improve the existing housing stock, it will stifle construction of additional affordable units. We are deeply concerned about exacerbating the affordability crisis in the future if developers have no financial incentive to produce more affordable units for our growing population, said Banks.</p><p>It is clear that something needs to change if the real estate industry wants to regain its foothold in Albany. The emboldened Democrats are likely to continue their push for reforms that are less business-friendly than their Republican counterparts. Already on the docket is a bill that would drastically increase the number of developments subject to the prevailing wage requirement, by redefining public works as any project that receives public funding, including tax subsidies.</p><p>Peebles said the progressive wave that brought the Democrats to power is in part a backlash to the wealth and income inequality in the city, an issue in which the real estate industry has been complicit. The industry does not provide an environment of upward mobility, Peebles said. Unless they become more inclusive, this business model is unsustainable.</p><p>The sense of urgency has pompted industry leaders to call for action from the real estate community.</p><p>More than one person in REBNY has talked about real estate being under an existential threat, said Meringoff during the CO event. The music wont go on forever. Take the opportunity to be active politically, he urged the crowd.</p><p>RXRs Rechler said that REBNY, the industrys leading advocacy group, will have to adjust to the new reality. REBNY is going to have to come out of this and, as an industry, take a look and say, Okay, what did we do right? What did we do wrong? Theres a new playing field. How do we adapt our playbook for that new playing field and make sure that that REBNY as our leading industry advocacy group is positioned to do that?</p><p>Peebles had a word of advice for them on how to accomplish that. REBNY ought to be a part of the solution to making the city cleaner and more attractive, he said.
