Last year, they promised Washington that they would build out a 5G wireless network to 97-percent of the country in three years, including much of rural America, while offering the 'same or better rate plans at the same or better prices.' The combined company, which will retain the T-Mobile name, is expected to serve more than 100-million subscribers, rivaling the even larger footprints of AT-T and Verizon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero said the merger was unlikely to 'substantially lessen competition,' rejecting arguments put forward by California, New York and 11 other states that sued to block it.</p><p>'T-Mobile has redefined itself over the past decade as a maverick that has spurred the two largest players in its industry to make numerous pro-consumer changes. The proposed merger would allow the merged company to continue T-Mobile's undeniably successful business strategy for the foreseeable future,' he wrote in his decision. 'While Sprint has made valiant attempts to stay competitive in a rapidly developing and capital-intensive market, the overwhelming view both within Sprint and in the wider industry is that Sprint is falling farther and farther short of the targets it must hit to remain relevant as a significant competitor.'</p><p>Sprint shares spiked more than 72-percent on the news, trading at $8.25 by midday. T-Mobile surged 11.1-percent, to $93.90.</p><p>The deal could be completed as soon as April-1, the companies said in a news release, though it still requires approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. And though the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department approved the deal last year, it is possible the legal battle is not over. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who spearheaded the lawsuit, said that the states 'wholeheartedly' disagree with the ruling and are considering an appeal.</p><p>'From the start, this merger has been about massive corporate profits over all else, and despite the companies' false claims, this deal will endanger wireless subscribers where it hurts most: their wallets,' James said in a statement. 'There is no doubt that reducing the mobile market from four to three will be bad for consumers, bad for workers, and bad for innovation, which is why the states stepped up and led this lawsuit.'</p><p>In recent months lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns about the dangers of corporate consolidation. House lawmakers have embarked on a wide-ranging probe exploring whether Silicon Valley giants such as Apple, Google and Facebook have taken unfair action to quash rivals. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have made breaking up big tech companies a prominent feature of their presidential campaigns. But even when federal regulators are involved, they rarely take action against mergers: The Federal Trade Commission challenged just 22 mergers out of 2,111 in 2018, according to an agency report. Only five challenges resulted in litigation.</p><p>Advocates of the deal say it would boost competition by rescuing the struggling Sprint, which has been unprofitable for the better part of the past decade and claims just 13 percent of the market. Aija Leiponen, a professor of applied economics at Cornell University and an expert on the telecommunications industry, said the deal will keep Sprint out of the hands of AT-T and Verizon, which command 40-percent and 30-percent of the market, respectively.</p><p>'If Sprint goes bankrupt, its assets will likely be sold to the other three companies, potentially enhancing the already strong dominance of the two market leaders,' Leiponen said. 'The creation of a third equal competitor, the combined Sprint-T-Mobile, would have about 30-percent of the market, too. This might actually provide a more viable alternative, and a counterweight, to Verizon and AT-T nationwide.'</p><p>Although the merger was formally announced in April 2018, T-Mobile and Sprint, the latter controlled by the Japanese conglomerate Softbank, had been flirting with a combination for years but were thwarted by political head winds. To win the government's blessing, both companies agreed to sell key assets \" including hundreds of retail stores, thousands of cell sites and spectrum licenses \" to Dish Network in an effort to turn Dish into a fourth national wireless carrier. Sprint and T-Mobile were also forced to ditch their prepaid phone businesses, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.</p><p>'If this merger proceeds, we hope the plan for DISH Network to enter the wireless marketplace as a new competitor works, and that wireless users will eventually benefit again from a market with four strong competitors,' legal director John Bergmayer at the think tank Public Knowledge said in a statement. 'There will be a great deal of uncertainty for consumers in the meantime, as a result of this decision. New entry into the wireless market is not easy, especially when it requires the cooperation of your competitors, as under the DOJ's proposal.'</p><p>Executives said the new  T-Mobile will increase competition in broadband markets by bringing high-quality coverage to underserved areas and will be a major job creator in a tight labor market. The new company will have over 3,500 more full-time workers than the individual companies would, T-Mobile said in a news release, and 11,000 more by 2024. Some 600 new retail locations and five new customer experience centers will also create 12,000 jobs, the company said, many in small towns.</p><p>'This will benefit Kansas consumers by increasing competition in our state, expanding quality coverage in many rural areas of Kansas, expediting the deployment of 5G technology for Kansans, and protecting and expanding Kansas jobs,' Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who supported the merger, said in a statement. 'We intend to hold the merged company to its promises of investment in its Kansas network and of maintaining substantial employment at what will become the combined company's 'second headquarters' in Overland Park.'</p><p>Sprint executive chairman Marcelo Claure said in a news release that the company was 'ready to make the vision of a New T-Mobile a reality.' The ruling 'brings us a big step closer to creating a combined company that will provide nationwide 5G, lower costs, and a high-performing network that will invigorate competition to the benefit of all mobile wireless and in-home broadband consumers.'</p><p>Richard Parker, legal counsel for T-Mobile's parent company, Deutsche Telekom, said in a statement emailed to The Washington Post that the company was 'delighted' with the decision. 'As we argued in court, this merger ensures competition by allowing the combined companies to more effectively compete with the market leaders. It is our hope that with the Court's endorsement of the merger, along with the federal agencies' approval, this matter can be closed so that the market can do what it does best: fuel competition and innovation.'</p><p>Mike Sievert, T-Mobile's current president, is poised to succeed John Legere as chief executive to lead the new company on May 1. Legere, whose charisma and acumen helped move the merger forward, will remain a member of the board.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:taylor.telford@washpost.com\">taylor.telford@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-3968ddba4d1411ea9b5ceac5b16dafaa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y66-X2K1-DYX1-H2F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1292\"/><timeReceived>GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 33 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0002: Unparseable date: \"0002\"EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Last year, they promised Washington that they would build out a 5G wireless network to 97-percent of the country in three years, including much of rural America, while offering the 'same or better rate plans at the same or better prices.' The combined company, which will retain the T-Mobile name, is expected to serve more than 100-million subscribers, rivaling the even larger footprints of AT-T and Verizon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero said the merger was unlikely to 'substantially lessen competition,' rejecting arguments put forward by California, New York and 11 other states that sued to block it.</p><p>'T-Mobile has redefined itself over the past decade as a maverick that has spurred the two largest players in its industry to make numerous pro-consumer changes. The proposed merger would allow the merged company to continue T-Mobile's undeniably successful business strategy for the foreseeable future,' he wrote in his decision. 'While Sprint has made valiant attempts to stay competitive in a rapidly developing and capital-intensive market, the overwhelming view both within Sprint and in the wider industry is that Sprint is falling farther and farther short of the targets it must hit to remain relevant as a significant competitor.'</p><p>Sprint shares spiked more than 72-percent on the news, trading at $8.25 by midday. T-Mobile surged 11.1-percent, to $93.90.</p><p>The deal could be completed as soon as April-1, the companies said in a news release, though it still requires approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. And though the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department approved the deal last year, it is possible the legal battle is not over. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who spearheaded the lawsuit, said that the states 'wholeheartedly' disagree with the ruling and are considering an appeal.</p><p>'From the start, this merger has been about massive corporate profits over all else, and despite the companies' false claims, this deal will endanger wireless subscribers where it hurts most: their wallets,' James said in a statement. 'There is no doubt that reducing the mobile market from four to three will be bad for consumers, bad for workers, and bad for innovation, which is why the states stepped up and led this lawsuit.'</p><p>In recent months lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns about the dangers of corporate consolidation. House lawmakers have embarked on a wide-ranging probe exploring whether Silicon Valley giants such as Apple, Google and Facebook have taken unfair action to quash rivals. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have made breaking up big tech companies a prominent feature of their presidential campaigns. But even when federal regulators are involved, they rarely take action against mergers: The Federal Trade Commission challenged just 22 mergers out of 2,111 in 2018, according to an agency report. Only five challenges resulted in litigation.</p><p>Advocates of the deal say it would boost competition by rescuing the struggling Sprint, which has been unprofitable for the better part of the past decade and claims just 13 percent of the market. Aija Leiponen, a professor of applied economics at Cornell University and an expert on the telecommunications industry, said the deal will keep Sprint out of the hands of AT-T and Verizon, which command 40-percent and 30-percent of the market, respectively.</p><p>'If Sprint goes bankrupt, its assets will likely be sold to the other three companies, potentially enhancing the already strong dominance of the two market leaders,' Leiponen said. 'The creation of a third equal competitor, the combined Sprint-T-Mobile, would have about 30-percent of the market, too. This might actually provide a more viable alternative, and a counterweight, to Verizon and AT-T nationwide.'</p><p>Although the merger was formally announced in April 2018, T-Mobile and Sprint, the latter controlled by the Japanese conglomerate Softbank, had been flirting with a combination for years but were thwarted by political head winds. To win the government's blessing, both companies agreed to sell key assets \" including hundreds of retail stores, thousands of cell sites and spectrum licenses \" to Dish Network in an effort to turn Dish into a fourth national wireless carrier. Sprint and T-Mobile were also forced to ditch their prepaid phone businesses, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.</p><p>'If this merger proceeds, we hope the plan for DISH Network to enter the wireless marketplace as a new competitor works, and that wireless users will eventually benefit again from a market with four strong competitors,' legal director John Bergmayer at the think tank Public Knowledge said in a statement. 'There will be a great deal of uncertainty for consumers in the meantime, as a result of this decision. New entry into the wireless market is not easy, especially when it requires the cooperation of your competitors, as under the DOJ's proposal.'</p><p>Executives said the new  T-Mobile will increase competition in broadband markets by bringing high-quality coverage to underserved areas and will be a major job creator in a tight labor market. The new company will have over 3,500 more full-time workers than the individual companies would, T-Mobile said in a news release, and 11,000 more by 2024. Some 600 new retail locations and five new customer experience centers will also create 12,000 jobs, the company said, many in small towns.</p><p>'This will benefit Kansas consumers by increasing competition in our state, expanding quality coverage in many rural areas of Kansas, expediting the deployment of 5G technology for Kansans, and protecting and expanding Kansas jobs,' Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who supported the merger, said in a statement. 'We intend to hold the merged company to its promises of investment in its Kansas network and of maintaining substantial employment at what will become the combined company's 'second headquarters' in Overland Park.'</p><p>Sprint executive chairman Marcelo Claure said in a news release that the company was 'ready to make the vision of a New T-Mobile a reality.' The ruling 'brings us a big step closer to creating a combined company that will provide nationwide 5G, lower costs, and a high-performing network that will invigorate competition to the benefit of all mobile wireless and in-home broadband consumers.'</p><p>Richard Parker, legal counsel for T-Mobile's parent company, Deutsche Telekom, said in a statement emailed to The Washington Post that the company was 'delighted' with the decision. 'As we argued in court, this merger ensures competition by allowing the combined companies to more effectively compete with the market leaders. It is our hope that with the Court's endorsement of the merger, along with the federal agencies' approval, this matter can be closed so that the market can do what it does best: fuel competition and innovation.'</p><p>Mike Sievert, T-Mobile's current president, is poised to succeed John Legere as chief executive to lead the new company on May 1. Legere, whose charisma and acumen helped move the merger forward, will remain a member of the board.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:taylor.telford@washpost.com\">taylor.telford@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-3968ddba-4d14-11ea-9b5c-eac5b16dafaa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y67-2221-DXXY-32F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1292\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Federal Communications Commission and its Republican chairman, Ajit Pai, finding[1] that net neutrality supporters had made 'unconvincing' arguments in their efforts to override the FCC's move to remove the regulation. While the ruling was a boon for the FCC, it also overruled the agency's effort to block[2] states from adopting net neutrality policies of their own, a move that could spur states such as California to act.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) 'We are very pleased by today's decision,' an FCC senior official said in a phone conference Tuesday after the court made its ruling. </p><p>The official provided noted that the FCC is not yet able to determine whether it will appeal the decision to prevent the agency from blocking state-created net neutrality rules. Pai moved to repeal[3] of the government's net neutrality rules in 2017. Federal open Internet protections had prevented Internet service providers, including AT...nd Verizon, from slowing[4] down access to web content, or charging services such as Netflix and Hulu for faster delivery of their shows. Activists often characterize[5] ISPs as a driveway connecting a home to the vast network of portals on the internet, while net neutrality, they claim, is the principle preventing providers from charging a high fee for some traffic. Many people who oppose providing the government more authority over bandwidth say that's not an apt-description. Former FCC Chairman Michael Powell, for instance, frequently pushes back against that characterization. 'Americans have never known anything but an open Internet,' Powell said during[6] a press conference in 2017, noting that an open internet was a concept woven into how the internet was designed.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Sponsored Content  More than 22 states' attorneys general, along with cities and various internet companies, sued the FCC. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google also filed supportive briefs through their Washington lobbying group, the Internet Association (IA). 'The internet industry shares the view of an overwhelming majority of Americans that net neutrality protections are critical to the future of a free and open internet,' IA President Michael Beckerman said in a statement to the media following the decision. He added: 'IA and our member companies will continue to fight for nationwide, strong, enforceable net neutrality protections that ban blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization through Congress and at the FCC.'Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

That means some of the Trump-era asylum rules Wolf presided over are on hold, too.   The appointment of former Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan \"was invalid under the agency's applicable order of succession, and so he lacked the authority to amend the order of succession to ensure Wolf's installation as Acting Secretary,\" wrote Judge Paula Xinis in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland's opinion , issued Friday (a day after President Donald Trump formally nominated Wolf\u2014who has been acting DHS secretary since November\u2014as the agency's official head).   \"Because Wolf filled the role of Acting Secretary without authority, he promulgated the challenged [asylum] rules also 'in excess of\u2026authority,' and not 'in accordance with the law,'\" Xinis continued.   The lawsuit was brought by Casa de Maryland Inc. (CASA), the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), and three other nonprofit groups, and it challenges 18  DHS rules \"that overhaul the criteria for issuing work authorization to as ylum applicants ,\" notes the court's opinion. \" Plaintiffs mount a full-throated attack on the challenged agency rules, invoking the Administrative Procedure Act ('APA'), the Federal Vacancies Reform Act ('FVRA'), and the Homeland Security Act ('HSA').\"   The court concluded that \"preliminary injunctive relief\" was warranted for both CASA and ASAP (but not the other plaintiffs), temporarily blocking \"enforcement of the following rule changes against CASA and ASAP's members\":    The Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,545 (printing parts of the regulations to be codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.7(a)(1)); \u2013   The 365-day waiting period, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626-28 (referenced throughout and as codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3(c)(3); \u00a7 208.7(a)(1)(ii), (a)(1)(iii)(E), and (b)(1)(i); and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(8)); \u2013   Removal of \"deemed-complete\" rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3); \u2013   The discretionary review rule, providing that agency is no longer required to issue EADs to eligible asylees, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,628 (changes reflected at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.13(a)(1)); \u2013   The one-year filing bar, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.7(a)(1)(iii)(F)) ; and \u2013   The rule requiring submission of biometric information as part of EAD applications, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.7(a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(iv)(E),   It's a limited reprieve for now, but positive news nonetheless.   Another federal court ruling regarding immigration isn't so heartening. This one from Monday says the Trump administration can force out hundreds of thousands of immigrants who reside legally in the U.S. under what's referred to as \"temporary protected status.\"   Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to vacate a 2018 district court ruling that preliminarily blocked enforcement of the administration's order, which end the protected status program for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan.   In finding \"that the Trump administration acted within its authority in terminating legal protections\" for these immigrants, the court \"effectively strips legal immigration status from some 400,000 people, rendering them deportable if they do not voluntarily leave the country,\" The New York Times reports .  FREE MARKETS  Congress is out of touch on tech companies. \" While Democratic and Republican officials have been criticizing the conduct of U.S. 'Big Tech' companies, a growing disconnect separates those crusading politicians from the way a lot of consumers are feeling,\" writes Art Raymond at Utah's Deseret News , in a look at consumer polling and political posturing around tech products. \"It turns out, a close look at the attitudes of the average Jills and Joes who use the tech products and platforms every day reveals that, frankly, they really don't care that much.\"  FREE MINDS  Trump is fearmongering about Iran again. \" According to press reports, Iran may be planning an assassination, or other attack, against the United States in retaliation for the killing of terrorist leader [Qassem] Soleimani,\" the president\u2014who has lately been talking up his supposed anti-war bona fides\u2014 tweeted late last night. \"Any attack by Iran, in any form, against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!\"  QUICK HITS  \u2022 Pennsylvania \"Gov. Tom Wolf's pandemic restrictions that required people to stay at home, placed size limits on gatherings and ordered 'non-life-sustaining' businesses to shut down are unconstitutional,\" held U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV in a Monday ruling.   \u2022 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled that it's OK for Florida to make people convicted of felonies who have served their sentences pay off all court debt before they regain the right to vote.   \u2022 Ruling parties use the instruments of power to ensure their dominance, example 8 billion:   BREAKING: In 4-3 decision, Wisconsin Supreme Court keeps the Green Party ticket off of Wisconsin's ballot.   Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn joins the court's three liberals to form a majority.   This means clerks do not have to reprint ballots and can now mail them.   \u2014 Patrick Marley (@patrickdmarley) September 14, 2020   \u2022 A new lawsuit alleges a range of abuses against immigrant detainees at the Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia.

The ruling complicates EU efforts to rein in tech giants in Europe.Europe's second-highest court on Wednesday overturned a ruling ordering tech giant Apple to reimburse Ireland for \u20ac13 billion ($15 billion) in back taxes.The General Court ruled in favor of Apple and Ireland in a joint appeal of a 2016 ruling from the European Commission, saying the US tech firm does not have to pay the sum. \"The General Court annuls the contested decision because the Commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU1,\" judges in Luxembourg said in a statement, making reference to EU competition rules.\"The Commission was wrong to declare'' that Apple \"had been granted a selective economic advantage and, by extension, state aid,\" the statement read. </p><p>The decision is open to further appeal on points of law to the European Court of Justice.EU targeted big tech in 2016 rulingA 2016 ruling from European Commission said the iPhone maker had benefited from illegal state aid owing to two Irish court decisions that allegedly artificially reduced Apple's tax burden.The decision was part of a series of anti-trust cases that targeted major US firms including Starbucks, McDonald's and Amazon.The Commission had ruled that tax deals struck by Apple and other companies with countries such as Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg constitute illegal state aid, a violation of EU regulations.Both Apple and Ireland appealed that ruling leading to Wednesday's decision. Apple has had a base in the southern city of Cork since 1980, where it employs more than 5,000 people and through which it routes international sales, avoiding billions in corporate taxes.Vindication for Apple and Ireland\"This case was not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it. We're proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world as we know the important role tax payments play in society,\" Apple said in response to the Wednesday ruling. The government of Ireland said it had \"always been clear\" Apple received no special treatment, adding, \"The correct amount of Irish tax was charged... in line with normal Irish taxation rules.\"DW business reporter Arthur Sullivan called the ruling a \"big blow\" for the EU, but said it was important to distinguish between this specific case and the wider fight against tax avoidance. \"This case looked at the issue of illegal state aid. Did Apple's specific arrangements in Ireland amount to illegal state aid. The courts today said it didn't,\" Sullivan said. \"However...the competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has been increasingly looking to tackle this issue. We're seeing the commission is increasingly willing to use tools they've never used before, such as bringing in voting on changes to the corporate tax structure in the EUIf that comes in, that would mean the fight is still very much on.\"Profit shifting under scrutinyThe ruling is a setback to the Commission's fight to reduce the practice of profit shifting whereby multinational companies shift profits from a high tax jurisdiction to a lower one.The EU's lower court last year overturned a ruling that had ordered Starbucks to pay \u20ac30 billion in Dutch back taxes. In a separate case, the court threw out a ruling against a Belgian tax scheme for 39 multinationals.The ruling is likely to be taken into account in pending cases against Ikea, Nike, and other international firms.The decision comes amid an EU campaign to increase taxation and limit the power of digital behemoths like Apple, though some member states are opposed.Ireland's economy has benefited from the presence of multinational corporations attracted by the country's low tax rates. Dublin is seen as unwilling to accept a ruling suggesting that its tax laws are too lax.kp/sms (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109991159481117810275776100172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7829</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C4-K151-JCMN-Y29N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><timeReceived>11:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle Business</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

This time we take an in-depth look at the economic impact their policies might have.</p><p><br/><br/>Whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden wins the US Presidential election next month, we're likely to see further government spending and continued trade tensions with China. The devil, however, is in the detail. Both candidates are aiming for growth, but how they intend to get there could make all the difference.<br/><br/>MORE OF THE SAME OR SPREADING THE WEALTH?<br/><br/>Trump would no doubt see a second term as vindication of his policies and a mandate to keep it up. This is likely to see him 'double down' on his recent key strategies - lower taxes, de-regulation and US self-reliance.<br/><br/>A Trump win could therefore help companies keep their profits strong, their workers employed and their shareholders happy - all of which would be good for the economy.<br/><br/>In contrast, Biden's overall economic goal can be summed up in one word: redistribution. His desire to increase corporate taxes is well publicised. But he has also announced proposals to double the minimum wage and spend $ 6 trillion on transport infrastructure, the transition to low carbon vehicles, and clean energy.<br/><br/>So a Biden victory could put more money in people's pockets, supporting consumer spending, and create jobs in key areas for the future, most noticeably the green sector.<br/><br/>Joe Aylott, Investment Analyst at Coutts, says, 'Whatever happens, the US economy will ultimately keep growing, notwithstanding any shocks to the system from the coronavirus pandemic. That growth will be fuelled from different directions though, depending on who wins the election.'<br/><br/>He adds, 'While elections are of course important to the here and now - especially when they concern the world's largest economy - it's the more structural issues that can really make a difference over time.<br/><br/>'Central bank monetary policies, for example, along with how productive companies are and the trends we see in their earnings, can have a much more fundamental, long-term impact.'<br/><br/>'While elections are of course important to the here and now - especially when they concern the world's largest economy - it's the more structural issues that can really make a difference over time.'<br/><br/>Joe Aylott, Investment Analyst, Coutts<br/><br/>A TAXING ISSUE<br/><br/>28%<br/><br/>THE CORPORATE TAX RATE PROPOSED BY BIDEN, UP FROM TRUMP'S 21%<br/><br/>One of President Trump's most significant moves was cutting the headline tax on corporate profits in the US to 21%, from 35%. This has allowed companies to keep a greater proportion of their earnings, providing capital to fund development and employ more people. Companies have used some of the extra cash to fund share buybacks, which has been a factor behind the inexorable rise in US share prices since 2016.<br/><br/>Biden plans to raise it again by 7%, taking it to 28%. Any rise won't be welcomed by business, but companies would still pay 7% less than four years ago. He also plans to target 'Big Tech' companies that put profit centres offshore to minimise domestic tax exposure, and to increase capital gains tax, which tends to be most keenly felt by the wealthy.<br/><br/>Trump's plans are a little vaguer, but he has advocated further tax cuts and increased spending. He's also said he would extend many of the tax reductions introduced in his 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, some of which are currently scheduled to end over the next four years.<br/><br/>MAKING A STAND ON MINIMUM WAGE<br/><br/>$ 15<br/><br/>THE HOURLY MINIMUM WAGE PROPOSED BY BIDEN, DOUBLE ITS CURRENT LEVEL<br/><br/>Joe Biden proposes doubling the US minimum wage from $ 7.50 an hour to around $ 15. It's worth noting that many US states already have a higher minimum in place - $ 11.80 in New York, $ 12 in California and GBP13 Washington, for example - so the overall impact may not be as substantial as the headline figure suggests.<br/><br/>That said, it would give a pay rise to the 1.6 million workers who earn the federal minimum, as well as many more earning their current state minimum.<br/><br/>As Joe Aylott says, 'While higher wage bills may take a bite out of profits - potentially bad for markets - their workers would have more money to spend - potentially good for GDP.<br/><br/>'Again, Biden's plan comes down to redistribution.'<br/><br/>TRADING BARBS<br/><br/>2022<br/><br/>THE PROPOSED DEADLINE FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOR CHINESE FIRMS LISTED IN THE US TO COMPLY WITH NEW AUDITING RULES<br/><br/>One topic important to global economic growth where you can barely tell the candidates apart is that of foreign policy on China.<br/><br/>If you want the American people to vote for you, it'll do you no good to go easy on China. Spying accusations and the coronavirus pandemic have only worsened public sentiment.<br/><br/>Both candidates therefore talk tough on US-China relations. Trump's bellicose pronouncements are well known, but Biden has also taken a confrontational stance, calling president Xi Jinping 'a thug' during the Democratic nomination race.<br/><br/>However, there is a key difference in how the candidates would deal with the issue.<br/><br/>Joe explains, 'Trump has a much more isolationist approach, even putting a question mark over trade links with allies such as Europe. Biden, on the other hand, is more likely to try to improve relations with other global powers - again, such as Europe - to get their support in the fight against China.'<br/><br/>He adds, 'Biden's more measured approach could potentially build bridges around the world on trade, which could boost the global economy. But Trump's standalone stance could produce a better deal for the country - and a prosperous US is also good for the world, such is its power and influence.'<br/><br/>KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON DEVELOPMENTS<br/><br/>At Coutts we're carefully monitoring all policy announcements on both sides of the US election, and analysing their potential impact on the economy and markets. This means we'll be ready to act if necessary after the votes are counted. It's just one element in a broader mix of factors we consider when analysing the long-term economic prospects.<br/><br/>To find out more about our views on this and other issues important to investors, visit our insight page or speak to your private banker.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610J-KX11-JD3Y-Y48S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 5, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In a statement, it promised 'a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms,' which would be the first such Congress has ever undertaken.Earlier in the day, shares of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple dropped significantly after published reports suggested that federal authorities are preparing for investigations into anticompetitive behavior by several of these technology giants.Facebook's stock dropped 7.5%. Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell 6.1%. Amazon declined 4.6%. Apple, which has only been mentioned tangentially in these reports, fell 1%.The Financial Times reported[2]:'The growth of monopoly power across our economy is one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today,' said David Cicilline, the Democratic lead on antitrust issues on the House judiciary committee. </p><p>'Market power in digital markets presents a whole new set of dangers.'The DoJ won jurisdiction for a potential inquiry into Google and Apple, while the FTC was granted purview for examining antitrust issues at Facebook and Amazon. The two agencies share responsibility for antitrust enforcement in the US and must agree on jurisdiction before either launches an investigation.Industry executives and antitrust lawyers said the two organisations typically only agree jurisdiction if they intended to investigate. But they added that any cases could take years to come to fruition and the agencies could eventually decide not to take action.Ledyard King of USA Today noted [3]the probe is the latest in a string of problems for Silicon Valley:'Unwarranted, concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy - especially when digital platforms control content,' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted Monday. 'The era of self-regulation is over.'The committee said it is concerned that a handful of companies wield 'extraordinary power over commerce, communication, and information online,' and have claimed an unfair competitive advantage in the market.'The growth of monopoly power across our economy is one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today,' Rep. David N. Cicilline, D-R.I., who chairs the panel's antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement.

The DOJ review will may encompass all four companies, according[3] to the Wall Street Journal.When it comes to Facebook and Amazon, the DOJ might explore different tech practices or legal theories than the FTC, the Wall Street Journalreported. </p><p>Both the FTC and DOJ are coordinating their efforts.At the same time, the House of Representatives is launching a sweeping investigation into Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, and results of the investigation may inform changes in antitrust laws that would make it easier to break up these companies.Barbara Ortutay and Rachel Lerman summarized [4]the cases that can be brought against the FAANG group:FACEBOOKWith 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren[5] has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea[6] .GOOGLEAs Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals \u2014 notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all \u2014 an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.APPLESince its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.AMAZONFrom an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: 'Walmart is much larger.'

For the last two years, I've given out ''Good Tech Awards'' to tech projects that are actually making the world a better place -- the 2018 edition featured blood-delivering drones, decarceration start-ups, and researchers calling out racial and gender bias in artificial intelligence systems, among other things. It's one of my favorite pieces to write, and reminds me that lots of technologists are still out there doing good.</p><p>  On the worry side, it's a clich\u00e9, but I'm nervous about A.I. and automation. I'm not worried about the machines themselves -- at least not in the Terminator, killer-robot sense. I'm worried about the political and economic system into which we're deploying this new, world-changing technology, and whether it's too late to rejigger things so we don't end up with a truly dystopian outcome.</p><p>  What is the best news tip you've ever received?</p><p>  I'm not sure about ''best,'' but the most random tip I've ever gotten was probably the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack. It came to me as an unsolicited email from someone (whom we now know was likely a North Korean hacker) who called himself ''the boss of G.O.P.'' and included a link to a trove of documents. It looked like spam, but I opened it on a whim and was shocked to find 26 folders of internal Sony Pictures documents inside, including spreadsheets containing the salaries of all their executives.</p><p>  How does it feel after you publish a big story? What do you do?</p><p>  Hmm, let's see. After I publish a big story, I usually step out onto my terrace, draw a few deep, contented breaths, crack open a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Margaux and spend the rest of the day basking in the satisfaction of a job well done.</p><p>  I'm kidding. Obviously, I spend the hour after a story is published frantically refreshing Twitter, looking for affirmation from complete strangers and measuring my self-worth by their instantaneous judgments. I'm not a lunatic.</p><p>  Actually, it usually feels equal parts great and awful to publish a big story. Great because you're done, which is nice, but then you wait in agony as the world absorbs and digests what you've written and tells you that your entire thesis is wrong, or you've mixed up 4chan and 8chan, or you wrote that the concept of a ''non-playable character'' came from video games when it really originated in tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons. (I got dozens of emails about that one.) On the rare occasions when the reception to a piece is overwhelmingly positive, I allow myself to bask in it, although I sometimes suspect there's been some sort of glitch -- maybe the experts are all on vacation this week?</p><p>  I'm lucky to write for an intelligent and attentive audience, and I do get a lot of great and genuinely helpful feedback. I also write a lot about horrible parts of the internet, so once in a while my inbox and Twitter feed get flooded with trolls and bigots calling me a ''fake news moron from the New York Slimes'' (or worse). On those occasions, I try to take a few hours off from the internet and let the cycle run its course.</p><p>  How do you spend your time when you're off duty?</p><p>  My newest extracurricular is ceramics. Earlier this year, I started taking pottery classes, and it's been -- as Gwyneth Paltrow as this sounds -- totally healing and restorative. Making something with your hands is incredibly satisfying, and forcing yourself to get away from screens and learn a new skill is something I wish I'd done years ago.</p><p>  Other than pottery, I like cooking, music, walking my dog in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, doing the crossword puzzle and reading the New Yorkers that pile up on my kitchen table. I used to play a lot of video games, but I had to kick that habit -- it was turning my brain into pudding.</p><p>  ______</p><p>  A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.</p><p>  Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.</p><p>  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         </p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DRAWING (DRAWING BY LUIS MAZ\u00d3NE)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-278645190627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-P301-JBG3-62XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/reader-center/kevin-roose-technology-the-shift.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/reader-center/kevin-roose-technology-the-shift.html</url><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DF5V</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DL5G</classCode><className>HOBBIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp; ETHNICITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DIEG</classCode><className>GENDER &amp; SEX DISCRIMINATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DO43</classCode><className>MOTORIZED SCOOTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

However, the downside is that tech giants like Facebook are viewed as exerting undue influence on culture, the economy and people's daily lives. None other than Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and one of the world's richest men, said in June last year at The Economic Club forum in Washington DC that it's time for government to step in and regulate big tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moreover, in the past few years, Facebook has been rocked by a series of privacy scandals, and regulators are mulling over whether to take action on the spread of fake news through Facebook. \"There will be more regulation of the tech sector. For example, regulation that relates to privacy. The way people consume media has brought it into a realm where we should shape it so that the benefits outweigh the negatives,\" Gates said.</p><p>Last year, the United Kingdom proposed a \"duty of care\" standard for companies such as Facebook to ensure they filter potentially harmful content. The government of Canada declared that Facebook had broken the law by failing to protect users' data from flowing to the political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. Irish regulators started investigating Facebook for failing to protect users' passwords. The government of Sri Lanka temporarily shut down Facebook and WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook, after a terrorist attack on Christians killed more than 250 people. Facebook itself told its investors that it expects the US government to issue a fine of up to US$5 billion ($6.7 billion).</p><p>A future for Facebook?</p><p>Where does that leave Facebook? For the time being, Facebook's financials are in top notch form. For its most recent 3QFY2019, revenue and operating income was up 28.6% and 24.3% respectively y-o-y. Daily and monthly active users also improved by 9% and 8% respectively for the same period, despite the negative press the company receives.</p><p>The active user figures are a key performance metric measure for Facebook, because trends in the number of users influence the number of ads it is able to show, which affect the value of its ads to marketers, which then ultimately affect its revenue and financial results. Facebook has a seen a strong growth in active users over the quarters, as shown in the chart. (see chart 1)</p><p>Valuations-wise, Facebook's fundamentals have been stellar both over a 3 year and 5 year span. The weighted value growth (represented by 10% revenue, 20% net profits, 30% operating cash flow and 40% free cash flow) exceeds the share price growth for both the 3 year and 5 year period. The 5 year weighted value CAGR was 44.0% against a share price CAGR of 22.6%; the 3 year weighted value CAGR was 26.5% against a share price CAGR of 18.9%. Facebook's balance sheet is healthy, given its strong liquidity and solvency indicators. Facebook currently has a current ratio and quick ratio of 7.2 times and 6.9 times, well above the 1.0 times benchmark. Facebook also has almost no debt on its balance sheet and is net cash.</p><p>Facebook's current margins are also very strong, at 83.2% and 44.6% for it gross margins and operating margins, which reflect the strong profitability of the company. Compared to its global peers, Facebook trades at a 21% for its P/E, and is at the industry average for EV/EBITDA, which on an overall basis makes it a marginally attractive company within the industry. Further, Facebook's OCF and FCF margin, which is currently at 52.5% and 29.4%, is well above the industry average of 12.8% and 14.9% respectively. Facebook's yields are also attractive compared to the benchmark US risk-free-rate. (see chart 2)</p><p>Facebook's Instagram Checkout, introduced in March 2019, allows users to buy items on the app. This is expected to contribute to Facebook's top line moving forward, through its current 800 million buyers on the platform. Facebook's ecommerce platforms - Messenger, Instagram Checkout, Facebook Shop and Marketplace - has also potential for over 800 million users over the next 3 years according to market research, which should provide further earnings visibility for the company over the medium term. Also, Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency venture is focused on the strategy of establishing an easy and single transaction place for B2B and e-commerce transactions; which would go well with Instagram Checkout.</p><p>Analysts are optimistic of Facebook's growth, even after factoring the billions of dollars that could be given out in damages for the Cambridge Analytica privacy suit. We share the same view, given that Facebook's earnings and cash flow and cash flow reserves are more than enough to cover this potential risk. With strong fundamentals, a growing population, and Facebook's venture into e-commerce and cryptocurrency, we believe Facebook's potential upside from its current share price of US$219.06 is upwards of 15% over the next 12 months. The analyst consensus target price is US$239.02, a 9.1% upside potential, with a resounding 86% buy call from 57 analysts, according to Bloomberg. This is a stock suitable for investors looking for growth with a medium risk tolerance profile.</p><p>So why the undervaluation? Probably the known unknown of government regulation globally. How many US$5 billions can Facebook afford to pay when global regulators start imposing fines? Even then, Facebook is a household name, the 21st century's Coca Cola, and it may weather the regulatory storm. Worth the risk? You decide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y60-JJ11-JCF0-30KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Edge Publishing PTE.

However, the downside is that tech giants like Facebook are viewed as exerting undue influence on culture, the economy and people's daily lives. None other than Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and one of the world's richest men, said in June last year at The Economic Club forum in Washington DC that it's time for government to step in and regulate big tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moreover, in the past few years, Facebook has been rocked by a series of privacy scandals, and regulators are mulling over whether to take action on the spread of fake news through Facebook. \"There will be more regulation of the tech sector. For example, regulation that relates to privacy. The way people consume media has brought it into a realm where we should shape it so that the benefits outweigh the negatives,\" Gates said.</p><p>Last year, the United Kingdom proposed a \"duty of care\" standard for companies such as Facebook to ensure they filter potentially harmful content. The government of Canada declared that Facebook had broken the law by failing to protect users' data from flowing to the political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. Irish regulators started investigating Facebook for failing to protect users' passwords. The government of Sri Lanka temporarily shut down Facebook and WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook, after a terrorist attack on Christians killed more than 250 people. Facebook itself told its investors that it expects the US government to issue a fine of up to US$5 billion ($6.7 billion).</p><p>A future for Facebook?</p><p>Where does that leave Facebook? For the time being, Facebook's financials are in top notch form. For its most recent 3QFY2019, revenue and operating income was up 28.6% and 24.3% respectively y-o-y. Daily and monthly active users also improved by 9% and 8% respectively for the same period, despite the negative press the company receives.</p><p>The active user figures are a key performance metric measure for Facebook, because trends in the number of users influence the number of ads it is able to show, which affect the value of its ads to marketers, which then ultimately affect its revenue and financial results. Facebook has a seen a strong growth in active users over the quarters, as shown in the chart. (see chart 1)</p><p>Valuations-wise, Facebook's fundamentals have been stellar both over a 3 year and 5 year span. The weighted value growth (represented by 10% revenue, 20% net profits, 30% operating cash flow and 40% free cash flow) exceeds the share price growth for both the 3 year and 5 year period. The 5 year weighted value CAGR was 44.0% against a share price CAGR of 22.6%; the 3 year weighted value CAGR was 26.5% against a share price CAGR of 18.9%. Facebook's balance sheet is healthy, given its strong liquidity and solvency indicators. Facebook currently has a current ratio and quick ratio of 7.2 times and 6.9 times, well above the 1.0 times benchmark. Facebook also has almost no debt on its balance sheet and is net cash.</p><p>Facebook's current margins are also very strong, at 83.2% and 44.6% for it gross margins and operating margins, which reflect the strong profitability of the company. Compared to its global peers, Facebook trades at a 21% for its P/E, and is at the industry average for EV/EBITDA, which on an overall basis makes it a marginally attractive company within the industry. Further, Facebook's OCF and FCF margin, which is currently at 52.5% and 29.4%, is well above the industry average of 12.8% and 14.9% respectively. Facebook's yields are also attractive compared to the benchmark US risk-free-rate. (see chart 2)</p><p>Facebook's Instagram Checkout, introduced in March 2019, allows users to buy items on the app. This is expected to contribute to Facebook's top line moving forward, through its current 800 million buyers on the platform. Facebook's ecommerce platforms - Messenger, Instagram Checkout, Facebook Shop and Marketplace - has also potential for over 800 million users over the next 3 years according to market research, which should provide further earnings visibility for the company over the medium term. Also, Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency venture is focused on the strategy of establishing an easy and single transaction place for B2B and e-commerce transactions; which would go well with Instagram Checkout.</p><p>Analysts are optimistic of Facebook's growth, even after factoring the billions of dollars that could be given out in damages for the Cambridge Analytica privacy suit. We share the same view, given that Facebook's earnings and cash flow and cash flow reserves are more than enough to cover this potential risk. With strong fundamentals, a growing population, and Facebook's venture into e-commerce and cryptocurrency, we believe Facebook's potential upside from its current share price of US$219.06 is upwards of 15% over the next 12 months. The analyst consensus target price is US$239.02, a 9.1% upside potential, with a resounding 86% buy call from 57 analysts, according to Bloomberg. This is a stock suitable for investors looking for growth with a medium risk tolerance profile.</p><p>So why the undervaluation? Probably the known unknown of government regulation globally. How many US$5 billions can Facebook afford to pay when global regulators start imposing fines? Even then, Facebook is a household name, the 21st century's Coca Cola, and it may weather the regulatory storm. Worth the risk? You decide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y37-5XC1-DYX1-T0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Edge Publishing PTE.

According to the new banking technology rules, one cannot use single OTP to sign more than one document. It was not earlier. This will change the business model and customer experience for all of us.</p><p><br/><br/>SEBI has released a consultative paper recently, which says that banks and financial institutions that are advisors cannot do selling. Those banks that are big mutual fund distributors and acting as advisors, now cannot do both. So, the technology and ecosystem must be designed in such a way as to be agile to handle such disruptions.<br/><br/>Now we have many NBFCs in the market and most NBFCs command a better premium than banks. This is because they are more customer focused and they are more flexible. Many of the new banks are using NBFCs as the last leg to expand their market. So, leveraging this, there is scope for exponential growth as compared to linear growth.<br/><br/>There are eCommerce players, healthcare companies and holiday companies, which were customers of banks. They can do underwriting based on the data they have. So, some of the current business of financial firms will come under threat. In the budget 2018 there are several measures that are offering benefits to the MSME sector.<br/><br/>Sameer Jaini, Digital Strategist, CEO - The Digital Fifth<br/><br/>Fintechs are not only impacting banks, they are also affecting big technology companies like Wipro, TCS, etc, which traditionally offer big solutions. Their deal sizes are in millions, compared to a few lakhs of the fintechs. Even consultancy business is changing. The large providers typically go with a T&amp;M model. Today, the sales guy cannot come as a coordinator, he must come with appropriate domain knowledge.<br/><br/>Banks themselves are changing direction. Earlier, they would do total outsourcing. Now they are hiring good technology guys to do inhouse development. Earlier, LMS was typically taken from a solutions provider. Now, many banks are building from scratch, as what is available is so generic that it does not give a long term competitive advantage. More and more things that are customer facing are getting insourced.<br/><br/>Prasanna Lohar, Head - Innovation, DCB Bank<br/><br/>The big tech companies have not thought of agility and new services around core applications. They are already late as fintechs are servicing things around the core. For example, Accenture is setting up a fintech lab. Collaboration will drive the success for fintechs.<br/><br/>Innovation Index of India is not growing in a big way. The parameters are how big organizations are innovating. So, India needs a structured way to adopt fintech, such as sandboxes. There are small countries like Singapore and Israel, which have gone a long way is making use of sandboxes. Microsoft has really changed its ways. It is working as if it is in a startup mode.<br/><br/>New banks have opportunity to bring in new technologies. Maybe, even core banking will come from a fintech. Banks are now recruiting ethical hackers, blockchain experts, UI/UX experts, etc, to bring in more innovation. Technologies like big data, IoT, AI, etc, are being adopted. When it comes to adopting fintech, we have done some hackathons. In India, we see lots of copycat solutions. We are suggesting the creation of a use case repository to empower fintechs, so that they do not need continuous explaining. This will enable vertical innovation as opposed to horizontal innovation.<br/><br/>Jagdish Narayanan, CTO, Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank<br/><br/>As a startup bank, we must see how to leverage the fintechs around us, as well as have the core backbone in shape. The backbone of CBS and regulatory and reporting solutions is hygiene and it should be left alone alone as far as possible. It must also be insisted that digital innovation should be done with API connections, making them lot more amenable to adopting newer technologies.<br/><br/>Kunal Patel, FinTech Speaker/Business Advisor and Mentor<br/><br/>Big companies and consultancies are today trying to play catch up. Banks are working with fintechs, but that was not the case earlier. They tend to invite some of their startups to their internal meetings as well. If someone in a big company tells you that they are working like a startup, that is not the case. The required cultural shift will happen slowly.<br/><br/>Big technology companies and startups must co-exist and be in sync. Many large IT companies today do not know what they are doing and how to remain relevant. These technology companies are still detached from their end users. Startups have a different mentality and are focused on the customers.<br/><br/>Akhil Handa, Head - Fintech &amp; New Business Initiatives, Bank of Baroda<br/><br/>We are fortunate to talk to both the big technology companies and the fintech startups. We have a problem in maintaining relationship with a big technology company. It relates to DNA on both sides. Banks need big technology companies to evolve. The large companies are making a roadmap for their future. Now who is drawing the maximum benefit is the fintechs, as they can go to both banks and big technology companies, in selling products or being acquired. A sale is largely made on putting together the requisite team. When we look at any proposition, we have 2 questions - is there any implicit call to a big company or can we do it internally? It is a great time to be a fintech. The strategy of large companies is to co-opt innovation and then take it to their clients. Many large technology companies today were fintechs 10 years ago.<br/><br/>Venkatesh Hariharan, Director - Fintech, iSPIRIT<br/><br/>When we talk about competition and collaboration with fintech ecosystems, I believe every industry is becoming a platform. Banking is, however, not in this frame because it is highly regulated. One of the big challenges is that banks are still looking at it as vendor management. If they look beyond, the scale will accelerate very fast. That is where commercial partnerships need to come up. Recently, the prime minister of the Philippines said his government wants to adopt Aadhaar. Many other countries are interested in leveraging solutions developed in India. With GST, millions of bills are coming online. That makes bill discounting a huge possibility. We see several digital lenders coming up.<br/><br/>Sudin Baraokar, Innovation Advisor, State Bank of India<br/><br/>The idea of building a bank chain alliance for blockchain was to move beyond our ecosystem. India must become not just the digital leader but also the technology leader. Only then we will have startups and fintechs thinking big. It is time for fintechs to think big and make use of the sandboxes. Instead of SBI buying the products and services, we can subscribe to and consume those services, and go ahead. Gartner predicts that by 2030, all banking services today will cease to exist.<br/><br/>Pankaj Pandey, CTO, IDBI Federal Life Insurance<br/><br/>Fintech companies must play a major role. We are still behind the west in fintech adoption. I see crucial role for the government and the regulator in this.

They would prefer to be viewed as tech companies rather than banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is hardly surprising. At best, banking is considered old-fashioned; at worst, banks are seen as irresponsible because of their role in the financial crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How much nicer, then, if banks could convince both analysts and customers that their real character is that of a tech company with a banking licence. Customers might then flock to them as they do to Apple or Facebook. Analysts and investors would give them a higher rating based on potential growth rather than mark them down in anticipation of regulatory costs and fines.</p><p>Probably the only major bank that is truly convincing in declaring itself a tech company is ING. Even though the Dutch bank was badly scarred by the financial crisis, requiring EU10bn in assistance from the Dutch government, its tech roots go back to the launch of the branchless operation ING Direct in the late 1990s. The bank then had to sell ING Direct USA - as well as investment management and insurance arms - to comply with European Commission rules on state aid. The UK and Canadian Direct businesses were sold to raise funds. ING has a presence in 40 countries, including the core markets of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg and the 'challenger markets', which include Germany, Austria and Spain.</p><p>Worth it in the long run</p><p>The restructuring has not prevented ING from forging ahead with what CEO Ralph Hamers calls its \"disruptive model\", in which the bank goes ahead with products that result in short-term revenue losses balanced out by the longer term goal of increased market share. Some operations are entirely online, for example in Germany where ING has built the country's third largest retail bank from scratch in 15 years and is currently taking on 1500 new customers every day. More recently, ING has been building itself into a digital bank with the focus on mobile as the main channel.</p><p>\"We started investing in digital four to five years ago when we saw the trends coming from Silicon Valley. We saw new business models coming up, we saw the customer behavioural changes as well, and the expectations of our customers more and more to do banking on the go,\" says Mr Hamers. \"We were [already] known for being the internet of banks as we basically built a bank around the internet rather than the internet around our bank, and through that we created a new business model.</p><p>\"Over the past couple of years, we've been building a digital bank, moving away from the desktop to mobile, because people have less and less time to spend [on banking]. So the mobile channel has overtaken the desktop channel, at least in most of the countries in which we work.\"</p><p>But this is just the beginning. The ultimate goal is for ING to have the same platform operating across every global region (just like the big tech companies), and to create a financial ecosystem that customers are interesting in engaging with on a regular basis (as with Facebook) and on which rival banks and other companies can also sell their products (similar to Amazon).</p><p>ING is trying to move away from the classic value proposition of taking deposits and loaning them out as funds to one where a large primary customer base (customers whose salary or income is paid through ING) interacts with the bank and generates fee income by buying investment and insurance products. The insurance products come from a third-party provider.</p><p>In ING-speak, this is not cross-selling but 'cross-buying', because it is a consequence of the customer visiting the bank website and finding an attractive product, rather than of a sales operation mounted by the bank.</p><p>Internally, the bank has reorganised so that instead of marketing, product development and IT departments all working in silos with the delays and communications problems this typically involves, they work together in project-specific squads which figure out the quickest way to solve a problem. Compared with the zero tolerance of mistakes typical of banking culture, these squads are encouraged to take risks and learn through mistakes. This is called the agile approach.</p><p>In a wide-ranging interview in New York, where ING was celebrating 20 years as a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange, Mr Hamers explained how he hopes the bank will be perceived differently in future</p><p>Hidden figures</p><p>\"What I see is that analysts do indeed look at us as a bank,\" he tells The Banker. \"The way we want to portray ourselves is as a tech company with a banking licence. Even further [ahead], I think we should basically be the largest bank without a balance sheet, if you really take it far into the future.</p><p>\"Every new client that we get is costing us in the first year. So, if analysts continue to basically value us on a multiples basis, my net earnings are lower, because I am growing, so I don't get granted [credit] for my growth [in the way that a tech company does].</p><p>\"Every year we grow by 1.4 million to 1.5 million new customers, and we can actually show that a new customer coming in over time generates value, even in a digital model, because we've turned around... from a savings model to a primary banking model. There will be cross-buying coming in, there will be new products sold to these customers as well. The value of these customers is nowhere taken into account in our valuation.\"</p><p>Despite Mr Hamers' strong argument, the reality is that ING is perceived only as one of the better players in a lacklustre eurozone banking sector, rather than as boasting the trailblazing status of a tech company.</p><p>A report by private bank Berenberg says: \"For those investors who have to own a bank in the eurozone, ING has to be top of the list. Near-term returns are limited to the dividend yield of 5% plus 4% growth in total book value/share, but this is what long-term winners in the sector deliver.\"</p><p>ING delivered an underlying net profit of EU4.98bn in 2016, up 17.9% on 2015's figures, adding 1.4 million retail customers, EU34.8bn in net core lending growth and EU28.5bn net customer deposit inflow as it did so. In The Banker's Top 1000 World Banks 2017 ranking, ING placed 33rd, up one place from the previous results.</p><p>Tough targets</p><p>But, as with other European banks, ING's prospects are limited by any future capital increase that may be required under the so-called Basel IV standard, and Mr Hamers says that the EU1bn the bank has cut on costs will be swallowed up by additional regulatory costs. In other words, the cost of being a tech company with a banking licence as opposed to being just a tech company is considerable.</p><p>For all its vision, ING cannot escape the realities of interest rates at historic lows - ING's net interest margin is 1.52% - with fee income only accounting for 15% of total earnings. The bank has a long way to go before it can claim to have left behind the balance sheet constraints of traditional banking and adopted a model based mainly on fee income. Return on equity is set to stay between 10% and 13%, and is currently 11%. The bank's cost-to-income ratio is 53%, and the aim is to bring it down to 50%.</p><p>\"Our ambition [on return on equity], the way we set it out three or four years ago, was anywhere between 10% to 13%,\" says Mr Hamers. \"At that moment, we were still in restructuring from a bank assurer to a bank, and that was quite an ambitious target, but we're hitting it. Last year it [was about] 11%. Looking forward, I think we can manage it at this level from a return perspective, even with the low interest rates, because of the cost you can attack with digitalisation.</p><p>\"However, the capital levels for European banks are still uncertain because of the discussions in Basel. And that could really influence our capital levels, and that could then affect return on equity as well.\"</p><p>It certainly must be dispiriting, albeit typical for a bank CEO, to see all that hard work done in cutting costs offset by new regulatory costs.</p><p>\"The ambition in [cost-to-income] is to get much closer to 50%,\" says Mr Hamers. \"Over the past couple of years, we've made enormous improvements to our cost structure. We took out about EU1bn of cost... but on the other side, we got a lot of regulatory costs in return: bank taxes, deposit guarantee systems, contributions to resolution funds, [all of] which is almost equal to what we took out; it's like EU850m for us last year.</p><p>\"All the savings that we've been able to generate through our digital model were taken up by these additional costs. But we continue to invest in digital. So you can expect our costs in many other countries, from an efficiency perspective, to go down.\"</p><p>New blood</p><p>ING is working on pushing revenues up by acquiring customers and launching products. \"At the same time, we're growing the number of products, we're growing the number of clients, so the savings in efficiency on one side because of being digital will be [augmented] by investments in areas to introduce new products, [and they will give us] real growth, because we continue to grow,\" says Mr Hamers. \"We still get 1500 new customers a day in Germany, we still get 600 new customers a day in Spain.\"</p><p>ING sets great store by attracting primary customers who will likely buy other products. The bank estimates that out of 36 million ING customers nearly 10 million are primary ones.</p><p>Mr Hamers was appointed ING's CEO in 2013 at the age of 46, becoming the youngest CEO in the bank's history. After the traumas of the bail-outs and the restructuring, it seems the board's thinking was that the bank needed a fresh approach. Noted for being casual in dress (at least by banking standards) and a tech enthusiast who frequently visits Silicon Valley, Mr Hamers has proven adept at getting the bank's message across by way of short YouTube messages. He also brings an all-round knowledge of banking through his various ING postings as the local manager in Romania, the Netherlands and latterly Belgium, and as head of the commercial banking network and deputy general manager of global lending risk management. He began his career with ABN Amro, before joining ING in 1991.</p><p>While Mr Hamers has received plaudits for his techie vision for the bank, he also has an affinity for data and statistics (he studied econometrics) and uses them to make fine cost calculations. This combination of talents makes him a powerful force in contemporary banking.</p><p>Getting access</p><p>The big ambition for ING under Mr Hamers is to create a single platform across the entire bank and develop a financial hub that works more like something Facebook or Amazon would create rather than like a conventional banking portal.</p><p>\"People do their banking on the go while waiting for the bus or the train,\" says Mr Hamers. \"They are not talking to each other, but they're on social media. That's where they post their blogs, that's where they have their conversations, that's where they put their pictures, that's where they live their lives. The question is, as a bank, how do you get in there? How do you get into that life? Because that's where they spend their time... and for a bank to be relevant, you have to get in there, and you have to be connected to those ecosystems, or be an ecosystem yourself.\"</p><p>Mr Hamers says the goal is to create an ecosystem with a strong identifiable brand open to other types of products, including banking services from competitors.</p><p>A first step in this direction is get a single platform across the bank. \"[The ecosystem can come] on the back of creating that one platform that all these tech companies have, because they have one platform across the globe, whereas banks have platforms per country.\"</p><p>\"I have, in the 13 countries in which [ING is] a domestic bank, 13 different apps doing exactly the same. Facebook is the same everywhere, Uber is the same everywhere, why can't ING be the same everywhere?\"</p><p>A long journey</p><p>Yet even ING, an early adopter of technology, has legacy issues to deal with before it can create a single platform.</p><p>\"It will take quite some time, for two reasons - first, even though we are a young, internet-based bank, we still have some technology that we have to renew,\" says Mr Hamers. \"We have many customers that we have to take along as well, so we're not starting from scratch. We have 36 million customers who we have to take along on this journey. We have basically determined for ourselves some kind of an intermediate phase, which means that in four years' time we want to have accomplished two things in terms of merging platforms: one big project between two branch banks, omni-channel banks if you wish, in Belgium and the Netherlands, so we're creating one platform for 11 million customers there. And then a project that we call 'the model bank', which will be one platform and one way to interact for all of our clients in France, Italy, Austria, the Czech Republic and Spain.\"</p><p>To bring about these kinds of sweeping changes, ING has had to rethink its culture and the way it works. Gone is working in silos and in a process-driven way that meant projects took years to reach fruition. Gone is a culture where mistakes are unacceptable, to be replaced by one in which learning from mistakes is encouraged. Most importantly, the bank sets out to disrupt itself before anyone else, such as a fintech competitor, does it to the bank.</p><p>\"If you are the first one to move, if you are the first one to disrupt then, yes, you will lose some income on one side, but you will be able to compensate by growth on the other side,\" says Mr Hamers. \"That's what we see when we introduce internet banking in some of the countries in which we are already a bank. We were very aggressively pricing our savings, we were disrupting our own business. But we grew much faster because we took clients from the competitors as well, so that's the way you can actually make it work, and that's what keeps [employees] motivated.</p><p>\"The way we put it into practice is that we launch services that we know we will lose income on. For example, we launched Payconiq in Belgium, which is a payments app. That payments app takes out the use of and the need for a card system to guarantee the payments going from a consumer to a merchant, so we're totally taking out the card scheme. We're disrupting the card business but we're also disrupting our own fee income from that card business, let's face it. But I'm convinced that if we don't do it somebody else will.\"</p><p>Other recent tech wins have been the strong growth in users of the Twyp (The Way You Pay) app in Spain allowing peer-to-peer payment, and the development in Romania of Startarium, providing online resources for entrepreneurs.</p><p>Money in, money out</p><p>To maintain and further advance its technological edge, ING will invest EU800m in digital banking by 2021. To ensure that this translates into returns for shareholders, the plan is to take out EU900m in cost over the same period.</p><p>Mr Hamers believes that banking products do not change very much, but the way that you deliver them does. Equally you can use information gained from social media to assist in the old-fashioned task of credit scoring, enabling the bank to make very quick decisions on loan requests.</p><p>\"There are many different ways that these self-learning algorithms operate, and basically you use the old-fashioned way [as well], so you will still have data from credit bureaus and your own data in the bank,\" he says. \"But you can also go out and see what data is out there, in terms of behaviour, in terms of statement, in terms of activities of clients and plans of clients, that they communicate about in social media. You can derive a specific pattern there, that helps you score these clients... We're trying these kinds of algorithms to see whether we can have services that are differentiating for our clients. The only reason we do it is, if we can give you an answer to your credit request, within 10 minutes, and whether it's 'yes' or 'no', people who get a 'no' are still appreciative of your service.\"</p><p>But none of this is possible unless a bank can successfully change its way of working. ING claims to take 'the agile approach, just like Spotify, Netflix and Google'. Since this approach was introduced in 2015, staff with different skill sets come together to work in squads to complete specific tasks. Once done they regroup. Private offices are a thing of the past and everyone works in a shared space.</p><p>\"If you want to compete in the world of tech and if you, increasingly, want to become a tech company, you have to organise like a tech company. You have to get the culture of a tech company,\" says Mr Hamers.</p><p>It is clear that by changing its way of working and its way of delivery, ING has moved the banking needle a long way forward.

In August this year, India relaxed local sourcing norms for single brand retailers with foreign direct investment (FDI) and allowed them to sell online even before setting up physical stores. The move is expected to benefit some of the largest global retailers including IKEA, H&amp;M and Uniqlo. Prior to the reform, for singlebrand retailers with over 51 per cent FDI, the policy required 30 per cent of value of goods to be procured from India as part of the local sourcing requirement. However, the new policy maintains that all procurements made from India by a single-brand retailer for that brand shall be counted towards local sourcing, irrespective of whether the goods procured are sold in India or exported. Furthermore, the Government has decided that sourcing of goods from India for global operations can be done directly by the entity undertaking single-brand retail or its group companies (resident or non-resident), or indirectly by them through a third-party.</p><p><br/><br/>Moreover, brands now applying for FDI in single-brand retail will also be allowed to commence e-commerce operations even before they set up physical stores, subject to the condition that the entity opens bricks-and-mortar stores within two years from the date of start of online retail. The reformed policy is making a big difference in terms of bringing investments in the sector, employment and growth. This will also dramatically increase the export capability of the country. The FDI policy has been lauded throughout the year by global brands like IKEA, Uniqlo, etc. even as these brands continue to work towards increasing their sourcing from India.<br/><br/>The reform policy was also welcomed by Kumar Rajagopalan, Chief Executive Officer, Retailers Association of India (RAI), who appreciated the Government's stance on contract manufacturing. \"FDI in contract manufacturing is also a good move as it can encourage new types of manufacturers to look at India seriously. The easing of the channel pays for single brand retailers by allowing them to start off with online and then subsequently go offline and is also a laudable change as it increases ease of doing business and will encourage them to come to the country.\"<br/><br/>With an escalating trade war between the US and China, the opening up of contract manufacturing is bringing about certainty for companies who were seeking to set up an alternate manufacturing hub in the country. Prior to this, India had no specific provision for contract manufacturing in its FDI policy.<br/><br/>As per a report by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), FDI equity inflow in India in 2019-20 (till August) stood at US $ 19.33 billion. India received US $ 2.73 billion of foreign investment in the month of August 2019 as compared to US $ 2.54 billion in the previous year.<br/><br/>International firms clawing their way into the Indian market<br/><br/>Today, India is one amongst the fastest growing retail industry in the world and is increasingly becoming the focal point for some of the largest global retail firms. An enormously growing middle-class population with ever increasing disposable income, powerful manufacturing sector and strong economic fundamentals have made the country an important destination for international brands to have their strong foothold in. The Indian middle class is forecast to expand at 19.4 per cent per year, outpacing China, Mexico and Brazil. In fact, McKinsey Fashion Scope had maintained at the beginning of this year that 2019 will be the year in which India will take centre stage and that more than 300 international brands are expected to open stores in the country in the next two years.<br/><br/>According to data from McKinsey's Fashion Scope city-level growth forecasting tool, India's apparel market will be worth US $ 59.3 billion (about Rs. 4.12 lakh crore) in 2022, making it the sixth-largest in the world and comparable to Britain's US $ 65 billion (Rs. 4.51 lakh crore) and Germany's US $ 63.1 billion (Rs. 4.38 lakh crore). It's just not the figures that say so, but also the continuously increasing interest of some of the biggest international retail firms in the Indian market and their continuous expansion and fund infusion in business here. Walmart, which bought India's largest online firm Flipkart Group, last year for US $ 16 billion, has been infusing funds and working on growing its India business, throughout the year. In fact, infusion by both Walmart and Amazon in India in the whole of this year has been phenomenal and worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The online retail giant Amazon had recently announced its plan to roll out more than 100 kiosks in malls across the country by the end of the year. The company experimented with its first kiosk two years ago in Bangalore and has been operating four of them in the country. In June, this US-based retail giant stepped up its investment in its Indian marketplace and pumped in Rs. 2,800 crore. It had infused Rs. 2,200 crore into its Indian business just six months ago and has so far spent upwards of US $ 5.5 billion. Amazon India allotted 2.8 billion equity shares of Rs. 10 each aggregating to Rs. 2,800 crore at par on rights basis to the existing shareholders of the company, according to the regulatory documents filed by Amazon. The resolution for this capital infusion was passed by the board of directors of Amazon Seller Services on 21 May. Again, after filing its annual performance report for the financial year ending March 2019, Amazon decided to invest Rs. 4,472.50 crore (US $ 630 million) in three of its Indian businesses - Amazon Pay, Amazon Retail and Amazon Sellers Service, according to business intelligence platform Paper.vc. The retail giant's main rival is Walmart owned Flipkart and the recent funding is expected to help the firm take on its opposing party. Jeff Bezos, Founder of the retail giant, had committed investment worth US $ 5 billion in the Indian market in 2016.<br/><br/>Amazon and Flipkart have been investing millions of dollars across various operations as they are looking at strengthening their position in the Indian e-commerce market. For its festive season sale, Flipkart brought onboard nearly 27,000 kirana shops across 700 cities to strengthen its pan-India supply chain in order to enhance e-commerce experience for its existing 160 million customers. Flipkart had received Rs. 1616.12 crore in capital infusion from its Singapore-based parent company called Flipkart Pvt. Ltd. in September, according to the documents filed with Registrar of Companies (RoC). Before this, the Singapore entity had injected Rs. 1431.3 crore in Flipkart India in January this year. Flipkart India has allotted 4,64,403 equity shares to its Singapore parent entity at Rs. 34,800 per share that includes a premium of Rs. 34,799 on each share.<br/><br/>So, while these two online retail giants are competing for a better presence in India, a number of other foreign brands have entered the country in 2019 courtesy the growing retail industry in India. For example, Uniqlo from Japan, Hummeland Ecco from Denmark, Yoyoso from China, among others.<br/><br/>Reliance is gunning for top slots in the Indian retail scenario<br/><br/>India's biggest conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd., has been hankering to reach the top in every industry it lays its eyes on. Led by Mukesh Ambani, Reliance has found footing in retail unlike any other with its respective subsidiary, Reliance Retail's fashion and lifestyle retailing business crossing the Rs. 10,000 crore milestone in 2018-19. This is despite the slowdown of business from 10.3 per cent of total sales in FY '18 to 8.4 per cent in FY '19. Accordingly, Reliance Retail's fashion and lifestyle retail business revenue in 2018-19 was Rs. 10,967 crore as compared to Rs. 7,127 crore in the previous fiscal.<br/><br/>The growth in the business comes as no surprise to any one who is associated with the industry, seeing the pace at which the company has invested in and acquired ventures across platforms.<br/><br/>The first quest to strengthen its readymade garments and accessories portfolio in the fashion and lifestyle retail space came with the acquisition of diversified conglomerate ITC's mid segment menswear brand, John Players.<br/><br/>Reliance acquired the assets of John Players, which includes the brand and distribution rights through 750 stores. This is expected to have added Rs. 350 crore to Reliance Retail's value fashion business carried out through Reliance Trends and Ajio.com.<br/><br/>Reliance Industries is not only interested in established brands but seems to consider the start-up space as one to watch out for. In August this year, the behemoth acquired a majority stake in Google-backed fashion portal Fynd, which hints towards Reliance's increasing ambitions in the e-commerce sector. As a part of the deal, RIL bought 87.6 per cent stake in the company for Rs. 295 crore as it aims to push for online-to offline (O2O) commerce.<br/><br/>In one of the biggest acquisitions of the year, Reliance bought Hamleys for about Rs. 620 crore (GBP 67.96 million) in an all-cash deal. Not only this, the conglomerate has set out to help some of the biggest brands open their doors to the Indian market. As per reports, the prestigious Tiffany and Co., as well as the popular home goods retailer Pottery Barn will be unveiling multiple stores across the country in the near future.<br/><br/>Italian luxury house Versace and Valentino have been on a lookout for a new partner in India and Reliance seems to be the top contender to take over the India franchisee rights and sell authorised products, adding more names to its already vast portfolio of luxury and premium brands.<br/><br/>Reliance Brands is also looking to expand Italian denim brand Replay in India, in less than a year after it acquired the distribution rights for the premium fashion label to be sold in Indian markets. The brand will open doors to almost 10 stores by the end of 2021, joining the league of brands such as Calvin Klein, Diesel and GAP<br/><br/>In the next five years, Reliance is aiming for a fivefold growth of its fashion retail stores in India. From the current 557 Reliance Trends outlets spread across 160 cities, the company plans to take the tally to 2,500 stores in 300 cities by 2023. Reliance Retail is also working on an omnichannel strategy to integrate its offline retail stores with its online business. It is for this reason that Reliance has been withdrawing its clothes, shoes and lifestyle products from would-be rival marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart. It aims to shift focus to its own portals.<br/><br/>Reliance Industries has the highest number of global fashion and lifestyle brands in the country with around four dozen joint ventures or master franchisee arrangements with international labels including Diesel, Kate Spade, Steve Madden, Burberry, Canali, Emporio Armani, Furla, Jimmy Choo and Marks &amp; Spencer.<br/><br/>Government calls for 'Start-up India', international players get attracted<br/><br/>India's coveted start-up club of unicorns - firms valued at US $ 1 billion or more, are growing faster than ever. 2019 alone has produced over half a dozen unicorns so far, 8 to be precise. Homegrown ventures have managed to garner US $ 7.67 billion in the nine-months ended 30 September of 2019. Holding the position of the third largest hub of startups in the world, the Indian Government has taken upon itself to enable every enterprising entrepreneur to succeed in his endeavour. While announcing a start-up friendly Union Budget in July this year, the Government made its agenda clear of addressing the issues of unemployment and reviving the ailing economy which necessitated building confidence of start-ups and SMEs through reforms and policy amendments in their favour. India has seen the rise of over 40,000 start-ups, which have created more than US $ 130 billion of value from January 2014 to September 2018. In such an exciting phase of the Indian economy, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has emphasised on push for start-ups, mudra loans for up and coming entrepreneurs and also easier approval system to create companies, which has been lauded by the overall start-up ecosystem. To delve deeper into what the budget has brought for the Indian start-ups, the Finance Minister has begun the process of clearing the tax issue which mostly discourages discerning entrepreneurs from turning their ideas into businesses. According to the announcements, start-ups and investors filing necessary declarations are no more constrained by any kind of scrutiny with respect to the valuation of the share premium and the funds raised by the start-ups are no more subject to undergo the scrutiny of the Income Tax Department. Also, income tax assessing officers need to obtain prior approval from their supervisory officers before conducting an inquiry or verification of the income tax return filed by the start-ups.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the announcements also ruled that the start-ups funded by Category-II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) are now exempted from angel tax and they no longer will be questioned where funding exceeds the face value of shares, as under Section 56(2)(viib). Keeping in line with this, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs also said that it will allow start-ups to issue 50 per cent of their paid-up capital as sweat equity. The period of exemption from other regulatory filings which was 5 years has now been extended to 10 years. According to the DPIIT, ventures will come under the definition of start-ups for up to 10 years from their date of incorporation. A notification will be issued to inform start-ups of the proposed changes. Even as most of the start-ups that started operations have held solid ground, once popular names likes Buttercups (an online lingerie retailer) and Stalk Buy Love, women's fashion apparel portal have fallen prey to tough market conditions and lack of funding.<br/><br/>While these and many other measures by the Government are making India a favourable market for growth of startups, they are also attracting a number of international online firms to the country. However, these firms started doing business in the country through illegal ways which later led to the seizure of around 500 of their parcels by the Mumbai Customs. Many e-commerce firms from China were shipping goods ordered by Indians to various cities claiming they were 'gifts'. As per the domestic laws, any gifts received by Indians up to Rs. 5,000 don't attract any taxes. After the Government's clampdown on Chinese e-commerce companies and sellers who were allegedly sending goods to India as gifts to evade duty, these firms are now working towards establishing their bases in India for smoother functioning. Shein which entered India in 2017 has invested Rs. 250 crore for marketing in India and has localised its customer service, logistics and marketing efforts in the country. Shein has attracted more than 3 million followers on social media and collaborated with about 2,000 influencers and received about 20,000 orders a day.<br/><br/>India going for no-ownership trend<br/><br/>Sharing economy is the new in-thing in India and as per a research, by 2025, it is estimated that many areas of the sharing economy will rival the size of their traditional counterparts. This has evolved in such a way that sharing model has become a default choice for younger consumers in the society. While categories like real estate, furniture, automobiles, etc. have been excelling in this model, clothing and accessories segment is now taking up the market by storm and it makes perfect sense for people who cannot afford luxury brands but do appreciate the intricacies and quality. According to a report by Allied Market Research, globally, online clothing rental market size is estimated to reach US $ 1,856 million by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 10.6 per cent from 2017 to 2023. And this is estimated to grow at a much faster rate in India. The online fashion rental market in India, pegged at US $ 3-4 billion, has been expanding continuously with a number of existing players as well as start-ups like Flyrobe, Stage3, The Clothing Rental, Liberent, among others, which are extensively attracting seed funding.<br/><br/>The industry has seen immense potential which is also proven by the very recent acquisition of Flyrobe by New Delhi based start-up AARK World Pvt. Ltd. that owns and operates fashion rental service platform Rent It Bae. The merger of the two businesses will now operate under the brand name Flyrobe. The deal is aimed at accelerating growth and expansion. The company plans to expand its footprints in India and overseas in Dubai, London and the US through a franchise model. The firm is also launching virtual walls at all Flyrobe stores. Within months, the trial feature with Augmented Reality will be available on its mobile apps as well, which would be called 'Tryrobe'. This technology will be the first of its kind in the ethnic fashion space. The company plans to incorporate an omnichannel strategy to grow the business as consumer demand for a multichannel shopping experience continues to mount.<br/><br/>The year ruled that fast fashion is not a sustainable practice as it is and to top it, the shopping behaviour of today's millennials has changed drastically wherein they need a new garment for every occasion. And this has led to rise in rental market in developing economies of Asia-Pacific as they are looking for an economical alternative to direct purchasing every time. On the same lines, a number of brands - both national and international - are embracing the concept of circular economy. Swedish fast fashion brand H&amp;M is the latest player to show its commitment to a more circular version of the fashion industry with its new rental, repair and recycling concept in its H&amp;M Sergels Torg store located in Stockholm. Re-commerce is another term to the otherwise known resale industry and this too is attracting a number of millennials and generation Z population across the world. Re-commerce retailers are growing 20 times faster than the conventional retail market and 5 times faster than discount retailers, according to Coresight Research.<br/><br/>On a lookout for newer strategies amidst retail downsizing and bankruptcies<br/><br/>2019, a year that has been packed with surprises, has also relayed many shocks to those who have had to bid adieu to some of their favourite brands. Thanks to the rapidly changing consumer trends and mounting competition from e-commerce players, traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers and brands are forced to shutter stores at rates that have never been seen earlier.<br/><br/>By this November, retail store closures were already nearly 55 per cent higher than during the entirety of 2018. That's according to advisory firm Coresight Research, which put the number of closures at more than 9,000 as of 1 November.<br/><br/>Names that were once etched in minds as the most popular shopping destinations have declared bankruptcy, despite various attempts to restructure and stay afloat. The most distressing were the Chapter 11 filings by Forever 21, Barney's, Payless, Diesel among many others. Some brands, however, have downsized considerably in order to decrease expenses in the day and age of rising costs. JCPenney, Gap, Sears and Victoria's Secret are just some of the names that are in the process of effecting a turnaround.<br/><br/>However, the US $ 1.5 trillion apparel industry is one that companies continue to keep vying for. In an attempt to gain a piece of that pie, quite a few stellar international companies have collided with the world of fashion in the form of unusual collaborations.<br/><br/>Although the year has been a tough one for retail in general, the apparel and fashion industry continues to be a force to be reckoned with. The United States' apparel market alone is expected to grow from US $ 350 billion in 2015 to US $ 385 billion in 2025, that projects a CAGR of 2 per cent, according to Statista.<br/><br/>Pepsi marked its entry into the fashion world through a collaboration with homegrown ready-to-wear label HUEMN. The collection which was designed by designer duo Pranav Misra and Shyma Shetty was launched at Lotus India Fashion Week S/S '20.<br/><br/>The company has made a conscious effort to make the collection as sustainable as possible with all the denim fabric used being made with recycled plastic. The collection consists primarily of athleisurewear and is a step forward for PepsiCo's 'Winning with Purpose' vision which aims to build a world where plastics never become waste.<br/><br/>Another brand foraying into collaboration is Italian sportscar maker Ferrari. It has collaborated with Italian luxury house Giorgio Armani. Not only fashion, the brand is aiming to diversify into entertainment and luxury services as well, looking to garner 10 per cent of its EBDIT within the next decade from these categories. Ferrari's new direction in branded goods means items like parkas and sunglasses will now carry premium-style pricing more, keeping up with the image of the company's sports cars.<br/><br/>Tommy Hilfiger has taken a leaf out of its history book by revisiting the first Coca-Cola Clothes collection that it created in 1986. Celebrating that iconic milestone, Tommy Jeans launched the re-edition of the styles as Tommy Jeans Coca-Cola capsule collection in collaboration with the popular beverage conglomerate.<br/><br/>Shake up at the top management level<br/><br/>As some brands are tirelessly working to revamp their companies in order to gain traction in a declining market, others have had to bear the loss of a brilliant leader.<br/><br/>One of the most disheartening blows to the e-commerce world was the resignation of Jack Ma, the Founder and Executive Chairman of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Being known for his playful image and quirky antics for motivating his employees, Ma has been able to leave behind a legacy that will break the pattern of wobbling share prices and overall downturn of big tech companies when their charismatic leaders take their leave.<br/><br/>The record-breaking sales of US $ 38 billion on the recent Singles' Day sale held on 11th of November 2019, is a testament to how the company continues to flourish on the strong foundation he laid. The sales saw a 26 per cent rise from last year's GMV.<br/><br/>Alibaba's secondary listing in Hong Kong became the world's largest offering in 2019, larger than the roughly US $ 8 billion raised by Uber in May. The company is looking to issue 500 million new ordinary shares which are likely to raise HK $ 88 billion (US $ 11.3 billion) before a so-called 'green shoe' over-allotment option that will have 75 million more shares. This option could take the total to US $ 12.9 billion.<br/><br/>2019 came as a year for one of the biggest losses to the fashion industry with the death of fashion maven Karl Lagerfeld. The creative director of iconic brands such as Chanel, Fendi and his own eponymous label, Lagerfeld was one of the most famous, outspoken, and influential figures who helped make Paris the fashion capital of the world and shaped the luxury behemoth, Chanel over the course of 36 years. Following his demise, Virginie Viard took his place, having been his right-hand woman since 1987.<br/><br/>Another popular brand facing its fair share of struggles this year that were offset by something other than the 'retail apocalypse', is Ted Baker. Ray Kelvin, Founder and Chief Executive of Ted Baker stepped down amid allegations of sexual misconduct related to forced hugging by business colleagues. The news made the first-half results swindle with the company shares plummeting as much as 38 per cent.<br/><br/>Lindsay Page was entrusted with the reigns of the company thereafter, and a string of new executives, including former ASOS People Director Peter Collyer who joined as the Chief People Officer, have come on-board to overturn the current slump. The company also poached industry veteran Rachel Osborn to be the Chief of Finance after having held the same position at department store chain Debenhams for a year.<br/><br/>Overall, it has been a year of shuffling of the top management of well-known brands. Gap Inc. announced that CEO Art Peck, who took on the role in 2015, will be stepping down. The news caused the company's stock to plummet 7 per cent to US $ 16.75. The son of Founders Donald and Doris Fisher, Robert J Fisher, who serves as Gap's Non-executive Chairman of board, will be taking over the position as interim CEO and President.<br/><br/>The Founder of Superdry, Julian Dunkerton has become the British retailer's permanent CEO after emerging victorious in a bitter battle for control in April wherein he prompted the existing directors, including Chief Executive Euan Sutherland, to resign en masse.<br/><br/>JC Penney Co. Inc. hired James DePaul, Former Chief Administration Officer and Senior Vice President of stores and operations at Shopko and a 25-year veteran in the industry.<br/><br/>An appointment that is taking the fashion world by storm is that of Tom Ford as the Chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA). After taking over from Diane von Furstenberg earlier this year, Ford introduced a slew of changes ahead of the New York Fashion Week S/S'20. One of his first moves was to make the board more diverse by including younger designers, especially those of colour, who have been making their mark on the industry. The other move was introducing a shorter schedule for NYFW.<br/><br/>Body positivity and inclusion remained buzzwords in 2019<br/><br/>Fashion was always meant to be a form of self-expression but that was confined only to the skinny, white girl. This industry is fast realising the necessity for inclusion of not only people of colour but also people across sizes.<br/><br/>This year, a lot of brands have stepped up their game to show that they are not far behind in the race for inclusion. Dolce &amp; Gabbana unveiled garments that range up to size 54 in Italy, the approximate equivalent of a stateside size 18-20. This move by the Milan-based brand to extend its sizing, which went into force with its pre-fall collection, makes it the first first luxury fashion house to extend its size range to 20 in the US, 22 in the UK and 54 in Europe women.<br/><br/>There is hardly anyone in the fashion industry who is not familiar with Agent Provocateur, the supremely sexy and luxe lingerie brand launched by Serena Rees. However, Rees set out to venture into a unique concept with her modern and inclusive intimates and street wear brand Les Girls Les Boys. The brand will offer gender fluid underwear, i.e., pieces that are unisex and can be worn by both men and women.<br/><br/>Not only are brands trying to bear in mind to break stereotypes that have been held up for ages on, even ramps are becoming more inclusive. In February, of the 7,300 models who walked in 221 shows, about two of every five cast were persons of colour. That's a 38.8 per cent increase from spring 2019's findings. From Nike introducing plus size mannequins, Sangalese model Khoudia Dio who became an internet sensation overnight for her strikingly dark, glistening skin and Trans model Stav Strashko have walked the runway for Marc Jacobs and Coach. Even Robyn Lawley, an Australian model who is an advocate for body positivity, has been one of the first women above sample size to appear in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. Modelling has thus come a long way to include people who conventionally faced rejection from this industry obsessed with fair skin and emaciated bodies.<br/><br/>Victoria's Secret's decline in the past few months has somewhat opened the management's eyes that their racial and size bias is no longer going to sit well with consumers. One of the major reasons for its declining popularity is the fact that female customers do not feel included and are tired of the sexy marketing. They have had to lay off 50 people at their headquarters owing to tanking sales and the head of stores and store operations has stepped down amid a failed attempt at a turnaround.<br/><br/>Victoria's Secret has been scrutinised for its lack of inclusivity in the past following former L Brands' Chief Marketing Officer Ed Razek's comments about transgender and plus-size models. L Brands announced that it would cancel the 2019 show in an effort to evolve the marketing of Victoria's Secret. To effect a change in their marketing approach, Victoria's Secret is making sure its new cast of Angels are represented in all of its stores. They have hired their first transgender model, Valentina Sampaio.<br/><br/>Victoria's Secret also announced a recent collaboration with UK-based lingerie brand Bluebella, that has long been dedicated to empowering women, on a collection that 'celebrates inclusivity and strength - each piece is designed for modern, empowered and confident women.\"<br/><br/>US-China trade war: Dominated trade discussions in 2019<br/><br/>US-China trade war was among the major issue across the global apparel and textile industry. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has reported that India got an overall benefit of US $ 755 million and Vietnam of about US $ 2,601 million from this trade war.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning of the trade war, Vietnam received more orders from US clients, but the country's industry is concerned about the effects of the influx of Chinese firms escaping tariffs. Chinese companies will directly compete with local companies in terms of labour which will create big pressure on local players. India and Pakistan too get a little share of China and even Bangladesh does not get more comparatively.<br/><br/>Though in India, whenever one talks to apparel manufacturers, very few accept that they are gaining 'something' from this ongoing war or they are able to fit in the cost given by the buyers for orders which are shifting from China to India.<br/><br/>Apart from Indian apparel exporters, even US-based brands are also in dilemma on this issue. Various moves taken by the US Government are seen as a way to mitigate domestic concerns ahead of the 2020 elections. Not only US and China are in loss, but also other countries are left in a confused state due to the frequent changingly conditions and continuous discussion between both the countries.<br/><br/>The United States Fashion Industry Association (USFIA) claimed that the average price of US apparel imports from Bangladesh, India and Vietnam increased by 20 per cent or even more in the first five months of 2019 because companies shifted their orders to these countries.<br/><br/>In 2019, from January to September, India apparel export to US increased by 8.37 per cent (value-wise) and by 5.71 per cent (volume-wise). While India's overall exports of textile and apparel sector (including handicrafts) have increased from US $ 39.3 billion in 2017-18 to US $ 40.4 billion in 2018-19.<br/><br/>Exactly a year after, there is an election coming up in the US and the recent talk between both the countries is moving in a positive direction. Therefore, one can expect that this situation will be finally clear and the 'war' will end. If there is no solution to this 16-month-old trade war, by 2021, US economy may face more challenges as a recession can hit US, while the global economy may face a loss of US $ 455 billion or even more.<br/><br/>Policies specific for apparel industry announced, but little impact<br/><br/>Special package for the apparel industry, demonetisation, GST, change in labour laws are four major policy-level decisions of the Government in recent years have impacted the overall economy as well as the apparel and textile industry. This shows the activeness of the Government also.<br/><br/>On the flip side, forget about National Textile Policy as enough has been said and heard about the same in the last six years, and with 2019 passing by, the Government will again become active on this. But as per industry informed people, it will take at least a few more months in 2020 for the policy to become final. Even apparel exporters are now not that much bothered about this as for them, the major concern is Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL). This WTO-compliant scheme rebates the embedded taxes including central excise duty on fuel used in transportation, embedded CGST paid on inputs, purchases made from unregistered dealers, inputs for the transport sector, embedded CGST and compensation cess on coal used in the production of electricity.<br/><br/>But now the term 'policy paralysis' is used with reference to RoSCTL because this was supposed to come into effect from the date of notification (7th March 2019) and and was supposed to remain in force up to 31st March 2020. But even after 8 months, the industry is still awaiting notification of the same.<br/><br/>It is to be noted that this issue has been highlighted many times in several public forums but its detailed notification is still pending. Industry stalwarts insist that it is not just 5 to 6 per cent that they will get under this scheme; this can be their survival tool as the business is now running on a very thin margin and this incentive really matters. The maximum rate of rebate for apparel is 6.05 per cent while for made-ups, this goes up to 8.2 per cent.<br/><br/>The only positive in terms of policy matter in 2019 has been the initiative of the coming together of various trade bodies/ associations on one platform under the Ministry of Textiles and the Ministry of Commerce.<br/><br/>Moving forward, the Government is releasing the new Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2020-25 and the industry is eagerly and positively looking for the same.<br/><br/>Dull year for manufacturing, yet silver linings emerge<br/><br/>2019 was the year of election for India, and as usual, many companies put their expansion plans on hold for a clear picture of the country's overall scenario. Besides, all developments have taken place as usual like previous years. Despite challenges and down sentiments, big and small expansions have taken place.<br/><br/>There are many bigger players who are diversifying within the textile industry, but this will take time that is at least one or two years, due to their individual as well as overall business sentiments. Orient Crafts has kicked off its second large unit at Ranchi and the third is under process. In 2020, many more factories will be operational here as currently, they are under process.<br/><br/>With an investment of Rs. 250 crore, Page Industries also announced to set up a factory in Odisha. As a surprise element, V2 Retail started its manufacturing operations in Noida.<br/><br/>Some of the companies (big ones as well as SMEs) are slowly moving towards their ambitious targets with their unique strategies and they are sure to achieve their targets.<br/><br/>Various states continued their attractive policies to lure apparel manufacturers and MP was also added in this list of 2019. Richa Global, Maral Overseas and Trident Group announced their investment in MP while Avgol, Israel also announced an investment of Rs. 1,250 crore.<br/><br/>Irrespective of the claims made by Gujarat, it is now clear that garmenting is not growing there. And reasons for the same are numerous, at the industry as well as Government level.<br/><br/>Few players which are into textiles and not apparels also announced their entry into apparel production like Kolhapur's well known name Mukta Group of Industries.<br/><br/>SMEs across the nation, continued to add more products, adding small and new factories in established hubs which are comparatively cost-effective like NCR, Noida and Greater Noida. Many new players have also forayed into apparel manufacturing as they are confident about their concepts, planning and resources.<br/><br/>Lesser-known emerging hubs like Indore also went for good expansion. Apparel Online India covered many such companies in 2019.<br/><br/>Investment in automation especially monitoring systems, and implementation of lean and efficiency enhancement continued at a steady pace in 2019. To enhance R&amp;D in apparel manufacturing, Shahi Exports established a Chair in NIFT Delhi which is the first of its kind in the Indian apparel manufacturing sector.<br/><br/>Global online Clothing rental Market<br/><br/>BY 2023 US $ 1,856 MILLION<br/><br/>India's apparel Market<br/><br/>BY 2022 US $ 59.3 Billion<br/><br/>FDI Equity Inflow<br/><br/>2019-20 (TILL AUGUST)<br/><br/>US $ 19.33 BILLION</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APPROL-0050936467</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APPROL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTD-C0W1-DXMP-K365-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6022\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Apparel Online, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Apparel Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 16, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

They've tried hard to get Denver city regulators and the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to crack down on the apps companies for not following taxi industry regulations that hold cabs to defined territories, require them to pick up all passengers and set taxi rates.</p><p>A new law proposed at the state Legislature would legalize ride-sharing app service under a new classification of \"transportation network company.\" The bipartisan bill would regulate them for safety - requiring criminal background checks for drivers, set limits for time behind the wheel and establish minimums for insurance coverage.</p><p>But, at least in early drafts, the rules would be far more loose than for taxi cabs.</p><p>Some see the eventual passage or defeat of the law as a legislative referendum on the fate of Lyft and UberX in Colorado.</p><p>The Colorado PUC staff is prepared to slap a cease-and-desist order on Lyft and UberX, saying they don't comply with state laws. The PUC staff will seek support from the PUC's commissioners to shut Lyft and UberX down if Colorado law isn't changed to legalize the services, said Doug Dean, director of the PUC.</p><p>\"If the legislation fails, we will go out there and start issuing civil penalties and fines and put these services out of business,\" he said. \"It's not our first choice, it's just what we'll have to do.\"</p><p>Even if that's the case, no one interviewed for this story expects ride-sharing app technology to go away. Uber has shown itself to be adaptable, and willing to doggedly press for rule changes that get its services accepted.</p><p>Nearly everyone interviewed expects ride-sharing technology to be legalized in some fashion. The question is: Will it be a niche transportation option, or supplant taxis as the dominant way to catch a car-for-hire?</p><p>If app-driven ride-sharing in personal cars is allowed, it'll becomes something cab companies will offer, too, predicts Brad Whittle, senior vice president in charge of the Colorado operation of Yellow Cab taxis.</p><p>\"We might have no choice but to operate like they do,\" he said.</p><p>Dean, the director of the PUC, says he doesn't doubt Whittle means it. He's uncertain regulated cab companies could survive as they are today with a largely unregulated, cheaper ride service growing in popularity.</p><p>A lot depends on what kind law, if any, is passed by the legislature: \"This could result in de facto taxi deregulation,\" Dean said.</p><p>Cabs, under Colorado law, are licensed to operate in a defined area and charge approved rates, and they can't legally deny service to a paying customer in their service area.</p><p>If ride-sharing rules ultimately give cab companies a way out of such obligations, will the poor or elderly still have access to cars for hire? How long will traditional taxi service remain viable?</p><p>Some of what the future may look like is already playing out in San Francisco, home city to both Lyft and Uber. There, thorny issues are being sorted about insurance and liability for accidents in the ride-sharing model (see the accompanying story).</p><p>San Francisco's taxi and limo companies also have lost a third of their drivers since the arrival of ride-sharing apps, according to research by Forbes magazine. Many are presumed to have gone into business for themselves, using their own cars with Lyft or Uber apps becoming their dispatching service and payment processor.</p><p>Ali Vazir, a Denver UberX driver, quit being a cabbie after nearly six years plying streets in Denver for Yellow Cab and Metro. What drew him to UberX was the chance to drop the weekly cab lease payments he made to the cab company, which amounted to $22,000 to $32,000 annually. After other expenses, Vazir said, there were times it was a struggle to make the equivalent of minimum wage.</p><p>He, like other UberX drivers, isn't an Uber employee. Technically, he licenses Uber's dispatching and payment software, has to insure himself and his car, and bear vehicle maintenance costs personally. But, Vazir says, his cut of UberX fares brings home more money, his schedule is more flexible, and he drives a newer car, he said.</p><p>\"I feel emancipated. I'm so much happier, and my passengers are happier, too,\" Vazir said.</p><p>Many cab company drivers see cab companies as decent-paying employers and complain UberX and Lyft are illegal operators that will drive them out of business by being in an unfair position to claim the most profitable cab customers.</p><p>Not so, says Uber.</p><p>It hired a polling firm, which conducted a phone survey of several hundred registered voters in the 10-county metro area and found that 89 percent of respondents had never used a cab locally.</p><p>That jibes with what Lyft driver Brittany Cameron experiences. Her fares are predominantly women, sometimes young couples and occasionally men - and they're almost all people in their 20s or early 30s who don't even think of taking taxis, Cameron said.</p><p>\"None of my friends take cabs, but they are beginning to take Lyft,\" she said. \"None of them ever took cabs, so it's not like we're taking away their business.\"</p><p>The Southwest Energy Efficiency Project (SWEEP), a Boulder-based energy conservation think tank, is urging the Legislature to legalize person-to-person ride-sharing by app, because it makes not having a car a more viable option at a time when there's a generational shift in transportation priorities going on, especially in U.S. cities.</p><p>SWEEP compiled studies that found 33 percent of U.S. 16- to 34-year-olds currently have no driver's license, a post-World War II record, capping a shift away from car ownership that's emerged for nearly a decade, said Will Toor, head of SWEEP's transportation programs. A majority of that age group don't own cars, while smartphone ownership is nearly universal, he said.</p><p>The spread of app-driven bike sharing, car-sharing services for short-term rentals, and now ride-sharing services like UberX and Lyft, reflect the rising popularity of sharing transportation and the adoption of car-free or \"car-lite\" lifestyles.</p><p>\"There's some fairly strong evidence to suggest that these truly are structural changes,\" he said.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

At one point at the beginning of April, it was estimated that more than 3.9 billion people half the world's population were in some form of lockdown. This has been a global crisis, with the actions of China, the United States, the European Union and global institutions such as the World Health Organisation closely scrutinised.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the world adjusts to the impact of the pandemic, the next phase of our tech work will focus on the geopolitics of technology, building on previous reports looking at the governance and regulation of multinational tech companies, their impact on the global stage and the global architecture surrounding technology policy. We are also continuing our work on 21st-century government, seeking to understand the model of a technology-driven government that delivers for citizens in light of the upheaval of the pandemic.</p><p>To build the evidence base for our policymaking, we commissioned four major polls carried out by YouGov in early June in Great Britain, France, Germany and the US. We sought to understand what people in the West thought about the geopolitics surrounding the pandemic, their opinion on global cooperation and how they perceive the role Big Tech should play in tackling the challenges facing the world, and situate that in the context of how they saw the pandemic's effect in their own communities.</p><p>The role of technology has also been fundamental to coping with the pandemic, allowing some businesses to continue and people to communicate with their colleagues, friends and families while socially isolated. Much of the technology people have used has been provided by consumer-facing tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. Their products and services have brought significant benefits for people around the world, but they have also amplified pre-existing harms such as public-health misinformation that has been linked to real-world harm and the spread of hate speech. This has recently led some advertisers to pull spend from social media platforms.</p><p>This points towards the coronavirus pandemic having far-reaching impact on geopolitics, on perceptions of technology, and on the development of new views on the nature of community, inequality and social togetherness.</p><p>Read the full reports here:</p><p>Covid-19 and Changing Attitudes: Technology and Big Tech</p><p>Covid-19 and Changing Attitudes: The US, China and Global Cooperation</p><p>Covid-19 and Changing Attitudes: Concerns for the Future and Trust</p><p>KEY FINDINGS</p><p>On perceptions of technology and \"Big Tech\" companies:</p><p>Across Britain, the US, Germany and France, views on whether Big Tech companies are a force for good or bad in the world are mixed, though in all countries surveyed the most popular answer people gave was that they are neither a force for good nor for bad in the world.</p><p>Google is consistently viewed more as a force for good than the other companies, and social media companies Twitter and Facebook are consistently viewed more negatively than the other companies.</p><p>In Britain, the US and Germany more people see Google, Amazon and Apple as a force for good than see them as a force for bad, whereas more people see Facebook and Twitter as a force for bad than see them as a force for good. In France, only Google is seen as more of a force for good than it is seen as a force for bad (not withstanding that a plurality of people for each company in each country surveyed see the companies as neither a force for good or bad).</p><p>Across all four countries, people's perceptions and expectations of the role that Big Tech companies have played or should play, respectively, are closely aligned: People do not see them playing a significant role in tackling the pandemic, nor do they believe that they should. This is in particular contrast to the significant role people expect the World Health Organisation and global pharmaceutical companies to play.</p><p>In general, people in all four countries do not expect to work from home more often after the pandemic is over, though roughly a third do in all the countries we surveyed.</p><p>All four countries report an increase in shopping online for household goods and clothes, and in particular an increase in online video calls to keep in touch with friends and family. This is especially pronounced in Britain and the US, but less so in France and, in particular, Germany.</p><p>Read the detailed findings</p><p>On geopolitics and attitudes to the US, China and global cooperation:</p><p>Both the Chinese and the US governments are seen as forces for bad in the world by a majority of people in Britain and France, with people in Germany having a worse view of the US government than they do of the Chinese government.</p><p>In Britain, the US, Germany and France, more than 40% of people in each country surveyed hold the Chinese government most responsible for the severity of the pandemic, more people than those who hold their own governments responsible.</p><p>There is no consistent view on the importance of coordination with other countries on the pandemic, though it is notable that less than a quarter of people surveyed in each country want more integration with the global economy, and in France only 6% wanted more economic integration.</p><p>In all the countries we surveyed, people have a much higher expectation of the role the World Health Organisation should be playing in finding solutions to the pandemic compared to the role they think it has played in tackling it.</p><p>There are high expectations of global pharmaceutical companies to find solutions to the problems created by the pandemic, but few people have a lot of confidence in those companies (and in France a quarter of people have no confidence at all).</p><p>In Britain 60% of people view the UN as a force for good in the world, but the pandemic has changed few opinions of the UN in the countries we surveyed. It's also clear the pandemic has changed few views on the perceptions of the EU in the countries we surveyed.</p><p>Read the detailed findings</p><p>On the impact of the pandemic on social attitudes and political trust:</p><p>Britain has seen a greater surge in community spirit in response to the pandemic than the other countries surveyed.</p><p>People in Britain are much more worried about the economy in general than they are about their health. But they are generally as worried about their health as about their own individual economic circumstances.</p><p>Across all four countries, more people are more concerned about others than are concerned about their own situation, with worries about families' health and the broader economy more widespread than for individual circumstances.</p><p>There is political polarisation as to who bears responsibility for the severity of the pandemic, and who is trusted to address it.</p><p>Read the detailed findings</p><p>Background to the Research</p><p>The source of this data is polling conducted by You Gov of a sample of 8,494 adults in Great Britain, the US, Germany and France. The sample was made up of 2,033 adults in GB between 4 and 15 June 2020; 2,418 adults in the US between 8 and 11 June 2020; 2,020 adults in Germany between 9 and 12 June 2020 and 2,023 adults in France between 9 and 11 June 2020.

Smaller rivals will struggle, grow weaker and even go to the wall in the current climate. This will pose a challenge for competition regulators in the future, who will have to look again at breaking up Big Tech\u2019s power and influence. For the present, it already appears to be creating an ethical dilemma for the authorities.</p><p>Take today\u2019s decision by the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-provisionally-clears-amazon-s-investment-in-deliveroo\"> to clear a $575m funding round</url>\u00a0led by Amazon in the UK delivery service Deliveroo, which would give Amazon a 16 per cent stake in the company. It said: \u201cDeliveroo recently informed the CMA that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its business meant that it would fail financially and exit the market without the Amazon investment.\u201d</p><p>So the CMA, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ee743b2-02ba-4996-9716-b34e2e676282\"> which had been concerned</url> the deal would reduce competition in the emerging grocery delivery market, has cut short its investigation and swallowed its reservations because\u00a0\u201cwholly unprecedented circumstances have meant reassessing the focus of this investigation, reacting quickly to the impact of the coronavirus and deciding what it would mean for the businesses involved in this transaction and, in turn, for customers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Essentially, Deliveroo failing would have meant less competition anyway, and customers facing higher prices, worse service or being cut off from online food delivery altogether.</p><p>As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35ed6672-eb75-4290-986b-ef8412856180\"> yesterday\u2019s #techFT reported</url>, it was only on Wednesday that the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said it would go easier on companies guilty of data breaches, due to coronavirus, while the European Commission is struggling to attach privacy and personal data protections to the rapid proliferation of contact-tracing apps. There is a tangible feeling here that regulators are being made powerless by the demands of the pandemic.</p><p>Back to the power of Big Tech, and Apple CEO Tim Cook told a company-wide virtual meeting on Thursday that it was still in a strong financial position and he saw <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/apple-ceo-sees-company-emerging-strongly-from-covid-19-crisis\"> no reason not to be optimistic</url>, while Richard Waters\u2019       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57e4370a-7d07-4fbb-8ef3-025be2b6c6d0\"> latest Inside Business column</url> examines the relative fortunes of Amazon, Apple and Google.</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.

Netflix has streaming hits for the lockdown like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tiger King</emphasis>, and while it has shut down work on all of its productions, this is still a golden age for watching TV,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96d312a4-7e38-11ea-82f6-150830b3b99a\"> argues Anna Nicolaou</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.

Since the 2010s, the Gulf has witnessed an upward trend of data outflow and historically high rates of social media and smartphone penetration. Simultaneously, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) governments particularly those of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia have been directing vast resources toward the digitalization of their infrastructure by creating the needed institutions, amending legislation, partnering with \"Big Tech,\" and building local human capital. The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly been the biggest test of the Gulf's digital infrastructure to date, but the region has proved to have formidable digital resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UAE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pandemic caught the world by surprise and caused significant disruption, especially during the transition to remote work. The UAE reaped the benefits of its long-term plans such as the National Innovation Strategy, the Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031, and the Blockchain Strategy 2021, all of which laid the groundwork for the country's COVID-19 digital response. The transition to remote work, school, and business was recognizably swift, efficient, and resilient.</p><p>For instance, Dubai's Paperless Strategy created a digital national identity for 300,000 registered users including citizens, residents, and visitors and gave each an account from which they could access 5,000 nationwide government and private services. The system also enabled the use of digital signatures for documents and transactions, as well as the ability to request and share data with service providers digitally.</p><p>Technology played a more significant role in the health response. The UAE's Department of Health developed the TraceCovid app to trace individuals who came into close contact with people later diagnosed with COVID-19. Additionally, Dubai police have a state-of-the-art monitoring system called Oyoon (\"eyes\" in Arabic), which watches the emirate's 3.3 million residents. With a huge network of cameras in the city, Oyoon uses facial, voice, and license plate recognition to gather data, and feeds the collected information into a shared government database for cross-referencing. To counter the pandemic, this database and network is being used to enforce lockdown rules.</p><p>The UAE is known for its data sovereignty doctrine, most notably applied in 2013 when the government blocked access to voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services, including Skype. To counter the economic fallout from COVID-19 and help businesses transition to remote working, the country has lifted its ban on VoIP services, as well as that on the popular video conference apps Teams and Zoom. However, there are serious doubts as to whether the UAE will continue to allow VoIP services after the expected return to the pre-COVID-19 work environment. Unquestionably though, the country will emerge from the crisis more confident in its digital systems and its ability to withstand a global pandemic.</p><p>Bahrain</p><p>With its continued institutional investment in technology infrastructure and legal frameworks, Bahrain despite its small size and population has steadily grown into a technology hub. To compete with other regional tech hubs like the UAE, Bahrain offers 30-40 percent lower operating costs, in addition to a central location in the Gulf and a tech-savvy population. However, the kingdom gained its position as a sought-after hub for global tech giants because of its regulatory environment, which was the product of decades of reforms: the data protection laws, the bankruptcy law, and the allowance of full foreign ownership in most industries and sectors.</p><p>Bahrain is a regional leader in digital infrastructure, as well as one of the first nations to introduce a nationwide 5G network. As a direct outcome of Manama's efforts, Amazon Web Services launched its first cloud center in the Middle East in Bahrain in 2019, adding to the growing list of cloud choices for enterprises in the region.</p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic forced both the government and private sector to shift to remote work, Bahrain's digital infrastructure ensured a swift and resilient transition. The kingdom also brought its digital capabilities to bear on tracing COVID-19 cases. Bahrain's eGovernment launched a contact tracing app called BeAware, which involves infected individuals wearing GPS-tracked bracelets that report to government monitoring stations any movement outside of designated areas. The Ministry of Health may randomly request pictures from self-isolating individuals, who must send back a photo proving they are wearing the bracelet.</p><p>The private sector is using Bahrain's strong infrastructure to play a major part in countering the pandemic's economic fallout as well. For instance, MVC Global and Cox Logistics will use blockchain and artificial intelligence to aid in the efficient distribution of food and medicines in the kingdom and the rest of the GCC market. Bahrain's long-term reforms and investments created digital resilience for the government to oversee the transition to remote work, while the private sector had the space to test and deploy its solutions.</p><p>Saudi Arabia</p><p>Saudi Arabia's investments in technology have paid off in its fight against the pandemic. The kingdom has both the biggest economy in the Middle East and the biggest population on the Arabian Peninsula, but it used to lag behind its Gulf peers in technological development. With Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia initiated a national transformation strategy to shift from an oil-dependent economy to a digitally empowered one. It introduced legislation and frameworks, created institutions, and formed international partnerships. The kingdom also focused on introducing digital solutions in priority sectors justice, health, electricity, culture, and tourism with a clear goal of becoming the region's tech leader.</p><p>The Saudi prioritization of digital transformation resulted in the gradual deployment of commercial 5G networks in 2019 in more than 20 cities. The launch of 5G also helped to boost the kingdom's tech credentials among investors who are keen to invest in industries that would benefit from 5G capabilities, such as tech, finance, education, and the public sector. In addition, the government has introduced a host of smart tools that have proved effective and gained the public's trust. For instance, the Ministry of Health updated its app, Mawid, which guides users on self-isolation and hospital visits, while the Ministry of Education utilizes the National Education Portal to provide educational materials and digital tools for students at home.</p><p>The pandemic coincided with the Saudi presidency of the G20 forum in 2020. This offered Riyadh an opportunity to lead by example by implementing an early lockdown, suspending the hajj and umrah pilgrimages, and using its position as the chair to coordinate the global response to COVID-19 on various fronts, especially in the digital sector. The kingdom advocated for digital response and recovery, and promoted collaboration with international organizations and the private sector, marking a shift in Saudi priorities. Vision 2030 laid the groundwork for the digital infrastructure that increased the kingdom's digital resilience in the face of the pandemic, and thanks to its G20 leadership Saudi Arabia is now positioning itself as a tech leader in the region.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>While the GCC states have not yet transformed from oil-powered economies to fully diversified ones, the reforms carried out and the institutional investments made across the Gulf in the 2010s paved the way for the region's strong digital response to the pandemic and its fallout.</p><p>The UAE not only solidified its position as a regional tech hub but also proved that the country is a global digital pioneer. Bahrain, despite being the smallest nation in the Gulf, has emerged as one of its most digitally savvy governments with strong support from local and international tech companies. Saudi Arabia, which lagged digitally behind its Gulf peers despite its vast economy, has benefited from Vision 2030 by creating a resilient digital infrastructure that has withstood the crisis. Additionally, the kingdom's G20 presidency is positioning Riyadh as a strong advocate for the role of technology in countering the pandemic.</p><p>Other countries in the Middle East would do well to learn from the Gulf's digital investments when preparing for the future.</p><p>Mohammed Soliman is a non-resident scholar with the Middle East Institute's Cyber Program.

Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi wrote in March in Foreign Affairs that just as a bungled intervention in the Suez crisis precipitated the end of the British empire, \u201cthe coronavirus pandemic could mark a \u2018Suez moment\u2019\u201d for the US, as China \u201cposition[s] itself as the global leader in pandemic response.\u201d   But even if the effects are not quite that drastic, they will be profound. The US\u2019s declining stature in the wake of the pandemic is accelerating two global political trends that have emerged in the last five years.     First, rising tensions between the US and China threaten to initiate a new arms race and a return of great-power rivalry. Second, from Turkey to Brazil to Hungary to Poland, an increasing number of countries are undergoing \u201cautocratization,\u201d centralizing power and restricting political freedoms\u2014putting an end to the post\u2013Cold War waves of democratization that ushered in new freedoms and rights for hundreds of millions of people. Taken together, these two trends will make for a more divided and uncertain world.   A global digital divide   One visible manifestation of both the decline of US power and the resurgence of autocracy is the fragmenting of the global digital ecosystem. Since Google pulled out of China in 2010 over the government\u2019s censorship of search results, China has cultivated a walled garden of applications primarily for use by its citizens. While the decoupling isn\u2019t total\u2014the Android and iOS mobile operating systems are prevalent, and programming languages like Java and Python are widely used\u2014most Chinese never go on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon, PayPal, or many other platforms, but instead use their local alternatives.    This fragmentation is part of a larger normative battle. China has been joined by Russia, Iran, and other autocratic regimes in promoting cyber sovereignty \u2014the idea that countries should set their own rules on how their citizens use the internet. In Russia, the government is planning to implement a \u201csovereign internet,\u201d a self-contained, centrally controlled system that would allow the country to cut itself off from the global internet entirely (see \u201cYandex\u2019s balancing act,\u201d page 38). By contrast, while the US and Europe differ on the nature and importance of privacy, the limits of free speech, and the right way to regulate Big Tech, there is broad agreement that the internet should be open and interoperable.     These trends mean that increasingly, where large countries relied on size, military force, or economic influence, they now also view technology (and not just the military kind) as one of the keys to sustaining and extending their power. This paradigm, known as \u201c technonationalism ,\u201d rests on two crucial assumptions: first, that an early technological lead gives countries a first-mover advantage, and second, that dominance in certain technologies, such as artificial intelligence, gives them an edge in other fields. These assumptions do not need to be true to be influential. Under their logic, no country can afford to let competitors pull ahead.     An illustration of this was the US Commerce Department\u2019s decision in October 2019 to add 28 Chinese companies to its \u201centity list\u201d of firms subject to trade restrictions. They include most of the leading Chinese AI firms, including iFlytek, SenseTime, and Megvii. Ostensibly, they were added as punishment for facilitating shocking human rights abuses against Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang. But a secondary result was to hinder them from competing with US companies.    More recently, in May 2020, the White House released a strategy document accusing Chinese authorities of exploiting \u201cthe free and open rules-based order\u201d and attempting to \u201creshape the international system in its favor.\u201d It calls for renewed prosecutions of Chinese trade-secret theft and a stronger process for preventing Chinese companies from acquiring advanced technologies, such as \u201chypersonics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology.\u201d Subsequently, US officials tightened restrictions against Chinese electronics giant Huawei by blocking the company from using US technology or machinery to manufacture its chips. In late July, the Trump administration abruptly ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, alleging that it was a hub for industrial espionage . China retaliated by closing the US consulate in Chengdu.    China, meanwhile, continues to lock out international companies that refuse to play by its rules \u2014such as agreeing to censor search engine results, provide authorities with data on users, or hand over software source code and other proprietary data. It has also ramped up efforts to cultivate \u201cmass innovation\u201d and increase subsidies to strategic sectors such as AI, semiconductor chips, and aerospace through programs like \u201cMade in China 2025.\u201d    China also promotes its companies and technologies to many countries in direct competition with US, European, and other firms. Beginning in 2015, Chinese officials began touting the \u201cDigital Silk Road,\u201d focused on internet connectivity, artificial intelligence, the digital economy, telecommunications, smart cities, and cloud computing. This has led to  investments in at least 20 countries, totaling nearly $40 billion, according to a 2019 estimate by the RWR Advisory Group, a consultancy.    Countries with investments from China\u2019s Digital Silk Road  Source: Bloomberg   The Trump administration\u2019s attempts to disentangle US technology supply chains from China and its moratorium on new visas for skilled foreign workers, announced in June and extended through December, only serve to help China. A report by Ishan Banerjee and Matt Sheehan published by the Paulson Institute, a think tank in Chicago, found that while Chinese-educated AI researchers produced nearly one-third of all papers accepted at the NeurIPS conference, the leading AI research meeting in the world, most Chinese researchers study, live, and work in the United States. If they are forced to leave, such talent cannot be easily replaced.    If Joe Biden is elected president, his administration will no doubt reconsider some of these policies. Jake Sullivan, a Biden campaign advisor, recently said at an event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (where I am a fellow) that there should be \u201cless focus on trying to slow China down and more on running faster ourselves.\u201d But whatever Biden does, the competition to determine international norms and standards for critical technologies will continue.   The geopolitics of repression   Other governments are also using technology to advance their political agendas. Even before the covid-19 crisis, the world was in the midst of an autocratic resurgence. Researchers from the Varieties of Democracy project estimate that 2.6 billion people, or 35% of the world\u2019s population, are having their political liberties curtailed.    Authoritarians are using a raft of digital technologies to counter dissent, maintain political control, and stay in power. In my prior research and in an upcoming book, I document how cities in Kenya, Mexico, and Malaysia employ Chinese AI-powered technology to keep watch over citizens; how spyware from Israeli and US sources helps intelligence operatives in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt monitor dissent and track opposition figures; and how censorship and disinformation campaigns enable authorities in Thailand and Pakistan to tamp down criticism and flood digital channels with pro-government narratives.   Countries that possess public surveillance capabilities powered by big data and AI  Source: Carnegie Endowment   Autocratic regimes are far more likely to use these instruments for repression, but democracies sometimes use them to curb civil rights too. In the United States, for example, the advocacy group Freedom House observes , police have used technologies such as drones, facial recognition, and social-media surveillance in response to escalating Black Lives Matter protests.    The pandemic has accelerated this attrition of individual liberties. Data collected by Samuel Woodhams of Top10VPN, a digital privacy group, shows that as of July 2020, 50 countries had introduced contact tracing apps, 35 had adopted alternative digital tracking measures, 11 had implemented advanced physical surveillance technologies, and 18 had imposed censorship related to covid-19. Many of the countries using these techniques are democracies.    A big problem is that governments are rushing out health surveillance technology without proper vetting or oversight. Bahrain, Kuwait, and Norway all launched intrusive covid-19 tracing apps that \u201cactively carry out live or near-live tracking of users\u2019 locations by frequently uploading GPS coordinates to a central server,\u201d Amnesty International reported in June. The report caused Norway to suspend its app\u2019s rollout; Bahrain and Kuwait have not.    Of course, digital technology isn\u2019t responsible for authoritarianism\u2019s resurgence, but it gives crucial advantages to unsavory regimes . This illiberal assault is putting inordinate pressure on the liberal international order and the institutions that uphold it, including the UN, NATO, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, and others.    China and Russia stand to gain the most from this. Indeed, some experts argue that they have directly pursued a \u201cdigital authoritarianism\u201d strategy: providing powerful technology to help illiberal leaders entrench their regimes, thereby creating an autocratic alternative to the liberal international order.    Source: Michael Coppedge, ET AL. HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.23696/VDEMDS20   My own research suggests that most of these regimes would pursue anti-\u00addemocratic digital strategies even without Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s help. All the same, there is reason to worry about the growing global spread of Chinese technology such as Huawei 5G networks, Transsion mobile phones, and WeChat for e-commerce and communication. Not only does this increase global reliance on Chinese technology, thereby enhancing China\u2019s influence, but many products, such as WeChat\u2019s social app or Alipay Health Code (which classifies users\u2019 health status and determines whether they are allowed to travel or enter certain public spaces), are designed to facilitate government surveillance and censorship. As Christopher Walker, Shanthi Kalathil, and Jessica Ludwig wrote this year in the Journal of Democracy, \u201cThe CCP [Chinese Communist Party] has been forging an increasingly seamless synthesis combining consumer convenience, surveillance, and censorship. This model is exemplified by such all-encompassing platforms as WeChat \u2026 which includes politically based content restrictions and lends itself to surveillance.\u201d (See also the interview with Samantha Hoffman on page 56.)    Of course, technologies are often two-edged swords. Digital tools help civic movements, journalists, and political challengers. The ability of social-media networks to rapidly mobilize citizens and swell mass protests is a potent threat that no regime has fully neutralized.     It\u2019s also worth remembering that while the US-China rivalry can dominate discussions about the future of technology, it\u2019s not the only thing determining where trends are headed. The European Union, for example, is increasingly staking out its own independent policy positions . It\u2019s emphasizing privacy, accountability for big tech firms, and transparency for big data and AI. India, Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria, and Indonesia are all deciding whether to try to carve out their own digital agendas or to act more as fence-sitters, playing China, the US, and the EU against one another.    Though commentators like Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group warn of a \u201c great decoupling \u201d between the US and China, with dire consequences for technology, talk of a new bipolar Cold War is overblown. There are too many new players and too many variables to assume that two superpowers will monopolize the rules of technology for the foreseeable future. Instead, we are likely to witness increased splintering as fresh ideas come to the fore, new platforms gain followings, and more people get online for the first time. A multipolar world with new, diverse sources of ideas, innovation, regulation, and geopolitical influence may not be such a bad thing at all. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42873867532</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-WB11-F07F-82JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Technology Review</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000CZKS</classCode><className>YANDEX NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

F. Skinner's operant-conditioning method of 'programmed instruction' through computerized 'teaching machines.' Almost thirty years later, the 'Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act' is primed to pump a flood of federal education funds into online charter school corporations, such as K12 Inc., KIPP, and Connections Academy, which deploy 'adaptive learning' software that replace human teachers with artificial-intelligence courseware programmed with 'Skinner-box' cognitive-behavioral algorithms geared to condition students for workforce training. The CARES Act Cares about Robots As teachers and students are forced to convert their coursework to online platforms during the COVID-19 lockdown, the CARES Act is creating deregulatory loopholes to expand the federal funding of adaptive-learning courseware delivered by online education corporations such as K12 Inc.[1] (which was bankrolled by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos[2]) and Connections Academy[3] (which is owned by the globalist Pearson Education PLC[4]: the 'world's largest education company'[5]). According to a press release from the US Department of Education[6], '[t]he new flexibilities, authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, allow schools to repurpose existing K-12 education funds for technology infrastructure and teacher training on distance learning.' </p><p>In particular, '[t]he CARES Act now allows states and school districts to devote more of their federal resources to technology infrastructure to support distance learning for students and for professional development for teachers who are teaching remotely.' In brief, the emergency CARES Act authorizes schools to restructure their budgets by diverting funding for brick-and-mortar infrastructure and then reallocating those funds into new 'technology infrastructure' expenses that pay for 'distance learning' software delivered by online edu-companies. At the same time, schools can procure more federal stimulus money by applying for CARES Act grants that fall under the provisions for financing 'technology infrastructure' geared toward 'distance learning.' Hence, the CARES Act incentivizes schools to increase their eligibility for more federal relief money by applying for grants that pay schools to 'upgrade' their virtual campuses with commercial 'adaptive learning' software, such as Smart Sparrow[7] and Knewton[8], which have both been financed by the Pearson Corporation. To be sure, these ed-tech provisions in the CARES Act are written to favor online edu-corporations like the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP[9]), which deploys adaptive-learning software, such as Dreambox[10] and Clever[11], the latter of which has been bankrolled by Bilderberger Peter Thiel[12]: Trump's 'shadow president'[13] who has also invested in Knewton[14]. AI Adaptive Learning Is a Post-Humanism: From Social Distancing to Distance Learning While these CARES Act incentives funnel money into online ed-tech corporations, the new 'Proposed Rules' for federal 'Distance Learning and Innovation' (85 FR 18638[15]) have been drafted to streamline federal funding for 'competency-based' 'adaptive learning' through 'subscription-based' 'artificial intelligence' that carries out 'direct instruction' without input from a human teacher. In brief, this litany of jargon is a recipe for economically checkmating locked-down schools into competing for federal CARES Act funds to pay for online edu-corporations that substitute human teachers with adaptive-learning courseware modules which automate 'direct instruction' through AI on a monthly 'subscription' basis that can be rolled over indefinitely until the student completes all the course modules necessary to earn 'competency' certificates at his or her own pace. Competency-Based Education: CBE[16] refers to self-paced curriculums in which the student can learn faster or slower depending on his or her 'competence.' 85 FR 18638[17] states, 'CBE programs . . . measure student progress based on their demonstration of specific competencies rather than sitting in a seat or at a computer for a prescribed period of time. Many CBE programs are designed to permit students to learn at their own pace.' Self-paced CBE enrollment is being promoted so that students who are struggling to adjust to online learning during COVID lockdown will be able to spend more time completing their classwork without penalty of flunking if they miss coursework due dates. Subscription-Based Learning: To facilitate self-paced CBE, the new federal 'Distance Learning' rules provide legal flexibility to extend course deadlines by converting credit hours on a semester enrollment basis to competency certificates on a monthly subscription basis. 85 FR 18638 proposes more efficient channels for federal financing of 'students enrolled in competency-based programs on a subscription basis' in order to fuel the '[e]xpansion of subscription-based programs [which] provides students with the scheduling flexibility they may need,' especially while they struggle to reschedule life under virtual house arrest. CBE subscription fees can be paid for as many months as the student needs to complete all the online course modules required to earn his or her competency certificate. Adaptive-Learning Courseware: The self-pacing of online CBE subscriptions is further 'personalized' by servicing students with 24-hour access to instant automated feedback from 'adaptive learning[18]' software, which is defined by 85 FR 18638[19] as 'artificial intelligence' that 'teaches' students with 'feedback from technology-mediated instruction.' Adaptive-learning software, such as Desire2Learn's[20] Brightspace LeaP[21], is a digital version of B.F. Skinner's 'teaching machine[22],' which automates operant-conditioning methods of stimulus-response animal training. With 24/7 access to 'Skinner box' methods of 'programmed instruction' through AI automation, students can personalize the self-pacing of their own course progress as they can upload the adaptive-learning software anytime, anyplace, without having to wait for a human instructor to be available. 85 FR 18638[23] states, '[w]ith the introduction of adaptive learning , a student enrolled in distance education is likely to be learning at his or her own pace' as ed-tech is 'increasingly using analytics to identify struggling or accelerated learners in order to refer them to additional adaptive learning experiences to support their learning needs.' AI Deregulation: If adaptive-learning software is more convenient and efficient than a human teacher, why not 'outsource' the entire profession of human teaching to a digital faculty of artificially intelligent bots? The new 'Proposed Rules' redefine the legal terms and conditions for 'academic engagement' so that it 'need not be exclusively with a human instructor.' The new rules on 'Innovation' also 'remove barriers' to AI ed-tech progress by allowing educational institutions the 'flexibility' to effectively write blank checks[24] for new AI courseware programs without prior regulatory approval from the Department of Ed. As AI teacher-bots, such as IBM's Watson[25], are programmed to get progressively 'smarter' as they evolve over time through 'machine learning[26],' 85 FR 18638[27] greenlights 'future innovations' for Watson and other AI bots to 'move forward' with the development of humanoid 'artificial general intelligence (AGI[28])' that can completely replace human teachers 'without undue risk of a negative program finding or other sanction.' It should be noted that a Government Relations representative of the IBM Corporation[29], Edgar McCulloch, sat on the 'Accreditation and Innovation negotiating committee[30]' which helped draft these proposed rules. It should also be noted that IBM's Watson partners[31] with the globalist[32] Pearson Education. In sum, these emergency COVID deregulations are being touted to purportedly accommodate students during this virtual-online overhaul of the locked-down school system by expanding CBE curriculums so that course deadlines can be rolled over by converting credit enrollment into competency subscriptions. Due to physical classroom capacity and human staffing limitations, brick-and-mortar classes cannot indefinitely roll over student registration on a monthly subscription basis, which means brick-and-mortar schools are being cornered into permanently converting to virtual-online campuses in order to become eligible for more CARES Act money that subsidizes subscription CBE curriculums. At the same time, human instructors who teach online classes cannot provide 24/7 instruction to fully 'personalize' the self-pacing of every student's CBE curriculum, which means online schools will be encouraged to 'hire' adaptive-learning AI instead of human beings. In the final equation, online schools will have an unfair advantage to rake in federal CARES Act funds for replacing human teachers with artificial intelligence while brick-and-mortar schools and human instructors are rendered obsolete as they are held hostage by the economic lockdown without the ability to fairly compete for stimulus money from the CARES Act. The Techno-Fascist History of Project BEST: The Department of Ed in Bed with Ed-Tech Corporations To set up the institutionalization of Skinnerian adaptive-learning computers, the Association for Educational Computing and Technology (AECT) was awarded an $855,282 federal grant in 1981 to implement Project BEST[33] (Better Education Skills through Technology), which laid out the blueprint for the public-private techno-fascist schooling system that is currently being rammed through by the CARES Act and 85 FR 1863 under the duress of COVID-19 lockdown. Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt blew the whistle on this corporate-technocratic education initiative in 1982 when she was the Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement for the US Department of Education under the Ronald Reagan Administration. Iserbyt leaked several internal documents from the Department of Ed pertaining to Project BEST, such as an informational brochure that states, 'Project BEST is a cooperative effort involving both the federal, state, and local government and the private sector in the planning and use of modern information technologies to improve the effectiveness of basic skills, teaching and learning.' This document reveals that Project BEST, which was buoyed by President Reagan's Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives[34], spent almost one million dollars of federal tax revenues on public-private political-economic plans to plug students into Skinnerian IT computers that psycho-behaviorally condition learning outcomes to fulfill job quotas for corporate-technocratic workforce planning. Project BEST was pushed by President Reagan's Secretary of Education, Terrel Howard Bell, who was formerly the US Commissioner of Education, which headed up the Office of Education of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) before the Office of Education was assigned its own separate Department under President Jimmy Carter in 1979. At the end of Reagan's first term as President, Secretary T. H. Bell passed the technocratic teaching torch to his successor, Education Secretary William Bennet, who later went on to co-found the K12 Inc. Corporation until he had to resign from the online schooling company after public backlash from racist eugenics comments he made on his conservative talk radio show, Bill Bennet's Morning in America[35].  It should be noted that Secretary Bennet's speech writer was Peter Thiel[36], who would become a key financer of adaptive-learning courseware such as Clever[37] and Knewton[38]. According to a Freedom of Information Act[39] report, on July 19, 2017, Thiel met privately at his 'Residence' with the current Secretary of Ed, Betsy DeVos, who was also a key investor[40] in Bennet's K12 Inc., although she divested her shares in the online edu-company before taking her cabinet seat under President Trump. It should also be noted that DeVos has spent millions of dollars bankrolling virtual charter schools with the help of her cronies at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC[41]), who created the Virtual Public Schools Act[42]: a template bill which lawmakers use to draft boilerplate legislation establishing 'virtual schools[43]' that deliver instruction 'via the Internet in a virtual or remote setting.' In sum, Billionaire Betsy DeVos and her Bilderberg crony, Peter Thiel, are carrying the torch for former Secretaries Bell and Bennet as DeVos capitalizes on the COVID-19 lockdown to ram through the next phase of Project BEST.

Along with vaccine development, contact tracing has been touted as a necessary tool to help stop the spread of the virus. But for many minority communities across the globe as well as data privacy advocates, the promise of contact tracing is met with trepidation. While contact tracing and other forms of surveillance may seem like a panacea, a pandemic is not the time to grant the private sector and governments further reason to abuse civil liberties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a public health tool employed in crises such as Ebola and others, contact tracing is designed to track the people with whom a person infected with COVID-19 or another infectious disease may have come into contact, and thereby slow the spread of the disease. While there are some general questions about how effective contact tracing can be, there are also several specific and troubling data and rights-related risks that contract tracing poses.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Data</emphasis></h><p>First, big tech companies like Apple and Google have offered to build out their contact tracing capabilities but have thus far refused to share this information with health officials, thereby rendering the efforts largely useless for public health purposes. Yet these efforts let the companies continue to collect a massive amount of personal and private data, and they are no stranger to criticism and lawsuits over their handling of said data. It is reasonable to ask what the companies will be doing with this data if and when the coronavirus pandemic is under control.</p><p>Second, some lesser-known companies' efforts at contact tracing apps have gone the opposite direction, that is to partner directly with state governments in the US, and health officials on digital contact tracing efforts and sharing public health data. Yet these faulty apps are collecting users' data in an insecure manner. A company that created a contact tracing app for North and South Dakota, for example, is now being accused of going against its own privacy policy because its app allows data to be shared with outside vendors including Foursquare and Bugfender, neither of which appear to be working on contact tracing themselves, thereby opening the door for companies to use the transferred data for marketing or other non-health-related efforts.</p><p>Third, as a recent CNN article outlines, the steady slide into mass collection of consumers' private details has accelerated post-9/11, but contact tracing and other forms of digital surveillance risk would involve a different level of intimacy, that of accessing our social and health histories. Not only should we not trust big data with this information, but it is not unreasonable to assume that this information could be weaponized not only by autocratic governments but democratic ones, too. For example, given the Trump administration's politicization of public health information and authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and the White House Coronavirus Task Force, it is reasonable to be wary of entities like these having increased access to the public's personal health data.</p><p>If one thinks that sounding the alarm about contact tracing is a bridge too far, consider the other \"reforms\" that governments have been pushing through during the COVID-19 crisis, likely betting that their respective citizenry will be too focused on the pandemic to care about the sweeping powers that some world leaders and legislatures are amassing, largely under the radar.</p><p>The US Senate has been quietly pushing extensions to the PATRIOT Act, the vast post-9/11 law that not only changed the way that government could surveil its citizens under the pretext of counterterrorism but continues to be a major flashpoint for minority rights groups who point to issues of targeted surveillance of Arabs and Muslims. Meanwhile, China is trying to ram through a national security law that would clamp down on dissent in Hong Kong. Over in Russia, the government is using problematic facial recognition software to crack down on quarantine violators.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Successful Contact Tracing</emphasis></h><p>With all of these concerns, what is to be done? First, public health officials should consider abandoning high-tech contact tracing efforts altogether. In theory, successful contact tracing does not need to involve sophisticated technology like Bluetooth or tracking bracelets. Therefore, current and floated contact tracing efforts, ones that rely on high-tech solutions and the involvement of tech giants, may not only be dangerous in their scope and potential to abuse consumers' private data, but also may be unnecessary. Germany, for example, which has seen relatively few coronavirus cases per capita as compared with other European countries, uses a low-tech but successful approach mainly involving simple phone calls.</p><p>Second, in this time of solidarity, there is also an opportunity for those concerned with attacks on free expression and privacy to join with human rights advocates to stop private companies and government entities from further descending into unnecessary and potentially damaging surveillance. In the US, for example, reigning in big tech is often a bipartisan effort, and libertarian lawmakers have historically expressed concern about the government's expansion of surveillance powers.</p><p>Two such examples stand out for replication elsewhere. Several US senators and representatives recently introduced the Public Health Emergency Privacy Act, which seeks to protect the data collected through COVID-19 contact tracing efforts or more generally during a public health emergency from being used or shared for other than their intended use. Additionally, the European Union, while underscoring the need for robust digital tools to combat the coronavirus, has also urged member states to abide by the EU's fairly strict data privacy protocols such as the General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p>While it is unlikely that autocratic states will champion legislation or regulations like those mentioned in the US and EU contexts, other democratic states must adopt similar commitments and legislation before private, health-related data gets into the wrong hands. Further, like the Public Health Emergency Privacy Act, it is imperative that any other data protection legislation introduced must apply to both corporations and governments, to prevent both misuse of data and targeting of minorities and dissenters.</p><p>From China's surveillance of the Uighur minority to the US government's weaponization of the PATRIOT Act against Arab and Muslim Americans, there is ample pretext for both the private sector and governments to abuse consumer data and public trust under the guise of national security or public health. But the COVID-19 pandemic is terrifying enough. Activists, public servants and elected officials who care about data privacy and human rights should make sure that this public health crisis is not used as a ploy to further erode citizens' rights, protections and safety.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FROBSR-0053511672</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FROBSR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603W-8WR1-JB5M-W4C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1196\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fair Observer, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fair Observer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 10, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The US Senate has passed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion aid package as coronavirus deaths top 1,000 nationwide. Despite the fractious post-impeachment landscape of US politics, the bill came together at breakneck speed.</p><p>* Thus far, EU eurozone finance ministers have been unable to agree a firm plan for the bloc's bailout fund in response to the crisis.

The economy will take a big hit.</p><p>US Senate passes USD$2.2 trillion aid package as coronavirus deaths top 1,000 nationwide. The US Senate has (late on Wednesday) passed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems. The unanimous, 96-0 vote came despite earlier wrangling and arguments on both sides about whether it went too far or not far enough.</p><p>EU eurozone finance ministers have been unable to agree a firm plan for the bloc's bailout fund , the European Stability Mechanism, so far this week. Heads of government will hold crunch talks on the subject later this afternoon. Reports suggest much behind the scenes wrangling, with some observers noting that the crisis throws economic disparities within the EU into sharp relief. Report indicate that southern European countries heavily hit by the crisis are seeking new credit lines from the eurozone's bailout fund or the creation of special EU 'corona bonds'. Other countries - including Germany and the Netherlands - are said to be much less keen.</p><p>The UK government is announcing a new aid package - cash handouts - for the self-employed, in addition to support measures already announced for businesses and employees. It is also preparing a big rollout of testing kits over the next three months, initially to front-line health workers. The kits will show whether a person is carrying anti-bodies that indicate they have been infected by COVID-19 previously.</p><p>Iran's government has banned internal travel. Iran is a COVID-19 hotspot (over 25,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths). Tehran has warned of a 'second wave' infections outbreak and more restrictions are expected. Observers says the high rate of infections in Iran reflects extensive holidays-related travel earlier in the year.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has reported its second coronavirus death and tightened a nationwide curfew. Riyadh is barring entry and exit from the capital Riyadh and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, as well as movement between all provinces.</p><p>South Africa is the country worst affected by the coronavirus on the African continent. It will begin a 21-day lockdown at midnight Thursday. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said he believes it may be at least two weeks before the lockdown affects the rise in cases.</p><p>All international flights to Russia will be halted from Friday following a sharp jump in coronavirus cases in the country this week, Russian government officials have announced. Vladimir Putin has also said he will postpone a vote on constitutional changes, scheduled for 22 April, which would have allowed him to run for office again. Russia's government is now ramping up its response to the crisis. Starting on March 28, Russians will have a week's paid leave - to stay at home. Russians will also see a moratorium on mortgage payments and enterprises will be given credit holidays.</p><p>Commentators, forecasters and financial institutions</p><p>Key points</p><p>* The number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 400,000 globally, according to the WHO.</p><p>* US Fed Reserve says it is primed to 'take more policy actions'.</p><p>* Barclays has slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020 following the Saudi-Russia OPEC+ price war and much lower world demand.</p><p>* Looking for crisis upsides? Big Tech-EU relations could be seeing something of a thaw in a new spirit of crisis-induced cooperation.</p><p>The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has surpassed 400,000 globally, according to the WHO. There are some 414,179 confirmed cases (40,722 last 24 hours) and 18,440 deaths (2,202 last 24 hours). International proliferation continues with two new countries/territories/areas from the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean region reporting cases of COVID-19. China continues to show a low number of new cases and deaths. Total cases for China stand at 81,848 (101 last 24 hours) with deaths at 3,287 (just 4 in last 24 hours).</p><p>US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says America 'may well be in recession' but also adds that it's not a typical downturn. While the slump may be severe, activity could rebound vigorously when the virus is under control, he maintains. Speaking to NBC, Powell also insisted that the Fed still has room to take more policy actions in response to the crisis. It has already cut interest rates, pledged money-printing through its QE asset purchase programme and also launched new programmes to support consumer credit and corporate debt. Weekly US unemployment figures are due to be announced later today - and will likely show a sharp jump.</p><p>Barclays has slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020, citing considerable downward pressure on the market from a Saudi-Russian price war and unprecedented demand disruption because of the coronavirus crisis. The bank lowered its 2020 price outlook for Brent and West Texas Intermediate by $12 each to $31 and $28 per barrel respectively.</p><p>A report on Politico suggests that the coronavirus crisis is creating a thaw in relations between tech firms and politicians who were previously limbering up regulators to tackle so-called 'Big Tech'. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, told Politico the crisis and tech firms' response 'could be a turning point in how big platforms behave in the future'. The report notes that while airlines and hotels are asking for government bailouts, Facebook and Netflix both announced they will provide $100 million in funding to help small businesses and the creative community.

The US Senate has (late on Wednesday) passed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems. The unanimous, 96-0 vote came despite earlier wrangling and arguments on both sides about whether it went too far or not far enough.</p><p>EU eurozone finance ministers have been unable to agree a firm plan for the bloc's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, so far this week. Heads of government will hold crunch talks on the subject later this afternoon. Reports suggest much behind the scenes wrangling, with some observers noting that the crisis throws economic disparities within the EU into sharp relief. Report indicate that southern European countries heavily hit by the crisis are seeking new credit lines from the eurozone's bailout fund or the creation of special EU 'corona bonds'. Other countries - including Germany and the Netherlands - are said to be much less keen.</p><p>The UK government is announcing a new aid package - cash handouts - for the self-employed, in addition to support measures already announced for businesses and employees. It is also preparing a big rollout of testing kits over the next three months, initially to front-line health workers. The kits will show whether a person is carrying anti-bodies that indicate they have been infected by COVID-19 previously.</p><p>Iran's government has banned internal travel. Iran is a COVID-19 hotspot (over 25,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths). Tehran has warned of a 'second wave' infections outbreak and more restrictions are expected. Observers says the high rate of infections in Iran reflects extensive holidays-related travel earlier in the year.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has reported its second coronavirus death and tightened a nationwide curfew. Riyadh is barring entry and exit from the capital Riyadh and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, as well as movement between all provinces.</p><p>South Africa is the country worst affected by the coronavirus on the African continent. It will begin a 21-day lockdown at midnight Thursday. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said he believes it may be at least two weeks before the lockdown affects the rise in cases.</p><p>All international flights to Russia will be halted from Friday following a sharp jump in coronavirus cases in the country this week, Russian government officials have announced. Vladimir Putin has also said he will postpone a vote on constitutional changes, scheduled for 22 April, which would have allowed him to run for office again. Russia's government is now ramping up its response to the crisis. Starting on March 28, Russians will have a week's paid leave - to stay at home. Russians will also see a moratorium on mortgage payments and enterprises will be given credit holidays.</p><p>Commentators, forecasters and financial institutions</p><p>Key points</p><p>  It's a big move and an indication of how the response to the deepening crisis is being stepped up in the US.

Russia steps up its COVID-19 policy response after criticisms of complacency.  South Africa braces for lockdown from tonight. The economy will take a big hit. </p><p>The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has surpassed 400,000 globally, according to the WHO. There are some 414,179 confirmed cases (40,722 last 24 hours) and 18,440 deaths (2,202 last 24 hours). International proliferation continues with two new countries/territories/areas from the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean region reporting cases of COVID-19. China continues to show a low number of new cases and deaths. Total cases for China stand at 81,848 (101 last 24 hours) with deaths at 3,287 (just 4 in last 24 hours).</p><p>US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says America 'may well be in recession' but also adds that it's not a typical downturn. While the slump may be severe, activity could rebound vigorously when the virus is under control, he maintains. Speaking to NBC, Powell also insisted that the Fed still has room to take more policy actions in response to the crisis. It has already cut interest rates, pledged money-printing through its QE asset purchase programme and also launched new programmes to support consumer credit and corporate debt. Weekly US unemployment figures are due to be announced later today - and will likely show a sharp jump.</p><p>Barclays has slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020, citing considerable downward pressure on the market from a Saudi-Russian price war and unprecedented demand disruption because of the coronavirus crisis. The bank lowered its 2020 price outlook for Brent and West Texas Intermediate by $12 each to $31 and $28 per barrel respectively.</p><p>A report on Politico suggests that the coronavirus crisis is creating a thaw in relations between tech firms and politicians who were previously limbering up regulators to tackle so-called 'Big Tech'. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, told Politico the crisis and tech firms' response 'could be a turning point in how big platforms behave in the future'. The report notes that while airlines and hotels are asking for government bailouts, Facebook and Netflix both announced they will provide $100 million in funding to help small businesses and the creative community. Google has also rolled out online tools for teachers and streaming content providers have been responsive to requests for actions that would prevent internet traffic congestion.</p><p>Sources: Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports;

Heads of government will hold crunch talks on the subject later this afternoon. Reports suggest much behind the scenes wrangling, with some observers noting that the crisis throws economic disparities within the EU into sharp relief.

Iran is a Covid-19 hotspot (over 25,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths). Tehran has warned of a 'second wave' infections outbreak and more restrictions are expected. Observers says the high rate of infections in Iran reflects extensive holidays-related travel earlier in the year.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has reported its second coronavirus death and tightened a nationwide curfew.

There are some 414,179 confirmed cases (40,722 last 24 hours) and 18,440 deaths (2,202 last 24 hours). International proliferation continues with two new countries/territories/areas from the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean region reporting cases of COVID-19. China continues to show a low number of new cases and deaths. Total cases for China stand at 81,848 (101 last 24 hours) with deaths at 3,287 (just 4 in last 24 hours).</p><p>US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says America 'may well be in recession' but also adds that it's not a typical downturn. While the slump may be severe, activity could rebound vigorously when the virus is under control, he maintains. Speaking to NBC, Powell also insisted that the Fed still has room to take more policy actions in response to the crisis. It has already cut interest rates, pledged money-printing through its QE asset purchase programme and also launched new programmes to support consumer credit and corporate debt. Weekly US unemployment figures are due to be announced later today - and will likely show a sharp jump.</p><p>Barclays has slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020, citing considerable downward pressure on the market from a Saudi-Russian price war and unprecedented demand disruption because of the coronavirus crisis. The bank lowered its 2020 price outlook for Brent and West Texas Intermediate by $12 each to $31 and $28 per barrel respectively.</p><p>A report on Politico suggests the coronavirus crisis is creating a thaw in relations between tech firms and politicians who were previously limbering up regulators to tackle so-called 'Big Tech'. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, told Politico the crisis and tech firms' response 'could be a turning point in how big platforms behave in the future'. The report notes that while airlines and hotels are asking for government bailouts, Facebook and Netflix both announced they will provide $100m in funding to help small businesses and the creative community. Google has also rolled out online tools for teachers and streaming content providers have been responsive to requests for actions that would prevent internet traffic congestion.</p><p>Sources: Coronavirus disease (Covid-2019) situation reports; Barclays; Politico</p><p>This article was originally published on just-food.com on 26 March 2020.

The US Senate has (late on 25 March) passed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems. The unanimous, 96-0 vote came despite earlier wrangling and arguments on both sides about whether it went too far or not far enough.</p><p>EU eurozone finance ministers have been unable to agree a firm plan for the bloc's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, so far this week. Heads of government will hold crunch talks on the subject later this afternoon. Reports suggest much behind the scenes wrangling, with some observers noting that the crisis throws economic disparities within the EU into sharp relief. Reports indicate that southern European countries heavily hit by the crisis are seeking new credit lines from the eurozone's bailout fund or the creation of special EU 'corona bonds'. Other countries - including Germany and the Netherlands - are said to be much less keen.</p><p>The UK government is announcing a new aid package - cash handouts - for the self-employed, in addition to support measures already announced for businesses and employees. It is also preparing a big rollout of testing kits over the next three months, initially to front-line health workers. The kits will show whether a person is carrying anti-bodies that indicate they have been infected by Covid-19 previously.</p><p>Iran's government has banned internal travel. Iran is a Covid-19 hotspot (over 25,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths). Tehran has warned of a 'second wave' infections outbreak and more restrictions are expected. Observers says the high rate of infections in Iran reflects extensive holidays-related travel earlier in the year.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has reported its second coronavirus death and tightened a nationwide curfew. Riyadh is barring entry and exit from the capital Riyadh and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, as well as movement between all provinces.</p><p>South Africa is the country worst affected by the coronavirus on the African continent. It will begin a 21-day lockdown at midnight Thursday (26 March). Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said he believes it may be at least two weeks before the lockdown affects the rise in cases.</p><p>All international flights to Russia will be halted from Friday following a sharp jump in coronavirus cases in the country this week, Russian government officials have announced. Vladimir Putin has also said he will postpone a vote on constitutional changes, scheduled for 22 April, which would have allowed him to run for office again. Russia's government is now ramping up its response to the crisis. Starting on 28 March, Russians will have a week's paid leave - to stay at home. Russians will also see a moratorium on mortgage payments and enterprises will be given credit holidays.</p><p>Commentators, forecasters and financial institutions - Key points</p><p>* The number of Covid-19 cases has surpassed 400,000 globally, according to the WHO.</p><p>* US Fed Reserve says it is primed to 'take more policy actions'.</p><p>* Barclays has slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020 following the Saudi-Russia OPEC+ price war and much lower world demand.</p><p>* Looking for crisis upsides?

The US Senate has (late on 25 March) passed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems. The unanimous, 96-0 vote came despite earlier wrangling and arguments on both sides about whether it went too far or not far enough.</p><p>EU eurozone finance ministers have been unable to agree a firm plan for the bloc's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, so far this week. Heads of government will hold crunch talks on the subject later this afternoon. Reports suggest much behind the scenes wrangling, with some observers noting that the crisis throws economic disparities within the EU into sharp relief. Reports indicate that southern European countries heavily hit by the crisis are seeking new credit lines from the eurozone's bailout fund or the creation of special EU 'corona bonds'. Other countries   including Germany and the Netherlands   are said to be much less keen.</p><p>The UK government is announcing a new aid package   cash handouts   for the self-employed, in addition to support measures already announced for businesses and employees. It is also preparing a big rollout of testing kits over the next three months, initially to front-line health workers. The kits will show whether a person is carrying anti-bodies that indicate they have been infected by Covid-19 previously.</p><p>Iran's government has banned internal travel. Iran is a Covid-19 hotspot (over 25,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths). Tehran has warned of a 'second wave' infections outbreak and more restrictions are expected. Observers says the high rate of infections in Iran reflects extensive holidays-related travel earlier in the year.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has reported its second coronavirus death and tightened a nationwide curfew. Riyadh is barring entry and exit from the capital Riyadh and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, as well as movement between all provinces.</p><p>South Africa is the country worst affected by the coronavirus on the African continent. It will begin a 21-day lockdown at midnight Thursday (26 March). Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said he believes it may be at least two weeks before the lockdown affects the rise in cases.</p><p>All international flights to Russia will be halted from Friday following a sharp jump in coronavirus cases in the country this week, Russian government officials have announced. Vladimir Putin has also said he will postpone a vote on constitutional changes, scheduled for 22 April, which would have allowed him to run for office again. Russia's government is now ramping up its response to the crisis. Starting on 28 March, Russians will have a week's paid leave   to stay at home. Russians will also see a moratorium on mortgage payments and enterprises will be given credit holidays.</p><p>Commentators, forecasters and financial institutions\u00a0- Key points</p><p>  The US Senate has passed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion aid package as coronavirus deaths top 1,000 nationwide.

Russia steps up its Covid-19 policy response after criticisms of complacency.  South Africa braces for lockdown from tonight. The economy will take a big hit. </p><p>The number of Covid-19 cases has surpassed 400,000 globally, according to the WHO. There are some 414,179 confirmed cases (40,722 last 24 hours) and 18,440 deaths (2,202 last 24 hours). International proliferation continues with two new countries/territories/areas from the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean region reporting cases of Covid-19. China continues to show a low number of new cases and deaths. Total cases for China stand at 81,848 (101 last 24 hours) with deaths at 3,287 (just 4 in last 24 hours).</p><p>US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says America 'may well be in recession' but also adds that it's not a typical downturn. While the slump may be severe, activity could rebound vigorously when the virus is under control, he maintains. Speaking to NBC, Powell also insisted that the Fed still has room to take more policy actions in response to the crisis. It has already cut interest rates, pledged money-printing through its QE asset purchase programme and also launched new programmes to support consumer credit and corporate debt. Weekly US unemployment figures are due to be announced later today   and will likely show a sharp jump.</p><p>Barclays has slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020, citing considerable downward pressure on the market from a Saudi-Russian price war and unprecedented demand disruption because of the coronavirus crisis. The bank lowered its 2020 price outlook for Brent and West Texas Intermediate by $12 each to $31 and $28 per barrel respectively.</p><p>A report on Politico suggests that the coronavirus crisis is creating a thaw in relations between tech firms and politicians who were previously limbering up regulators to tackle so-called 'Big Tech'. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton,\u00a0told Politico the crisis and tech firms' response 'could be a turning point in how big platforms behave in the future'. The report notes that while airlines and hotels are asking for government bailouts, Facebook and Netflix both announced they will provide $100 million in funding to help small businesses and the creative community. Google has also rolled out online tools for teachers and streaming content providers have been responsive to requests for actions that would prevent internet traffic congestion.</p><p>Sources: Coronavirus disease (Covid-2019) situation reports;

On Feb. 19, the S&amp;P 500  hit an all-time high , and one week later we saw it drop 13 percent. In the period from Feb. 24 to March 24, there were 22 trading days with the market moving up or down more than 2.5 percent for 18 of those days. This was more than any other time in history with the same number of trading days. Today, stocks are up nearly 40 percent from their record lows in March, marking what could be the shortest bear market ever.    While the uncertainty of the stock market can be unnerving, it is crucial to remember the market is a forward-looking mechanism, so even in worst-case scenarios, there are likely brighter days ahead. Sit down, breathe and do your best not to overreact to short-term market changes. Take these uncertain times to go back to the drawing board and reflect on your long-term financial goals such as buying a home, sending your children to college and retirement.    Although it is important not to overreact, turbulent markets can serve as excellent reminders to remember and review your long-term financial plans. If you\u2019re aiming to buy your family a home or send your children to their dream school and be prepared for retirement, it is important to have a diversified portfolio that allows you to do so.    Diversifying Assets   Investopedia defines diversification as a technique that reduces risk by allocating investments among various financial instruments, industries and other categories. When markets are high, investors are prone to boundless optimism, and they often pour all of their money into stocks that will likely see steady increases.   The U.S. has bared witness to dozens of companies who have been affected by COVID-19 immensely, specifically in the cruise, airline and hospitality industries . Due to such drastic changes in certain industries, it may not be the best idea to purchase all of your stocks and place assets under one umbrella.    Having a combination of asset classes will reduce your portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to swings in the market. Bond and equity markets often move in opposite directions, so if your portfolio is diversified across both areas, shaky movements in one will be offset by positive results in another.    When diversifying your portfolio, remember to remove your bias toward domestic securities, and invest in international stocks as well. Oftentimes, investors are able to benefit from growth overseas while the U.S. market stagnates. It is highly likely that international stocks and bonds will continue playing a critical role in investments as companies grow to maturity around the world.    Structural Changes In The Market   During COVID-19, the market has seen dozens of structural changes that have increased stocks prices, especially within the big tech sector. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella summed up  how the virus has affected Silicon Valley perfectly, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months.\u201d   Though stock prices in the tech sector seem to be steadily rising, it is important to evaluate how technological changes may impact holdings to understand which asset types, securities or sectors face a higher risk of obsolescence from disruptive technologies and where the opportunities lie.    Again, it is important to mitigate risks when it comes to investing in big tech, especially since the sector\u2019s adherence to antitrust laws is increasingly being called into question. It may be worth focusing on business-to-business stocks rather than high-profile business-to-consumer giants to avoid potential risks that increased regulation may present.    The Bottom Line   One of the most important lessons we\u2019ve learned from the unprecedented market events this year is that it is never too early to prepare for a financial crisis. What is most important is to have a healthy budget that reflects your current personal economic status and to put your money into market sectors that make sense.    Do not jump to extreme measures and withdraw money from retirement plans, but rather think long-term and start an emergency fund composed of assets from optional expenses (vacations, eating out, etc.). Rash decisions during uncertainty have the potential to permanently damage your finances, so remember to always focus on long-term planning.

Late yesterday, the US Senate passed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems. The unanimous vote - 96-0 - came despite earlier wrangling and arguments on both sides about whether it went too far or not far enough.</p><p>EU eurozone finance ministers have been unable to agree a firm plan for the bloc's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, so far this week. Heads of government will hold crunch talks on the subject later this afternoon. Reports suggest much behind-the-scenes wrangling, with some observers noting that the crisis throws economic disparities within the EU into sharp relief. Reports indicate that southern European countries heavily hit by the crisis are seeking new credit lines from the Eurozone's bailout fund or the creation of special EU 'corona bonds'. Other countries - including Germany and the Netherlands - are said to be less keen.</p><p>The UK Government is announcing a new aid package - cash handouts - for the self-employed , in addition to support measures already announced for businesses and employees. It is also preparing a big rollout of testing kits over the next three months, initially to front-line health workers. The kits will show whether a person is carrying antibodies that indicate they have been infected by COVID-19 previously.</p><p>Iran's government has banned internal travel. Iran is a COVID-19 hotspot (over 25,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths). Tehran has warned of a 'second wave' infections outbreak and more restrictions are expected. Observers says the high rate of infections in Iran reflects extensive holidays-related travel earlier in the year.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has reported its second coronavirus death and has tightened a nationwide curfew. Entry and exit into and from the capital Riyadh and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina has been barred, as has movement between all provinces.</p><p>South Africa is the country worst affected by the coronavirus on the African continent. It will begin a 21-day lockdown at midnight today. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said he believes it may be at least two weeks before the lockdown affects the rise in cases.</p><p>All international flights to Russia will be halted from Friday following a sharp jump in coronavirus cases in the country this week, Russian government officials have announced. Vladimir Putin has also said he will postpone a vote on constitutional changes, scheduled for 22 April, which would have allowed him to run for office again. Russia's government is now ramping up its response to the crisis. Starting on Saturday, Russians will have a week's paid leave, to stay at home. Russians will also see a moratorium on mortgage payments and enterprises will be given credit holidays.</p><p>Commentators, forecasters and financial institutions</p><p>* The number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 400,000 globally, according to the WHO.</p><p>* US Fed Reserve says it is primed to 'take more policy actions'.</p><p>* Barclays has slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020 following the Saudi-Russia OPEC+ price war and much lower world demand.</p><p>* Looking for crisis upsides? Big Tech-EU relations could be seeing something of a thaw in a new spirit of crisis-induced cooperation.</p><p>The number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 400,000 globally , according to the World Health Organisation. There are 414,179 confirmed cases (40,722 last 24 hours) and 18,440 deaths (2,202 last 24 hours). International proliferation continues with two new countries/territories/areas from the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions reporting cases of COVID-19. China continues to show a low number of new cases and deaths. Total cases for China stand at 81,848 (101 last 24 hours) with deaths at 3,287 (just 4 in last 24 hours).</p><p>US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says America 'may well be in recession' but also adds that it's not a typical downturn. While the slump could be severe, activity may rebound vigorously when the virus is under control, he maintains. Speaking to NBC, Powell also insisted that the Fed still has room to take more policy actions in response to the crisis. It has already cut interest rates, pledged money-printing through its 'Quantitive Easing' asset purchase programme and also launched new programmes to support consumer credit and corporate debt. Weekly US unemployment figures are due to be announced later today, and will likely show a sharp jump.</p><p>Barclays has slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020 , citing considerable downward pressure on the market from a Saudi-Russian price war and unprecedented demand disruption because of the crisis. The bank lowered its 2020 price outlook for Brent and West Texas Intermediate by $12 each to $31 and $28 per barrel, respectively.</p><p>A report on Politico suggests that the coronavirus crisis is creating a thaw in relations between tech firms and politicians who were previously limbering up regulators to tackle so-called 'Big Tech'. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton told Politico the tech firms' response to the crisis \"could be a turning point in how big platforms behave in the future\". The report notes that while airlines and hotels are asking for government bailouts, Facebook and Netflix both announced they will provide US$100m in funding to help small businesses and the creative community. Google has also rolled out online tools for teachers and streaming content providers have been responsive to requests for actions that would prevent internet traffic congestion.</p><p>Coronavirus COVID-19 and the global drinks industry - just-drinks timeline</p><p>This article was originally published on just-drinks.com on 26 March 2020.

The unanimous vote - 96-0 -\u00a0came despite earlier wrangling and arguments on both sides about whether it went too far or not far enough.</p><p>EU eurozone finance ministers have been unable to agree a firm plan for the bloc's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, so far this week. Heads of government will hold crunch talks on the subject later this afternoon. Reports suggest much behind-the-scenes wrangling, with some observers noting that the crisis throws economic disparities within the EU into sharp relief. Reports indicate that southern European countries heavily hit by the crisis are seeking new credit lines from the Eurozone's bailout fund or the creation of special EU 'corona bonds'. Other countries - including Germany and the Netherlands - are said to be less keen.</p><p>The UK Government is announcing a new aid package - cash handouts - for the self-employed, in addition to support measures already announced for businesses and employees. It is also preparing a big rollout of testing kits over the next three months, initially to front-line health workers. The kits will show whether a person is carrying antibodies that indicate they have been infected by COVID-19 previously.</p><p>Iran's government has banned internal travel. Iran is a COVID-19 hotspot (over 25,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths). Tehran has warned of a 'second wave' infections outbreak and more restrictions are expected. Observers says the high rate of infections in Iran reflects extensive holidays-related travel earlier in the year.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has reported its second coronavirus death and has tightened a nationwide curfew. Entry and exit into and from the capital Riyadh and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina has been barred, as has movement between all provinces.</p><p>South Africa is the country worst affected by the coronavirus on the African continent. It will begin a 21-day lockdown at midnight today. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said he believes it may be at least two weeks before the lockdown affects the rise in cases.</p><p>All international flights to Russia will be halted from Friday following a sharp jump in coronavirus cases in the country this week, Russian government officials have announced. Vladimir Putin has also said he will postpone a vote on constitutional changes, scheduled for 22 April, which would have allowed him to run for office again. Russia's government is now ramping up its response to the crisis. Starting on Saturday, Russians will have a week's paid leave, to stay at home. Russians will also see a moratorium on mortgage payments and enterprises will be given credit holidays.</p><p>Commentators, forecasters and financial institutions</p><p>  The US Senate has passed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion aid package as coronavirus deaths top 1,000 nationwide. Despite the fractious post-impeachment landscape of US politics, the bill came together at breakneck speed  Thus far, EU eurozone finance ministers have been unable to agree a firm plan for the bloc's bailout fund in response to the crisis. Underlying pressures and divisions within the bloc may become more evident in the coming weeks  The UK government is announcing a new aid package - cash handouts - for the self-employed  Russia steps up its COVID-19 policy response after criticisms of complacency  South Africa braces for lockdown from tonight. The economy will take a big hit </p><p>The number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 400,000 globally, according to the World Health Organisation. There are 414,179 confirmed cases (40,722 last 24 hours) and 18,440 deaths (2,202 last 24 hours). International proliferation continues with two new countries/territories/areas from the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions reporting cases of COVID-19. China continues to show a low number of new cases and deaths. Total cases for China stand at 81,848 (101 last 24 hours) with deaths at 3,287 (just 4 in last 24 hours).</p><p>US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says America 'may well be in recession' but also adds that it's not a typical downturn. While the slump could be severe, activity may rebound vigorously when the virus is under control, he maintains. Speaking to NBC, Powell also insisted that the Fed still has room to take more policy actions in response to the crisis. It has already cut interest rates, pledged money-printing through its 'Quantitive Easing' asset purchase programme and also launched new programmes to support consumer credit and corporate debt. Weekly US unemployment figures are due to be announced later today, and will likely show a sharp jump.</p><p>Barclays has slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020, citing considerable downward pressure on the market from a Saudi-Russian price war and unprecedented demand disruption because of the crisis. The bank lowered its 2020 price outlook for Brent and West Texas Intermediate by $12 each to $31 and $28 per barrel, respectively.</p><p>A report on Politico suggests that the coronavirus crisis is creating a thaw in relations between tech firms and politicians who were previously limbering up regulators to tackle so-called 'Big Tech'. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton\u00a0told Politico the tech firms' response to the crisis \"could be a turning point in how big platforms behave in the future\". The report notes that while airlines and hotels are asking for government bailouts, Facebook and Netflix both announced they will provide US$100m in funding to help small businesses and the creative community. Google has also rolled out online tools for teachers and streaming content providers have been responsive to requests for actions that would prevent internet traffic congestion.</p><p>Coronavirus COVID-19 and the global drinks industry - just-drinks timeline</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JDGNWS-130603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JDGNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHJ-J611-F14X-V2JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1125\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Aroq Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>just-drinks global news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"60913\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 26, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000157</classCode><className>BAILOUTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DP1V</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS ASSISTANCE &amp;

IT transformation journeys that would have lasted a few years are being packed into months,\" he said.<br/> Earlier, IBM launched Watson AIOps, a new offering which uses AI to automate and enable companies to diagnose, self-detect and respond to IT issues in real-time. This is an area where billions of dollars are spent on maintaining IT systems every year - from banks to pharmaceutical companies. Watson AIOps is built on Red Hat OpenShift to run across hybrid cloud environments and works with collaboration technologies at the centre of today's distributed work environments, such as Slack and Box.<br/> The push for adopting digital since the onset of Covid-19 is something which even Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently eluded to. In Microsoft's recent earnings call, Nadella had said that two years of digital transformation have happened in 2 months.<br/> Such a massive surge in demand could result in an outage and consequently lost revenue opportunity, if IT systems are not in place. Market research firm Aberdeen pegs an outage at about $260,000/hour.<br/> With new offerings built on Red Hat OpenShift, enterprises have the ability to autonomously manage workloads across a massive volume of edge devices.<br/> Krishna also is bullish about the demand from telecom. \"As 5G adoption expands, telecommunications providers can quickly provide new services,\" said Krishna. Vodafone Business, is working with IBM to help improve worker safety and productivity in remote locations such as oil rigs, factories, warehouses, ports and mines. Combining Vodafone Mobile Private Networks, IBM Edge Application Manager and Red Hat OpenShift, the new solution uses sensors, AI, as well as predictive and video analytics to understand and respond to incidents in milliseconds, keeping workers safe, according to Krishna.<br/> \"Technology platforms are the basis for competitive advantage in the 21st century and it will determine how quickly an organisation can pivot to new market opportunities, serve clients, how much you can scale, and how fast you can respond to a crisis like the one we're facing today,\" stated Krishna.<br/> All these, however, raise concerns over big tech companies cornering a bigger market share going forward.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A-340238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YV4-PT21-JBYT-H3XS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"474\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 6, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

This is one of the main conclusions of the second edition of the annual European Tech Insights report by IE University's Center for the Governance of Change (CGC).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Tech Insights 2020 report [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ie.edu/cgc/research/european-tech-insights/\">https://www.ie.edu/cgc/research/european-tech-insights/</url>], explores how the general public across nine European countries (France, Germany, Estonia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom) feel about the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the role technology and tech companies play in society, compared to peers in the US, China, &amp; Mexico. The survey covered 2,883 respondents across the globe.</p><p>Before the pandemic, 53% of Europeans believed that governments should not share their citizens' health records with companies like Google without their previous consent, even if doing so would help developing new treatments and help early detection of diseases. In the past three months however, these privacy concerns have decreased.</p><p>- In two of the European countries first hit by the coronavirus, Italy and Spain, an overwhelming majority (79% and 67% respectively) now support the implementation of restrictive tracking systems like the ones deployed in China.</p><p>- Similarly, the number of citizens that are willing to reduce their privacy through more CCTV or social network surveillance by governments has also grown in over the last three months by 15% in Italy, 7% in the USA and 4% Spain.</p><p>- 69% of Americans and 51% of Chinese disagreed with sharing their personal data before the pandemic and this number has now decreased by 10 percentage points in both countries since January.</p><p>The European Tech Insights 2020 report also found that Covid-19 has increased anti-automation sentiments, but there is a notable generational divide in perceptions on limiting automation in order to save jobs:</p><p>- After the onset of the pandemic, support for limiting automation almost doubled in China, from 27% to 54%, and there was a 14% increase in Spain by mid-April when the country was experiencing a record number of cases.</p><p>- For citizens under 55 the majority support limiting automation, whilst those over 56 are less supportive of limitations (49% against and 32% for).</p><p>- At the same time, a majority of Europeans - with as many as 70% of Britons - find confidence in their skills and think that robots and computers will not be able to do their jobs better than them within the next 10 years, an outlook that is more prevalent among the older generation. This figure is similar for France and Poland but lower in Mexico (55%) and China (25%)</p><p>OTHER KEY FINDINGS</p><p>Governance</p><p>- 37% of young Europeans (18-35 years old) are in favour of using 'digital avatars' - algorithms with access to our data to profile our values - instead of politicians, to represent their interests in national parliaments. By contrast, only 19% of older cohorts are excited about that option. In China, support is significantly higher with 61% being excited about digital avatars.</p><p>Trade</p><p>- 41% of Europeans think that Europe should follow the US example and raise tariffs on Chinese products to protect its regional economy. This position is particularly popular in France and Poland, where over 50% of citizens support more trade barriers. In contrast, Germany and Estonia are strongly against this proposition.</p><p>- A majority (49%) of Chinese citizens think that China should use its political and economic strength to prevent Europe from raising tariffs.</p><p>Regulation</p><p>- More than 50% of Europeans think that governments should adopt new regulation forcing companies of the gig economy like Uber and Deliveroo to comply with the same labour rules than traditional companies.</p><p>- 70% of Europeans surveyed think that governments should increase taxes on air travel, particularly on domestic flights that can be substituted by a train journey, in order to reduce the environmental damage. This share is higher among older demographics than younger ones.</p><p>Taxation</p><p>- Citizens of four of the countries most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic strongly support raising taxes for companies. Europeans favour raising taxes on big tech companies (53 % of Italians and 40 % of Spaniards think that technological companies should pay more taxes to enable governments to finance the recovery), while US and Chinese respondents think that all companies should be taxed more, not only technological ones. In all four countries, less than 15 % of respondents think that there should not be increases in taxes.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from India Education Diary.

However, where new opportunities require new uses of personal information, a company's need to move fast to meet demand can often be at odds with the need to carefully map out data workflows to assess and address privacy concerns.With Congress having failed thus far to pass comprehensive consumer privacy legislation, and California's groundbreaking consumer privacy law offering individual rights only after data has been collected, companies have little legal guidance as to how to resolve this tension.However, regulators are showing their willingness to use existing enforcement powers through unfair and deceptive trade practices acts to investigate privacy concerns of new or suddenly popular products. A number of Senators have also shown that they are paying close attention to privacy issues that arise as public health authorities' use Big Data analytics to support their efforts to contain COVID-19.A group of Senate Democrats sent a letter to Google[1] in March 2020 questioning the company's practices around sharing data with government entities, including the measures taken to safeguard patient information entered into a website developed by Google's sister company that facilitates checking symptoms and obtaining testing for coronavirus. </p><p>A similar letter[2] was sent to Apple about its virus screening application and website. In addition, the Senate Commerce Committee is holding a 'paper hearing[3]' on April 9, 2020, to examine the 'recent uses of aggregate and anonymized consumer data to identify potential hotspots of coronavirus transmission and to help accelerate the development of treatments.'This government interest should serve as a reminder to Big Tech that even in a pandemic, privacy guardrails should guide product development. Data protection assessments, where attorneys and business executives work together before a product is released to map how a product will collect and use data, are critical to meeting legal requirements in the area of consumer protection. These assessments should: Evaluate the benefits of the data collection, use, and disclosure against the risk of harm to the individual; Enforce data minimization during product development by documenting the necessity of each data element collected to achieving the business purpose; Analyze the data collection, use, and disclosure practices against the organization's privacy policy; and Evaluate whether any special security measures need to be taken in light of the sensitivity of the data at issue.These assessments would be valuable in demonstrating to regulators that the organization was thoughtful in considering consumer privacy and security and could actually help businesses maximize the value of the data they collect.On the policymaking side, the current climate presents an opportunity to think more intelligently about privacy regulation. The benefits of innovative data use and sharing of data for public health purposes challenge some principles that privacy advocates have held firm to in recent debates about state and federal legislation.For example, the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) prohibits the 'use [of] personal information collected for additional purposes without providing the consumer with notice' (Cal. Civ. Code 1798.100(b)), and similar purpose limiting provisions are common in other privacy legislation. Purpose limitations are a tricky concept to begin with: organizations often use the same data elements in multiple different ways, all with an eye toward providing products and services, and discrete identification of each purpose is not always possible.Moreover, providing supplemental notice is also difficult when an organization does not necessarily track an email or mailing address for each individual from whom they collect data (for example, in the case of cookie data). The CCPA\u2014unlike the EU General Data Protection Regulation\u2014does not contain any exceptions to its requirements or accounting for public interest use purposes.Policymakers should consider how rigid application of privacy principles could impede important uses of data in the public interest. In the current pandemic, for instance, using big data may be critical to society's ability to flatten the epidemiological curve and shore up the economy. We should think creatively about how we might enable uses of data that are important to the public interest while mitigating risks to privacy.For instance, companies that use location information to track individuals' movements could minimize the privacy risks to individuals by deleting the information within a certain period of time after pinpointing areas that are potential hot spots. And insurance companies could be barred from using such data to determine who among their insureds is a greater risk.Data de-identification tools also have a role to play. Indeed, the pandemic highlights the need for sensible national standards governing what it means to 'de-identify' data. For example, Google and other BigTech companies have been sharing[4] what Google calls 'anonymous' location data in order to allow public health officials to see where individuals are congregating despite shelter-in-place orders.Organizations frequently use the term 'anonymous,' including in privacy policies, without specifying what steps they have taken to render data unlinkable to a person and without acknowledging that sophisticated data scientists can re-identify based on very few data points.While the Federal Trade Commission and National Institute of Standards and Technology have both published guidance on de-identification, this guidance is not law. Moreover, the CCPA imposes a different standard for de-identification\u2014one that arguably cannot be met where a line of data refers to an individual (see Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140(h)).An opportunity now exists for regulators, industry, and privacy advocates to come together to develop both pragmatic technical standards for removing identifying details from data sets and model policies for handling of de-identified data. Such rules could have public health benefits and also allow organizations to work with big data in new and innovative ways while still protecting individual privacy.[View source[5].] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/18/testing-verily-google-coronavirus-white-house-letter/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/18/testing-verily-google-coronavirus-white-house-letter/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20Apple%20on%20COVID-19%20website%20privacy%20(4.3.20).pdf\">https://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20Apple%20on%20COVID-19%20website%20privacy%20(4.3.20).pdf</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/4/committee-announces-paper-hearing-on-big-data-and-the-coronavirus\">https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/4/committee-announces-paper-hearing-on-big-data-and-the-coronavirus</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-reveals-location-data-health-officials-coronavirus/\">https://www.wired.com/story/google-reveals-location-data-health-officials-coronavirus/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2020/04/covid-19-privacy-challengers-for-big-tech\">https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2020/04/covid-19-privacy-challengers-for-big-tech</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411158654645705725876100230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMS-R4C1-JCMN-Y4HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1194\"/><timeReceived>7:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans. One depressing aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is to see two of the usual suspects - Big Tech and Big Pharma - trying to distort what we hear, learn, and understand about the ongoing situation. Each has a dog in the COVID-19 fight and seeks to convince us they have viable approaches that just happen to maximize their profits, whether it be the necessity of proprietary apps or the need to rely on new proprietary approaches - such as a new vaccine and expensive drugs under patent that have yet to be put forward, I originally intended to combine discussion of these two grifts into one post. </p><p>But in the interest of keeping the post short and manageable and also in concentrating discussion in comments on what are actually two separate problems - albeit each falling under the general heading of profiteering - I have decided to split the post, and discuss Big Tech today, and Big Pharma tomorrow. Contact Tracing I have written extensively about Hong Kong's success in fighting COVID-19. The city's effective coronavirus control strategy relies on tried and tested public health measures to control spread of an infectious disease: the use of masks; social distancing; and testing and tracing. Background assumptions I should mention are that the city has excellent health care, and public health officials have ample experience and enjoy public trust, They didn't hit on their COVID-19 strategy by serendipity. Previous experience in 1968 with what's still known as the Hong Kong' flu and SARS in 2003 informed their infectious disease control strategy. Beginning in March, I have written at least five previous posts discussing aspects of Hong Kong's approach,comparing the city's response and record to that ofNew York, as they are similarly sized and densely populated (see for my most recent take , No, We Don't Need to Place Our Faith in Downloading Some Untested, Privacy-Infringing App as the Only Possible COVID-19 Slayer; Why Don't We Look to Places that Have Successfully Limited Disease Spread and Copy Their Policies?[1]) Now, to be sure, Hong Kong has recently seen an uptick in cases: today the South China Morning Post[2] reported the total number of cases now stands at 1569 and 8 people have died. And the public health system has reacted quickly and hard to get control again over the spread of this very sneaky disease that exploits any weakness or lack of vigilance. Conflating Contact Tracing and Contact Tracing By App An integral part of Hon Kong's successful strategy is effective contact tracing. Yet this is not the same thing as contact tracing via app. In a recent article in the Conversation, Digital contact tracing's mixed record abroad spells trouble for US efforts to rein in COVID-19[3], Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at Tufts University's Fletcher School conflated contact tracing with digital contact tracing, aka contact tracing via app. Ignacio, in comments on a previous post, noted that contact tracing via app alone isn't very good contact tracing. In fact, if I understand him correctly, it can be worse than useless. Maybe, if he reads this, he'll pipe up in comments with a more thorough explanation, with some details as to why this is so. It merely alerts you that you at some point were near to someone who has subsequently tested positive for the disease. But, what good does that do? Especially with the increasing number of infections.In fact, it may also underestimate your true chance of infection, since I understand these apps don't necessarily work very well indoors, and we're coming to learn that there, particularly in poorly ventilated places, you are at great if not greatest risk of contracting the virus. Instead, effective contact tracing requires more than a determination that you may have been vicinity of someone who subsequently tested positive for the disease. In fact, contact tracing is not simple, as Dr.Sarah Borwein pointed out to me in a discussion I included in a previous post, Contact Tracing Via Old Shoe-Leather Epidemiology While Spurning the Techno-Fix Fairy: How Hong Kong Quells COVID-19 Without Killing Civil Liberties[4]: [Crucial to this success] is the importance of painstaking test and trace measures to plot and thwart the course of COVID-19 spread. Sarah described what has been undertaken as 'old shoe-leather epidemiology.' No app. No technofix fairy. Just hard work. I asked her to explain what test and trace means to Hong Kong health authorities. Sarah Borwein: So we had 21 days with no local cases and then a case was detected 2 days ago, and now her grand-daughter and husband have tested positive. What they are doing reflects their strategy: They did extensive interviews with the index case (the 66 year old grandmother) and retraced everywhere she'd been in the 2-3 days prior to getting sick - every market stall etc. She looks after her 5 year old grand-daughter who is also positive - so they have also traced all her contacts. She attends a tutorial school, so the teachers and other kids. And now they are conducting testing for 860 families who live in her housing block or the grand-daughter's, or work in the market or work in or attend the tutorial center. At least 5000 people from 1 case! They actually do something similar whenever we have a local case of dengue fever (not endemic here) - so they do have practice. Jerri-Lynn Scofield: So, that's what test and trace means! And not via an app. Sarah Borwein: No, not via an App Although there are websites where you can see the locations of all the positive cases, and any flights etc (including seat number) they have been on - so you can self-report if you were near them. But mainly they do the shoe-leather work as the mainstay. I'm afraid that just turning this process over to an app that notes when a person was in the presence of someone who tested positive is not the same thing. Charavarti discussed problems of trust and privacy in three cases, South Korea, India, and Germany, but doesn't seem to understand there is a flaw in the contact tracing by app approach. South Korea's success involves combining the tracking app and correlating it with lots of additional surveillance data. I have not studied their system, but understand that surveillance information is regularly collected about people, and the app that tells when you were in the presence someone who tested positive is only one part of the country's contact tracing approach. And that's not the only thing the country has done. Not only did South Korea test widely, but as Chakravorti acknowledges: Its contact tracing arsenal includedtracking apps[5]paired with CCTV footage, travel and medical records and credit card transaction information. India, for its part, has virtually abandoned the effort as there are considerable concerns about safeguarding the data that is collected. But there are lingering legacy aspects. Originally it was a requirement that one download and use the app before boarding a 'plane. International flights remain suspended, but there's confusion about whether the app requirement still stands, with some immigration officials still insisting it does apply. So the prudent person who wants to fly out of India when that again becomes possible will preemptively download the app. As for Germany, with its unfortunate history of misuse of data first by the Nazis and then by the Stasi, its citizens are rightly skeptical of contact tracing via app. So, what do they do instead? Seems to be a variation of that old shoe leather epidemiology also practiced by Hong Kong and discussed by Sarah above, Per the Conversation: Even with a decentralized, privacy-protecting approach, Germany's new app is unlikely to achieve the level of adoption of South Korea's. However, the government's investment in aneffective traditional contact tracing approach[6]using public health staff to investigate contacts makes a digital alternative less urgent. Contact Tracing Theater: Apps My resistance to use of apps for contact tracing purposes stems from more then idle unconsidered civil liberties concerns - although privacy and controls on data collection are undoubtedly important and should not be surrendered lightly. But just as the security theater we've all come to loathe doesn't really make you any safer when you eventually board the airplane, so contact tracing by app is not very sound contact tracing at all. It just makes big Tech companies and their executives richer, more powerful, and more central to our existence.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/07/covid-19-mistakes-to-avoid-dont-conflate-contact-tracing-with-contact-tracing-by-app.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;#38;utm_medium=feed&amp;#38;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/07/covid-19-mistakes-to-avoid-dont-conflate-contact-tracing-with-contact-tracing-by-app.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;#38;utm_medium=feed&amp;#38;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[7], Doomsday scenarios[8], Guest Post[9], Health care[10], India[11], Pandemic[12], Politics[13], Regulations and regulators[14], Ridiculously obvious scams[15], Science and the scientific method[16], Surveillance state[17] on July 14, 2020[18] by Jerri-Lynn Scofield[19].

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans.    One depressing aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is to see two of the usual suspects \u2013 Big Tech and Big Pharma \u2013 trying to distort what we hear, learn, and understand about the ongoing situation. Each has a dog in the COVID-19 fight and seeks to convince us they have viable approaches that just happen to  maximize their profits, whether it be the necessity of proprietary apps  or the need to rely on new proprietary approaches \u2013 such as a new vaccine and expensive drugs under patent that have yet to be put forward,    I originally intended to combine discussion of these two grifts into one post. But in the interest of keeping the post short and manageable and also in concentrating  discussion in comments on  what are actually two separate problems \u2013 albeit each falling under the general  heading of profiteering \u2013 I have decided to split the post, and discuss Big Tech today, and Big Pharma tomorrow.    Contact Tracing    I have written extensively about Hong Kong\u2019s success in fighting COVID-19. The city\u2019s effective coronavirus control strategy relies on tried and tested public health measures to control spread of an infectious disease:  the use of masks; social distancing; and testing and tracing. Background assumptions I should mention are that the city has excellent health care, and public health officials have ample experience and enjoy public trust,    They didn\u2019t hit on their COVID-19 strategy by serendipity. Previous experience in 1968 with what\u2019s still known as the Hong Kong\u2019 flu and SARS in 2003 informed their infectious disease control strategy.    Beginning in March, I have written at least five previous posts discussing aspects of Hong Kong\u2019s approach,comparing the city\u2019s response and record to that of New York, as they are similarly sized and densely populated (see for my most recent take , No, We Don\u2019t Need to Place Our Faith in Downloading Some Untested, Privacy-Infringing App as the Only Possible COVID-19 Slayer; Why Don\u2019t We Look to Places that Have Successfully Limited Disease Spread and Copy Their Policies? )    Now, to be sure, Hong Kong has recently seen an uptick in cases: today the South China Morning Post reported the total number of cases now stands at 1569 and 8 people have died. And the public health system has reacted quickly and hard to get control again over the spread of this very sneaky disease that exploits any weakness or lack of vigilance.    Conflating Contact Tracing and Contact Tracing By App    An integral part of Hon Kong\u2019s successful strategy is effective contact tracing. Yet this is not the same thing as contact tracing via app. In a recent article in The Conversation, Digital contact tracing\u2019s mixed record abroad spells trouble for US efforts to rein in COVID-19 , Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School conflated contact tracing with digital contact tracing, aka contact tracing via app.    Ignacio, in comments on a previous post, noted that contact tracing via app alone isn\u2019t very good contact tracing. In fact, if I understand him correctly, it can be worse than useless. Maybe, if he reads this, he\u2019ll pipe up in comments with a more thorough explanation, with some details as to why this is so.    It merely alerts you that you at some point were near to someone who has subsequently tested positive for the disease. But, what good does that do? Especially with the increasing number of infections.In fact, it may also underestimate your true chance of infection, since I understand these apps don\u2019t necessarily work very well indoors, and we\u2019re coming to learn that there, particularly in poorly ventilated places, you are at great if not greatest risk of contracting the virus.    Instead, effective contact tracing requires more than a determination that you may have been vicinity of someone who subsequently tested positive for the disease. In fact, contact tracing is not simple, as Dr.Sarah Borwein pointed out to me in a discussion I included in a previous post, Contact Tracing Via Old Shoe-Leather Epidemiology While Spurning the Techno-Fix Fairy: How Hong Kong Quells COVID-19 Without Killing Civil Liberties :    [Crucial to this success] is the importance of painstaking test and trace measures to plot and thwart the course of COVID-19 spread.    Sarah described what has been undertaken as \u201cold shoe-leather epidemiology.\u201d No app. No technofix fairy. Just hard work.    I asked her to explain what test and trace means to Hong Kong health authorities.    Sarah Borwein: So we had 21 days with no local cases and then a case was detected 2 days ago, and now her grand-daughter and husband have tested positive. What they are doing reflects their strategy:    They did extensive interviews with the index case (the 66 year old grandmother) and retraced everywhere she\u2019d been in the 2-3 days prior to getting sick \u2013 every market stall etc. She looks after her 5 year old grand-daughter who is also positive \u2013 so they have also traced all her contacts. She attends a tutorial school, so the teachers and other kids.    And now they are conducting testing for 860 families who live in her housing block or the grand-daughter\u2019s, or work in the market or work in or attend the tutorial center.

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans.    One depressing aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is to see two of the usual suspects \u2013 Big Tech and Big Pharma \u2013 trying to distort what we hear, learn, and understand about the ongoing situation. Each has a dog in the COVID-19 fight and seeks to convince us they have viable approaches that just happen to  maximize their profits, whether it be the necessity of proprietary apps  or the need to rely on new proprietary approaches \u2013 such as a new vaccine and expensive drugs under patent that have yet to be put forward,    I originally intended to combine discussion of these two grifts into one post. But in the interest of keeping the post short and manageable and also in concentrating  discussion in comments on  what are actually two separate problems \u2013 albeit each falling under the general  heading of profiteering \u2013 I have decided to split the post, and discuss Big Tech today, and Big Pharma tomorrow.    Contact Tracing    I have written extensively about Hong Kong\u2019s success in fighting COVID-19. The city\u2019s effective coronavirus control strategy relies on tried and tested public health measures to control spread of an infectious disease:  the use of masks; social distancing; and testing and tracing. Background assumptions I should mention are that the city has excellent health care, and public health officials have ample experience and enjoy public trust,    They didn\u2019t hit on their COVID-19 strategy by luck or serendipity. Previous experience in 1968 with what\u2019s still known as the Hong Kong\u2019 flu i and SARS in 2003 informed their infectious disease control strategy.    Beginning in March, I have written at least five previous posts discussing aspects of Hong Kong\u2019s approach,comparing the city\u2019s response and record  to that of  New York, as they are similarly sized and densely populated (see for my most recent take , No, We Don\u2019t Need to Place Our Faith in Downloading Some Untested, Privacy-Infringing App as the Only Possible COVID-19 Slayer; Why Don\u2019t We Look to Places that Have Successfully Limited Disease Spread and Copy Their Policies? )    Now, to be sure, Hong Kong has recently seen an uptick in cases: today the South China Post reported the total number of cases now stands at 1569 and 8 people have died. And the public health system has reacted quickly and hard to get control again over the very sneaky disease that exploits any weakness or lack of vigilance.    Conflating Contact Tracing and Contact Tracing By App    An integral part of Hon Kong\u2019s successful strategy is effective contact tracing.Yet this is not the same thing as contact tracing via app. In a recent article in the Conversation, Digital contact tracing\u2019s mixed record abroad spells trouble for US efforts to rein in COVID-19 , Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School conflated contact tracing with digital contact tracing, aka contact tracing via app.    Ignacio, in comments on a previous post, noted that contact tracing via app alone isn\u2019t very good contact tracing. In fact, if I understand him correctly, it can be worse than useless. Maybe, if he reads this, he\u2019ll pipe up in comments with a more thorough explanation, with some details as to why this is so.    It merely alerts you that you at some point were near to someone who has subsequently tested positive for the disease. But, what good does that do? Especially with the increasing number of infections.In fact, it may also underestimate your true chance of infection, since I understand these apps don\u2019t necessarily work very well indoors, and we\u2019re coming to learn that there, particularly in poorly ventilated places, you are at great if not greatest risk of contracting the virus.    Instead, effective contact tracing requires more than a determination that you may have been vicinity of someone who subsequently tested positive for the disease. In fact, contact tracing is not simple, As Dr.Sarah Borwein pointed out to me in a discussion I included in a previous post, Contact Tracing Via Old Shoe-Leather Epidemiology While Spurning the Techno-Fix Fairy: How Hong Kong Quells COVID-19 Without Killing Civil Liberties :    [Crucial to this success] is the importance of painstaking test and trace measures to plot and thwart the course of COVID-19 spread.    Sarah described what has been undertaken as \u201cold shoe-leather epidemiology.\u201d No app. No technofix fairy. Just hard work.    I asked her to explain what test and trace means to Hong Kong health authorities.    Sarah Borwein: So we had 21 days with no local cases and then a case was detected 2 days ago, and now her grand-daughter and husband have tested positive. What they are doing reflects their strategy:    They did extensive interviews with the index case (the 66 year old grandmother) and retraced everywhere she\u2019d been in the 2-3 days prior to getting sick \u2013 every market stall etc. She looks after her 5 year old grand-daughter who is also positive \u2013 so they have also traced all her contacts. She attends a tutorial school, so the teachers and other kids.    And now they are conducting testing for 860 families who live in her housing block or the grand-daughter\u2019s, or work in the market or work in or attend the tutorial center. At least 5000 people from 1 case!    They actually do something similar whenever we have a local case of dengue fever (not endemic here) \u2013 so they do have practice.    Jerri-Lynn Scofield: So, that\u2019s what test and trace means! And not via an app.    Sarah Borwein: No, not via an App    Although there are websites where you can see the locations of all the positive cases, and any flights etc (including seat number) they have been on \u2013 so you can self-report if you were near them. But mainly they do the shoe-leather work as the mainstay.    I\u2019m afraid that just turning this process over to an app that notes when a person was in the presence of someone who tested positive is not the same thing. Charavarti discussed problems of trust and privacy in three cases, involving South Korea, India, and Germany, but doesn\u2019t seem to understand there is a flaw in the contact tracing by app approach.    South Korea\u2019s success involves combining the tracking app and correlating it with lots of additional surveillance data. I have not studied their system, but understand that surveillance information is regularly collected about people, and the app this app that tells when you were in the presence someone who tested positive is only one part of the country\u2019s contact tracing approach.Not only did South Korea test widely, but as Chakravorti acknowledges:    Its contact tracing arsenal included  tracking apps  paired with CCTV footage, travel and medical records and credit card transaction information.    India, for its part.  has virtually abandoned the effort  as there are considerable concerns about safeguarding the data that is collected. But there are lingering legacy aspects. Originally it was a requirement that one download and use the app before boarding a \u2018plane. International flights  remain suspended, but there\u2019s confusion about whether the app requirement still stands, with some immigration officials still insisting it does apply. So the prudent person who wants to leave India when that again becomes possible will preemptively download the app.    As for Germany, with its unfortunate history of misuse of data first by the Nazis and then by the Stasi, its citizens are rightly skeptical of contact tracing via app. So, what do they do instead? Seems to be a variation of that old shoe leather epidemiology also practiced by Hong Kong and discussed by Sarah above, Per the Conversation:    Even with a decentralized, privacy-protecting approach, Germany\u2019s new app is unlikely to achieve the level of adoption of South Korea\u2019s. However, the government\u2019s investment in an  effective traditional contact tracing approach  using public health staff to investigate contacts makes a digital alternative less urgent.    Contact Tracing Theater : Apps    My resistance to use of apps for contact tracing purposes stems from more then idle unconsidered civil liberties concerns \u2013 although privacy and controls on data collection are undoubtedly important and should not be surrendered lightly. But just as the security theater we\u2019ve all come to loathe doesn\u2019t really make you any safer when you eventually board the airplane, so contact tracing by app is not very sound contact tracing at all.

Experts say that such innovations will help in the longer term by reducing unnecessary use of health services that were already struggling to meet the needs of an ageing population, long before Covid-19 struck. </p><p>\u201cThe pandemic has drawn attention to the complexities of delivering healthcare within a massively decentralised market,\u201d says Vincent Grasso, global healthcare and life sciences lead at IPsoft, an artificial intelligence company. \u201cPart of [our] dilemma involves the inability to scale up human labour fast enough to meet new demands on resources. AI applications, including conversational computing, can be very helpful to meet this demand.\u201d </p><p>Health agencies are also striking partnerships with tech companies at a speed and scale hard to imagine under normal circumstances. The NHS is working with the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Palantir to create data models to optimise the allocation of ventilators, hospital beds and staff.</p><p>Data privacy restrictions are loosening. The UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office recently said it would be \u201cpragmatic\u201d in enforcing the usual rules, taking into account compelling public interest arguments. It acknowledged that organisations might fall short of their usual data protection practices due to their need to divert resources away from compliance and information governance, and might take longer to respond to information rights requests. \u201cThe ICO does not operate in isolation from matters of serious public concern,\u201d it wrote. </p><p>The crisis has been a big impetus for enabling digital health, says Klaus Boehncke, partner at LEK Consulting, a management consulting group. Governments were already working on new rules to facilitate the emergence of digital health, ranging from apps and wearables to \u201cdigi-ceutical\u201d therapies that rely on software as a key component in managing a disease. </p><p>Germany passed a law in November to allow doctors to prescribe health apps, with costs reimbursed by insurers. Such moves are \u201ca driver of innovation in German healthcare\u201d, says Ramraj Puvinathan, research associate at Public, an accelerator for public sector-focused start-ups. \u201cIt is the first model of its kind anywhere in Europe, in terms of reimbursing healthcare providers through statutory health insurance.\u201d </p><p>Regulators are breaking down data silos to better unleash innovation in digital medicine and AI. The EU is integrating data across member states to enable cross-border digital prescriptions and patient data exchange, and the US recently passed rules to enable data to flow more seamlessly across the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programmes. </p><p>Regulators are approving a growing number of digital health therapies. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first \u201cdigital pill\u201d, a sensor-laden chemotherapy drug that allows clinicians to monitor whether patients are following their prescribed drug regimen. The FDA has also sanctioned mental health apps from Pear, a San Francisco-based technology group, that support people with addiction and chronic insomnia. </p><p>More products are expected. Apple and Johnson &amp; Johnson are running a clinical trial exploring whether Apple Watch can be used to detect atrial fibrillation. </p><p>In Europe, the first wave of digital health start-ups has focused mainly on back-office tasks such as communications, staffing logistics and information flows. \u201cMost successful European [digital health] start-ups are operational, and don\u2019t classify under medical regulation categories,\u201d says Puvinathan. \u201cWhat is interesting now is a second wave of start-ups that we think will go into the ecosystem, requiring clinical evidence, ticking regulatory boxes and fulfilling European regulations.\u201d</p><p>Clinical trials themselves could change significantly thanks to AI advances. The technology has the potential to improve logistics such as patient enrolment by quickly scanning electronic medical records and clinical trial eligibility criteria. </p><p>For instance, 86 per cent of trials do not meet enrolment deadlines, and nearly a third of Phase III trials fail because of inability to recruit patients. AI could improve the selection of participants by sifting through electronic medical records, genetic information and unstructured data, including doctors\u2019 notes, to find the best fits between proposed therapies and disease signatures.</p><p>AI could support adaptive clinical trials, a new approach in which studies change tack based on emerging insights. \u201cAI could help with stratifying patients and identifying new biomarkers that might be important and lead to a change in the trial,\u201d says Clay Heskett, partner at LEK Consulting. \u201cThat has to be done with the blessing of the [regulatory] agencies, but the tools are enabling more flexibility than ever before.\u201d </p><p>Not everyone feels comfortable about the rise of AI, digital technology and, by implication, commercial interests in healthcare. Tech companies have faced public criticism, regulatory rebukes and even legal challenges for data privacy breaches. </p><p>The UK\u2019s privacy watchdog said in 2017 that an NHS trust had broken data protection laws when it gave DeepMind, Google\u2019s artificial intelligence arm, access to the personal medical records of 1.6m British patients. Google and the University of Chicago faced a lawsuit over a data-sharing agreement that failed to secure patient consent, and allowed re-identification of anonymised patients, by triangulating date stamps and doctors\u2019 notes. </p><p>Even today, despite the gravity of the coronavirus threat, UK privacy campaigners have expressed concern about the involvement of tech companies in the NHS Covid-19 response. Palantir, for instance, also has a portfolio that includes tracking undocumented migrants for the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The NHS partnership with Big Tech has prompted an open letter from a group of campaigners, doctors and academics imploring the US agency to avoid cutting ethical corners and to maintain transparency in areas such as contact tracing. </p><p>Others have noted the rise of the \u201cbio-surveillance state\u201d. In China and South Korea, tech companies are playing a critical role in facilitating quarantines and mobility restrictions. This includes distributing QR codes via apps that assign colour codes determining quarantine status, based on factors such as travel history, time spent in infectious areas and relationships to virus-carriers. This has prompted allegations of inaccurate ratings and stigmatisation of the ill. </p><p>The speed of China\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown cannot easily be disentangled from a techno-surveillance infrastructure that also allows the tracking of political dissidents and minority groups. </p><p>In the west, concerns have already been raised over the increased participation of tech companies in managing hospital data. A recent report found that 33 of the 50 US-based hospitals examined were working with Amazon, Google or Microsoft, but without standardised and open rules over data protection management. Hospitals cited cyber security concerns as the reason for not sharing such details with an investigation led by STAT, a subsidiary of the Boston Globe newspaper. </p><p>In the consumer healthcare space, surreptitious data-sharing has been widespread; one review of medicine-related apps on the Android mobile platform found 79 per cent of those sampled shared user data with third parties including advertising companies, private equity firms and credit agencies. </p><p>Covid-19 has prompted an expansion of state power in healthcare that is a long way from over. These changes are helping tech companies and data innovators play a greater role in service delivery. Much will depend on whether regulators roll back the reforms once the pandemic is over.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Many have already risen to the challenge and rightfully grabbed headlines. Meanwhile, there are others that we may have taken for granted, like Internet and technology companies, but their contributions are unmistakable. They have provided crucial services and lifelines for all of us in isolation, and they\u2019ve done so even though they\u2019ve long received many lawmakers\u2019 ire.</p><p><br/>Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, officials at all levels of government sought to burden Internet technology companies with regulations and/or break up their businesses. However, in many ways, these companies have made life in quarantine more bearable, helped prevent the economy from coming to a complete standstill, and have even provided a foundation for fighting COVID-19. Government regulators should remember this and understand that had their plans for tech companies come to fruition, these firms wouldn\u2019t have had the capacity to adequately provide their important services.<br/>We have heard over and over again that social distancing is one of the best tools we have to combat the coronavirus, but humans are social creatures used to interaction and a constant flow of information. In any other era, the solitude of extreme social distancing would have been even more jarring and devastating than it currently is, but modern Americans enjoy a few benefits that lessen the pain of quarantine.<br/>With social media platforms, we can stay in touch, see photos, know what\u2019s going on in our family and friend\u2019s lives, and social media can even connect us to news sources. Search engines serve as a conduit to endless sources of information\u2013\u2013both taking our minds off of the pandemic but also providing us with valuable news about it\u2013\u2013while simultaneously removing dangerous misinformation. [1]<br/>Even in a pandemic, Americans can go shopping and purchase necessities and luxuries without ever leaving the couch. Using app-based services, we can have meals from our favorite restaurants brought to our doors, groceries delivered to our homes, and Amazon\u2019s massive marketplace allows us to buy just about anything we want.<br/>When so-called nonessential employees and other workers were directed to stay home, technology made it possible for many of us to keep working. Video conferencing software enables face-to-face meetings; various platforms help teams collaborate in real time; and smartphones allow us to receive work messages from almost anywhere.<br/>Indeed, Internet technologies are playing a profound role in the global effort to stop COVID-19. Putting aside many companies\u2019 direct philanthropic efforts, communication technologies enable telemedicine, and they connect healthcare professionals around the world, allowing them to share data in real-time and effectively respond to the outbreak.<br/>Google Trends\u00a0has become a research platform for epidemiologists [2]; Microsoft is offering massive\u00a0computing power [3]\u00a0for modeling the ACE2 receptor that the coronavirus targets; and Amazon\u2019s logistics permit the company to focus on\u00a0delivering essential goods [4]\u00a0and serving critical health needs.<br/>Most poignant are the many\u00a0stories [5]\u00a0of\u00a0families and friends [6]\u00a0who have been present, via a computer or phone screen, with their ailing loved ones as they passed away from COVID-19. As devastating as these stories are\u2014and they are devastating\u2014it must be remembered that without technology, these last moments could not have been shared at all.<br/>To say that these innovations make us fully prepared for a pandemic would be absurd, but we are certainly better able to handle a world in isolation because of the Internet. Given all of this, it is astounding to realize that not long-ago some\u00a0federal [7]\u00a0and state government officials fixed their sights on tech companies with the intention of either breaking them up or limiting their abilities to innovate.<br/>Had nanny-state government officials gotten their way (and unfortunately, they still might), then they would be the architects of another kind of disaster. Lawmakers are not equipped to pass laws at the rate of Internet technology development and often choose solutions not suited to future problems.<br/>Many proposed regulations would be destructive on large and small companies alike. In fact, burgeoning firms and startups continually fight off rules and red tape that would likely shut them down. These tech businesses have clearly proven their merit in this crisis. In fact, in these strange times, the Internet and technology companies play an important role that needs to be encouraged, not cut down.<br/>Endnotes<br/>\u201cwhile simultaneously removing dangerous

I would call for a comprehensive system of governance that can cover the whole process from beginning to end.</p><p>Her team had assessed at least 84 sets of ethics guidelines for AI, she said, and most seemed to converge around a few basic principles, including transparency, fairness and safety. A lot of good work has been done on the principles to apply, the foundations.

Governments cant do it without them, but there is an incredible concentration of power in the hands of only a few players, she pointed out.

Media and journalism is affected both ways: negatively and positively. Hence the pandemic impact on media is going to be far bigger than on many other professions. With most of the population staying home to prevent the virus spreading, the consumption of news increased. So demand on the commodity produced by journalists is up and mainstream media has regained some of the ground it lost to so-called social media and 'influencers'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, the consumption vehicle changed as people became more and more stuck with their smart phones and computers. Newspapers are under immense pressure to sustain the business, not only due sharp drop in circulation but due to rapidly declining advertising revenue. Lockdown measures recommended by authorities to protect public health left many businesses temporarily closed and of course these won't advertise.</p><p> At a time of high news consumption, actual producers of news are not making any gains; ironically they're losing. These losses can have detrimental effects on the future of media and journalism.  -</p><p>Moreover, those advertising are asking media outlets to avoid putting their advertisements on stories related to coronavirus in their websites \u2014 at least that's an issue in UK for example. That again means far less ads with almost all media coverage now related to coronavirus.</p><p>At a time of high news consumption, actual producers of news are not making any gains; ironically they're losing. These losses can have detrimental effects on the future of media and journalism. Supposedly, authorities and public alike now acknowledge the essential need of media and journalism \u2014 not only to deliver the right message but also to fight against harmful fabrications of other sources like the so-called social media. That acknowledgement need to be translated into actions, first and foremost of these actions is to consider media and journalism a 'public asset'.</p><p>Not necessarily providing grants and financial aid to it, like other businesses deemed essential for the 'public good' but at least to fend it against harsh regulations that pushes it to extinction. And as a 'public asset', media and journalism requires protection and a guarantee against monopoly and hegemony of the vehicles disseminating the content it produces.</p><p>How Australia fought tech giants</p><p>Australia became the first country to force big tech like Google and Facebook to share advertising revenue with local media. Australia's finance minister said the move comes after talks with Facebook and Alphabet (parent company of Google) \"failed to yield a voluntary code to address complaints by domestic media players that the tech giants have too tight a grip on advertising, their main source of income\".</p><p>In fact, media is not begging for help or 'charitable donations' from big tech and needs governments to make that happen. Those big techs benefiting extensively from the lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic are actually making their excessive gains by carrying the product of media and journalists \u2014 in one way or another.</p><p>Also in UK, there're rising calls to increase windfall tax on big tech and use the money to 'invest' in media and journalism. The largest body representing media professionals, National Union of Journalists (NUJ), asked the government to raise the current 2 per cent windfall tax on major tech companies (with more than half a billion pound revenue) to 6 per cent. NUJ stresses that the need is not to 'grant' the money from that tax on their profits to journalists or media, but rather use it as investment.</p><p>Why journalism should be supported</p><p>Journalists are also asking to be considered among those eligible for some government measure to help those hurt by the impact of the pandemic, like soft loans or temporary waiver of some taxes for example.</p><p>That suggestion, sharing some of the excess profit big tech is making from the current circumstances, is a viable one to support media and journalism in these difficult times. It also establishes the foundation for future fair and just relationship between producers and distributors of content.</p><p>Some of the habits developed during the pandemic will stay with us, and one of these could be the change in the way we consume news: less print and more digital. Current regulations favour the distribution vehicle over the actual worker, and here government intervention is logical if media and journalism is to be preserved. No argument here against 'free market' or 'fair play', but just a regulation for a just relationship if mutual benefit.</p><p>more on media<br/><br/>COVID-19: Will newspapers survive the coronavirus crisis?  <br/>COVID-19: Is traditional media showing the way again?  <br/>Coronavirus threatens press freedom  <br/>Why Google and Facebook must pay local journalism  </p><p>Also talking about media and journalism as a 'public asset' doesn't mean 'nationalisation' of media, but rather a favourable regulation that takes into account keeping the 'professional' ring of the full chain.</p><p>Of course, there're other suggestions to preserve media and journalism and help it through current crisis, but the one that might be more durable is that complementary relationship between media and big tech. or at least, that's what I think.</p><p>\u2014 Dr Ahmed Mustafa is a UAE-based journalist.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/59/158840642525.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/59/158840642525.jpeg</url></p><p>20190131_lebanese_newspaper<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-173619241</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT9-MH61-F11P-X4BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-it-insane-to-start-a-business-during-coronavirus-millions-of-americans-dont-think-so-11601092841\"> recent</url>US data shows that applications for the employer identification numbers needed to start new businesses are up 18.5 per cent this year compared with 2019. Many of these new enterprises will fail, of course \u2014 most do. If historical trends hold, this <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ca8d0cb-48e5-4c99-b4ea-ac60b47344b9\"> Schumpeterian creative destruction</url> will leave the economic landscape very different after Covid-19.</p><p>Start with the new businesses. There\u2019s no tally of the type of enterprises being set up, but it\u2019s a fair bet that many will be highly digital. They are likely to hold a large chunk of value in intangible assets such as research and development, brands, content, data, patents or human capital, rather than in physical assets such as industrial machinery, factories or office space. </p><p>That was certainly the case during the financial crisis. Between 2007 and 2009, the share of intangible assets as a proportion of total fixed investment spending rose by 7.5 per cent, according to an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carlyle.com/global-insights/when-the-future-arrives-early-thomas\"> analysis</url> by the Carlyle Group. Its report, which looks at the fallout of Covid-19 on business models, predicts that spending on intangibles may rise by 11 per cent over the next couple of years, as the work from home revolution erodes the importance of physical assets.</p><p>So far so good, for knowledge workers, or those starting an asset-light business. But intangible assets are also associated with jobless recoveries. Over the past 20 years, the shift from a tangible to an intangible economy has, to put it quite simply, allowed employers and businesses to do more with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2083406-ee83-11e8-89c8-d36339d835c0\"> fewer workers.</url></p><p>If education levels in the US were higher, workers laid off during this pandemic might be better able to adapt to the new landscape, and use new technologies to enhance their own productivity and employability. But training is not a quick fix. </p><p>\u201cPast increases in the intangible share of corporate outlays have been associated with slower recoveries in employment,\u201d Carlyle writes. \u201cIf that relationship holds this cycle, a return to full employment in the US may be much further off than the late 2021 or 2022 recovery\u201d in gross domestic product.</p><p>The continued rise of intangible assets has implications for investors too. Commonly used metrics like \u201cbook value\u201d, the ratio of share price to a company\u2019s productive assets, were often used by \u201cvalue\u201d seekers to assess which companies might be over- or underpriced. Stocks with the lowest price-to-book ratios were expected to outperform those with the highest ratios. </p><p>But current accounting rules do not allow internally generated intangible assets to be recorded on balance sheets as capital. That means this metric has lost much of its meaning. Or the meaning has shifted. Today, a high price-to-book ratio might signal not an overpriced stock, but one that has a lot of the sort of intellectual property and software that have retained their value amid Covid-19. </p><p>In a pandemic, it is better to own a company built on customer data than one with bricks and mortar retail outlets. Indeed, it may turn out to be smarter to own companies rich in intangible assets from any sector rather than bet on the Big Tech companies that have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9678c481-52e0-45e0-8610-a49b33aeec45\"> driving the S&amp;P 500</url>. This will be particularly true if <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06ad9abe-73aa-44f7-b1fe-08dc16854610\"> regulators</url> begin to pick apart the business models of Facebook, Google and the like.</p><p>Finally, coronavirus-related digital shifts may put a lot more downward pressure on pricing power than expected, according to Robert Kaplan, head of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank. In a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/kaplan/2020/rsk200929\"> essay</url> on US economic conditions and monetary policy in the wake of the pandemic, he noted how people\u2019s work and shopping habits have changed. They are doing more online, which allows digital platforms to grow bigger, and this in turn has damped business pricing power.</p><p>\u201cTo respond to this trend, businesses are investing substantially more in technology to replace people, lower their costs and improve their competitiveness,\u201d he wrote.</p><p>That in turn may shift how we should think about monetary policy. Mr Kaplan dissented from the Federal Reserve\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48301cef-ba80-4345-b706-9492ba6d717f\"> recent decision</url> to keep the federal funds rate target unchanged at zero to 0.25 per cent. The deflationary effect of the digital revolution, he said, \u201cmay well offset the cyclical inflationary impact of a tightening job market\u201d. </p><p>Translation? Even after we are ultimately out of the Covid-19 woods, the changing nature of our digital economy may mean that we simply do not get as much inflation as we think. Some people believe that\u2019s an argument for keeping rates at zero or even lower, for longer \u2014 if we aren\u2019t at risk of overheating, why worry? Despite\u00a0his view that acceleration of the digital economy will have some muting effect on inflationary forces, Mr Kaplan worries that a prolonged period of zero rates can encourage excess risk taking.\u00a0</p><p>There are also plenty of academics and policymakers who believe that loose monetary policy has become an economic morphine drip that carries more risk than reward. Indeed, that\u2019s a common theme in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/finance-and-investment/the-financial-system_d45f979e-en\"> new book</url> on the lessons learned about financial fragility between 2008 and today, by the OECD\u2019s New Approaches to Economics Challenges initiative. </p><p>Bottom line \u2014 the cure for the coronavirus economy carries new risks of its own.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Rana Foroohar with\u00a0</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/rana-foroohar\"> myFT</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00a0and on\u00a0</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RanaForoohar\">Twitter</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article has been amended to clarify Robert Kaplan\u2019s views on inflation</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-4a1da405b4524e4fadb8c44afb9163d0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610D-BD41-DXP9-935Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 4, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0006377</classCode><className>CARLYLE GROUP LP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC6799 INVESTORS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>CG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The Report considers the future of AI in the UK, from perceived opportunities to risks and challenges. In addition to scoping the legal and regulatory landscape, the Report considers the role of AI in a social and economic context, and proposes a set of ethical guidelines. </p><p>This blog post sets out those ethical guidelines and summarises some of the key features of the Report. Ethical AI The ethical use of AI is central to the Report, with the five key principles for a cross-sector ethical AI code: Artificial intelligence should be developed for the common good and benefit of humanity. Artificial intelligence should operate on principles of intelligibility and fairness. Artificial intelligence should not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families or communities. All citizens have the right to be educated to enable them to flourish mentally, emotionally and economically alongside artificial intelligence. The autonomous power to hurt, destroy or deceive human beings should never be vested in artificial intelligence.The Report suggest that, in the short-term, this AI code is more appropriate than legislation, even if the Committee does not rule out that regulation in the future. Access to Data One of the key concerns set out in the Report is that all companies should have 'fair and reasonable access to data'. The Committee notes the possibility that the 'Big Tech' companies may use network effects to build up large proprietary datasets which are difficult to match. In response, the Committee suggests ethical, data protection and competition frameworks, including a review of the use of data by the Competition and Markets Authority. Healthcare and AI The Report notes that the current fragmented cooperation between the National Health Service (NHS) and AI developers risks undervaluing the wealth of information held by the NHS. To avoid this, the Report calls for a framework for sharing appropriately anonymised NHS data to be created. Patients should be made aware of the potential use of their data, and given the opportunity to opt-out. Recognised as elements pivotal to the use of AI in healthcare are the acceptance by the public of AI being used in their treatment, the use of patient data, the NHS being equipped to deploy new technology and AI-trained staff. Criminal misuse of AI A further concern set out is that AI could be used to cause harm, for example by facilitating cyber-attacks or data sabotage. The Report invites the UK Cabinet Office to address this risk in its Cyber Security Science ...chnology Strategy, and urges further research on necessary protection mechanisms. Other key take-aways In addition to the ethical questions and competition concerns identified, the Report also addresses further issues that may shape the future of AI in the UK.First, the Report recognises that legal liability and accountability requires clarification. In particular, referring to the potential for AI to cause harm in the event of a malfunction, underperformance or an erroneous decision, the Committee urges the UK Law Commission to ensure that these risks are adequately addressed.Second, the Committee calls on industry to develop voluntary mechanisms to inform consumers when AI is used to make significant or sensitive decisions that affect them.Third, the Report warns that the current focus on deep learning technologies may lead to under exploitation of other AI opportunities, and calls on the Government and universities to support diverse AI research.Finally, the Report discusses increasing the number of visas available for people with valuable skills in AI-related areas, inclusion of the ethical design and use of AI technology in school curriculums, and retraining initiatives in the job market. What to expect next There is a lot of political and regulatory focus on AI, not only in the UK but throughout Europe and the world. The Report is just one piece in a larger puzzle. The European Commission'sCommunication on 'Artificial Intelligence for Europe'[6], will be addressed elsewhere on this blog, and French President Macron recently announced investments of nearly EUR 1.5 billion in AI technology by the end of 2022.The UK Government will develop various policy initiatives and new legislation in response to the Report.Franka Felsner contributed to this article. 2018 Covington ...rling LLP [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/laura-corbett\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/laura-corbett</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/miranda-cole\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/miranda-cole</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/organization/covington-burling-llp\">https://www.natlawreview.com/organization/covington-burling-llp</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.covcompetition.com\">http://www.covcompetition.com</url>/ [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldai/100/100.pdf\">https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldai/100/100.pdf</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-artificial-intelligence-europe\">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-artificial-intelligence-europe</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NTLR1207091525192252251251762100255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTLR-120709</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S78-8F31-JCMN-Y35B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><timeReceived>4:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>National Law Review</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 1, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Communications, Media Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Global</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Initiative &amp;

That's one scenario experts are pondering in the wake of multiple consumer health portfolios being put up for sale last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pfizer, maker of non-Rx brands such as ChapStick and Advil, and Merck KGaA, the German drugmaker with a stable of smaller products, both announced intentions to shop their consumer health lines, fueling speculation about who could step up to buy them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If that buyer turns out to be a consumer goods expert, we could be talking about something more than a mere reshuffling of the over-the-counter (OTC) goods deck.</p><p>Both of these pharma companies reportedly have seen interest from other pharma giants, as well as from smaller companies looking for specific products to fill out their own portfolios. Consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies, too, are becoming more strategic in tailoring their portfolios, points out Dave Wendland, VP of strategic relations at Hamacher Resource Group, an advisory to consumer healthcare companies.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/technology/experts-say-pharmas-move-to-snapchat-is-in-the-making/article/684720/\">Experts say pharma's move to Snapchat is in the making</url></p><p>Should one of them take more of a stake in consumer health, the move wouldn't come completely out of left field. Non-pharma names such as Procter &amp; Gamble are already in the space, and others are eyeing an entrance. For example, Reuters reported Nestl\u00e9 has been named as a prospective buyer for Merck KGaA's OTC portfolio, along with generics maker Perrigo and the private equity owners of German drugmaker Stada.</p><p>Wendland offers another possibility: Kellogg Company. Known to most people as a maker of breakfast cereals - and sugary ones at that - Kellogg in October moved smoothly into nutritionals with the purchase of protein-bar maker Rx Bars for $600 million.</p><p>\"I feel this is part of a bigger movement and will potentially lead to the introduction of such high-fiber, high-protein options to patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes,\" he predicts.</p><p>Of course, there'd be more regulatory hoops to jump through for that kind of health drive in an era when regulators are tightening rules related to the health claims on food and drinks. \"At one time, you could slap 'heart healthy' on just about anything without any worries. Now, the FDA considers that more of a health claim,\" notes Wendland.</p><p>Nevertheless, newly minted Kellogg CEO Steven Cahillane brings a strong history in the health and wellness market. His former company, Nature's Bounty, is a global maker of vitamins, nutritional supplements, and other consumer health and beauty products.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/at-work-with/how-lauren-schulz-is-shaping-dr-reddys-otc-brands-like-doans/article/686770/\">How Lauren Schulz is shaping Dr. Reddy's OTC brands</url></p><p>As Kellogg looks to cash in on the trend toward healthier snacks, big food is going in the same direction as big tech. Companies such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft have flexed their relationships with consumers to push ever more deeply into health.</p><p>Retailers including Walgreens Boots Alliance have also sought to do so by empowering consumers with self-directed tools and the guidance necessary to make health-related decisions.</p><p>\"These are big moves,\" says Wendland, who sees parallels between search engines pivoting to become health information hubs and retailers looking to become integrated health providers.</p><p>Meanwhile, all of the above hasn't been lost on marketers. Healthcare agencies have restructured to be in a better position to win more health and wellness business. And when it comes to padding out their consumer-health holdings, don't count big pharma out of the running just yet.</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline has expressed interest in Pfizer's consumer health business, which may well point to a strategic vision in that it follows first a joint venture and then an asset swap with Novartis. The two companies formed the GSK Consumer Healthcare joint venture in 2014. (In March 2018, GSK will have the option of buying out Novartis' shares in that partnership, and there have been some indications it plans to do so.)</p><p>It was the following year that GSK traded its oncology business in exchange for Novartis' vaccine line. Although GSK suffered in the immediate aftermath of the swap, then-CEO Andrew Witty told investors at the time that the company's oncology business stood to benefit from Novartis' distribution reach.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/campaigns/pfizer-campaign-aims-to-keep-boomers-healthy/article/710051/\">Pfizer campaign aims to keep boomers healthy</url></p><p>Other companies that have sniffed around the Pfizer unit include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sanofi, and Reckitt Benckiser. The latter is forming two units in its consumer health operations: RB Health, which will focus on OTC, and RB Hygiene Home, which will handle cleaning and laundry brands.</p><p>During Reckitt's Q3 earnings call, Rakesh Kapoor, the CEO of Reckitt Benckiser who will also lead RB Health, touted his company's ambition to be a \"global leader in consumer health and the only one really focused on the broader consumer health market beyond just [OTC] medicines.\"</p><p>And then there's Sanofi, which acquired OTC health firm Chattem several years back and stands as one example of a pharma company that seems quite happy with its consumer health assets.</p><p>Wendland describes Chattem as \"a bellwether\" for Sanofi. \"Evidenced by their most recent Rx-to-OTC launches, Sanofi has an eye toward additional growth opportunity within consumer health,\" he says.</p><p>Sanofi's consumer-health entrance dates back to its 2010 acquisition of Chattem for $1.9 billion. At that time, Chattem employed 580 people and was a $500 million per year business. The company, which has since rebranded under the Sanofi name, employs 825 people and expects to generate $1.5 billion in gross revenues in 2017. This past year, the company bulked up its consumer health portfolio, exchanging Sanofi's animal health business for Boehringer Ingelheim's consumer healthcare unit.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/campaigns/pfizer-bolsters-eucrisa-launch-with-two-dtc-campaigns/article/704738/\">Pfizer bolsters Eucrisa launch with two DTC campaigns</url></p><p>All things considered, one would be hard-pressed to conclude the impending sale of two consumer healthcare units is in some way a harbinger that big pharma is fleeing the space. A more careful tailoring and targeting may actually be what is happening.</p><p>Consider the recent partnership between Bayer and Walgreens, in which Bayer's hydraSense line of nasal care products will be sold exclusively through the pharmacy chain. This is a classic case of partnering to take advantage of each other's strengths, with Bayer leaning on Walgreens for its marketing reach.</p><p>\"Pharma companies are realizing where their strengths are,\" explains Wendland.</p><p>Pfizer and Merck may simply be recognizing where their own strengths lie as they consider divesting their OTC lines. Nevertheless, if Nestl\u00e9 and Kellogg find that their marketing reach is a good match for these consumer health product lines, we may see a sea change in this sector.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MMMHUS-719520</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MMMHUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RC4-Y4V1-F16T-Y16C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">355070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Haymarket Media.

My name is Josh Resnik, and I'm the publisher of CQ Roll Call, as well as the emcee for today's event. </p><p>Before we kick off the discussion, I'd like to take a moment to set the stage for this evenings dialogue. Today, we live in a world of rapid change. Every industry is going through turbulence and transformation, largely driven by technology, but also by political and governmental changes as well, and finances is clearly not immune. Technological changes are upending the industry. Today, we call those changes by the collective name of FinTech. But as Georgetown's own Professor Chris Brummer has said many times, in 5 or 10 years what is now called FinTech will simply be the new world of finance. </p><p>At CQ Roll Call for the past 75 years, our publications have been leaders in unbiased, nonpartisan, legislative, and regulatory analysis. And now, in partnership with Professor Brummer, we're launching new coverage of FinTech's technological and regulatory impacts. We'll be teaming up with regulators, academics, and industry leaders to elevate the public's understanding of modern finance. We've been excited to partner with Professor Brummer on this coverage, including our new podcast, FinTech Beat, which went live on Apple today. And we're also delighted to be partnering with Georgetown Law School and the Institute of International Economic Law on tonight's event. </p><p>So let's dive in and get started with our panel. Professor Brummer will be moderating tonight's discussion. In addition to being a professor here at Georgetown, as well as the co-founder of FinTech Beat, Chris is also a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Subcommittee on Virtual Currencies and a member of the Consultative Working Group for the European Securities and Markets Authority's Financial Innovation Standing Committee. </p><p>We're fortunate to have some of FinTech's leading experts joining us on our panel this evening. So please join me in welcoming Brad Carr, senior director of Digital Finance at the Institute of International Finance. Brad leads the IIF's analysis on technology and innovation issues, including data regulations, reg tech, cloud, and distributed ledger technology, and the IIF's studies on the adoption of machine learning within the financial sector. </p><p>Next, we have Amy Kim, chief policy officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Prior to joining the chamber, Amy advised financial institutions, blockchain-based companies, marketplace lenders, investors, and innovators regarding compliance obligations under financial services laws. </p><p>Our third panelist is Tim Swanson, founder and director of Research at Post Oak Labs. Tim is currently an advisor to Elm Labs, Clear Maddox, and Bloxier (SP), and was an advisor to Hyperledger. </p><p>Please join me in welcoming our panelists and CQ Roll Call and Georgetown's own Chris Brummer to the stage. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BRUMMER: So thank you so much. Afterwards, we're going to have a--a brief opportunity for a--a Q&amp;A, both with our panelists, and also, obviously, for our--our--our keynote discussion later. </p><p>There's nothing like having an event after alcohol and having some introductory drinks. And hopefully, this will--will help to get the most forthright and interesting conversation from all of our panelists. </p><p>RESNIK: We--we didn't get to do the drinking though. </p><p>BRUMMER: Oh, yeah. Well, fortunately, I did. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We prepared the audience for us. </p><p>BRUMMER: I guess that's the most important thing. </p><p>So I guess I'll start with--with you, Tim. You know, some of the biggest news recently, particularly when you're talking about cryptocurrencies, and stable coins, and new applications for distributed ledger technology, has come from the entrance of new kinds of players but they're new familiar players, particularly big tech, and big finance with this announcement, both by JP Morgan and Facebook, that they are entering into this space. And there's a--a lot of talk and a lot of buzz about this really reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Maybe, could you sort of help walk us through what exactly are the kinds of things that they're looking to do and--and why is it that they're interested in--in blockchain technologies more generally? </p><p>SWANSON: A quick question, who's--who works for JP Morgan, anyone here or Facebook. All right. </p><p>So yeah, the two that I guess I'll mention, and thanks for that, are JPM Coin. I know it's been mis-characterized by some calling it Diamond Coin, and some people aren't excited about it. That's fine. You don't have to be excited about it. I'm not here to shill--shill the coin or anything like that. But what--what's--what's--the reason why JPM Coin was created is--is a means to an end. They needed a way internally, or on this--this network that they created called IIN, they needed a way to--to effectively settle these different instruments that they may have created on behalf of whatever participants on the network, rather than having to rely on the outside, effectively the settlement rails that takes three to five days. So if you have unchained cash then you can provide effectively instant settlement and therefore, get rid of the--this locked up capital. </p><p>For example, if you look at the nostro vostro accounts globally, as an aggregate in the world, it's like $9-$10 trillion of capital is sitting there at any given time. So, you know, obviously, JPM Coin's not going to revolutionize that entire-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --So let me just--just--just jump in, just to make--make sure. </p><p>SWANSON: Sure. </p><p>BRUMMER: So what you're basically saying is, JP Morgan has customers. They need to service those customers. And by creating a new kind of rail they're able to allow some of their existing customers to settle their transactions faster. Or is it--is it faster? Is it supposed to be more--more--better security? You know, what--what is it that creating JPM Coin does that an Excel sheet wouldn't be able to do? </p><p>SWANSON: Sure. So that's a great question. As it of this--as it of this moment, in June, it looks like the you know, you could have an Excel--Excel chain, if you will, that would be just as effective because you're effectively relying on that one participant. In theory, though, the--the goal for them long-term is to enable other participants to potentially validate transactions on the network or even open to the network to--to other--other networks. In fact, the long-term goal for them, my understanding, is for them to--to actually allow retail participants and not just wholesale interaction. </p><p>So again, it's a means to an end. It's kind of, I hate calling it boring inter-bank related activity, but it is. It's--it's not something that you and I as--as its consumers would probably ever touch in the next couple years. Whereas, the Facebook phenomenon, which you were kind of mentioning, I believe, since they've taken all their data, now he wants to take all of money. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So for what it's worth, Facebook Coin, they--they're supposed to do some announcement, I think, on the 18th or so when they review all the information and until then, we can only speculate based on what we've heard. But what we've heard so far is it's going to be some--like a basket of--of currencies, kind of like an SDR, which is a basket of--of four or five different major currencies. So it's kind of a stable coin. We've heard that maybe the network participants are going to be charged up to $10 million to run nodes. So the--the model is very different than JPM--JPM Coin, which is kind of a means to an end for the--its customers and counter-parties, whereas Facebook Coin sounds like it's, or sorry, Global Coin I think is what they call it, is going to be, supposedly, for--for remittance market, for participants who are--for--for the billion plus users that they have to move money across borders. </p><p>BRUMMER: So ultimately, we're talking about two very different financial products, if we are to believe current reports. That on the one hand, you have Facebook, which is apparently going to leverage some of its messaging for its retail-ish people, normal people. And then you have Facebook Coin, which is looking to, at least immediately, service institutional investors and to service those institutional investors by establishing a--a new rail, a new means of transacting cross border. But I guess both of them have a cross border feel to it, right? I mean, because JP Morgan, I'm guessing, has lots of different banks and then you have Facebook, which has--is going to lever this messaging system for all of its billions of users. </p><p>And I will get to, for that question, Brad. Maybe if you could maybe elaborate some of what you've heard or--or thought about in terms of these new financial products or stable coins-- </p><p>CARR: --Sure-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --and--and also, any kinds of immediately or immediate regulatory questions (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>CARR: So I think, firstly, you know, if I can distinguish another model as well, and that's that of--of MUFG Coin, which I think is probably the most advanced of the--the prototypes we've seen around the world, whereas the JPM Coin is targeted in the--the wholesale sector. It's about, you know, it's the settlement of transactions for--for corporate counter-parties, whereas MUFG Coin is a lot more retail oriented. Yet MUFG's own marketing is that if you go to Tokyo for the Olympics next year you'll be paying for your meals around town with--with MUFG Coin. </p><p>You know, that notion is more one of its trying to modernize a retail payment or point of sale transaction. It's essentially enabling you to have tokens of some sort on your phone and paying with those as an alternative to cash. And the Bank of Canada prototype for a--a central bank digital currency, is essentially working towards the same sort of model. So you've got a few different variances there. </p><p>The--the scenario that--that I came up against on the JP Morgan one is, that I think is going to get really interesting is, so what happens when you end up with one bank holding another banks coin? You know, if--if, let's say Citibank is holding a JPM Coin, is that equivalent to holding JPM senior debt in terms of the credit risk profile? Or is it considered to be cash back because it's reserved? Are you convinced of the--the stable coin fixing? Or do you start to say, \"Well, actually, this is a different kind of risk profile?\" And then similarly, if a customer is given JPM dollars and getting JPM coins back, you know, from a--a ledgers perspective of--of how you assess that counter-party risk, are you knitting the--the dollars and the coins? </p><p>So you've got a few things there that--that I think are all manageable issues, but are ones that, in terms of the prudential framework, you'd need to work through which of those and establish whether or not this is essentially considered equivalent to, you know, coins and bank notes under the existing prudential framework. </p><p>BRUMMER: That's--that's--that's interesting. One of the things that I--I noticed when you travel, obviously, to different international regulatory fores (SP), how people look at it, particularly a stable coin, but also any kind of cryptocurrency depends on where they're coming from. So for those who may not be as familiar with the stable coin, they're called stable coins because they're--they're presumably pegged or reference to a--a certain basket, or perhaps even the U.S. dollar and they're not intended to fluctuate. And the way in which you can create that stability is--is varied at least. </p><p>CARR: Yep. Right. </p><p>BRUMMER: And--and some of those ways can be just a straight peg or they could be algorithmic activities. </p><p>CARR: So--so if--so if you're a regulator trying to work out a prudential treatment that you're going to apply to this, one of the questions you'd need to establish is, you know, are you convinced of the--the peg? Or is this something that, you know, okay, it's fixed today but it may--may well not be in the future? </p><p>And to segue a little from the commercial bank tokens, you know, one piece we've--we've heard and we've corroborated in a few different places, is that the People's Bank of China has been developing a digital currency that would not be fixed against the renminbi. Now, there's a whole host of questions then that come to--to buy with that. You know, is that intended to segregate inward and outward capital flows away from the other currency? Is it something that's intended as a means of a--being a trade--international trade currency, or trade finance currency? Will Chinese industrialist in 10 years time insist that they're only going to pay you in--in digital renminbi instead of in dollars? </p><p>You know, there's a whole stack of questions that come about there for something that presumably would be, you know, somewhat stable, not entirely volatile. Presumably, the PBOC would have an interest in ensuring that that currency is--is not wildly fluctuating day to day and it retains some of its value, but it would not be fixed against the renminbi in that example. </p><p>BRUMMER: And-- </p><p>CARR: --Yep. So if I can make one more point. And well, you referred to Facebook, and you referred to the different treatments and definitions around the world. You know, the scenario I find really fascinating is, you know, are yourselves going to have individuals giving Facebook dollars in order to buy Facebook coins, or whatever it's called? When we get around and--and have the conversations with central bankers and regulators around the world, and we talk about, you know, \"Would you view the entrance of a big tech firm into finance?\" </p><p>You know, at what point do you start regulating them in the same way that you regulate a bank or an insurer or what? And quite a lot of central bankers will say, or supervisors will say that the tripwire is when they start taking deposits. And--and for that reason, a lot of them have--have steered clear of anything that could look like a deposit taking activity. But if individuals are putting their money into Facebook and being given Facebook coins, as a result, that starts to look a bit like a deposit. </p><p>KIM: Although it could too, I mean, what we've seen historically, not--is that, you know, it could just be money transmitters, too if they're not actually taking a deposit but offering a--a receiving to transmit on to another location. Now you see companies like Microsoft and others that have already received their licenses to be money transferred, a financial institution, but just a--a different than deposit taking financial institution. So there could be--it'll be interesting to see how that plays out in this scenario. </p><p>CARR: It's got a lot, perhaps, about the--the timing of the transactions and--and you know, whether or not consumers are being encouraged to, you know, deposit for some put--deposit, invest a--a chunk of money for some period for these tokens that they can then redeem in due course, and whether they're incentivize by coupons or discounts or somewhere else that--that starts to look a little bit like interest, or whether it's that you're just buying the tokens each time that you need them for the--the transaction, which would look more of a--a money transfer (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>KIM: Well, yeah, it will be interesting to see how it plays out because it could also be prepaid access. If you, you know, put $100 in and then you can use that-- </p><p>CARR: --Yeah-- </p><p>KIM: --use on the platform. </p><p>CARR: Yeah. </p><p>KIM: It will be interesting (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CARR: Maybe we'll find out on June 18 or--or maybe it'll be quite a long time after that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, I know that Amy has actually taken a keen interest in the upcoming G20 conversations, not just, you know, the--the very question of--of money transmission has to do in part, and it depends on which state you're talking about. Money transmitter laws are--are largely state-based in the United States and they have to deal with some safety and soundness issues with individual money transmitters, and you have to sort of get a license and the like. When you get to the federal level, where you're not necessarily asking about money transmission, per se, but you're concerned about market integrity, money laundering, and the other issues that are sort of embedded in the flow of money, those kinds of issues start to take on an international dimension as well. And--and Amy, I know you've been very, very involved in thinking through some of the money laundering issues, and some of the approaches taken by international regulatory authorities. </p><p>We'll be having a conversation, obviously, about the European approach and--and differences between EU and--and U.S. regulators a bit later. But there does seem to be more coordination, or at least it's--it's higher on the--on the to-do-list is--is the--is the money laundering AML question. </p><p>Where--where is--what is the state of things? What do you predict in terms of new rules and new approaches coming out from the G20? </p><p>KIM: Yeah. Well, I mean, just to start to kind of for context, I mean, certainly, you know, Bitcoin being the first iteration of blockchain that we've seen. It was a peer-to-peer payment system that's triggered financial services concerns, so that's--and--and financial services regulatory concerns, whether it's a JP Morgan coin or securities laws or, you know, anti-money laundering. That's why we've seen a lot of headwinds, I think, in the financial services space and how do they apply? </p><p>The U.S. was a--a front runner, I think, in--in addressing that in 2013, with Treasury issuing their guidance, which determined that the exchangers and administrators in this space were money transmitters, and therefore, money's a type of financial institution, the money services business in the U.S. So then that's the U.S. Federal perspective and then what you're referencing is the FATF, the Financial Action Task Force is an inner governmental body, that puts out recommendations with respect to anti-money laundering that about 200 countries then, you know, trickle down and implement in their host country. </p><p>So what they're looking at now is, you know, in October, they created a concept called Virtual Assets, which is, I think, maybe the first time I've ever seen it called Virtual Assets by a government or governmental type body, and then applied the--certain of the AML recommendations that they make to what they're calling virtual assets service providers. So that raises a couple of questions. I mean, first of all, I'm sure we all know, virtual assets can actually be a pretty broad category. These aren't all financial instruments and-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --They're not all cryptocurrencies, necessarily. </p><p>KIM: Right. I mean, typically, like we've seen in the U.S., you've dealt with it as a--a--a substitute for funds or currency, you know, more like a substitute for money. Their definition goes a little bit beyond that, and it says, you know, use for payment or investment. And, you know, as we're seeing in the securities dynamic, what's--an investment can be blurred, or you could--some people can view it as an investment and some people could be using it as on a platform, which I think is a whole other thing we can all debate about, maybe at a another time. </p><p>But and so, so that kind of argument is going on, where does that fit? And there's one in particular that's going on right now, that's a bit of a hot topic for some, which is how to apply this with respect to a very specific wire transfer rule, which applies for transfers between financial institutions of $3,000 or more? In that case, you would have to obtain certain information about both the person originating the payment and the person receiving it. And so if you think about that in a blockchain context, what do you know about the person originating that and then what do you know about the person receiving it? And so that's where some of the consternation comes in and where regulators are looking for solutions. </p><p>BRUMMER: And there's been an interesting amount of back and forth and--and some contestation between industry and regulators on AML issues. I mean, the idea, obviously, is if you increasingly, not just pseudonymous, but increasingly anonymous-like transactions then that could-some be a gateway for everything from narco-trafficking, to terrorism finance, and--and other kinds of issues. And I've--I've heard as--as others probably have as--as well, that part of that Financial Action Task Force approach, which was originally sort of half of a paragraph has now sort of ballooned into sort of a multi-page analysis of--of trying to interpret an initial approach towards AML rules for--for virtual currencies. What--what exactly, to your understanding, is that point of friction between industry and the regulators on--on AML issues? </p><p>KIM: Yeah. I mean, I think one of the issues is how do you know where that money is going? You know, I think from a regulatory perspective, the--the very specific issue is about money or wire transfers, but I think the bigger issue, and those of you working traditional financial institutions, you need to know who your counter-parties are to a transaction. And so that's what traditional regulators are used to seeing. And then, so if you're looking at this and being told, \"Well, I don't know who's receiving the money,\" you know, that's where you kind of get that. And so those are some--that's where the rub is occurring. And--and yeah. </p><p>CARR: And the industry is gun shy about that, given the magnitude of fines that have occurred in the last few years that have been specifically related to--to not having sufficient KYC, not knowing your client, not knowing where the money's going. </p><p>But also that, you know, I think the irony here is, (INAUDIBLE) the G20 have started out from this perspective I've been concerned about. I've--I've concerned about cryptocurrencies being used for AML purposes. The irony is, they're going to come around, I think, to a view that the blockchain technology is actually central to a big part of the AML fix. And I think a lot of where we're headed in the next five years is going to be around developments in digital identity, where I think blockchain has a big role. </p><p>Just to give you a couple of figures. So the UK banks spend more on AML then the UK government spends on prisons. You know, there's enormous amount of money being put by--by every bank in the world into AML systems at the moment. And the catch rate is terrible. According to Interpol, we capture between 1 and 2 percent of the illicit activity. So it's--it's a terrible return on investment for the level of--of time and money that goes in to--to AML processes at the moment. So we have to get better and smarter at it and one part of it is digital identity solutions. And I think there's other commercial imperatives for--for digital identity besides AML. So I think that this is going to have some real momentum behind it. </p><p>But again, you know, you also look at things like the feeds on a white paper that found that turning on machine learning algorithms drove a--a 75 percent catch right on fraud. The difference being that in fraud, you've got a really good reference data set to work with and in AML it's scattered all over the place. And the banks have got restrictions that mean they can't even share information within their own firm across borders on AML threats. They can't share themselves on a firm-to-firm basis. They don't get a feedback loop from law enforcement so when they fill in these thousands of suspicious transaction reports that never find out which one of those went anywhere. So you don't have the depth of the reference data to train an algorithm to get better at AML. So I--I think you're going to see that--that for, you know, given that that magnitude of that problem and the desire to get better, digital identity with blockchain having a role within it is--is a big part of what we'll see in the next five years. </p><p>KIM: I would agree with you. I feel like, sorry, that this builds into a bigger question. You know, we're--this the G20 and the FATF recommendations really focused on this one little thing on wire transfers. But that's only a very specific type of transfer between financial institutions that is triggered at a threshold level. There's all these other things that companies are doing with respect to on-boarding customers, monitoring transactions, filing transactions reports, with law enforcement responding to subpoenas, holding accounts open so law enforcement can-- You know, I mean, there's a lot that goes on in an AML compliance program. And there's--there's many people that agree. I--I'm one of them that agree that I think we need to modernize how we look at AML-- </p><p>CARR: --Yep, definitely-- </p><p>KIM: --compliance and enforcement. And you know, things like your name, date of birth, address, and social security number in the U.S., I mean, I don't know, does anybody here think that that's private anymore? </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, that actually is a very good question, because we are going to our Q&amp;A for just one or two questions. We're on a very tight diplomatic schedule, not withstanding our drinks at the outset. And if there were any individuals with one or two questions, do feel free to--to ask our panelists. I do find it fascinating that, and we'll have a chance later to talk a little bit more, the one question that--that no one's really brought up is the question that is something a security or not? And even where you have a stable coin, there are certain kinds of questions that arise depending on how you stabilize a cryptocurrency and--and--and what are the methodologies and technologies and tactics used to--to stabilize and to maintain a certain price of--of crypto-asset and that becomes very important. It could even become important for Facebook and other companies. </p><p>I see, sir. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Is that when you announced (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>BRUMMER: Exactly. And I have a solution. </p><p>QUESTION: Bert Delia (SP), banking consultant here in town. </p><p>Going back to JPM Coin, one of the objections of JPM Coin is other banks won't want to deal with it. And there's a parallel on this. Years ago, when Bank of America launched its credit card there were other--other banks that were reluctant to facilitate Bank of America Card transactions, which is why Bank of America Card eventually got spun off from B of A. So question number one is, how is JPM going to deal with that? And question number two is where does Swift fit into this picture, given the massive role that they currently play in cross-border currency movement? </p><p>SWANSON: I'll take the JPM one. So I--I don't think that their goal is to be used by everybody at this stage. They're more than happy, from my conversations, to--to work within the customer base and counter-parties and build on and see--see if there is anyone. But to your point, yeah, why--why don't other commercial banks do this? Ideally, I guess if we look at a spectrum, it would be great to have a central bank issue with digital currency. I mean, we could talk about that. Happy to discuss some of--some of the other just conversations on the sinkhole of money flour, which the BIS talked about. </p><p>To--to your point there, Brad, there's several different models on--on how central banks could do that. But yeah, a JPM point isn't trying to be everything for everybody and including for all their commercial banks. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah, Swift, Brad, is that something you want to-- </p><p>CARR: Look, probably. I'll probably just add to that, that, you know, I think any, you know, bank issued coin is going to have a need for interoperability. And you don't want to have things fragmenting into a scenario where you have a, you know, a--a--a seller telling its buyers, \"I don't want to be paid in JP Morgan Coin. I want to be paid in HSBC Coin or City Coin or whatever,\" then you're just fragmenting the whole system. So I think everyone's got an interest in ensuring that we get past that and we have an interoperable approach. </p><p>Swift, look, you know, I think there's--you know, and you constantly see the debate in the press with Swift and the discussions they've had with the Ripple, I think, during the Cyborgs Conference that Swift ran last year. There was a running commentary of all the--the crypto evangelists posting things furiously on every social media channel bashing Swift at the time. </p><p>My own perception is that--that the blockchain technology, where it's at right at the moment, struggles to handle the volume of transactions to be able to completely, you know, replace the existing Swift infrastructure. Where I think blockchain is really good is when you've got a smaller volume of complex transactions, trade finance, corporate lines, syndicated lines, bond insurance. So, you know, that's my sense of where the--the use cases or where it's the--the best fit. But I realize I'm wading into an area where some people hold very, very passionate views so I'm sure there's some contrarians. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, just to piggyback on this. And I'm--I'm just curious. So if you're talking about Facebook, right, and you already have WhatsApp, so you--you kind of have a messaging system, right. So--so the question is, how do you then, you know, if you think of the--the sort of life-cycle of the transaction, of the messaging, and then you have the settlement. And the question is, you know, how do you scale up to be able to handle lots of different--different transactions? And I guess you could say the same even if you had a large retailer, you know, like Amazon, creating a--a--they came out with a--a Bezos coin or something, you could--you could figure out some-- Or the--they--they already have an internal messaging protocol system. It's going to be the--it's going to be how do you actually use the--the--the blockchain technology. </p><p>Some folks have said yourselves can batch them together, and then others have come up with other kinds of interesting ways of running parallel systems in order to sort of accommodate lots of--of value. Have you, Amy or Tim, have you heard or talk to any--any individuals as to how do you scale up for these kinds of large transactions to make them commercially feasible, particularly when you do have big tech and big finance entering into the space? </p><p>SWANSON: Real quick. Who's ever used WeChat or WeChat Pay, anybody? Everyone puts their hands down. They don't want be doxed. All right. Well, I used to live in China. I worked at there for five years. I have WeChat so feel free to hack my phone, whoever you want to. I actually couldn't use WeChat Pay because I didn't have, out here in America, I don't have access to a Chinese bank. But yeah, they--they process, you know, gazillions of dollars a day, or--or a RMB's worth of money a day, and they don't need a blockchain. I'm not saying you need to have a blockchain but it's still unclear. That's why I'm saying once we find on the 18th, hopefully, they'll clear things up because right now, it doesn't make sense to me. </p><p>CARR: Probably the one of the things about is, you know, we shouldn't view the technology as static. And, you know, whilst I see some of those limitations in the technology today, you know, what's decided that in five years time that's still going to be the case. And you have things like quantum computing that are, you know, now coming out of the universities and going into commercial and R&amp;D. If that's hitting some sort of inflection point where that can be overlaid or built into other solutions. You know, we shouldn't assume that the--the technology--technology limitations that apply now will--will be forever. </p><p>KIM: Yeah. And we see new things every--every day. So, you know, with what we're seeing now in a year or two there may be a new solution for that. </p><p>BRUMMER: We have two questions up front and apparently one in back. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Well, yeah. Next we'll--we'll come up front. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. It seems like innovation has come in waves in different phases. Information Technology sort of led the way with a lot of innovation over the past--over the past few decades. In the last decade, finance caught up and I didn't think that they were going to move so quickly but they seem to be moving more quickly. Sort of wrapping up the rear, we have governance and--and legal frameworks and constructs. Where do you see opportunities to innovate in governance, and these constructs that we have inherited in order to advance some of the things that Information Technology and other industries are trying to advance today? </p><p>CARR: So I guess, there's broader view across the financial sector, where are the opportunities? Look, a lot of the--and so I'm--I'm from a--a center where we have 40 bank CEOs and chairs on our board from the biggest firms around the world. The view I often hear is that the single biggest innovation they're--they can make in the business at the moment is getting more things onto the cloud faster. And indeed, you know, then running into the issues that the whole industry is largely reliant on three cloud service providers. And also that regulators around the world in different markets have differing views as to their level of comfort and their requirements for cloud. </p><p>So you have some--some restrictions and fragmentation that can arise from that or that your--your business case becomes that you can implement cloud for 40 percent of your business, where you've got a regulator who's got on board with the technology. I think that's the--the--the number one and I highlight that in the sense, that most banks are the result of lots of mergers and acquisitions that have occurred over the years. So they're coming from a starting point where not only do they have a 1970s or 80s mainframe base, but they actually have fragmented systems all over the place. And that cloud is--is therefore, a critical enabler to being able to get all of your data into a single data like where you--you can then run the sort of machine learning analytics and other that you really need to be able to, not only to manage your business from a risk management sense, but identify catch the bad guys in an ALM fraud sense, but also to be able to deliver the--the personalization and--and immediacy that customers increasingly are coming to expect because they--they've been exposed to that in other industries. </p><p>So to--to me, that's number one. You know, I think the--the other--I alluded to machine learning and the--the growth of that, both in commercial areas and--and risk management is significant. We'll have another report on that out shortly. But the other piece that we see, probably less in the U.S. but elsewhere, is the emphasis on open API's. That's been heralded by open banking, by PSD3, and the European Union. Open banking is proceeding now in--in Canada, Mexico, and Japan, and Hong Kong, and Australia, as well. And I think this is where we may see the emergence of, you know, platform-based banking in a--in a mix of guises. </p><p>You know, on one hand it will be the tech firms that come in and provide a platform and then market bank products on that platform. But it's also where you see some banks like Erste in Austria or an SEB in Sweden, that have really been at the forefront of saying, \"We want to be the platform. And we're going to provide the customer facing platform in which other banks products and FinTech firms products can be marketed on our platform because we see that as being the--the integral way of managing the customer relationship of the future.\" </p><p>And I guess as a final comment, I'd circle from that back to my earlier comment about digital identity. If you want to be the platform provider you're going to need to be able to do the digital identity that comes with that. And the digital identity that you provide is going to need to be interoperable with other digital identity frameworks as well. </p><p>SWANSON: Please. So, yeah, one other comment, and it's good to see you. It's been a long time, since last year. Actually, I actually when it's light. </p><p>So if you're looking for kind of an interesting example of weird governance that hasn't really worked out in--at least in the cryptocurrency world, there's this entity called Maker DAO. Has anyone ever heard of Maker DAO? And they has something called the DAI, which is supposed to be a stable coin. Anyways, they--as much as--and again, I'm going--I guess I'm going to--this is being recorded. So somebody's going call me a Federal Reserve show. And that's totally fine. </p><p>But with the Federal Reserve, we at least know who's participating in meetings, we know who's the governance body, we know when they produce reports and notes. With--with Maker, they have these calls in which we don't know--for--for all the talk about transparency, we don't only don't know who's necessarily taking part of the calls, but during the--the vote, who owns these votes, you have--or the--the voting process, you actually had some VC firms, so over a year ago, that bought a stake in these tokens. So as much as we--we had this discussion in the last couple years or number of years, about participation in--in governance, you actually have venture funds that are determining, for example, the interest rate on--on a token, and in this case, it went up to 19 percent. So ignoring their usury laws that--that may be an impacted here, the fact that we don't have transparency in some of these projects. And again, if you're from Maker, I'm sorry, I still have your shirts. It's nothing personal. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BRUMMER: Great. A question here. </p><p>QUESTION: As we start to see institutional money come in, the endowments, the crypto funds, the trust, no FDIC type thing set up, do you think it's too soon? What's your kind of feel on that? Because you're starting to see the last couple quarters, a lot of 30 and 20 and 15 from groups, not just retirement systems and, you know, people of that nature are not individuals anymore. </p><p>BRUMMER: Okay, great. We're going to just skip this question. And then a very brief 20 second question. In this lighting, I did not even know that our guest of honor was here. I apologize. Did you want to ask very, very briefly your question? </p><p>QUESTION: I have a couple of quick questions about AML. And to the extent that there's the urban legend out there that everything is reported to the blockchain. How do you--how do you all deal with that issue? Because when you have exchanges which have Omnibus accounts, which do all these internal transactions, which never make it to the blockchain, how do you assure yourself that you haven't had a double spend issue? </p><p>Secondly, I'd note, because we have someone from Europe here, the recent action with respect to closing down a mixing or tumbling operation, which is used to basically obscure who owns what on blockchain reported transactions. So to the extent that there's this theory that you've got a perfect view of what's going on, because it's reported to the blockchain, I don't think that's true and I'd like to hear why that's not--my view isn't true. </p><p>BRUMMER: So I'm going to take, because I know that our guests is on a very tight schedule, I'm going to take, unfortunately, the moderator's prerogative to continue that discussion afterwards because we still have drinks left-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--and move directly to our keynote. I--I do apologize. I--I just did not know he was here. So I think we are going to applaud our guests. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We will answer these questions afterwards, and move to the second part. Yep, this way. Thank you. Thanks. </p><p>RESNIK: All right, thanks again for that great conversation. And thanks again to our panelists, Brad, Amy and Tim, for joining us. And as Chris said, it's time for our keynote interview with Mr. Steven Maijoor. Mr. Maijoor has been the chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, since taking up office in April of 2011. He's the first chair of the Authority and is currently serving his second five year term. He's responsible for representing the authority, as well as chairing ESMA's Board of Supervisors and the management board. The role of the board of supervisors is to give strategic guidance to ESMA and make all main regulatory and supervisory decisions. </p><p>Please join me in welcoming Mr. Maijoor. And Chris, the floor is yours. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BRUMMER: Mr. Maijoor, thank you so much for coming here. As you can see, there's quite a bit of interest in what's happening in Europe and an appreciation for how many of those decisions can impact the--the American marketplace, both the securities marketplace, and the derivatives marketplace, and the FinTech marketplace. </p><p>As a professor, I--I tend to look at your job as--as very interesting and at times a bit difficult. European member states are having their own differences of opinion from time to time on the treatment of different kinds of financial products and--and--and how they should go about viewing cryptocurrencies in particular. What would you view as the pillars, if one will, of the understanding of how to go about thinking through the application of--of EU law to cryptocurrencies? I know you've gone through a consultative report and a process where you're trying to analyze and assess how your different members are--are viewing cryptocurrencies and regulating them. Where do you--where do things stand at this at this moment? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Thank you very much, Chris, and--and very good to be here and thank you very much for the invitation to be at Georgetown University. </p><p>The--so as you probably are aware, so in Europe, obviously, we're--we're coming from a history with a--a large number of different financial markets. And basically, there's been work in the EU in--in the past, you know, going back to, basically, 40 years, trying to integrate these--these financial markets. And--and--and it goes back to the whole notion is that when you have scale, when you have bigger integrated capital markets, that ultimately, that would be beneficial. And so across all areas where ESMA is active, obviously, we're trying to be consistency and--and trying to improve cross border financial transactions, financial market transactions. That is--that is the key element we're trying to achieve. </p><p>Going on, specifically, on to maybe because that ties in probably most closest to the previous discussion, we are looking from a securities markets perspective to crypto-assets. So there's also, obviously, a lot of interest in the previous discussions, there was a lot of the payments issues, we're--we're more looking into that from a securities markets issue. And we're basically, we have taken the position and it was reflected in your comment on the advice, is that if it is a financial instrument, you know, if it looks like a financial instrument you should treat it like a financial instrument. And ultimately, that is a--a--a supervisory reduction. Although there are small differences across the member states what is precisely a financial instrument, which is quite surprising to some extent, if you look at it from a distance. You know, if you want integrate capital markets, at least you won't have the same definition of what a financial instrument is. </p><p>But by and large, we have reasonably common definitions around that, typically, there needs to be transfer ability, there needs to be a profit right. And so what we have done is in the exercise in India of crypto-assets, we have asked, basically, our--our national regulators, \"Here are six examples of crypto-assets. Would you qualify those as--as financial instruments, yes or no?\" And basically, depending on the type of crypto-asset it was, whether it was a utility type, whether it's payment type, or whether it's the investment type, there was commonality on the number of them being needing to be qualified and described as a financial instrument. </p><p>That brings you to the logic that if it's like a financial instrument you should regulate it like a financial instrument that has far reaching implications because once you are a financial instrument, you are put in the whole regulatory world so not only are you talking about possibly a prospectus, not only talking about clearing, we're talking about can it be used by asset managers? And so that is a big decision once it is a financial instrument. But we took the position, if it's a financial instrument, if it has the same characteristics--characteristics that should be regulated and supervised like a financial instrument. </p><p>So national supervisors are now moving into that direction. And so we know that now a number of them have been vetted under their national systems as a financial instrument and so they are brought within the regulatory remit. I think the big question is, and maybe being a bit critical on--on the development, to what extent will it survive once it needs to meet the regulatory requirements? Or to frame it in a different way, to what extent was it successful because it--it was outside of the regulatory remit? By bringing into the regulatory remit it cannot be, you know, because some of it might be, some of the benefits might have been related precisely to avoid regulation. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, certainly in the United States we have a very similar conversation going on. When you say financial instrument, we're thinking, is it a security or is it not a security? And obviously, if--if a financial instrument--instrument or--or a cryptocurrency is a security then you're brought into the wonderful world of our colleagues across the street over at the Securities and Exchange Commission. But one of the things that we don't have, which I think the European position is, is--is by definition much more interesting, is that because it's a federal question entirely, both in terms of an enforcement and also--well, although I guess the state regulators can also get involved, but largely the--the definitional question comes from the U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence, you don't have the same degree, perhaps, of jostling and competition in terms of building up local financial markets, as perhaps, in--in the European Union, where there's a real interest by some of the member states to early into this space and--and in financial innovation, more--more--more generally in order to build up their financial centers. </p><p>How is it and what--what kind of guidance can ESMA play in helping to facilitate that, particularly in a world where you're also dealing with--with Brexit and--and the folks in the UK seeking to create their own financial centers? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Okay. These are many, many different issues in--in--in one question. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So--so first of all, generally, where for those of you who--who don't know ESMA that well, so we are a European body. And while day to day supervision is typically still at a national level, although for some areas, it is at our level. So for example, credit rating agencies and--and some benchmarks and--and also regarding CCPs will get direct supervisory powers. And so but the--the basic model in Europe is--is day to day supervision at a national level. But by entrance into one national market, you'll not only get entry to that financial market, you get entry to the whole of the 28 and that create, you know, creates all kinds of incentive issues. </p><p>To what extent that does that national regulator not only take into account the benefits for--for that member state, or the risk to that member state, but also takes into the wider implications for the whole of Europe. And so that is where, basically, ESMA comes in, is to make sure that those national supervisory and regulatory decisions are there to make sure that the whole European perspective is taken into account. To say it more bluntly, you can see that there might be some incentives to build a financial center without, you know--if most of the customers and clients are somewhere else in Europe, not having sufficient focus on the risk that you might be creating, instead, focus on the, you know, the benefits that a strong financial center might bring in terms of developing more economic activity, et cetera. </p><p>And so there is an important role for us to ensure consistency across--across the EU. Maybe first go back to the crypto-asset issue. And then because I think you're also mentioned Brexit if I listened carefully. So first on crypto-assets. So once it is determined to be a financial instrument we will--we will try and we have some--we have some instruments to make sure that the national regulators are as consistent as possible, where we have seen some of the national financial centers trying to, you know, to--to give a kind of a crypto-asset flavor to their financial center and trying to get that label. </p><p>The reality is that that is only possible for those assets, crypto-assets, which are outside of--which are not a financial instrument. And so there's more freedom there because that is basically then for the national regulators to decide. But there we have advice to the European Commission, to say and to the--to the EU political institutions, to say we need to have at least some risk warnings around those in AML. There's been a lot already a discussions on email, because that is an area where--where we see specific risk for crypto-assets. </p><p>Going to the Brexit issue, where and I think there are so many things to be said about Brexit, but I--I think you focused on the issue around regulatory competition, and how do we ensure consistency. One area where you can--so to prepare for Brexit, what is happening is that financial market participants are relocating from the UK to the EU 27, because they know that in the case of a no deal Brexit, or in the longer term, when the--when there's an orderly Brexit, is that there are problems in terms of the recognition of UK market participants. You know, having a license now in the UK is, of course, completely recognized across the EU. That will end for, you know, certainly in the case of a no deal Brexit. And so market participants are relocating from London to multiple financial centers. </p><p>Interestingly, it's not--there is not one big winner. It's going to different centers. You can see Dublin getting extra activity. Luxembourg, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, there's--there's some specialization, some focusing on asset management, someone on--on trading venues. Where our interest is to make sure is that there is no regulatory competition in the sense that these relocations, you can see the incentive to say, \"Come over here to my financial center. You will get the license for your entry to Europe but you can do it with a very little entity, with very little substance.\" And obviously, that is where ESMA comes in. And we say, \"We need to make sure that we have common standards for receiving this business.\" </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, this is a natural shift to a set of questions with clearinghouses. But I--before I get there, I did want to ask one question, which I find fascinating and maybe you could--you could help clarify. In the United States there are some conversations, particularly on the Hill, about cryptocurrencies that are not necessarily regulated or deemed to be securities from a U.S. securities law perspective, but still are sort of in this in between zone and there's a sense that they should somehow be subject to some kind of enhanced disclosures or--or--or something of the like. But given just the way in which our regulatory process works, that kind of directive won't and couldn't come from the SEC, because it's not within their mandate and it's not within their authority, and it's not coming from the CFTC either. And--and CFTC Chairman Giancarlo has gone to the Hill to sort of ask for a bit more of that authority. </p><p>To the extent to which, however, that lays within your authority to--to look at some of those crypto-assets, I assume that that approach, whenever completed in concert between ESMA and the commission and--and perhaps Parliament, that that would be for any such security within the block and therefore, it would be something that the rest of the world would have to think about in terms of the approach taken--taken by Europe. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Yes. So if I'm--I'm not sure whether I fully understand. So first of all, if we make EU law, obviously, you know, that is applicable all across the EU. </p><p>BRUMMER: I'm trying to softly ask about extraterritoriality. </p><p>MAIJOOR: No, so okay, okay. So first of all, in the EU, is, you know, all EU law is--once it is a regulation or directive, it applies across the EU. And when it's a directive there is some discussion how its implemented, but it needs to be implemented. When it's a regulation it is--it is directly applicable. </p><p>I think, on the issue around what should we do for securities that are not--or sorry, (INAUDIBLE) that--that look or smell or ceased received by investors or retail investors, like--and--and like a financial instrument, like a investment, but in reality are, according to the legal definition not. I think that is a very difficult area, because on the one hand, we want to be careful to say, \"Let's not legitimize it like a financial instrument.\" And so if you bring it into a kind of a bespoke regulatory regime you want to be careful not to treat it like a, you know, full supervising regulatory framework. On the other hand, there's precisely the issue around there should be sufficient risk, you know, risk indicators and to warn retail consumers around when they would buy this, although, in reality would not be a--a security. </p><p>On the issue of, interestingly, the extraterritoriality. The--of course, extraterritoriality has a bad name. But in reality, the flip side of this is--is a level playing field between--it is the--the flip side of having global markets and a level playing field. And so to--to, you know, to explain that better, if you--if you have an open EU capital market where you allow foreign marketplace to participate, which I think is completely right, you know, you want to have markets where there's broad participation, but you want to have a level playing field between the EU market players and the ones coming from outside the EU, also, you know, participating in that capital market providing services, that is a level playing field. </p><p>Then what is the implication is that you would say, \"Okay, you can provide your services in the EU. You can--you know, we can talk about clearing. We can talk about, you know, trading venues. We can talk about asset management in different areas.\" But you would basically say, \"If you provide services in the EU.\" That's fine coming from outside, but you need to live by the same rules for the EU clients.\" Obviously, it would not be around giving obligations for non-EU clients. But that, of course, is, you know, in the popular terms, seen as extraterritoriality because it goes back to the questions then outside the EU, if we want to provide those clients it means, you know, we have seen it with unbundling. </p><p>Unbundling was the--is the separation of execution and research in the case of research provided by brokers to--to their asset managers. We have asked for unbundling. The only thing we ask is that if there would be, for example, brokers from outside the EU providing services to EU asset managers just to say, \"It cannot be the case that as a non-EU provider and broker you don't have to unbundle while the EU broker has to unbundle.\" You would say, \"You need to do it. You need to live by those rules.\" But obviously, that has raised the debate here in the U.S., which is still ongoing, on, you know, to what extent should that be a common model? </p><p>And I think it's part of being a global market. You know, but it is an implication of having global markets and wanting to have a level playing field. And of course, the more different the rules are on a national or regional basis, the bigger this issue is. And therefore, it's so important to try to get at least international global standards, because the more you have them the less there will be these kinds of frictions. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, one of the most global industries is the clearing industry and--and under your remit and already lies this question of--of clearinghouses, which service customers from around the world and trillions of dollars run through the world's clearinghouses. As you may know, CFDC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo has, or at least plans to, to provide for a CFDC vote relatively soon, a mutual recognition package for non-United States clearinghouses but allowing, in effect, non-U.S. clearinghouses to--to operate in the United States to the extent to which they are deemed to be roughly equivalent or--or comparable to or subject to regulatory regimes that are roughly comparable to that of the United States. </p><p>But there is a condition attached and--and that condition is that in order to enjoy this kind of recognition it would have to be, in effect, mutual and that the non-U.S. clearinghouse would have to be operating in a country that provides that kind of recognition to the United States. There are a lot of--there's a lot in that question, too. What is your sense, where does the equivalence process stand now? And--and even before, if--if you wish, you know, maybe it's useful just to walk people through what are you thinking through and--and what are your priorities at this point in time when you are--are--are trying to operationalize equivalents in the United (INAUDIBLE) of--in Europe, as--as pertaining to a non-EU counterpart--CCPs? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Yes. So this is much talked about also, you know, today and yesterday it was that today at the--at CFDC, at the Emmerich and--and also had some other meetings at the--at the CFDC. So I think it's important to have a bit of a history here. </p><p>So Europe has had equivalence mechanisms already for a number of years. And while it is a--and the--the implication of the equivalence is that once equivalence is provided is that the EU fully relies on the foreign regulator and the foreign regulatory system. And so when equivalence is declared, basically the EU says from those jurisdictions, for this part of the market, so it's never equivalent across the board for all financial markets, it's, you know, it is it goes from credit rating agencies to--to--to clearing, for trading venues, and--and they are slightly different then so you need to look at a piece, you know, law by law what precisely equivalence means. But generally, it means is that these foreign market participants can basically fully participate in the EU markets while the EU fully relies on the local, you know, the home country rules and home country supervision. </p><p>Generally, that is a good system, but you should also realize is that, ultimately, it might--it gets to the point is that as Europe you have no tools at all, nothing, in--in such a situation to even say, \"I want to have more information on debt market participants. Because they are very active in the EU there might be certain risks and I want to understand what those risks are. And if I have seen those risks I want to--I want to address those risks or maybe have a supervisory tool to respond to those risks.\" </p><p>And so the equivalence system, as we have had until very recently, is a system where the ultimate consequence is full reliance, we're doing it, we're doing it in various areas. But you can understand and we have made a point already, before Brexit, that this is, in some cases, not the right model. In some cases you want to be sure that you can assess the specific risks that might be coming from outside the EU from financial market participants from outside the EU, for the EU because we're not sure whether that has the same priority in the, let's say, in the ranking for that regulator in--in the--in the other country. </p><p>And so we start, you know, we have started to change our thinking on that. And obviously, our thinking has accelerated because of Brexit. We know that the UK will continue to be, for the foreseeable--foreseeable years, the most important financial market for the EU. Is it appropriate for a financial--for a region to--you need to rely on a financial center. Your main financial center is outside of your region. But in addition to that, if you would take the consequence of the current equivalent system, you are fully--you need to fully rely on--on the local regulators. They're very professional. We work very well with them but also it's from an incentive standpoint, the right mechanism to have. </p><p>That is the reason that we said we need to change our equivalent systems. And so you can see that in various parts of EU law where this is changing. So it's not only changing for CCPs, but for example, it is also changing for investment firms. There are a large number of the investment firms from outside the EU providing their services in the EU. And again, equivalence would mean here full--full reliance on the third country regulator. And so that is the reason we have said we need to change the system, but again, only when in the case of CCP, it is--it can be relevant from a systemic perspective. </p><p>So only CCPs that might be relevant from a systemic perspective would be in the category where you would have additional supervisory tools. For those that are not in the category, that are not relevant from a systemic perspective, they would continue to have the possibility of full equivalents, full reliance. And also, even within the category where we would have certain supervisory tools and where the EU regulatory requirements would apply directly, there is the possibility of comparable compliance and so you would rely there, but on a--you need to make that assessments on a requirement by requirement basis what do you can rely there on the home country regulation of that CCP. </p><p>BRUMMER: Is--is there a sense in terms of the timing by which or--or--or the order at which you're proceeding in terms of granting equivalents to those non-EU based CCPs? Is there a sense as to when that process will be fully completed in light of the timing created if, for no other reason, externally by--by Brexit or a potential departure from it? </p><p>MAIJOOR: So--so the--so first of all, all these equivalence decisions have been--you know, we have already done a large number of equivalence decisions regarding--regarding countries outside the EU. For--for CCPs, we currently have 34 third country CCPs recognized with ESMA so they can fully participate in--in the EU market. The--the key next--the key step would be, of course, which--which will continue to be tier one CCPs, and which would be eligible or need to be in the tier two category, where you would have the--the supervisory powers and the direct application of EU law. </p><p>The process we are in, we have just published our consultation papers on key elements of this law, which is around (INAUDIBLE) and around the comparable compliance. So everybody can now react to those consultation papers. We plan to give our advice to the commission by the end of this year. And then the commission has a maximum of one year to implement those delegated acts or to decide on their--their delegated acts. And then after these delegated acts are there, the actual decision on tier one and tier two, we'll start off to that. And so it depends a bit whether the commission--so to have a--so we expect that the--the form of law will be in the official journal by the end of this year. That will,--from that moment on the clock will start ticking for the delegated act, the relevant laws that are especially relevant for third country CPCs. The commission need to decide on these within a year, but they could get quicker if they, you know, if they can decide quicker. And then only after that we can start our process regarding tier one and tier two. </p><p>BRUMMER: I know that they are going to be one or two questions for the audience. I did want to end with one question as we--as we find folks, and feel free to raise your hand, is with the Capital Markets Union. Obviously, we started off with cryptocurrencies, then we talked about clearinghouses, which are really the ultimate FinTech in many ways. Is the--are there any agenda items right now relating to FinTech, to your knowledge, that are on the table when it comes to the development of the Capital Markets Union? </p><p>MAIJOOR: I think the--so first of all, we need--Europe is a financial system with a too large banking sector, we paid a high price for that also in the financial crisis. I think you can make a point that having a better balance between the banking system and the non-banking system is that you can make the financial system more stable. And you will understand that in these discussions, the U.S. is frequently mentioned as, you know, the example where you have much more successful--well, capital markets are much deeper and--and they play a bigger role in the--in the economy and the financial system. We should--we should do the--you know, we--we should push for that, where Europe has been working on it for--for many decades already. And so I'm sure that the next European Commission will, again, work on that. </p><p>I think where technology comes in is where--one area where we think there needs to be much more improvements, is around cheaper distribution of products to retail consumers, you know, more standardization, more robo advice, more transparency on costs. We would hope that technology helps there to make sure that we get a better deal for--for the end consumer. </p><p>Currently, as a consumer, we can see that in our day to day lives is that there's been the biggest progress, at least how I see it, is--is in the payments area, our banking apps, how we can do the payments so much easier in our family, how we can now get better deals in terms of when we are in--in the U.S. and having a better rate for exchanging the U.S. dollar against the euro. And so in the payments area, we--I--you can see, and I'm personally I experienced as a client, how much progress there has been there. I can really see that there's been so much benefit to the consumer. I think that is not as far yet in securities markets. But there I would hope that in terms of standardization of advice, making it more inclusive advice, which is available for also people with a smaller purse, and more transparency of financial products, that they're--especially technology can help. </p><p>Other areas, there is where, of course, we're working on is--is things like cloud issues. Supervisory issues are very important for us. Cybersecurity risks are important for us. We're working on that. </p><p>BRUMMER: And that would be at the Capital Markets Union level? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Well, on the--I think on the capital markets unions, especially I--I think the distribution, cheaper distribution, more transparent distribution, I would--you know, we have seen in so many parts of our lives how services have improved because of technology. Securities markets have been lagging a--a bit there. And--and I think it--it will be--that is the area where I see the opportunity. </p><p>BRUMMER: Fascinating. </p><p>Are there any questions from our audience? This reminds me of my law school course. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Afraid of the regulator to--to raise your hand. </p><p>MAIJOOR: There's one. </p><p>BRUMMER: All right, excellent. </p><p>MAIJOOR: He--he saves it. </p><p>BRUMMER: He does save it. </p><p>MAIJOOR: He's there. </p><p>QUESTION. Hi. My name is President Sibbett. I'm a--a postdoctoral fellow at the Global Governance Center, at the Graduate Student Union in Switzerland. </p><p>I'm just wondering what thought ESMA has given in terms of developing regulations to assert European strategic autonomy in relations to U.S. sanctions, and particularly, as it relates to the--in the area of cryptocurrencies and what can be created there? Thank you. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Sorry, on which area? </p><p>QUESTION: Strategic autonomy from U.S. sanctions and U.S. regulations. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Well, I--I think probably I would not be--you know, this is--this is not the, let's say, the typical area of the--of a securities markets regulator. And so I'm--I'm getting into territory where I do it more, basically, as a--as a reader of newspapers than with the expertise knowledge. But we--we know, but just to convey that message, we know that there are discussions around-- You know, one of the implications of sanctions and effectiveness also is very much related to the role of the currency that it plays in global trade. And we--we very much know that the U.S. dollar has been much more successful in that respect than the euro. </p><p>I think, what is interesting there, I think the--so far the formal position has been, from most of the central bankers that I know, is that they are say, you know, whether--whether the euro would be a, let's say, a global currency that is used trade, if we are neutral visa vi that position, you can see, at least I've seen some signals, that you can see that that is changing by some of the central banking and some in the central bank community. </p><p>BRUMMER: And certainly, when it comes to the AML issues, one thing I noticed, just reading the--the earlier consultative reports, is that from ESMA and--and from the EBA, is that there does seem, and it's not the same thing as sanctions, but on the AML and a conversation that we had just in the preceding panel, that there does seem to be a lot of energy and--and--and work towards pushing through a very unified approach, and an upgraded approach towards any AML related issues, both in your Europe and--and globally. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Just to, because I--just to--one other part of the coin, I know that there's been and I--maybe that's the--the--the other part of your--your question, so we know that there's been sanctions in certain--certain countries, you know, outside of the--outside of the EU. If you're talking about sanctions by, let's say, regulators from the U.S. visa vi European finance or market participants, in principle, I think that is part of a system where you, without going into individual cases and whether they are right or wrong in individual cases, but I think the consequence of global capital markets, where you have supervision at a--at a national or regional level is, and if there would be a foreign market participant active in the EU and they will do--you know, they would not live by the EU rules, I think it is--it is right to be sanctions in--in that case. </p><p>And so maybe that is the other part of your question or the issue you're referring to. But in principle, I think that is a--a possibility that is related to the fact that you have global capital markets, that if you provide services cross border, there are--is there is indeed, the possibility that if--if those services are provided cross border, but they don't meet the--the--the relevant rules and regulations in that country, is that you can be sanctioned. </p><p>BRUMMER: Given the cross border, and I--this is a way to maybe, perhaps, tie up the earlier panel with--with this one, from ESMA's perspective, when you hear about companies like Facebook, or JP Morgan and other companies, big tech, entering into the space, do you have any--any thoughts, observations? Does--does this percolate to the--to--to your--to your to-do-list when you see these companies themselves thinking about creating alternative, or--or I shouldn't say alternative, but creating virtual currencies that, obviously, are going to be, in--in the case of Facebook, potentially used all over the world and--and--and within the European Union? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Well, obviously, as far as, you know, what--what I my understanding, so far, this is more in--in--and you call it also currency and so it would be more for the banking regulators to work on that. But obviously, on ICOs, on crypto-assets with an investment, a characteristic on these things we talk, you know, we talked globally, we talk to each other. We, in (INAUDIBLE) we inform each other about our experiences. This is an area where, as a regulator, you need to be humble, you need to be--you try to understand these new developments. And so there is a global regulatory community thinking about these issues. We know that the FSB is involved into analyzing crypto-assets and--and I think that--is that is only logical. Typically, these new developments, you need all the brainpower and--and the--the expertise to address those issues. And so, you know, obviously, talking about these issues on a--on a global basis among regulators is very important. </p><p>BRUMMER: And with the public. </p><p>Thank you so very much for your time. It's been immensely useful for the Washington community. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MAIJOOR: Thank you very much. </p><p>BRUMMER: Thank you, sir. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Thank you. </p><p>BRUMMER: Thank you. Appreciate it. </p><p>RESNIK: All right. Thank you, Chris and Mr. Maijoor, for the fascinating discussion, and a special thank you to Georgetown University Law Center for hosting us this evening. </p><p>Two things to leave you with. First, a quick reminder to subscribe to Chris's FinTech Beat podcast, now available on iTunes and in fact, tonight's interview with Mr. Maijoor will be the next episode. And second, the bar is still open-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--so feel free to enjoy. That concludes our programming for tonight.

My name is Josh Resnik, and I'm the publisher of CQ Roll Call, as well as the emcee for today's event. </p><p>Before we kick off the discussion, I'd like to take a moment to set the stage for this evenings dialogue. Today, we live in a world of rapid change. Every industry is going through turbulence and transformation, largely driven by technology, but also by political and governmental changes as well, and finances is clearly not immune. Technological changes are upending the industry. Today, we call those changes by the collective name of FinTech. But as Georgetown's own Professor Chris Brummer has said many times, in 5 or 10 years what is now called FinTech will simply be the new world of finance. </p><p>At CQ Roll Call for the past 75 years, our publications have been leaders in unbiased, nonpartisan, legislative, and regulatory analysis. And now, in partnership with Professor Brummer, we're launching new coverage of FinTech's technological and regulatory impacts. We'll be teaming up with regulators, academics, and industry leaders to elevate the public's understanding of modern finance. We've been excited to partner with Professor Brummer on this coverage, including our new podcast, FinTech Beat, which went live on Apple today. And we're also delighted to be partnering with Georgetown Law School and the Institute of International Economic Law on tonight's event. </p><p>So let's dive in and get started with our panel. Professor Brummer will be moderating tonight's discussion. In addition to being a professor here at Georgetown, as well as the co-founder of FinTech Beat, Chris is also a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Subcommittee on Virtual Currencies and a member of the Consultative Working Group for the European Securities and Markets Authority's Financial Innovation Standing Committee. </p><p>We're fortunate to have some of FinTech's leading experts joining us on our panel this evening. So please join me in welcoming Brad Carr, senior director of Digital Finance at the Institute of International Finance. Brad leads the IIF's analysis on technology and innovation issues, including data regulations, reg tech, cloud, and distributed ledger technology, and the IIF's studies on the adoption of machine learning within the financial sector. </p><p>Next, we have Amy Kim, chief policy officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Prior to joining the chamber, Amy advised financial institutions, blockchain-based companies, marketplace lenders, investors, and innovators regarding compliance obligations under financial services laws. </p><p>Our third panelist is Tim Swanson, founder and director of Research at Post Oak Labs. Tim is currently an advisor to Elm Labs, Clear Maddox, and Bloxier (SP), and was an advisor to Hyperledger. </p><p>Please join me in welcoming our panelists and CQ Roll Call and Georgetown's own Chris Brummer to the stage. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BRUMMER: So thank you so much. Afterwards, we're going to have a--a brief opportunity for a--a Q&amp;A, both with our panelists, and also, obviously, for our--our--our keynote discussion later. </p><p>There's nothing like having an event after alcohol and having some introductory drinks. And hopefully, this will--will help to get the most forthright and interesting conversation from all of our panelists. </p><p>RESNIK: We--we didn't get to do the drinking though. </p><p>BRUMMER: Oh, yeah. Well, fortunately, I did. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We prepared the audience for us. </p><p>BRUMMER: I guess that's the most important thing. </p><p>So I guess I'll start with--with you, Tim. You know, some of the biggest news recently, particularly when you're talking about cryptocurrencies, and stable coins, and new applications for distributed ledger technology, has come from the entrance of new kinds of players but they're new familiar players, particularly big tech, and big finance with this announcement, both by JP Morgan and Facebook, that they are entering into this space. And there's a--a lot of talk and a lot of buzz about this really reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Maybe, could you sort of help walk us through what exactly are the kinds of things that they're looking to do and--and why is it that they're interested in--in blockchain technologies more generally? </p><p>SWANSON: A quick question, who's--who works for JP Morgan, anyone here or Facebook. All right. </p><p>So yeah, the two that I guess I'll mention, and thanks for that, are JPM Coin. I know it's been mis-characterized by some calling it Diamond Coin, and some people aren't excited about it. That's fine. You don't have to be excited about it. I'm not here to shill--shill the coin or anything like that. But what--what's--what's--the reason why JPM Coin was created is--is a means to an end. They needed a way internally, or on this--this network that they created called IIN, they needed a way to--to effectively settle these different instruments that they may have created on behalf of whatever participants on the network, rather than having to rely on the outside, effectively the settlement rails that takes three to five days. So if you have unchained cash then you can provide effectively instant settlement and therefore, get rid of the--this locked up capital. </p><p>For example, if you look at the nostro vostro accounts globally, as an aggregate in the world, it's like $9-$10 trillion of capital is sitting there at any given time. So, you know, obviously, JPM Coin's not going to revolutionize that entire-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --So let me just--just--just jump in, just to make--make sure. </p><p>SWANSON: Sure. </p><p>BRUMMER: So what you're basically saying is, JP Morgan has customers. They need to service those customers. And by creating a new kind of rail they're able to allow some of their existing customers to settle their transactions faster. Or is it--is it faster? Is it supposed to be more--more--better security? You know, what--what is it that creating JPM Coin does that an Excel sheet wouldn't be able to do? </p><p>SWANSON: Sure. So that's a great question. As it of this--as it of this moment, in June, it looks like the you know, you could have an Excel--Excel chain, if you will, that would be just as effective because you're effectively relying on that one participant. In theory, though, the--the goal for them long-term is to enable other participants to potentially validate transactions on the network or even open to the network to--to other--other networks. In fact, the long-term goal for them, my understanding, is for them to--to actually allow retail participants and not just wholesale interaction. </p><p>So again, it's a means to an end. It's kind of, I hate calling it boring inter-bank related activity, but it is. It's--it's not something that you and I as--as its consumers would probably ever touch in the next couple years. Whereas, the Facebook phenomenon, which you were kind of mentioning, I believe, since they've taken all their data, now he wants to take all of money. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So for what it's worth, Facebook Coin, they--they're supposed to do some announcement, I think, on the 18th or so when they review all the information and until then, we can only speculate based on what we've heard. But what we've heard so far is it's going to be some--like a basket of--of currencies, kind of like an SDR, which is a basket of--of four or five different major currencies. So it's kind of a stable coin. We've heard that maybe the network participants are going to be charged up to $10 million to run nodes. So the--the model is very different than JPM--JPM Coin, which is kind of a means to an end for the--its customers and counter-parties, whereas Facebook Coin sounds like it's, or sorry, Global Coin I think is what they call it, is going to be, supposedly, for--for remittance market, for participants who are--for--for the billion plus users that they have to move money across borders. </p><p>BRUMMER: So ultimately, we're talking about two very different financial products, if we are to believe current reports. That on the one hand, you have Facebook, which is apparently going to leverage some of its messaging for its retail-ish people, normal people. And then you have Facebook Coin, which is looking to, at least immediately, service institutional investors and to service those institutional investors by establishing a--a new rail, a new means of transacting cross border. But I guess both of them have a cross border feel to it, right? I mean, because JP Morgan, I'm guessing, has lots of different banks and then you have Facebook, which has--is going to lever this messaging system for all of its billions of users. </p><p>And I will get to, for that question, Brad. Maybe if you could maybe elaborate some of what you've heard or--or thought about in terms of these new financial products or stable coins-- </p><p>CARR: --Sure-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --and--and also, any kinds of immediately or immediate regulatory questions (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>CARR: So I think, firstly, you know, if I can distinguish another model as well, and that's that of--of MUFG Coin, which I think is probably the most advanced of the--the prototypes we've seen around the world, whereas the JPM Coin is targeted in the--the wholesale sector. It's about, you know, it's the settlement of transactions for--for corporate counter-parties, whereas MUFG Coin is a lot more retail oriented. Yet MUFG's own marketing is that if you go to Tokyo for the Olympics next year you'll be paying for your meals around town with--with MUFG Coin. </p><p>You know, that notion is more one of its trying to modernize a retail payment or point of sale transaction. It's essentially enabling you to have tokens of some sort on your phone and paying with those as an alternative to cash. And the Bank of Canada prototype for a--a central bank digital currency, is essentially working towards the same sort of model. So you've got a few different variances there. </p><p>The--the scenario that--that I came up against on the JP Morgan one is, that I think is going to get really interesting is, so what happens when you end up with one bank holding another banks coin? You know, if--if, let's say Citibank is holding a JPM Coin, is that equivalent to holding JPM senior debt in terms of the credit risk profile? Or is it considered to be cash back because it's reserved? Are you convinced of the--the stable coin fixing? Or do you start to say, \"Well, actually, this is a different kind of risk profile?\" And then similarly, if a customer is given JPM dollars and getting JPM coins back, you know, from a--a ledgers perspective of--of how you assess that counter-party risk, are you knitting the--the dollars and the coins? </p><p>So you've got a few things there that--that I think are all manageable issues, but are ones that, in terms of the prudential framework, you'd need to work through which of those and establish whether or not this is essentially considered equivalent to, you know, coins and bank notes under the existing prudential framework. </p><p>BRUMMER: That's--that's--that's interesting. One of the things that I--I noticed when you travel, obviously, to different international regulatory fores (SP), how people look at it, particularly a stable coin, but also any kind of cryptocurrency depends on where they're coming from. So for those who may not be as familiar with the stable coin, they're called stable coins because they're--they're presumably pegged or reference to a--a certain basket, or perhaps even the U.S. dollar and they're not intended to fluctuate. And the way in which you can create that stability is--is varied at least. </p><p>CARR: Yep. Right. </p><p>BRUMMER: And--and some of those ways can be just a straight peg or they could be algorithmic activities. </p><p>CARR: So--so if--so if you're a regulator trying to work out a prudential treatment that you're going to apply to this, one of the questions you'd need to establish is, you know, are you convinced of the--the peg? Or is this something that, you know, okay, it's fixed today but it may--may well not be in the future? </p><p>And to segue a little from the commercial bank tokens, you know, one piece we've--we've heard and we've corroborated in a few different places, is that the People's Bank of China has been developing a digital currency that would not be fixed against the renminbi. Now, there's a whole host of questions then that come to--to buy with that. You know, is that intended to segregate inward and outward capital flows away from the other currency? Is it something that's intended as a means of a--being a trade--international trade currency, or trade finance currency? Will Chinese industrialist in 10 years time insist that they're only going to pay you in--in digital renminbi instead of in dollars? </p><p>You know, there's a whole stack of questions that come about there for something that presumably would be, you know, somewhat stable, not entirely volatile. Presumably, the PBOC would have an interest in ensuring that that currency is--is not wildly fluctuating day to day and it retains some of its value, but it would not be fixed against the renminbi in that example. </p><p>BRUMMER: And-- </p><p>CARR: --Yep. So if I can make one more point. And well, you referred to Facebook, and you referred to the different treatments and definitions around the world. You know, the scenario I find really fascinating is, you know, are yourselves going to have individuals giving Facebook dollars in order to buy Facebook coins, or whatever it's called? When we get around and--and have the conversations with central bankers and regulators around the world, and we talk about, you know, \"Would you view the entrance of a big tech firm into finance?\" </p><p>You know, at what point do you start regulating them in the same way that you regulate a bank or an insurer or what? And quite a lot of central bankers will say, or supervisors will say that the tripwire is when they start taking deposits. And--and for that reason, a lot of them have--have steered clear of anything that could look like a deposit taking activity. But if individuals are putting their money into Facebook and being given Facebook coins, as a result, that starts to look a bit like a deposit. </p><p>KIM: Although it could too, I mean, what we've seen historically, not--is that, you know, it could just be money transmitters, too if they're not actually taking a deposit but offering a--a receiving to transmit on to another location. Now you see companies like Microsoft and others that have already received their licenses to be money transferred, a financial institution, but just a--a different than deposit taking financial institution. So there could be--it'll be interesting to see how that plays out in this scenario. </p><p>CARR: It's got a lot, perhaps, about the--the timing of the transactions and--and you know, whether or not consumers are being encouraged to, you know, deposit for some put--deposit, invest a--a chunk of money for some period for these tokens that they can then redeem in due course, and whether they're incentivize by coupons or discounts or somewhere else that--that starts to look a little bit like interest, or whether it's that you're just buying the tokens each time that you need them for the--the transaction, which would look more of a--a money transfer (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>KIM: Well, yeah, it will be interesting to see how it plays out because it could also be prepaid access. If you, you know, put $100 in and then you can use that-- </p><p>CARR: --Yeah-- </p><p>KIM: --use on the platform. </p><p>CARR: Yeah. </p><p>KIM: It will be interesting (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CARR: Maybe we'll find out on June 18 or--or maybe it'll be quite a long time after that. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, I know that Amy has actually taken a keen interest in the upcoming G20 conversations, not just, you know, the--the very question of--of money transmission has to do in part, and it depends on which state you're talking about. Money transmitter laws are--are largely state-based in the United States and they have to deal with some safety and soundness issues with individual money transmitters, and you have to sort of get a license and the like. When you get to the federal level, where you're not necessarily asking about money transmission, per se, but you're concerned about market integrity, money laundering, and the other issues that are sort of embedded in the flow of money, those kinds of issues start to take on an international dimension as well. And--and Amy, I know you've been very, very involved in thinking through some of the money laundering issues, and some of the approaches taken by international regulatory authorities. </p><p>We'll be having a conversation, obviously, about the European approach and--and differences between EU and--and U.S. regulators a bit later. But there does seem to be more coordination, or at least it's--it's higher on the--on the to-do-list is--is the--is the money laundering AML question. </p><p>Where--where is--what is the state of things? What do you predict in terms of new rules and new approaches coming out from the G20? </p><p>KIM: Yeah. Well, I mean, just to start to kind of for context, I mean, certainly, you know, Bitcoin being the first iteration of blockchain that we've seen. It was a peer-to-peer payment system that's triggered financial services concerns, so that's--and--and financial services regulatory concerns, whether it's a JP Morgan coin or securities laws or, you know, anti-money laundering. That's why we've seen a lot of headwinds, I think, in the financial services space and how do they apply? </p><p>The U.S. was a--a front runner, I think, in--in addressing that in 2013, with Treasury issuing their guidance, which determined that the exchangers and administrators in this space were money transmitters, and therefore, money's a type of financial institution, the money services business in the U.S. So then that's the U.S. Federal perspective and then what you're referencing is the FATF, the Financial Action Task Force is an inner governmental body, that puts out recommendations with respect to anti-money laundering that about 200 countries then, you know, trickle down and implement in their host country. </p><p>So what they're looking at now is, you know, in October, they created a concept called Virtual Assets, which is, I think, maybe the first time I've ever seen it called Virtual Assets by a government or governmental type body, and then applied the--certain of the AML recommendations that they make to what they're calling virtual assets service providers. So that raises a couple of questions. I mean, first of all, I'm sure we all know, virtual assets can actually be a pretty broad category. These aren't all financial instruments and-- </p><p>BRUMMER: --They're not all cryptocurrencies, necessarily. </p><p>KIM: Right. I mean, typically, like we've seen in the U.S., you've dealt with it as a--a--a substitute for funds or currency, you know, more like a substitute for money. Their definition goes a little bit beyond that, and it says, you know, use for payment or investment. And, you know, as we're seeing in the securities dynamic, what's--an investment can be blurred, or you could--some people can view it as an investment and some people could be using it as on a platform, which I think is a whole other thing we can all debate about, maybe at a another time. </p><p>But and so, so that kind of argument is going on, where does that fit? And there's one in particular that's going on right now, that's a bit of a hot topic for some, which is how to apply this with respect to a very specific wire transfer rule, which applies for transfers between financial institutions of $3,000 or more? In that case, you would have to obtain certain information about both the person originating the payment and the person receiving it. And so if you think about that in a blockchain context, what do you know about the person originating that and then what do you know about the person receiving it? And so that's where some of the consternation comes in and where regulators are looking for solutions. </p><p>BRUMMER: And there's been an interesting amount of back and forth and--and some contestation between industry and regulators on AML issues. I mean, the idea, obviously, is if you increasingly, not just pseudonymous, but increasingly anonymous-like transactions then that could-some be a gateway for everything from narco-trafficking, to terrorism finance, and--and other kinds of issues. And I've--I've heard as--as others probably have as--as well, that part of that Financial Action Task Force approach, which was originally sort of half of a paragraph has now sort of ballooned into sort of a multi-page analysis of--of trying to interpret an initial approach towards AML rules for--for virtual currencies. What--what exactly, to your understanding, is that point of friction between industry and the regulators on--on AML issues? </p><p>KIM: Yeah. I mean, I think one of the issues is how do you know where that money is going? You know, I think from a regulatory perspective, the--the very specific issue is about money or wire transfers, but I think the bigger issue, and those of you working traditional financial institutions, you need to know who your counter-parties are to a transaction. And so that's what traditional regulators are used to seeing. And then, so if you're looking at this and being told, \"Well, I don't know who's receiving the money,\" you know, that's where you kind of get that. And so those are some--that's where the rub is occurring. And--and yeah. </p><p>CARR: And the industry is gun shy about that, given the magnitude of fines that have occurred in the last few years that have been specifically related to--to not having sufficient KYC, not knowing your client, not knowing where the money's going. </p><p>But also that, you know, I think the irony here is, (INAUDIBLE) the G20 have started out from this perspective I've been concerned about. I've--I've concerned about cryptocurrencies being used for AML purposes. The irony is, they're going to come around, I think, to a view that the blockchain technology is actually central to a big part of the AML fix. And I think a lot of where we're headed in the next five years is going to be around developments in digital identity, where I think blockchain has a big role. </p><p>Just to give you a couple of figures. So the UK banks spend more on AML then the UK government spends on prisons. You know, there's enormous amount of money being put by--by every bank in the world into AML systems at the moment. And the catch rate is terrible. According to Interpol, we capture between 1 and 2 percent of the illicit activity. So it's--it's a terrible return on investment for the level of--of time and money that goes in to--to AML processes at the moment. So we have to get better and smarter at it and one part of it is digital identity solutions. And I think there's other commercial imperatives for--for digital identity besides AML. So I think that this is going to have some real momentum behind it. </p><p>But again, you know, you also look at things like the feeds on a white paper that found that turning on machine learning algorithms drove a--a 75 percent catch right on fraud. The difference being that in fraud, you've got a really good reference data set to work with and in AML it's scattered all over the place. And the banks have got restrictions that mean they can't even share information within their own firm across borders on AML threats. They can't share themselves on a firm-to-firm basis. They don't get a feedback loop from law enforcement so when they fill in these thousands of suspicious transaction reports that never find out which one of those went anywhere. So you don't have the depth of the reference data to train an algorithm to get better at AML. So I--I think you're going to see that--that for, you know, given that that magnitude of that problem and the desire to get better, digital identity with blockchain having a role within it is--is a big part of what we'll see in the next five years. </p><p>KIM: I would agree with you. I feel like, sorry, that this builds into a bigger question. You know, we're--this the G20 and the FATF recommendations really focused on this one little thing on wire transfers. But that's only a very specific type of transfer between financial institutions that is triggered at a threshold level. There's all these other things that companies are doing with respect to on-boarding customers, monitoring transactions, filing transactions reports, with law enforcement responding to subpoenas, holding accounts open so law enforcement can-- You know, I mean, there's a lot that goes on in an AML compliance program. And there's--there's many people that agree. I--I'm one of them that agree that I think we need to modernize how we look at AML-- </p><p>CARR: --Yep, definitely-- </p><p>KIM: --compliance and enforcement. And you know, things like your name, date of birth, address, and social security number in the U.S., I mean, I don't know, does anybody here think that that's private anymore? </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, that actually is a very good question, because we are going to our Q&amp;A for just one or two questions. We're on a very tight diplomatic schedule, not withstanding our drinks at the outset. And if there were any individuals with one or two questions, do feel free to--to ask our panelists. I do find it fascinating that, and we'll have a chance later to talk a little bit more, the one question that--that no one's really brought up is the question that is something a security or not? And even where you have a stable coin, there are certain kinds of questions that arise depending on how you stabilize a cryptocurrency and--and--and what are the methodologies and technologies and tactics used to--to stabilize and to maintain a certain price of--of crypto-asset and that becomes very important. It could even become important for Facebook and other companies. </p><p>I see, sir. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Is that when you announced (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>BRUMMER: Exactly. And I have a solution. </p><p>QUESTION: Bert Delia (SP), banking consultant here in town. </p><p>Going back to JPM Coin, one of the objections of JPM Coin is other banks won't want to deal with it. And there's a parallel on this. Years ago, when Bank of America launched its credit card there were other--other banks that were reluctant to facilitate Bank of America Card transactions, which is why Bank of America Card eventually got spun off from B of A. So question number one is, how is JPM going to deal with that? And question number two is where does Swift fit into this picture, given the massive role that they currently play in cross-border currency movement? </p><p>SWANSON: I'll take the JPM one. So I--I don't think that their goal is to be used by everybody at this stage. They're more than happy, from my conversations, to--to work within the customer base and counter-parties and build on and see--see if there is anyone. But to your point, yeah, why--why don't other commercial banks do this? Ideally, I guess if we look at a spectrum, it would be great to have a central bank issue with digital currency. I mean, we could talk about that. Happy to discuss some of--some of the other just conversations on the sinkhole of money flour, which the BIS talked about. </p><p>To--to your point there, Brad, there's several different models on--on how central banks could do that. But yeah, a JPM point isn't trying to be everything for everybody and including for all their commercial banks. </p><p>BRUMMER: Yeah, Swift, Brad, is that something you want to-- </p><p>CARR: Look, probably. I'll probably just add to that, that, you know, I think any, you know, bank issued coin is going to have a need for interoperability. And you don't want to have things fragmenting into a scenario where you have a, you know, a--a--a seller telling its buyers, \"I don't want to be paid in JP Morgan Coin. I want to be paid in HSBC Coin or City Coin or whatever,\" then you're just fragmenting the whole system. So I think everyone's got an interest in ensuring that we get past that and we have an interoperable approach. </p><p>Swift, look, you know, I think there's--you know, and you constantly see the debate in the press with Swift and the discussions they've had with the Ripple, I think, during the Cyborgs Conference that Swift ran last year. There was a running commentary of all the--the crypto evangelists posting things furiously on every social media channel bashing Swift at the time. </p><p>My own perception is that--that the blockchain technology, where it's at right at the moment, struggles to handle the volume of transactions to be able to completely, you know, replace the existing Swift infrastructure. Where I think blockchain is really good is when you've got a smaller volume of complex transactions, trade finance, corporate lines, syndicated lines, bond insurance. So, you know, that's my sense of where the--the use cases or where it's the--the best fit. But I realize I'm wading into an area where some people hold very, very passionate views so I'm sure there's some contrarians. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, just to piggyback on this. And I'm--I'm just curious. So if you're talking about Facebook, right, and you already have WhatsApp, so you--you kind of have a messaging system, right. So--so the question is, how do you then, you know, if you think of the--the sort of life-cycle of the transaction, of the messaging, and then you have the settlement. And the question is, you know, how do you scale up to be able to handle lots of different--different transactions? And I guess you could say the same even if you had a large retailer, you know, like Amazon, creating a--a--they came out with a--a Bezos coin or something, you could--you could figure out some-- Or the--they--they already have an internal messaging protocol system. It's going to be the--it's going to be how do you actually use the--the--the blockchain technology. </p><p>Some folks have said yourselves can batch them together, and then others have come up with other kinds of interesting ways of running parallel systems in order to sort of accommodate lots of--of value. Have you, Amy or Tim, have you heard or talk to any--any individuals as to how do you scale up for these kinds of large transactions to make them commercially feasible, particularly when you do have big tech and big finance entering into the space? </p><p>SWANSON: Real quick. Who's ever used WeChat or WeChat Pay, anybody? Everyone puts their hands down. They don't want be doxed. All right. Well, I used to live in China. I worked at there for five years. I have WeChat so feel free to hack my phone, whoever you want to. I actually couldn't use WeChat Pay because I didn't have, out here in America, I don't have access to a Chinese bank. But yeah, they--they process, you know, gazillions of dollars a day, or--or a RMB's worth of money a day, and they don't need a blockchain. I'm not saying you need to have a blockchain but it's still unclear. That's why I'm saying once we find on the 18th, hopefully, they'll clear things up because right now, it doesn't make sense to me. </p><p>CARR: Probably the one of the things about is, you know, we shouldn't view the technology as static. And, you know, whilst I see some of those limitations in the technology today, you know, what's decided that in five years time that's still going to be the case. And you have things like quantum computing that are, you know, now coming out of the universities and going into commercial and R&amp;D. If that's hitting some sort of inflection point where that can be overlaid or built into other solutions. You know, we shouldn't assume that the--the technology--technology limitations that apply now will--will be forever. </p><p>KIM: Yeah. And we see new things every--every day. So, you know, with what we're seeing now in a year or two there may be a new solution for that. </p><p>BRUMMER: We have two questions up front and apparently one in back. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Well, yeah. Next we'll--we'll come up front. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. It seems like innovation has come in waves in different phases. Information Technology sort of led the way with a lot of innovation over the past--over the past few decades. In the last decade, finance caught up and I didn't think that they were going to move so quickly but they seem to be moving more quickly. Sort of wrapping up the rear, we have governance and--and legal frameworks and constructs. Where do you see opportunities to innovate in governance, and these constructs that we have inherited in order to advance some of the things that Information Technology and other industries are trying to advance today? </p><p>CARR: So I guess, there's broader view across the financial sector, where are the opportunities? Look, a lot of the--and so I'm--I'm from a--a center where we have 40 bank CEOs and chairs on our board from the biggest firms around the world. The view I often hear is that the single biggest innovation they're--they can make in the business at the moment is getting more things onto the cloud faster. And indeed, you know, then running into the issues that the whole industry is largely reliant on three cloud service providers. And also that regulators around the world in different markets have differing views as to their level of comfort and their requirements for cloud. </p><p>So you have some--some restrictions and fragmentation that can arise from that or that your--your business case becomes that you can implement cloud for 40 percent of your business, where you've got a regulator who's got on board with the technology. I think that's the--the--the number one and I highlight that in the sense, that most banks are the result of lots of mergers and acquisitions that have occurred over the years. So they're coming from a starting point where not only do they have a 1970s or 80s mainframe base, but they actually have fragmented systems all over the place. And that cloud is--is therefore, a critical enabler to being able to get all of your data into a single data like where you--you can then run the sort of machine learning analytics and other that you really need to be able to, not only to manage your business from a risk management sense, but identify catch the bad guys in an ALM fraud sense, but also to be able to deliver the--the personalization and--and immediacy that customers increasingly are coming to expect because they--they've been exposed to that in other industries. </p><p>So to--to me, that's number one. You know, I think the--the other--I alluded to machine learning and the--the growth of that, both in commercial areas and--and risk management is significant. We'll have another report on that out shortly. But the other piece that we see, probably less in the U.S. but elsewhere, is the emphasis on open API's. That's been heralded by open banking, by PSD3, and the European Union. Open banking is proceeding now in--in Canada, Mexico, and Japan, and Hong Kong, and Australia, as well. And I think this is where we may see the emergence of, you know, platform-based banking in a--in a mix of guises. </p><p>You know, on one hand it will be the tech firms that come in and provide a platform and then market bank products on that platform. But it's also where you see some banks like Erste in Austria or an SEB in Sweden, that have really been at the forefront of saying, \"We want to be the platform. And we're going to provide the customer facing platform in which other banks products and FinTech firms products can be marketed on our platform because we see that as being the--the integral way of managing the customer relationship of the future.\" </p><p>And I guess as a final comment, I'd circle from that back to my earlier comment about digital identity. If you want to be the platform provider you're going to need to be able to do the digital identity that comes with that. And the digital identity that you provide is going to need to be interoperable with other digital identity frameworks as well. </p><p>SWANSON: Please. So, yeah, one other comment, and it's good to see you. It's been a long time, since last year. Actually, I actually when it's light. </p><p>So if you're looking for kind of an interesting example of weird governance that hasn't really worked out in--at least in the cryptocurrency world, there's this entity called Maker DAO. Has anyone ever heard of Maker DAO? And they has something called the DAI, which is supposed to be a stable coin. Anyways, they--as much as--and again, I'm going--I guess I'm going to--this is being recorded. So somebody's going call me a Federal Reserve show. And that's totally fine. </p><p>But with the Federal Reserve, we at least know who's participating in meetings, we know who's the governance body, we know when they produce reports and notes. With--with Maker, they have these calls in which we don't know--for--for all the talk about transparency, we don't only don't know who's necessarily taking part of the calls, but during the--the vote, who owns these votes, you have--or the--the voting process, you actually had some VC firms, so over a year ago, that bought a stake in these tokens. So as much as we--we had this discussion in the last couple years or number of years, about participation in--in governance, you actually have venture funds that are determining, for example, the interest rate on--on a token, and in this case, it went up to 19 percent. So ignoring their usury laws that--that may be an impacted here, the fact that we don't have transparency in some of these projects. And again, if you're from Maker, I'm sorry, I still have your shirts. It's nothing personal. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BRUMMER: Great. A question here. </p><p>QUESTION: As we start to see institutional money come in, the endowments, the crypto funds, the trust, no FDIC type thing set up, do you think it's too soon? What's your kind of feel on that? Because you're starting to see the last couple quarters, a lot of 30 and 20 and 15 from groups, not just retirement systems and, you know, people of that nature are not individuals anymore. </p><p>BRUMMER: Okay, great. We're going to just skip this question. And then a very brief 20 second question. In this lighting, I did not even know that our guest of honor was here. I apologize. Did you want to ask very, very briefly your question? </p><p>QUESTION: I have a couple of quick questions about AML. And to the extent that there's the urban legend out there that everything is reported to the blockchain. How do you--how do you all deal with that issue? Because when you have exchanges which have Omnibus accounts, which do all these internal transactions, which never make it to the blockchain, how do you assure yourself that you haven't had a double spend issue? </p><p>Secondly, I'd note, because we have someone from Europe here, the recent action with respect to closing down a mixing or tumbling operation, which is used to basically obscure who owns what on blockchain reported transactions. So to the extent that there's this theory that you've got a perfect view of what's going on, because it's reported to the blockchain, I don't think that's true and I'd like to hear why that's not--my view isn't true. </p><p>BRUMMER: So I'm going to take, because I know that our guests is on a very tight schedule, I'm going to take, unfortunately, the moderator's prerogative to continue that discussion afterwards because we still have drinks left-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--and move directly to our keynote. I--I do apologize. I--I just did not know he was here. So I think we are going to applaud our guests. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We will answer these questions afterwards, and move to the second part. Yep, this way. Thank you. Thanks. </p><p>RESNIK: All right, thanks again for that great conversation. And thanks again to our panelists, Brad, Amy and Tim, for joining us. And as Chris said, it's time for our keynote interview with Mr. Steven Maijoor. Mr. Maijoor has been the chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, since taking up office in April of 2011. He's the first chair of the Authority and is currently serving his second five year term. He's responsible for representing the authority, as well as chairing ESMA's Board of Supervisors and the management board. The role of the board of supervisors is to give strategic guidance to ESMA and make all main regulatory and supervisory decisions. </p><p>Please join me in welcoming Mr. Maijoor. And Chris, the floor is yours. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BRUMMER: Mr. Maijoor, thank you so much for coming here. As you can see, there's quite a bit of interest in what's happening in Europe and an appreciation for how many of those decisions can impact the--the American marketplace, both the securities marketplace, and the derivatives marketplace, and the FinTech marketplace. </p><p>As a professor, I--I tend to look at your job as--as very interesting and at times a bit difficult. European member states are having their own differences of opinion from time to time on the treatment of different kinds of financial products and--and--and how they should go about viewing cryptocurrencies in particular. What would you view as the pillars, if one will, of the understanding of how to go about thinking through the application of--of EU law to cryptocurrencies? I know you've gone through a consultative report and a process where you're trying to analyze and assess how your different members are--are viewing cryptocurrencies and regulating them. Where do you--where do things stand at this at this moment? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Thank you very much, Chris, and--and very good to be here and thank you very much for the invitation to be at Georgetown University. </p><p>The--so as you probably are aware, so in Europe, obviously, we're--we're coming from a history with a--a large number of different financial markets. And basically, there's been work in the EU in--in the past, you know, going back to, basically, 40 years, trying to integrate these--these financial markets. And--and--and it goes back to the whole notion is that when you have scale, when you have bigger integrated capital markets, that ultimately, that would be beneficial. And so across all areas where ESMA is active, obviously, we're trying to be consistency and--and trying to improve cross border financial transactions, financial market transactions. That is--that is the key element we're trying to achieve. </p><p>Going on, specifically, on to maybe because that ties in probably most closest to the previous discussion, we are looking from a securities markets perspective to crypto-assets. So there's also, obviously, a lot of interest in the previous discussions, there was a lot of the payments issues, we're--we're more looking into that from a securities markets issue. And we're basically, we have taken the position and it was reflected in your comment on the advice, is that if it is a financial instrument, you know, if it looks like a financial instrument you should treat it like a financial instrument. And ultimately, that is a--a--a supervisory reduction. Although there are small differences across the member states what is precisely a financial instrument, which is quite surprising to some extent, if you look at it from a distance. You know, if you want integrate capital markets, at least you won't have the same definition of what a financial instrument is. </p><p>But by and large, we have reasonably common definitions around that, typically, there needs to be transfer ability, there needs to be a profit right. And so what we have done is in the exercise in India of crypto-assets, we have asked, basically, our--our national regulators, \"Here are six examples of crypto-assets. Would you qualify those as--as financial instruments, yes or no?\" And basically, depending on the type of crypto-asset it was, whether it was a utility type, whether it's payment type, or whether it's the investment type, there was commonality on the number of them being needing to be qualified and described as a financial instrument. </p><p>That brings you to the logic that if it's like a financial instrument you should regulate it like a financial instrument that has far reaching implications because once you are a financial instrument, you are put in the whole regulatory world so not only are you talking about possibly a prospectus, not only talking about clearing, we're talking about can it be used by asset managers? And so that is a big decision once it is a financial instrument. But we took the position, if it's a financial instrument, if it has the same characteristics--characteristics that should be regulated and supervised like a financial instrument. </p><p>So national supervisors are now moving into that direction. And so we know that now a number of them have been vetted under their national systems as a financial instrument and so they are brought within the regulatory remit. I think the big question is, and maybe being a bit critical on--on the development, to what extent will it survive once it needs to meet the regulatory requirements? Or to frame it in a different way, to what extent was it successful because it--it was outside of the regulatory remit? By bringing into the regulatory remit it cannot be, you know, because some of it might be, some of the benefits might have been related precisely to avoid regulation. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, certainly in the United States we have a very similar conversation going on. When you say financial instrument, we're thinking, is it a security or is it not a security? And obviously, if--if a financial instrument--instrument or--or a cryptocurrency is a security then you're brought into the wonderful world of our colleagues across the street over at the Securities and Exchange Commission. But one of the things that we don't have, which I think the European position is, is--is by definition much more interesting, is that because it's a federal question entirely, both in terms of an enforcement and also--well, although I guess the state regulators can also get involved, but largely the--the definitional question comes from the U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence, you don't have the same degree, perhaps, of jostling and competition in terms of building up local financial markets, as perhaps, in--in the European Union, where there's a real interest by some of the member states to early into this space and--and in financial innovation, more--more--more generally in order to build up their financial centers. </p><p>How is it and what--what kind of guidance can ESMA play in helping to facilitate that, particularly in a world where you're also dealing with--with Brexit and--and the folks in the UK seeking to create their own financial centers? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Okay. These are many, many different issues in--in--in one question. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So--so first of all, generally, where for those of you who--who don't know ESMA that well, so we are a European body. And while day to day supervision is typically still at a national level, although for some areas, it is at our level. So for example, credit rating agencies and--and some benchmarks and--and also regarding CCPs will get direct supervisory powers. And so but the--the basic model in Europe is--is day to day supervision at a national level. But by entrance into one national market, you'll not only get entry to that financial market, you get entry to the whole of the 28 and that create, you know, creates all kinds of incentive issues. </p><p>To what extent that does that national regulator not only take into account the benefits for--for that member state, or the risk to that member state, but also takes into the wider implications for the whole of Europe. And so that is where, basically, ESMA comes in, is to make sure that those national supervisory and regulatory decisions are there to make sure that the whole European perspective is taken into account. To say it more bluntly, you can see that there might be some incentives to build a financial center without, you know--if most of the customers and clients are somewhere else in Europe, not having sufficient focus on the risk that you might be creating, instead, focus on the, you know, the benefits that a strong financial center might bring in terms of developing more economic activity, et cetera. </p><p>And so there is an important role for us to ensure consistency across--across the EU. Maybe first go back to the crypto-asset issue. And then because I think you're also mentioned Brexit if I listened carefully. So first on crypto-assets. So once it is determined to be a financial instrument we will--we will try and we have some--we have some instruments to make sure that the national regulators are as consistent as possible, where we have seen some of the national financial centers trying to, you know, to--to give a kind of a crypto-asset flavor to their financial center and trying to get that label. </p><p>The reality is that that is only possible for those assets, crypto-assets, which are outside of--which are not a financial instrument. And so there's more freedom there because that is basically then for the national regulators to decide. But there we have advice to the European Commission, to say and to the--to the EU political institutions, to say we need to have at least some risk warnings around those in AML. There's been a lot already a discussions on email, because that is an area where--where we see specific risk for crypto-assets. </p><p>Going to the Brexit issue, where and I think there are so many things to be said about Brexit, but I--I think you focused on the issue around regulatory competition, and how do we ensure consistency. One area where you can--so to prepare for Brexit, what is happening is that financial market participants are relocating from the UK to the EU 27, because they know that in the case of a no deal Brexit, or in the longer term, when the--when there's an orderly Brexit, is that there are problems in terms of the recognition of UK market participants. You know, having a license now in the UK is, of course, completely recognized across the EU. That will end for, you know, certainly in the case of a no deal Brexit. And so market participants are relocating from London to multiple financial centers. </p><p>Interestingly, it's not--there is not one big winner. It's going to different centers. You can see Dublin getting extra activity. Luxembourg, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, there's--there's some specialization, some focusing on asset management, someone on--on trading venues. Where our interest is to make sure is that there is no regulatory competition in the sense that these relocations, you can see the incentive to say, \"Come over here to my financial center. You will get the license for your entry to Europe but you can do it with a very little entity, with very little substance.\" And obviously, that is where ESMA comes in. And we say, \"We need to make sure that we have common standards for receiving this business.\" </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, this is a natural shift to a set of questions with clearinghouses. But I--before I get there, I did want to ask one question, which I find fascinating and maybe you could--you could help clarify. In the United States there are some conversations, particularly on the Hill, about cryptocurrencies that are not necessarily regulated or deemed to be securities from a U.S. securities law perspective, but still are sort of in this in between zone and there's a sense that they should somehow be subject to some kind of enhanced disclosures or--or--or something of the like. But given just the way in which our regulatory process works, that kind of directive won't and couldn't come from the SEC, because it's not within their mandate and it's not within their authority, and it's not coming from the CFTC either. And--and CFTC Chairman Giancarlo has gone to the Hill to sort of ask for a bit more of that authority. </p><p>To the extent to which, however, that lays within your authority to--to look at some of those crypto-assets, I assume that that approach, whenever completed in concert between ESMA and the commission and--and perhaps Parliament, that that would be for any such security within the block and therefore, it would be something that the rest of the world would have to think about in terms of the approach taken--taken by Europe. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Yes. So if I'm--I'm not sure whether I fully understand. So first of all, if we make EU law, obviously, you know, that is applicable all across the EU. </p><p>BRUMMER: I'm trying to softly ask about extraterritoriality. </p><p>MAIJOOR: No, so okay, okay. So first of all, in the EU, is, you know, all EU law is--once it is a regulation or directive, it applies across the EU. And when it's a directive there is some discussion how its implemented, but it needs to be implemented. When it's a regulation it is--it is directly applicable. </p><p>I think, on the issue around what should we do for securities that are not--or sorry, (INAUDIBLE) that--that look or smell or ceased received by investors or retail investors, like--and--and like a financial instrument, like a investment, but in reality are, according to the legal definition not. I think that is a very difficult area, because on the one hand, we want to be careful to say, \"Let's not legitimize it like a financial instrument.\" And so if you bring it into a kind of a bespoke regulatory regime you want to be careful not to treat it like a, you know, full supervising regulatory framework. On the other hand, there's precisely the issue around there should be sufficient risk, you know, risk indicators and to warn retail consumers around when they would buy this, although, in reality would not be a--a security. </p><p>On the issue of, interestingly, the extraterritoriality. The--of course, extraterritoriality has a bad name. But in reality, the flip side of this is--is a level playing field between--it is the--the flip side of having global markets and a level playing field. And so to--to, you know, to explain that better, if you--if you have an open EU capital market where you allow foreign marketplace to participate, which I think is completely right, you know, you want to have markets where there's broad participation, but you want to have a level playing field between the EU market players and the ones coming from outside the EU, also, you know, participating in that capital market providing services, that is a level playing field. </p><p>Then what is the implication is that you would say, \"Okay, you can provide your services in the EU. You can--you know, we can talk about clearing. We can talk about, you know, trading venues. We can talk about asset management in different areas.\" But you would basically say, \"If you provide services in the EU.\" That's fine coming from outside, but you need to live by the same rules for the EU clients.\" Obviously, it would not be around giving obligations for non-EU clients. But that, of course, is, you know, in the popular terms, seen as extraterritoriality because it goes back to the questions then outside the EU, if we want to provide those clients it means, you know, we have seen it with unbundling. </p><p>Unbundling was the--is the separation of execution and research in the case of research provided by brokers to--to their asset managers. We have asked for unbundling. The only thing we ask is that if there would be, for example, brokers from outside the EU providing services to EU asset managers just to say, \"It cannot be the case that as a non-EU provider and broker you don't have to unbundle while the EU broker has to unbundle.\" You would say, \"You need to do it. You need to live by those rules.\" But obviously, that has raised the debate here in the U.S., which is still ongoing, on, you know, to what extent should that be a common model? </p><p>And I think it's part of being a global market. You know, but it is an implication of having global markets and wanting to have a level playing field. And of course, the more different the rules are on a national or regional basis, the bigger this issue is. And therefore, it's so important to try to get at least international global standards, because the more you have them the less there will be these kinds of frictions. </p><p>BRUMMER: Well, one of the most global industries is the clearing industry and--and under your remit and already lies this question of--of clearinghouses, which service customers from around the world and trillions of dollars run through the world's clearinghouses. As you may know, CFDC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo has, or at least plans to, to provide for a CFDC vote relatively soon, a mutual recognition package for non-United States clearinghouses but allowing, in effect, non-U.S. clearinghouses to--to operate in the United States to the extent to which they are deemed to be roughly equivalent or--or comparable to or subject to regulatory regimes that are roughly comparable to that of the United States. </p><p>But there is a condition attached and--and that condition is that in order to enjoy this kind of recognition it would have to be, in effect, mutual and that the non-U.S. clearinghouse would have to be operating in a country that provides that kind of recognition to the United States. There are a lot of--there's a lot in that question, too. What is your sense, where does the equivalence process stand now? And--and even before, if--if you wish, you know, maybe it's useful just to walk people through what are you thinking through and--and what are your priorities at this point in time when you are--are--are trying to operationalize equivalents in the United (INAUDIBLE) of--in Europe, as--as pertaining to a non-EU counterpart--CCPs? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Yes. So this is much talked about also, you know, today and yesterday it was that today at the--at CFDC, at the Emmerich and--and also had some other meetings at the--at the CFDC. So I think it's important to have a bit of a history here. </p><p>So Europe has had equivalence mechanisms already for a number of years. And while it is a--and the--the implication of the equivalence is that once equivalence is provided is that the EU fully relies on the foreign regulator and the foreign regulatory system. And so when equivalence is declared, basically the EU says from those jurisdictions, for this part of the market, so it's never equivalent across the board for all financial markets, it's, you know, it is it goes from credit rating agencies to--to--to clearing, for trading venues, and--and they are slightly different then so you need to look at a piece, you know, law by law what precisely equivalence means. But generally, it means is that these foreign market participants can basically fully participate in the EU markets while the EU fully relies on the local, you know, the home country rules and home country supervision. </p><p>Generally, that is a good system, but you should also realize is that, ultimately, it might--it gets to the point is that as Europe you have no tools at all, nothing, in--in such a situation to even say, \"I want to have more information on debt market participants. Because they are very active in the EU there might be certain risks and I want to understand what those risks are. And if I have seen those risks I want to--I want to address those risks or maybe have a supervisory tool to respond to those risks.\" </p><p>And so the equivalence system, as we have had until very recently, is a system where the ultimate consequence is full reliance, we're doing it, we're doing it in various areas. But you can understand and we have made a point already, before Brexit, that this is, in some cases, not the right model. In some cases you want to be sure that you can assess the specific risks that might be coming from outside the EU from financial market participants from outside the EU, for the EU because we're not sure whether that has the same priority in the, let's say, in the ranking for that regulator in--in the--in the other country. </p><p>And so we start, you know, we have started to change our thinking on that. And obviously, our thinking has accelerated because of Brexit. We know that the UK will continue to be, for the foreseeable--foreseeable years, the most important financial market for the EU. Is it appropriate for a financial--for a region to--you need to rely on a financial center. Your main financial center is outside of your region. But in addition to that, if you would take the consequence of the current equivalent system, you are fully--you need to fully rely on--on the local regulators. They're very professional. We work very well with them but also it's from an incentive standpoint, the right mechanism to have. </p><p>That is the reason that we said we need to change our equivalent systems. And so you can see that in various parts of EU law where this is changing. So it's not only changing for CCPs, but for example, it is also changing for investment firms. There are a large number of the investment firms from outside the EU providing their services in the EU. And again, equivalence would mean here full--full reliance on the third country regulator. And so that is the reason we have said we need to change the system, but again, only when in the case of CCP, it is--it can be relevant from a systemic perspective. </p><p>So only CCPs that might be relevant from a systemic perspective would be in the category where you would have additional supervisory tools. For those that are not in the category, that are not relevant from a systemic perspective, they would continue to have the possibility of full equivalents, full reliance. And also, even within the category where we would have certain supervisory tools and where the EU regulatory requirements would apply directly, there is the possibility of comparable compliance and so you would rely there, but on a--you need to make that assessments on a requirement by requirement basis what do you can rely there on the home country regulation of that CCP. </p><p>BRUMMER: Is--is there a sense in terms of the timing by which or--or--or the order at which you're proceeding in terms of granting equivalents to those non-EU based CCPs? Is there a sense as to when that process will be fully completed in light of the timing created if, for no other reason, externally by--by Brexit or a potential departure from it? </p><p>MAIJOOR: So--so the--so first of all, all these equivalence decisions have been--you know, we have already done a large number of equivalence decisions regarding--regarding countries outside the EU. For--for CCPs, we currently have 34 third country CCPs recognized with ESMA so they can fully participate in--in the EU market. The--the key next--the key step would be, of course, which--which will continue to be tier one CCPs, and which would be eligible or need to be in the tier two category, where you would have the--the supervisory powers and the direct application of EU law. </p><p>The process we are in, we have just published our consultation papers on key elements of this law, which is around (INAUDIBLE) and around the comparable compliance. So everybody can now react to those consultation papers. We plan to give our advice to the commission by the end of this year. And then the commission has a maximum of one year to implement those delegated acts or to decide on their--their delegated acts. And then after these delegated acts are there, the actual decision on tier one and tier two, we'll start off to that. And so it depends a bit whether the commission--so to have a--so we expect that the--the form of law will be in the official journal by the end of this year. That will,--from that moment on the clock will start ticking for the delegated act, the relevant laws that are especially relevant for third country CPCs. The commission need to decide on these within a year, but they could get quicker if they, you know, if they can decide quicker. And then only after that we can start our process regarding tier one and tier two. </p><p>BRUMMER: I know that they are going to be one or two questions for the audience. I did want to end with one question as we--as we find folks, and feel free to raise your hand, is with the Capital Markets Union. Obviously, we started off with cryptocurrencies, then we talked about clearinghouses, which are really the ultimate FinTech in many ways. Is the--are there any agenda items right now relating to FinTech, to your knowledge, that are on the table when it comes to the development of the Capital Markets Union? </p><p>MAIJOOR: I think the--so first of all, we need--Europe is a financial system with a too large banking sector, we paid a high price for that also in the financial crisis. I think you can make a point that having a better balance between the banking system and the non-banking system is that you can make the financial system more stable. And you will understand that in these discussions, the U.S. is frequently mentioned as, you know, the example where you have much more successful--well, capital markets are much deeper and--and they play a bigger role in the--in the economy and the financial system. We should--we should do the--you know, we--we should push for that, where Europe has been working on it for--for many decades already. And so I'm sure that the next European Commission will, again, work on that. </p><p>I think where technology comes in is where--one area where we think there needs to be much more improvements, is around cheaper distribution of products to retail consumers, you know, more standardization, more robo advice, more transparency on costs. We would hope that technology helps there to make sure that we get a better deal for--for the end consumer. </p><p>Currently, as a consumer, we can see that in our day to day lives is that there's been the biggest progress, at least how I see it, is--is in the payments area, our banking apps, how we can do the payments so much easier in our family, how we can now get better deals in terms of when we are in--in the U.S. and having a better rate for exchanging the U.S. dollar against the euro. And so in the payments area, we--I--you can see, and I'm personally I experienced as a client, how much progress there has been there. I can really see that there's been so much benefit to the consumer. I think that is not as far yet in securities markets. But there I would hope that in terms of standardization of advice, making it more inclusive advice, which is available for also people with a smaller purse, and more transparency of financial products, that they're--especially technology can help. </p><p>Other areas, there is where, of course, we're working on is--is things like cloud issues. Supervisory issues are very important for us. Cybersecurity risks are important for us. We're working on that. </p><p>BRUMMER: And that would be at the Capital Markets Union level? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Well, on the--I think on the capital markets unions, especially I--I think the distribution, cheaper distribution, more transparent distribution, I would--you know, we have seen in so many parts of our lives how services have improved because of technology. Securities markets have been lagging a--a bit there. And--and I think it--it will be--that is the area where I see the opportunity. </p><p>BRUMMER: Fascinating. </p><p>Are there any questions from our audience? This reminds me of my law school course. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Afraid of the regulator to--to raise your hand. </p><p>MAIJOOR: There's one. </p><p>BRUMMER: All right, excellent. </p><p>MAIJOOR: He--he saves it. </p><p>BRUMMER: He does save it. </p><p>MAIJOOR: He's there. </p><p>QUESTION. Hi. My name is President Sibbett. I'm a--a postdoctoral fellow at the Global Governance Center, at the Graduate Student Union in Switzerland. </p><p>I'm just wondering what thought ESMA has given in terms of developing regulations to assert European strategic autonomy in relations to U.S. sanctions, and particularly, as it relates to the--in the area of cryptocurrencies and what can be created there? Thank you. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Sorry, on which area? </p><p>QUESTION: Strategic autonomy from U.S. sanctions and U.S. regulations. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Well, I--I think probably I would not be--you know, this is--this is not the, let's say, the typical area of the--of a securities markets regulator. And so I'm--I'm getting into territory where I do it more, basically, as a--as a reader of newspapers than with the expertise knowledge. But we--we know, but just to convey that message, we know that there are discussions around-- You know, one of the implications of sanctions and effectiveness also is very much related to the role of the currency that it plays in global trade. And we--we very much know that the U.S. dollar has been much more successful in that respect than the euro. </p><p>I think, what is interesting there, I think the--so far the formal position has been, from most of the central bankers that I know, is that they are say, you know, whether--whether the euro would be a, let's say, a global currency that is used trade, if we are neutral visa vi that position, you can see, at least I've seen some signals, that you can see that that is changing by some of the central banking and some in the central bank community. </p><p>BRUMMER: And certainly, when it comes to the AML issues, one thing I noticed, just reading the--the earlier consultative reports, is that from ESMA and--and from the EBA, is that there does seem, and it's not the same thing as sanctions, but on the AML and a conversation that we had just in the preceding panel, that there does seem to be a lot of energy and--and--and work towards pushing through a very unified approach, and an upgraded approach towards any AML related issues, both in your Europe and--and globally. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Just to, because I--just to--one other part of the coin, I know that there's been and I--maybe that's the--the--the other part of your--your question, so we know that there's been sanctions in certain--certain countries, you know, outside of the--outside of the EU. If you're talking about sanctions by, let's say, regulators from the U.S. visa vi European finance or market participants, in principle, I think that is part of a system where you, without going into individual cases and whether they are right or wrong in individual cases, but I think the consequence of global capital markets, where you have supervision at a--at a national or regional level is, and if there would be a foreign market participant active in the EU and they will do--you know, they would not live by the EU rules, I think it is--it is right to be sanctions in--in that case. </p><p>And so maybe that is the other part of your question or the issue you're referring to. But in principle, I think that is a--a possibility that is related to the fact that you have global capital markets, that if you provide services cross border, there are--is there is indeed, the possibility that if--if those services are provided cross border, but they don't meet the--the--the relevant rules and regulations in that country, is that you can be sanctioned. </p><p>BRUMMER: Given the cross border, and I--this is a way to maybe, perhaps, tie up the earlier panel with--with this one, from ESMA's perspective, when you hear about companies like Facebook, or JP Morgan and other companies, big tech, entering into the space, do you have any--any thoughts, observations? Does--does this percolate to the--to--to your--to your to-do-list when you see these companies themselves thinking about creating alternative, or--or I shouldn't say alternative, but creating virtual currencies that, obviously, are going to be, in--in the case of Facebook, potentially used all over the world and--and--and within the European Union? </p><p>MAIJOOR: Well, obviously, as far as, you know, what--what I my understanding, so far, this is more in--in--and you call it also currency and so it would be more for the banking regulators to work on that. But obviously, on ICOs, on crypto-assets with an investment, a characteristic on these things we talk, you know, we talked globally, we talk to each other. We, in (INAUDIBLE) we inform each other about our experiences. This is an area where, as a regulator, you need to be humble, you need to be--you try to understand these new developments. And so there is a global regulatory community thinking about these issues. We know that the FSB is involved into analyzing crypto-assets and--and I think that--is that is only logical. Typically, these new developments, you need all the brainpower and--and the--the expertise to address those issues. And so, you know, obviously, talking about these issues on a--on a global basis among regulators is very important. </p><p>BRUMMER: And with the public. </p><p>Thank you so very much for your time. It's been immensely useful for the Washington community. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MAIJOOR: Thank you very much. </p><p>BRUMMER: Thank you, sir. </p><p>MAIJOOR: Thank you. </p><p>BRUMMER: Thank you. Appreciate it. </p><p>RESNIK: All right. Thank you, Chris and Mr. Maijoor, for the fascinating discussion, and a special thank you to Georgetown University Law Center for hosting us this evening. </p><p>Two things to leave you with. First, a quick reminder to subscribe to Chris's FinTech Beat podcast, now available on iTunes and in fact, tonight's interview with Mr. Maijoor will be the next episode. And second, the bar is still open-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--so feel free to enjoy. That concludes our programming for tonight. Thank you so much for coming and we look forward to seeing you at our next event. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCN-2NG1-JDPT-T4FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.
