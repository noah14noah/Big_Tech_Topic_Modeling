This summer, the very same city hosted the G7 meetings, and one of the hot topics addressed within this high level forum very much reflects this beautiful song. Yes, it would indeed be nice to have globally consistent competition enforcement keeping up with the rapid evolution of the digital economy.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under the French presidency\u2019s initiative, the G7 countries\u2019 competition authorities, together with the European Commission, kicked off a joint reflection about the future of competition law and policy for the digital markets, driven by big data and platform-based business models. In July 2019, they shared  with the G7 Finance ministers their \u2018Common Understanding\u2019 on key principles to address the upcoming challenges triggered by the transformation of our economies in the digital age.</p><p>One of the main drivers of this joint initiative is the increasing globalisation of markets with more and more global players, global services and global users. Individual national authorities often lack the powers to address competition law problems effectively when the facts at stake are not confined to national territories. The Common Understanding therefore outlines the G7 competition authorities\u2019 joint views on whether competition rules are well suited for the digital economy, and how they should be adapted and more harmonised going forward. This debate started a while ago and has been in the spotlight of CoRe from the beginning, both in our publications and in our regular conferences. So obviously we had to take a closer look at this G7 initiative. </p><p>There is little doubt that this is an interesting and important process, but it appears that the high level conclusions in the Common Understanding do not present many genuine novelties. To start with, the authorities are in agreement that they all play an important role in the digital economy. Rather unsurprisingly, competitive markets are seen as the key to well-functioning economies, and the benefits of the digital economy can best be achieved if this remains so. The authorities also agree that competition law enforcement will continue to play an important role in safeguarding trust in digital markets, ensuring economic dynamism, incentives to innovate, and consumer benefits. This is not really new either, but it is always good to share common ground in order to have a meaningful discussion about what works well and what needs to be improved. </p><p>In this regard, we find ourselves in the middle of a passionate debate about the need, or not, for more upfront regulation to address certain challenges posed by digital markets. Those advocating stricter rules, typically smaller rivals of big tech companies, as well as consumer groups, take the view that competition rules may not always be suited to effectively prevent and address distortions of competition by the leading global players. In this respect, the G7 initiative indeed identifies certain substantial challenges, eg due to multi-sided platform models, as well as procedural hurdles for effective enforcement, eg data gathering and duration of proceedings. However, the main conclusion is that existing competition laws are flexible enough and generally fit for purpose, also in the digital era.  </p><p>The recent enforcement practice indeed shows that competition authorities have strict tools and considerable flexibility for applying them in order to tackle anticompetitive conduct in the digital economy. However, the system also has its shortcomings, and proposals have already been made to sharpen the tools. For instance, the French-German Manifesto, published earlier this year, advocated for stricter rules on abusive conduct by dominant (data-driven) players. It will be interesting to see if any such proposals will still be tabled, and how the new Commission under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen will view them. </p><p>These reforms, or any other need to amend the existing competition rules, are however not addressed by the group at all, although this would be in its own best interest. The EU\u2019s recent ECN+ initiative would have provided a good basis for spreading certain procedural best practices. But all this is not mentioned in the Common Understanding. Instead it is considered important that competition authorities have tools and means to deepen their knowledge of new business models and their impact on competition, eg through market studies, sector inquiries and the like. One would guess that they have these already, and it would have been nice to hear from the group what new tools could be added going forward.</p><p>Reform proposals about additional sector-specific rules to prevent certain forms of anti-competitive conduct are not really considered either by the G7. While consumer protection and data privacy laws are recognised as complementary to the competition rules, there seems to be a certain form of distrust by competition authorities about ex ante rules addressing more genuine competition law issues, such as third party access for instance. Such rules may not be very popular for competition authorities, for not leaving enough scope for facts-based, case-by-case decisions with drastic sanctions. This might explain why they are not covered in the Common Understanding.</p><p>Instead, the group rather states that regulations can harm competition by increasing the cost of entry and entrenching incumbents. This certainly depends on how these rules are shaped and applied, but they have proved to be very useful in other network industries, where competition law and ex ante regulation have co-existed for many years. Here they are generally deemed - and praised - to strengthen each other and achieve better results than each of them alone. It would indeed be interesting to check more thoroughly in how far some form of unbundling, third party access obligations and cost-based access prices might be more effective than the existing competition rules alone in digital markets. Maybe such a broader exercise could be part of the next steps for the joint G7 process. The competition authorities have already agreed to share their knowledge to promote a competitive digital marketplace. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice?</p><p>Finally, in their joint statement, the Seven recognize the importance of promoting greater international cooperation and convergence in the application of competition laws. Given the borderless nature of the digital economy, this seems to be yet another rather obvious claim. CoRe, both with our journal and our events, will seek to contribute to this debate in the years to come. In October, we will co-host our next conference on these topics and would be glad to welcome many of our readers in Brussels.</p><p>Meanwhile, we hope that you find this brand new issue interesting and thought-provoking once again. In the articles section, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ana Cacho Lacarra</emphasis> analyses recent case law on the rejection of competition law complaints, a very relevant procedural issue, both in digital markets and in other sectors, well presented from her perspective as an EU official dealing with such matters. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jasper Sluijs</emphasis> takes a close look into the way in which EU competition law applies to commercial divisions of public entities under Article 106 TFEU, a more rarely used provision, which has not really been at the forefront of the EU enforcement practice in the past few years. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mateusz Brzezi\u0144ski</emphasis> addresses the interesting issue of how to overcome obstacles for cross-border mergers, especially in high-tech markets, in light of EU merger control and secondary EU legislation in the field of company law. </p><p>The issue also contains several highly topical country reports on recent developments in Belgium by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jeroen Dewispelaere and Chlo\u00e9 Binet</emphasis>, in Germany by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Julius Rumpf</emphasis>, in Greece by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Andriani Ferti</emphasis>, in Malta by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Clement Mifsud-Bonnici</emphasis>, in Poland by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tomasz Feliszewski</emphasis>, and in Romania by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bogdan Marius Chiritoiu and Vlad Dan Roman</emphasis>. In the case notes section, you will find contributions about recent rulings of the Court of Justice of the EU and the General Court by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Thomas de Meese and Karl Stas</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Vasiliki Fasoula</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">David van Wamel</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Agustin Reyna</emphasis>.

The goal is that users will use their own social capital to reinforce and give credibility to the original message.\"</p><p> Wardle explains, \"Most of this content is designed not to persuade people in any particular direction but to cause confusion, to overwhelm and undermine trust in democratic institutions from the electoral system to journalism.\"</p><p> Mission accomplished.</p><p> Sadly, we willingly and collectively gave Big Tech and their legions of agitators all the tools necessary to tear about the fabric of society. First, we handed Facebook and Google an all-access pass into the deepest recesses of our souls. Then we got into the destructive habit of spreading incendiary misinformation as we sought virtual connections to others in our online \"social\" circles.</p><p> \"Technology platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest play a significant role in encouraging this human behavior because they are designed to be performative in nature\u2026 slowing down to check whether content is true before sharing is far less compelling than reinforcing to your 'audience' on these platforms that you love or hate a certain policy,\" Wardle explains.</p><p> These companies became the richest and most powerful in the world by luring and keeping us in their dystopian information eco-systems. For that reason, we pray they might be reigned in by antitrust cops.</p><p> But it's also important to note that every American has to play a role if we want to live in a world where objective truth is not a subjective matter.</p><p> \"A disordered information environment requires that every person recognize how he or she can become a vector in the information wars and develop a set of skills to navigate communication online and offline,\" Wardle cautions.</p><p> She prescribes the development and training of \"cognitive 'muscles' in emotional skepticism and trained to withstand the onslaught of content designed to trigger base fears and prejudices.\"</p><p> As the saying goes, the less you know, the more you are going to believe.</p><p> That's certainly true. But as Australia realized, it's increasingly difficult to \"know\" if the companies dedicated to spreading quality information are no more, and the companies dedicated to misinformation are thriving.</p><p> During the pandemic, the New York Times and Guardian are both tracking the \"perfect storm\" of \"global online disinformation, cyber-espionage and disruption, involving up to a dozen states but most prominently Russia and China.\"</p><p> These malevolent actors convince people to do dumb things like drink bleach, stock up on ammo and blame minorities for a viral disease. Worse, they promote distrust of public health experts and the policies they prescribe. There are countless examples of actionable misinformation and the terrible disruption it causes. None of it possible without Facebook.</p><p> We like Australia's revenue-sharing but are skeptical it will work. As we saw in France and Spain, these tech companies will spend a lot more on lawyers fighting the law then they would just to comply.</p><p> We also like state anti-trust investigations but understand these cases are slow, difficult and typically toothless.</p><p> The far better solution is to begin regulating these companies as publishers, rather than telecom companies. If Facebook is made to adhere to the same publishing guidelines as us (No obscenity; No fighting words; No defamation; No child pornography; No perjury; No blackmail; No incitement to violence; No true threats; No solicitations to commit crimes), and is held liable for each infraction, then truth could stand a fighting chance.</p><p> Newspapers don't want a handout, we want a level playing field.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKVT-2f9999d963e3e4879758ede8475ffb859b16a691</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899AA106C8F1A NWBKVT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSG-RNN1-JBCN-40YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409761</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Caledonian-Record Publishing Company Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

As the U.S. Census Bureau forges ahead with its first year of online participation, cybersecurity threats are a real worry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Recent messaging by the U.S. Census Bureau suggests participants' personal information is in good hands. A \"safety and security\" fact sheet dated Oct. 18 confidently displays three proclamations:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ' Your responses to the 2020 Census are safe '\u00a6 \"Every Census Bureau employee and contractor is sworn for life to always protect your information. Violating that oath carries stiff penalties for all Census Bureau workers ' a fine of up to $250,000 and/or up to five years in prison.\"</p><p> ' Responses to the 2020 Census are secure '\u00a6 \"The Census Bureau's technology is protected by strong authentication and authorization methods and is fully '\u02dclocked down' so that it can only be accessed by fully vetted individuals who are trained in data and cyber security.\"</p><p> ' No matter how you respond, your information remains protected '\u00a6 \"The Census Bureau works with the federal intelligence cyber community and industry experts to stay abreast of emerging cyber threats to continuously update protections and safeguards for your information.\"</p><p> Your data might stay confidential with the Census Bureau. But recent letters from Congress tell another chapter of the security story. We need Silicon Valley's help to save the sanctity of the process.</p><p> \"Misinformation campaigns to discourage any American, including targeted demographic groups, from participating in our national count would be an attack on our democracy with potentially far-reaching consequences for decades to come,\" wrote Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., in a Nov. 4 letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, signed by dozens of colleagues. \"We believe social media platforms must do more and do better than was done in 2016 to deter and mitigate interference in our upcoming count.\"</p><p> \"Deter\" and \"mitigate\" ring differently than \"safe,\" \"secure\" and \"protected.\"</p><p> \"Facebook can be an invaluable partner in ensuring an accurate census enumeration,\" said a Nov. 7 letter to COO Sheryl Sandberg, signed by the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. \"Having publicly stated your intent to put '\u02dcpeople, policies, and technology in place to protect against census interference' and push back on misinformation campaigns, we look forward to engaging with you and your team to ensure that [Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders] and other vulnerable communities are not targeted by malicious actors on your platform.\"</p><p> \"Can be\" and \"push back\" demonstrate the imperfect process ahead.</p><p> The Census Bureau is bound by Title 13 and Title 26 of the U.S. Code to collect and keep information with integrity.

They have the resources to combat deception, but if an issue arises, government is responsible to fix and litigate the mess. Even with Silicon Valley's big coffers, breaches still happen.</p><p> The benefits of the digital census are clear, such as easier access for participants and lower costs for the bureau. The major drawback is that to get there, we're in a perpetual fight to separate fact and fiction about filling out the form.</p><p> Next April is a moment of truth for the online era. Let's spend taxpayer money on messaging that captures the risks ahead. Let's stay away from promises that cannot be guaranteed.</p><p> The most fundamental document for capturing data about the American people began in 1790 on horseback ' six questions littered with racism, sexism and slavery. Even then, the Census Bureau notes that two of our Founding Fathers ' Thomas Jefferson and George Washington ' doubted its accuracy.</p><p> With all the advantages of modern life, we're still struggling to achieve a complete count. Whether you file by mail, by phone or online, that's the importance of your participation (and awareness) in 2020.</p><p> ' Chris Gentilviso</p><p> In April, immigration activists rallied outside the Supreme Court as the justices heard arguments over a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Now the stakes are much higher. The industry's past foot-dragging means that it now faces a real threat that the feds could act unilaterally - and stifle innovation in the process.</p><p>It's a serious risk. Raise your hand if you think the folks at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission understand what drives the innovation economy. That's what we thought. Yet these are the people who will be drawing up the rules the tech industry will play by in the years ahead.</p><p>Let's hope they don't forget that innovation is at the heart of our economic growth. Our ability to remain a world power requires that we maintain a technological edge over China and our other global competitors.</p><p>That won't be easy. The Chinese government is investing $300 billion in an effort to dominate the fields of green energy, green vehicles, robotics, medicine and artificial intelligence. Its goal is to overcome the United States' technological advantage by 2025. Any serious disruption in the way the U.S. tech industry operates could have costly, unintended consequences on our ability to maintain our advantage.</p><p>Whatever the federal government does, it must maintain incentives for U.S. tech firms to keep spending on research and development, which is one of their primary tools to evolve and prepare for the future.</p><p>Tech leads U.S. companies in research and development spending. Amazon ($14.1 billion), Google ($10.15 billion), Apple ($7.65 billion) and Facebook ($4.76 billion) were among the top 10 investors in R&amp;D in 2018. They are using those billions as a strategic weapon to win what could accurately be described as the World War of Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>Time is of the essence. The digital landscape of 2030 is likely to be fundamentally different than it is today. After all, consider how fast it's changed in the past dozen years. As recently as 2007, MySpace dominated the social networking landscape, receiving more than 70 percent of all visits to social networks. Facebook, which was only three years old, was a distant second.</p><p>That same year, IBM created Watson, its artificial intelligence system. Apple released the iPhone, Airbnb was founded, and Twitter had just gone global. Google had yet to release its Android system and Amazon was still finding its way on the cloud computing scene.</p><p>Those companies launched a wave of innovation that helped the United States emerge from the 2008 financial crisis and create what has been the longest bull market in history. \u00a0Unfortunately, Big Tech's dominance over those years has led to abuses that deserve greater federal regulation.</p><p>As a result, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission now needs to rein in Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. But, in the process, the feds must take extreme caution not to stifle innovation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-6286216</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNV-FMP1-JCX4-64B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 28, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Any serious disruption in the way the U.S. tech industry operates could have costly, unintended consequences on our ability to maintain our advantage.</p><p>Whatever the federal government does, it must maintain incentives for U.S. tech firms to keep spending on research and development, which is one of their primary tools to evolve and prepare for the future.</p><p>Tech leads U.S. companies in research and development spending. Amazon ($14.1 billion), Google ($10.15 billion), Apple ($7.65 billion) and Facebook ($4.76 billion) were among the top 10 investors in R&amp;D in 2018. They are using those billions as a strategic weapon to win what could accurately be described as the World War of Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>Time is of the essence. The digital landscape of 2030 is likely to be fundamentally different than it is today. After all, consider how fast it's changed in the past dozen years. As recently as 2007, MySpace dominated the social networking landscape, receiving more than 70 percent of all visits to social networks. Facebook, which was only three years old, was a distant second.</p><p>That same year, IBM created Watson, its artificial intelligence system. Apple released the iPhone, Airbnb was founded, and Twitter had just gone global. Google had yet to release its Android system and Amazon was still finding its way on the cloud computing scene.</p><p>Those companies launched a wave of innovation that helped the United States emerge from the 2008 financial crisis and create what has been the longest bull market in history. \u00a0Unfortunately, Big Tech's dominance over those years has led to abuses that deserve greater federal regulation.</p><p>As a result, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission now needs to rein in Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. But, in the process, the feds must take extreme caution not to stifle innovation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-6235114</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SJMRCN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNV-FMR1-JCX4-60H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 28, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The Supreme Court's decision allowing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple to proceed is relatively narrow, but today's technology titans have reason to be nervous nonetheless.</p><p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh sided with his four liberal colleagues Monday to let device owners challenge Apple over the way it allows iPhone and iPad users to download apps only through its proprietary store \u2014 and then takes a commission on some of the sales. The ruling is less dramatic than it may sound: It's up to a lower court to determine whether Apple or its store holds a monopoly in any market, as well as whether the firm is abusing its position. Still, a conservative justice's willingness to entertain a rethinking of antitrust policy in the digital age is a surprise, and a signal.</p><p> Antitrust advocates argue that the regime around competition today lags behind the times. Network effects help large companies grow larger while keeping little ones out, and every piece of data acquired makes the last millions or billions of pieces more valuable. The most ardent crusaders for regulation say focusing only on whether consumers are immediately being charged higher prices will not be enough to rein in the tech industry's power players. In that sense, the court's opinion is more of the same. It asks whether Apple's commission policy leads developers to recoup what they lose by making users pay more.</p><p> Other aspects of the ruling, however, are surprisingly forward-thinking. By determining that consumers can have a direct purchasing relationship with a platform even when they are buying third-party products, the court blurs the line that companies have held so far: that they are neutral intermediaries. And the additional acknowledgment that the third parties might also bring a case for any harm that Apple causes them in its role not as a dominant supplier of apps but as a dominant buyer \u2014 a \"monopsony\" rather than a monopoly \u2014 opens up another front for litigation.</p><p>Apple has a robust argument for why it should remain beyond regulatory reach. Its software runs on less than half of U.S. smartphones and a much smaller share of smartphones worldwide. Opponents say that does not matter because Apple still has a stranglehold on apps that run on its devices. (Plus, iPhone users are much bigger spenders than their Android-customer counterparts.) Figuring out what market a company has a monopoly in, if any, is a difficult enterprise. Figuring out whether that company is unfairly leveraging its role to hurt consumers or snuff out any potential competition can be thornier still. But before this week, it looked as though these fights might never have a chance to occur when it came to tech companies. Now, a battle has begun.</p><p>     This editorial first appeared in The Washington Post.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKAL-5101661</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E525410DF10 NWBKAL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4G-VSJ1-DXVP-V2YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Tuscaloosa News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The commission won some praise for standing up to big tech. But theatrics aside, this decision is misguided, harmful to consumers, and almost entirely beside the point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Start with the alleged offenses. Google licenses its Android software to phone-makers for free. If they want to offer its app store, called GooglePlay, they must also install a suite of the company's other products, such as its search engine and web browser. All told, this is a pretty popular trade-off: Android is now used in about 80 percent of the world's smartphones.</p><p> Europe's regulators object. \"These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits,\" says Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner. \"They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\"</p><p> This statement is wrong in nearly every particular.</p><p> For starters, Google isn't unduly inhibiting competition. Android users can select among more than 3 million apps on the Play store, including plenty of alternatives to the Google products that come pre-installed. It may be true, as Vestager says, that few users \"are curious enough to look for another search app or browser.\" But fostering curiosity probably isn't a job for antitrust regulators.</p><p> More to the point, the decision conceives of competition too narrowly. Android may be a dominant operating system. But because it's free and open-source, it has vastly expanded the range of choices otherwise available to consumers. Developers around the world have built products using Android - including many of the 1.6 million Europeans who make apps for a living - and often offer them free of charge.</p><p> All this, though, is premised on that initial trade-off: Manufacturers get a free operating system; consumers get cheap phones and free apps; and Google gets the resulting data and advertising dollars. If the EC throws a wrench into this cycle by making it harder for Google to serve ads, the likely result is that it will start charging for Android - thus leading to more expensive phones, reduced innovation and less choice for consumers.</p><p> The damage doesn't end there. One way Google imposes quality control over this ecosystem is by prohibiting manufacturers from using \"forked\" or customized versions of Android if they want to keep offering Google's apps. The EC wants to stop this practice in the interests of competition. Yet doing so would erode security and worsen the problem of \"fragmentation,\" or inconsistencies across different versions of Android. Neither is in the interests of consumers.</p><p> For all that, the EC's decision comes about a decade too late to achieve even its stated goals. Because Google's apps benefit from network effects and the power of big data, they get better as they become more popular. The better they are, in turn, the more people want them. After so many years of Google's dominance, few consumers want to do without its apps and few manufacturers want to make products that exclude them. No amount of meddling by Europe's bureaucrats is likely to change that dynamic.</p><p> In imposing this admittedly arbitrary penalty, then, the European Commission is threatening to harm consumers, impede innovation, make life difficult for developers, and undermine the security and usability of applications, all in pursuit of thoroughly implausible goals. If it is solving any problems along the way, it has yet to explain how.</p><p> - Bloomberg Opinion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNC-45a8af8b3eb07e3e8125f9c901ee0b4c77355d4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E53F07B0E78 NWBKNC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVG-Y1J1-JBCN-44F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401970</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Sun Journal<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The commission won some praise for standing up to big tech. But theatrics aside, this decision is misguided, harmful to consumers, and almost entirely beside the point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Start with the alleged offenses. Google licenses its Android software to phone-makers for free. If they want to offer its app store, called GooglePlay, they must also install a suite of the company's other products, such as its search engine and web browser. All told, this is a pretty popular trade-off: Android is now used in about 80 percent of the world's smartphones.</p><p> Europe's regulators object. \"These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits,\" says Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner. \"They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\"</p><p> This statement is wrong in nearly every particular.</p><p> For starters, Google isn't unduly inhibiting competition. Android users can select among more than 3 million apps on the Play store, including plenty of alternatives to the Google products that come pre-installed. It may be true, as Vestager says, that few users \"are curious enough to look for another search app or browser.\" But fostering curiosity probably isn't a job for antitrust regulators.</p><p> More to the point, the decision conceives of competition too narrowly. Android may be a dominant operating system. But because it's free and open-source, it has vastly expanded the range of choices otherwise available to consumers. Developers around the world have built products using Android - including many of the 1.6 million Europeans who make apps for a living - and often offer them free of charge.</p><p> All this, though, is premised on that initial trade-off: Manufacturers get a free operating system; consumers get cheap phones and free apps; and Google gets the resulting data and advertising dollars. If the EC throws a wrench into this cycle by making it harder for Google to serve ads, the likely result is that it will start charging for Android - thus leading to more expensive phones, reduced innovation and less choice for consumers.</p><p> The damage doesn't end there. One way Google imposes quality control over this ecosystem is by prohibiting manufacturers from using \"forked\" or customized versions of Android if they want to keep offering Google's apps. The EC wants to stop this practice in the interests of competition. Yet doing so would erode security and worsen the problem of \"fragmentation,\" or inconsistencies across different versions of Android. Neither is in the interests of consumers.</p><p> For all that, the EC's decision comes about a decade too late to achieve even its stated goals. Because Google's apps benefit from network effects and the power of big data, they get better as they become more popular. The better they are, in turn, the more people want them. After so many years of Google's dominance, few consumers want to do without its apps and few manufacturers want to make products that exclude them. No amount of meddling by Europe's bureaucrats is likely to change that dynamic.</p><p> In imposing this admittedly arbitrary penalty, then, the European Commission is threatening to harm consumers, impede innovation, make life difficult for developers, and undermine the security and usability of applications, all in pursuit of thoroughly implausible goals. If it is solving any problems along the way, it has yet to explain how.</p><p> - Bloomberg Opinion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNC-d65b6c18549cf619c9e4fbc055a3414577563897</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E53E14885E8 NWBKNC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVG-Y1J1-JBCN-4478-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401970</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Daily News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The move comes after the Japanese Diet passed a bill to amend the Act on the Protection of Personal Information and approved a separate bill to create a new law to ensure transparency in online transactions.      The revised personal information protection law boosts one's right to demand that service providers stop using data accumulated through search engines and social media. It also demands that companies obtain permission before using cookies, which keep track of a person's browsing history, if used in a way that can identify individuals.    Meanwhile, the new transparency law aims to prevent unfair business practices in which major online shopping companies force shops that sell their goods and services on these giants' sites to enter into disadvantageous contracts. It also requires IT giants to notify online tenants in advance when changing the terms of their contracts. Some online tenants have pointed out that the standard for search rankings is unclear, and under the new law, major companies are obligated to disclose their ranking methods when searching for products that affect tenants' sales    Big tech companies must report their current state of work in tackling such problems to the Japanese government once a year. Malicious cases that constitute a violation of the antimonopoly law are apparently subject to crackdowns by the Japan Fair Trade Commission.    While providing free and convenient services for many users, tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon (GAFA) boast an overwhelming share of the online market. The firms have become indispensable for individuals and other companies, and are making huge profits from businesses, including through advertising that connects the two.    But their oligopoly over users' data and powerful influence on the market has been seen as problematic in recent years, and regulatory movements have spread across the globe. The European Union was quick to introduce strict regulations, and Japan followed suit.    However, the effectiveness of the regulation remains questionable. In this digital world with speedy technological advancements, proving law violations is not easy. Borders between other countries also stand in the way of applying regulations on GAFA.    As people are staying at home amid the coronavirus pandemic, more individuals are using the internet, and IT giants have strengthened their presence. Furthermore, the Japanese government is using technology and data provided by such companies to analyze the turnout of people in downtown areas, as well as to develop a smartphone app that alerts users who may have been in close proximity to those infected with the coronavirus.    GAFA and other such businesses must realize their responsibility of playing an important role as infrastructure in a digital society.

Some might have yet to embrace the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But after the tsunami of revelations about Russian infiltration of Facebook's platform in the 2016 presidential election and the misuse of user data by Cambridge Analytica, these members of Congress finally have woken up to the urgency to protect the personal information collected by giant social media platforms.</p><p>Regulation is needed. Everyone knows it. The uncertainty and challenge are the form and extent of new privacy rules. But they must come, because Facebook has proved time and again that the government cannot leave that task to it and others like Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>In 2011, Facebook entered into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission regarding charges that it deceived users by telling them their data could remain private while allowing it to be made public and shared. Not much has changed. On the eve of <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>testimony, advocacy and privacy groups accused YouTube, whose corporate parent is Google, of illegally collecting data on millions of child users.</p><p>The tipping point for this week's grilling of <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>- the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes its turn Wednesday - was recent news that Cambridge, the British firm that received nearly $6 million from <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>campaign, improperly gained access to the data of 87 million Facebook users to develop psychological profiles for targeting voters.</p><p>Regulations should reflect basic principles. Users should have to agree to allow their data, which range from biographical information to personal interests and contacts, to be collected and shared. Users should not be forced to opt out of collection. The process of granting permission should be easy to understand. There should be limits on how data are shared with companies and how they use the information. A bipartisan Senate bill to require disclosures about who paid for online campaign ads is a starting point for a different, but similarly troublesome front. Europe is ahead of us, with privacy rules set to take effect in May. Congress must decide whether it also likes the European stick - fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies that misuse users' data.</p><p>America is at a turning point. Skepticism of big tech is growing. People are realizing that if they are not paying for something, they themselves are the product being sold. The #DeleteFacebook movement includes lots of regular folks among the platform's 2.2 billion users, and tech giants like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla/SpaceX founder <person><nameText>Elon Musk. </nameText></person>Privacy-oriented sites are seeing slow but steady increases in users.</p><p><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said he accepts responsibility for all the mistakes and spent lots of time Tuesday apologizing. We've seen the apology tour before. And more might be necessary. Given Facebook's recent announcement that the data of vastly more people had been breached by Cambridge than originally thought, it seems unlikely that the company knows the full extent of possible data misuse by other parties.</p><p>The law, it is said, is always behind the technology. It's time for our government to catch up. - The editorial board</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>at Tuesday's Senate hearing.

Speculative forecasts aside, at the time of writing, this much is clear: in a relatively short period of time, a novel coronavirus has sealed off borders, restricted travel, and curtailed in-person gatherings at school, workplaces, and conference venues. Whatever meaning, however fraught, was attached to the notion of 'business (and we would add politics and life) as usual before the spread of the virus has been indefinitely suspended, and global public attention daily trained to tracking confirmed cases, tallying death counts, and taking stock of the virus's disruptive social, political, and economic effects.</p><p>The links between technology and anti-trafficking-the focus of this Special Issue of Anti-Trafficking Review-and COVID-19 may seem topically distant and their analytical connections not readily apparent. However, by situating COVID-19 as an analytical launch pad into the Special Issue, our aim is to spark creative interdisciplinary approaches in tracking how distinctive global phenomena constitutively overlap in moments of social and economic disruption. And, more pointedly, we hope to better understand how issues framed as exceptional give rise to solutions,1 including state and non-governmental solutions augmented by technology, which may further contribute to structural vulnerabilities.</p><p>Consider one COVID-19 example that dovetails with sex work, technology, and anti-trafficking politics. As travel bans, border containment efforts, and a mix of mandatory and voluntary quarantines continue apace, the upending of various industries and businesses have left many workers reeling. Workers ineligible for paid leave and lacking worker protections are especially vulnerable, including (though not limited to) people in the sex trades. In the absence of meaningful state assistance, some groups have taken to crowdfunding and found other ways to help sex workers impacted by the pandemic, for instance by raising money and sharing advice and resources.2</p><p>The use of technology in these instances reveals the resiliency of sex workers organising to help people access critically important resources and ease financial losses. However, the bitter irony is that sex workers' use of technology-to advertise services, screen clients, share information with peers, and bank online-has come under intense scrutiny, not to mention criminal sanction, on the heels of a decade's worth of legislative and advocacy efforts to disrupt trafficking online by shuttering sites and holding platforms liable for activities presumed to facilitate trafficking. The passage of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) in the United States in 2018 amplified extant anti-prostitution efforts posturing as anti-trafficking protection with sweeping, censorious, and harmful effects on sex workers in the US and beyond.3</p><p>In our current moment, widely viewed as unprecedented, we also wonder: might an already constrained situation worsen for people in the sex trade as well as for workers in the gig economy, manufacturing, or service industries such as tourism and hospitality? How might technology exacerbate already precarious labour arrangements? And what analytical insights from past research to document anti-trafficking and technology might be brought to bear in mitigating current and future vulnerabilities?</p><p>These questions are not completely speculative. They draw on more than a decade's worth of critical trafficking studies highlighting how anti-trafficking/anti-slavery 'cures' produce injurious and sometimes worse effects than the 'epidemic' itself- to use, albeit critically, the language of media outlets that frequently characterise human trafficking as an 'epidemic'.4 Human trafficking is also commonly analogised as a form of slavery, a discursive move that elevates its exceptional status.5 Framing a complex phenomenon like trafficking as exceptional authorises 'uncompromising [calls to] action'6 to address it, such as rigid border controls, and innovative solutions, including technological ones, that heighten state and humanitarian surveillance efforts.7 What this research also draws our attention to is that efforts to stave off a crisis-whether the threat of human trafficking or a virus-induced public health emergency-can obscure structural factors that shape vulnerability and contribute to inequalities. People who endure structural vulnerabilities during more typical moments-for instance, migrants, refugees, ethnic and racial minorities, sex workers, and incarcerated, homeless, and working-class people-often face intensified conditions of constraint and economic precarity in the face of extraordinary situations.8 Moreover, exceptional state and non-state actions generated in response to crises in general9 and human trafficking in particular can contribute to intensified forms of surveillance for groups deemed 'at risk'.10 Such surveillance is made possible through data and technology-themes this Special Issue takes up.</p><p>Technology and Anti-Trafficking</p><p>Over the past decade, scholars, activists, and policymakers have repeatedly called for an examination of the role of technology as a contributing force to human trafficking and exploitation. Attention has focused on a range of issues from adult services websites and the use of social media to recruit victims and facilitate trafficking11 to the utilisation of data analytics software to understand trafficking and identify 'hotspots of risk'.12 For many anti-trafficking stakeholders, technology, assumed to be a contributing force to exploitation, can be reworked, and 'transformed from a liability into an asset'.13 Yet the idea that technology can be harnessed to address human trafficking relies on limited data and a number of assumptions.14</p><p>Just as facts are contested in human trafficking policy and research,15 there is added contestation where technology is concerned. In contrast to anti-trafficking stakeholders' unscrutinised optimism about technology, pitching its benefits in unilaterally positive terms, researchers have begun to seriously grapple with the assumptions that underlie discussions about technology and anti-trafficking, for instance whether anti-trafficking efforts augmented by technology are effective, or if instead such efforts do more harm than good.16 Moreover, as critical scholars have pointed out, assumptions that vex the understanding of trafficking are mirrored and magnified in the understanding of technology-facilitated trafficking too.17 These include uninterrogated claims that trafficking occurs mainly in the sex industry, that women in the sex trades are especially vulnerable while men are empowered, and that the general public has a central role to play in identifying victim-survivors.</p><p>Less understood are the ways in which power and technology cohere in antitrafficking policy and practice and to what effect. Investigating these questions is further complicated by the fact that definitions of technology vary widely. We understand technology as a range of techniques that structure and are structured by power and expertise.18 We also understand technology as 'co-produced',19 which is to say, its practical form and ultimate meaning is indelibly tied to discourses, institutions, and arrangements of power that authorise its development and use. Understanding technology as equal parts technical, political, and social is instructive in demonstrating how an uncritical embrace of deploying technological solutions for complex social problems can increase the repressive, controlling arm of the state, as several of the contributions to this Special Issue illuminate. It further helps to map the uneven benefits of technology on different actors, for instance, when tech solutions benefit corporations more than workers, or where technical fixes hailed as innovative fail to address poor working conditions, bad labour migration regimes, and business demand for profits.</p><p>Platform Regulation and Tech Solutionism</p><p>Politicians, law enforcement, and users of social media like Facebook and Instagram have issued urgent calls for technology companies to take actions toward 'cleaning up' their platforms.20 These demands are premised on the notion that technology companies bear responsibility to monitor activities and content deemed illicit. The current default is that companies are not doing enough to regulate platforms but ought to. Though there are mounting demands for non-state actors and entities to regulate their platforms, as Tarleton Gillespie has pointed out, technology companies have actively promoted the political and discursive framing of their sites as 'platforms' in order to skirt regulatory obligations required of telecommunications providers, while ensuring many of the protections of free speech legislation.21 In fact, companies' profit motive directs them not to regulate their platforms, protect user privacy or to be meaningfully accountable to them. Yet such critiques have done little to squelch a tide of data entrepreneurs who have gotten in on the business of digital disruption, presenting technologies like apps as capable of 'solving' slavery/trafficking.</p><p>Notable too is that data-driven 'disruption' leverages ideas of moral entrepreneurship. Kelly Gates has argued that tech solutionist 'moral entrepreneurs' present themselves as rescuers to humanitarian problems by reframing those problems as technological ones.22 Tech solutionism is driven by moral appeals that technology will cleanly and uncomplicatedly solve all of the problems wrought by complex issues like human trafficking. In this regard, tech solutionism echoes other findings from critical anti-trafficking scholarship that suggests anti-trafficking has become a 'rescue industry'.23</p><p>One of the key modes of data entrepreneurship we see regarding trafficking is the proposal to harness 'big data'.24 Recent work in Science and Technology Studies has turned a critical eye toward data science and data collection techniques,25 insights that hold important lessons for researchers and advocates whose work explores trafficking and exploitation. While state-sponsored data classification schemes, such as racial categorisations, have come under intense scrutiny in the sociological and historical scholarship,26 scholars have recently called attention to the ways non-governmental organisations and corporations also harvest 'big data' from users.27 Mark Andrejevic and Kelly Gates argue that today's state policing agencies hold a prevailing attitude of 'collect-everything' in their approaches to data collection.28 This attitude assumes that problems can best be solved with the aggregation of maximum information. We see this collect-all approach to big data presented in proposed solutions to trafficking. These new forms of data collection involve subtle and sometimes intimate forms of surveillance,29 collecting user information to generate algorithmic identity profiles.</p><p>In the anti-trafficking field, digital worker reporting apps perpetuate the illusion that the collection of more worker data will present self-evident solutions to labour exploitation.30 But, as Andrejevic and Gates caution, large-scale databases 'can generate patterns that have predictive power but not necessarily explanatory power'.31 Data generated by apps, worker reporting tools, and automation are also laundered through a human rights 'indicator culture' that gives it the veneer of accuracy and objectivity32 despite sizable gaps in data that may also be taken out of context.</p><p>It is also critical to note that the big data collection proposed by data entrepreneurs requires a massive expansion of surveillance infrastructure. That the creation of a data-oriented infrastructure has been lauded by figures in the anti-trafficking/ anti-slavery movement33 puts into sharp focus how visions of slaves' 'liberation' may end up authorising the creation of a surveillance humanitarianism infrastructure to address trafficking,34 all the more notable in an environment where little if any regulation exists to oversee it. Ironically, for tech solutionist data entrepreneurs, the 'freedom' of some will require the unfreedom-through the removal of privacy safeguards-of others. Furthermore, the tech 'solutions' to trafficking are to be developed by corporate actors and implemented by individual consumers, not through state-level policies, thus enacting a classic neoliberal attitude toward the management of socio-economic issues. In this way, neoliberal capitalism, although sometimes acknowledged as creating the inequalities leading to trafficking, is also positioned as the means to solving it.35</p><p>Networked Governance</p><p>Anti-trafficking efforts augmented by technology and backed by anti-trafficking policies also draw attention to shifting governance norms.36 Prior to the 2018 passage of FOSTA, numerous attempts occurred to raid and shutter sites like Craigslist, Backpage, MyRedbook, and others, which were presumed to support the facilitation of sexual exploitation online.37 By upending part of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996,38 FOSTA has advanced a model of governance that makes the enforcement of anti-trafficking laws not only the job of law enforcement but of a diffuse network of platforms and websites.39</p><p>An anti-prostitution strategy camouflaged as anti-trafficking protection, FOSTA illuminates two networked effects that were in development before its passage but which have been further extended following it: first, the rise of networked neo-abolition policy and practice across borders. Secondly, the advancement of a networked policing strategy reliant on third-party actors to anticipatorily police networks, pre-emptively analyse, filter, and scrub content presumed to be linked to commercial sex, and cooperate with law enforcement.40 This has led to heightened vulnerabilities for sex workers and trafficked persons in the United States but also beyond, as two of the contributions in this Special Issue demonstrate.</p><p>More broadly, the anti-trafficking movement itself has become a counter-network to the trafficking it seeks to address, with the way it has united a diverse group of actors, including state and municipal authorities, international organisations, philanthropies, women's rights groups, trade unions, celebrities, religious leaders, and corporations. As Thakor and boyd have argued, technology-facilitated trafficking is destabilising, and anti-trafficking agencies deploy new technologies in attempts to stabilise networks.41 Yet, while this anti-trafficking network demands the transparency and accountability of technology for its potential involvement in trafficking, it has continued to operate in its own 'accountability vacuum'42 and remained surprisingly immune to calls for transparency and accountability for the rights violations of migrants, sex workers, and other marginalised groups that it has promoted. As many of the articles in this Special Issue show, this is just as necessary in technology-facilitated anti-trafficking measures.</p><p>This Special Issue</p><p>The articles featured in this Special Issue offer sharp analyses of the ideologies of intervention and governance that have bolstered tech solutionism in anti-trafficking efforts. The issue opens with an article by Sanja Milivojevic, Heather Moore, and Marie Segrave who trace the development of the discourse surrounding technology and (anti-)trafficking from the early 2000s to the present day, where technology is framed as part of both the cause of and solution to trafficking. They analyse and critique four main assumptions about the role of technology in anti- trafficking efforts. The authors conclude with a call to anti-trafficking stakeholders to look past technology and re-focus their efforts on advocating for humane migration policies, and decent work and economic opportunities for all.</p><p>The next three articles examine different types of apps developed with the goal of preventing or combating exploitation. Stephanie Limoncelli analyses three apps aimed at encouraging ethical consumption by providing information to consumers about the risks of trafficking, exploitation, and child labour associated with various everyday products. Limoncelli notes the multiple problems with these apps, such as the obscure methodology used to rank them, limited or outdated sources, and contradictory information about the companies or products consumers are advised to choose or avoid. Furthermore, these apps, the author argues, reinforce neoliberal ideologies about the limited role governments should play in regulating businesses by locating the responsibility for the eradication of exploitation with individual consumers instead of collective action by workers</p><p>Apps concerned with the views of workers are the subject of the next article, by Laurie Berg, Bassina Farbenblum, and Angela Kintominas. On the basis of literature review and expert consultations, the authors present the limitations of so-called 'digital worker reporting' tools-apps through which global brands aim to collect information from hard-to-reach workers about their working and living conditions. While these are often touted as an efficient and cost-effective way to gather data directly from workers, the authors note a number of limitations, some of which are the same that have been plaguing traditional social audits for decades. These include that digital tools may not capture data from a representative cohort of workers and that data may be vague or superficial. A challenge specific to digital tools is that the collection of data creates new risks for workers' wellbeing and safety. On the whole, the authors conclude, digital worker reporting tools have limited or no benefits for workers. They also emphasise that technological tools cannot address the structural causes of worker exploitation, such as the drive for business and shareholder profit and consumer demand for cheap goods and services.</p><p>As a counterpoint to these business-driven apps, in the next article, Annie Isabel Fukushima highlights how an app can be useful when it is developed by, for and with migrant workers. She showcases the app Contratados (Contracted), developed by a migrant rights organisation in the US, which allows migrant workers to find work, rate employers, share resources, and seek support. She conceptualises the app as an example of a 'migrant futurity'-a vision of the future as imagined and enacted by migrants-as opposed to the 'homeland futurity' of surveillance and border control currently enacted by the US and many other governments. Using primary data collected from migrant workers and survivors of violence and trafficking in the 'tech city' of San Francisco, Fukushima argues that technology can be used to both help and harm migrant workers.</p><p>The next two articles analyse the impact of a relatively new, and highly controversial, measure to reduce human trafficking in the sex industry-the closure of websites hosting sex work advertisements. Samantha Majic analyses the closure of two such websites-MyRedbook, used by female sex workers and their clients, and Rentboy, used by male sex workers and their clients. Her analysis reveals that while concerns about human trafficking were cited as a reason for the closure of the former, such discourse was absent in the latter case. This reflects long-standing stereotypes about female sex workers as helpless and vulnerable victims and male sex workers as free and empowered agents. Furthermore, while only sex workers and their allies expressed outrage at the closure of MyRedbook, not only sex workers, but also LGBT people, their advocates, and civil liberties groups reacted to the closure of Rentboy. Majic critiques the LGBT movement's 'respectability politics' and urges it to show greater solidarity with sex workers and other marginalised groups, given the fragile gains of the movement and the opportunities and constraints that technological developments offer in the pursuit of gender, racial, and sexual justice.</p><p>The final thematic article, by Erin Tichenor, examines the impact of the closure of another adult advertisements website, Backpage, on sex workers in New Zealand following the passage of FOSTA. Drawing on twenty interviews with sex workers in Auckland, Tichenor shows how the closure of Backpage allowed a local platform, NewZealandGirls, to hike up its prices and force unfavourable conditions on sex workers who had little choice but to accept them. These findings further demonstrate how technology allows the overzealous US 'anti-trafficking' policy to extend far beyond its borders. Tichenor concludes by calling for anti-trafficking measures that prioritise community well-being and empowerment rather than those that strengthen the carceral state's stronghold on people's lives.</p><p>The first of the three short articles that conclude the issue also examines the impact of FOSTA. Danielle Blunt and Ariel Wolf present the findings of a community-based, sex worker-led survey that asked sex workers about their experiences since the closure of Backpage and adoption of FOSTA. The vast majority of research participants stated that their financial situation has deteriorated, as has their ability to access community and screen clients. The authors conclude that FOSTA is just the latest example of the US government using anti-trafficking policy and restrictions on technology to police already marginalised people.</p><p>In the next short article, Isabella Chen and Celeste Tortosa reflect on their experience providing legal and social support to twenty Venezuelan women who were trafficked to Austria. In particular, Chen and Tortosa describe how the women were trafficked through the use of social media and chat apps. They also share how the digital evidence from online interactions between the women and their traffickers was used in the investigation and successful prosecution of the case. They warn, however, that this does not apply to all women their NGO supports, and thus digital evidence, and technology, have only limited application in anti-trafficking efforts.</p><p>The final article, by Kate Mogulescu and Leigh Goodmark, describes how some victims of human trafficking in the sex industry in the US are prosecuted alongside traffickers and put on sex offender registries. The result? Both a criminal record and an indefinite digital mark that limits their ability to find a job, settle in a new community, and see their children. The authors conclude with a call for a careful, critical look at the system of sex offender registries and, more broadly, policing and prosecution strategies, including in cases of human trafficking, in the United States.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Although the articles in this Special Issue examine different aspects of the 'trafficking-technology nexus', they ultimately converge around several main points. First, the role of technology as either a facilitator or disruptor of human trafficking remains poorly understood and largely based on ideology, political agendas, and limited evidence: more often than not, it simply repeats long-standing erroneous assumptions about sex work, migration, and precarious labour. Secondly, the currently available technological 'solutions' have limited, if any, benefit for the trafficked persons, migrants, and low-wage workers they purport to help; rather, they benefit technology corporations, reinforcing the very neoliberal capitalism that creates and exacerbates people's vulnerability to trafficking. Finally, anti-traffickers' obsession with technology is a smoke-screen that obscures the role of gender discrimination, labour market deregulation, restrictive migration policies, and crucially, the rise of networked responses that pass as humanitarian yet are inextricably tied to a surveillance capitalist system43 that exploits people's personal data for profit. Not only do these systems and approaches create the conditions-including networked vulnerabilities-that exacerbate inequalities and expose people to the risks of trafficking. They also draw precious attention and limited resources away from measures capable of preventing trafficking and exploitation: decent work, gender, economic and racial justice, the free movement of people, and social protections grounded in transparency and accountability. Such prevention and protection efforts demand political will, not tech solutionist cures.</p><p>These insights also hold some lessons, even if speculative, in accounting for the effects of technology in response to COVID-19. First, community-based actions, tech or otherwise, are uniquely positioned to prevent exploitation. Relatedly, a robust public health response is needed to contain the spread of the virus and to mitigate its widespread effects. Yet in the absence of a coordinated global response, we see a surfacing of philanthrocapitalist-backed techno-solutionist fixes44 and calls to enlist 'big tech companies' for support.45 Placing trust in tech firms whose platforms have provided the technical blueprint for state surveillance efforts,46 cloud-supported immigration enforcement,47 and that have compromised users' privacy in exchange for advancing facial recognition technologies proves limited.48 It is likewise short-sighted to assume that tech companies are equipped to fill in the slack of an otherwise unresponsive state if such efforts are not accompanied by meaningful efforts to address the social, political, and economic barriers that make it hard for people to avoid the virus in the first place but also to survive its devastating financial effects.</p><p>As the articles in this Special Issue show, reliance on technological solutions does not necessarily translate into improved conditions for trafficking victims and other vulnerable communities. Indeed, if unaccompanied by wider socio-political shifts to address structural vulnerabilities, tech interventions may limit ameliorative efforts or, worse, create barriers to obtaining meaningful relief.</p><p>Jennifer Musto is an Associate Professor of Women's and Gender Studies at Wellesley College.

They had a chance to address the issues and they failed.</p><p> So we move to the next, inevitable step: the federal government\u2019s announcement last week that it will conduct an antitrust investigation of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. Now the stakes are much higher. The industry\u2019s past foot-dragging means that it now faces a real threat that the feds could act unilaterally \u2014 and stifle innovation in the process.</p><p> It\u2019s a serious risk. Raise your hand if you think the folks at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission understand what drives the innovation economy. That\u2019s what we thought. Yet these are the people who will be drawing up the rules the tech industry will play by in the years ahead.</p><p> Let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t forget that innovation is at the heart of our economic growth. Our ability to remain a world power requires that we maintain a technological edge over China and our other global competitors.</p><p> That won\u2019t be easy. The Chinese government is investing $300 billion in an effort to dominate the fields of green energy, green vehicles, robotics, medicine and artificial intelligence. Its goal is to overcome the United States\u2019 technological advantage by 2025. Any serious disruption in the way the U.S. tech industry operates could have costly, unintended consequences on our ability to maintain our advantage.</p><p> Whatever the federal government does, it must maintain incentives for U.S. tech firms to keep spending on research and development, which is one of their primary tools to evolve and prepare for the future.</p><p> Tech leads U.S. companies in research and development spending. Amazon ($14.1 billion), Google ($10.15 billion), Apple ($7.65 billion) and Facebook ($4.76 billion) were among the top 10 investors in R&amp;D in 2018. They are using those billions as a strategic weapon to win what could accurately be described as the World War of Artificial Intelligence.</p><p> Time is of the essence. The digital landscape of 2030 is likely to be fundamentally different than it is today. After all, consider how fast it\u2019s changed in the past dozen years. As recently as 2007, MySpace dominated the social networking landscape, receiving more than 70 percent of all visits to social networks. Facebook, which was only three years old, was a distant second.</p><p> That same year, IBM created Watson, its artificial intelligence system. Apple released the iPhone, Airbnb was founded, and Twitter had just gone global. Google had yet to release its Android system and Amazon was still finding its way on the cloud computing scene.</p><p> Those companies launched a wave of innovation that helped the United States emerge from the 2008 financial crisis and create what has been the longest bull market in history. Unfortunately, Big Tech\u2019s dominance over those years has led to abuses that deserve greater federal regulation.</p><p> As a result, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission now needs to rein in Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. But, in the process, the feds must take extreme caution not to stifle innovation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONTCH-4356166</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E0FF8CAB62B7C MONTCH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWB-S7V1-JBCN-44FY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Monterey County Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Monterey County Herald (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 28, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They're ubiquitous and, for the folks who sell these modern-day patent medicines, highly lucrative.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even worse though is the proliferation of online sellers promoting the purchase of illegal drugs over social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Powerful opioids including fentanyl, so-called recreational drugs like Ecstasy, even things advertised as authentic, FDA-approved meds but are instead counterfeits coming from China or Mexico that aren't anything like what they're labeled are available if you're dumb enough buy them.</p><p> All of them are illegal. And all of them present what should be obvious health risks to U.S. buyers looking for cheap highs or cheaper alternatives to what they can already buy at the local pharmacy or legitimately through the mail. It's a problem out of control and growing worse that Congress needs to involve itself in.</p><p> Many right-thinking politicians have thus far adopted a hands-off where Big Tech is concerned. Whatever the problem, they expect the sites to police themselves, but that hasn't worked. The tech companies have found a comfortable place to hide behind Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the catch-all clause absolving them of responsibility for what their users do with their platforms. They may publicly deplore the postings that advertise illegal drugs for sale and the like but the scheme in private to avoid serious congressional scrutiny that might hold them responsible for the posts they give a home.</p><p> This pattern of inadequate, dilatory responses hasn't been limited to drug sales, and it needs to change. There's ample precedent for the government to act. Backpage, a now-shuttered website, was so notorious for failing to police its ad marketplace facilitating forced prostitution and child exploitation the U.S. government seized it in April. Earlier this spring, President Trump ordered a crackdown on the sale of counterfeit goods online which White House trade adviser Peter Navarro called a \"shot across the bow to those companies. If you don't clean it up, then the government will.\"</p><p> That's the kind of threat that tends to get attention from the business community. When online hate speech and threats of violence became an unavoidable concern, Facebook announced in 2017 that it would hire 3,000 more monitors to review posts reported by users. When Russian attempts to manipulate American elections became impossible for them to deny, Twitter began to eliminate tens of millions of suspicious accounts.</p><p> Each of these efforts had, at their heart, the desire to prevent the government from acting. To combat the spread of illicit drugs sales on social media, Congress needs to consider modifications to Section 230. Former U.S. Rep. C. Christopher Cox, who originally came up with it, has said its original purpose \"was to help clean up the Internet, not to facilitate people doing bad things on the Internet.\"</p><p> Instead, as Mr. Cox alluded to, it's become the justification for not doing anything about some of the worst stuff on the Internet. Section 230 has been used to protect sites hosting revenge porn, extremely gruesome videos, or violent death threats. The broad leeway given to Internet companies represents \"power without responsibility,\" Georgetown University law professor Rebecca Tushnet wrote in an oft-cited paper.</p><p>Congress needs to investigate whether social media and Internet sales and advertising platform sites are taking reasonable steps to prevent illegal drug sales from being promoted or transacted. Asking the executives who make policy for these platforms up to and including the dominant players in \"big tech\" like Amazon and Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google, for details regarding existing policy and complaint resolution when someone reports a site would be a good first step.</p><p> These companies need to have adequate measures in place to allow users to report inappropriate content, complaints that should be responded to, and handled quickly and appropriately. Deleting posts offering illegal drugs for sale and deleting user accounts should be easy and protected activity. Most importantly, Congress needs to investigate whether these sites have acted proactively or if they wait until there's a user report. The nature and timing of the steps they have taken to address potential illegal drug sales is a matter very much in the public interest that is not and should not be protected by claims regarding rights under the First Amendment, trade secrets or other proprietary information, or Section 230.</p><p> As much as we abhor heavy-handed government regulation, if Congress determines that overall the social media and Internet platform sites have not taken adequate steps, legislation amending Section 230 to clarify it does not hold the users and providers of interactive computer services harmless where the enforcement of federal and state laws relating to illegal sales of drugs may be in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-17621C498E3C8030</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3Y-M0G1-DXVP-V10S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"851\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>23 September 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FOOD &amp;

Representatives across party lines made a case for greater regulation and antitrust action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust featured the heads of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Each super-wealthy,</p><p>super-powerful CEO called in via video conference -- COVID-19 still being a thing -- and faced tough questions from lawmakers.</p><p>That in itself was something new. Members of Congress historically have demonstrated a poor understanding of technology, sometimes embarrassing themselves during hearings like these. This time, however, the tech wasn't really the point. Competitive marketplaces, antitrust and bias in content moderation are things members of Congress can get their head around.</p><p>Questions were asked, and the CEOs were allowed to give brief answers, but the real message was in the subtext. Congress has been investigating for more than a year, and they've accumulated a lot of evidence. The hearing was a heads-up for Sundar Pichai (Google/Alphabet), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Tim Cook (Apple) and Jeff Bezos (Amazon) that changes are coming, whether they like them or not.</p><p>Whatever action Congress takes likely will involve new regulations and maybe even splitting off parts of the companies so that tech behemoths no longer can unfairly dominate the marketplace.</p><p>Google, for example, controls search results online. It uses that power to promote its own goods and services, suppressing other businesses' access to customers. Facebook, meanwhile, buys up competitors like Instagram when they might pose a competitive threat. That stifles free market competition that fosters innovation and benefits consumers.</p><p>Congress has the goods. Democrats and Republicans are united in the idea that something needs to be done, albeit for different reasons. Democrats generally don't like big business running roughshod over consumers. Republicans make the case that conservative viewpoints face systemic bias online. That argument doesn't match the data, but they're running with it anyway.</p><p>This sort of intervention is past due. It's been two decades since a big antitrust investigation went down in the United States. Then, Microsoft faced scrutiny and ultimately was ordered to change how it did business. Today, these four companies (and perhaps a handful of others) have grown so large and powerful that consumers suffer.</p><p>This isn't even just about innovation and competition. Monopolistic power allows companies to invade people's privacy with impunity and to upend other industries. For the latter, look no further than the harm done to local news since Facebook and Google took over advertising and co-opted news content at the same time, or the role of Amazon in crushing locally owned shops.</p><p>If by some miracle of massive campaign contributions Congress fails to act, the companies still aren't off the hook. The Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Justice Department and multiple combinations of state attorneys general are conducting their own independent investigations.</p><p>None of this means that people won't be able to order something from Amazon, buy an iPhone, look up an old friend on Facebook or figure out how to get somewhere with Google Maps. The odds of the government smashing the companies into fragments are low. But the odds that someone will do something with all of these investigations going on is high. That's good news for consumers and for the economy.</p><p>You can send a letters to the editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:letters@pressdemocrat.com\">letters@pressdemocrat.com</email></p><p>___ (c)2020 The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, Calif.)

Prior to last month's disclosure, the data breach had been kept under wraps, with Uber paying the two hackers responsible a sum of $100,000 to delete the information and stay quiet about the incident.</p><p>Law enforcement in multiple states, including New York and Pennsylvania, have responded to Uber's confession by launching investigations into the company's practices. Here in Pennsylvania, state Attorney General Josh Shapiro requested specifics last week about the stolen data to determine whether or not the company violated the Commonwealth's Breach of Personal Information Notification Act by not informing Uber users about the breach.</p><p>But regardless of whether or not Uber broke this specific law in this specific instance, it's long past time that the government holds big tech companies accountable for their actions. Shapiro said as much in a statement announcing the investigation, suggesting that the issue with Uber is systematic, not a fluke.</p><p>\"These kinds of breaches will keep happening - and Americans and Pennsylvanians will keep seeing their personal and financial information compromised - until we force these companies to change the way they do business,\" Shapiro said.</p><p>While Uber's statement assured its customers that the data hackers stole amounted to only names, phone numbers and email addresses, a lack of accountability and reporting means that we really can't be sure yet if that was the full extent of the breach. The same goes for whether we can trust that the hackers really did delete the data after receiving payment. And while Shapiro's and others' investigations will hopefully uncover the truth in this case, it won't be enough in the long term.</p><p>High-tech giants like Uber, Amazon and Google continue to hold unconscionably unchecked power in the United States. In its search for a new headquarters, Amazon has shown just how much power tech corporations have over cities - including Pittsburgh - desperate to be chosen host. That power to more or less flout the law is unacceptable and Shapiro should look to use this case to cut down on it.</p><p>It's a good sign that Khosrowshahi appears to have come forward with information about the hack voluntarily - he wasn't CEO at the time of the breach - and appears willing to cooperate with law enforcement to address the issue. Still, it's too risky to rely on tech chiefs to be so forthcoming regularly. Increased regulation is a must.</p><p>It's up in the air exactly when we'll see headlines about more data breaches like this again. But when it happens next, it'd be nice to get the information sooner than a year down the road.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3132610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R3M-FW11-JBSN-3257-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"504\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Pitt News: University of Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Campus</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 3, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Avoiding a bloodbath should be a priority.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Bloomberg News reported Monday, the House Judiciary Committee is gearing up to investigate unfair business practices by platform companies, while the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have divvied up Silicon Valley's big four \u2014 Amazon.com and Facebook, Apple and Google \u2014 as they probe potential antitrust violations.</p><p> The tech business has certainly had its share of mishaps and misdeeds over the years, and the concentration of power in certain digital markets is indeed a cause for concern. But the breadth of these looming probes is nonetheless worrying. As the government bears down, three things are worth keeping in mind.</p><p> One is that each of these businesses should be evaluated on its own terms, not as part of a generalized crackdown. It's true that all four companies are big, profitable and connected to the internet. Beyond that, though, their similarities aren't obvious. Google and Facebook are ad-sales companies. Amazon is a retailer. Apple makes nice phones. These are very different industries, with different competitive dynamics. They may each require distinctive reforms, or no reforms at all. A gigantic new rulebook on the telecoms model isn't the thing.</p><p> Second, the goal should be identifying specific instances of wrongdoing and devising prudent remedies. Take data. All four companies have loads of it, and in some cases may use it to gain unfair advantages. Facebook has created tools to monitor what other products its users are interested in, for example, and has acted on that information to buy out budding rivals or mimic their ideas. Likewise, Amazon's bird's-eye view into what people are buying on its marketplace may confer an undue advantage on its competing private-label goods. In both cases, regulators should intervene to stop objectionable behavior \u2014 not to put anyone out of business.</p><p> Finally, it's important to remember that, for all their faults, these companies shouldn't be vilified. After all, they're pillars of the American economy. They collectively employ almost 900,000 people. They've made it easier than ever to start a business. They've invented entirely new categories of products and services \u2014 and often charge users nothing for them. No one could argue that consumers have been harmed by Google's free apps or Amazon's aggressive cost-cutting. Quite the opposite: They now have a bounty at their fingertips that previous generations could never have dreamed of.</p><p> It's true that tech companies have generally done themselves no favors in the court of public opinion. They've often been heedless about the harms their products can cause, opaque about their data practices, and dismissive of their overseers. When it comes to paying taxes, Congress has no doubt noticed that they employ savvy accountants.</p><p> On balance, though, the good vastly outweighs the bad. Most other countries would kill for an industry as productive, profitable and endlessly inventive as the American tech business. Markets can always be improved, of course. But as Congress tries to write a new rulebook, and regulators begin to roll up their sleeves, one question above all needs to be asked: What problems are they trying to solve?</p><p>           This editorial first appeared on Bloomberg Opinion.    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKAL-5213040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E525410DF10 NWBKAL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9M-59H1-DXVP-V4J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Tuscaloosa News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The reason: because people are gullible.</p><p> Zuckerberg's critics have taken him to task for his company's refusal to lope along with other tech lemmings and regulate  or censor  political ads that may contain misleading or deceptive material.</p><p> Zuckerberg is absolutely right about this. His product is essentially a place for the exchange of communications and ideas.</p><p> As long as those messages are within reasonable limits and comply with Facebook's current policies  that is, not inciting violence or hate (however that can be defined) or encouraging other types of criminal behavior  then Facebook should allow the marketplace of ideas to sort things out.</p><p> Last week, Facebook reiterated that position. In a company blog post, Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management, stated, \"People should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public.\"</p><p> The gist is that politics will be politics, and Facebook won't get in the middle of that.</p><p> Here is why Facebook's stance matters.</p><p> Coinciding with Election Day in November 2018 an Economist/YouGov poll asked respondents if it was true that \"Russia tampered with vote tallies in order to get Donald Trump elected president.\" The results: 67% of Democrats and 62% of self-described liberals said that statement was \"definitely\" or \"probably\" true.</p><p> That came after former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said on at least two occasions during 2018 that no vote count or election result was affected by their activities.</p><p> Why wouldn't anti-Trumpers believe this? For more than two years the national media insinuated that Trump and his campaign were a rat's nest of Russophiles who worked hand in hand with Vladimir Putin's minions to steal the election.</p><p> Zuckerberg's critics want politicians who make false claims about themselves or their opponents booted from the world's largest social media platform because gullible recipients may sop up untrue information and circulate it. And if Big Tech won't eradicate this scourge, then Big Government must.</p><p> Yet they are perfectly fine with the national media promoting bogus narratives that fit a political message Zuckerberg's critics happen to agree with.</p><p> Citizens of a healthy, mature republic shouldn't be spoon-fed opinions by anyone. They should instead do their own homework by consulting multiple sources and informing themselves. Or they can suffer the consequences, the most paramount of which will be a contraction of freedom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-13c55cfc954955f857f47e827f8a33fb347bbbf7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2896A0105ED1A6 NWBKFL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0S-2G71-JBCN-43SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Ocala Star-Banner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The ads reappeared only after the media and Warren had a field day: \"I want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said on Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It would be hard to better encapsulate in a single incident why Warren, other Democratic presidential candidates, and many Republicans have grown increasingly leery of the power of Silicon Valley behemoths and their growing stranglehold on American life. Once seen as glistening American success stories, these companies are increasingly blamed for warping the economy, choking commercial competition and innovation, spreading hate and injecting poisonous ideas into the mainstream, and affecting the health of democracy here and abroad.</p><p>Last year, this editorial board called for breaking up Google, a virtual monopoly that accounts for more than 90 percent of all Internet searches.</p><p>But the problem clearly goes beyond one company, and beyond any single strategy to fight back. Warren's proposal is not a silver bullet, but she's onto something by challengingSilicon Valley's giants. The era of self-policing must end; it's time for reform and regulation in a substantive way.</p><p>The case for taking action is different for each of the tech giants. Google fits most closely into the traditional definition of a monopoly, because of its dominance in search, but Facebook and Amazon often behave in monopolistic ways too. Without any serious competitive pressures to fear, Facebook and Google (which owns YouTube) have also repeatedly failed to provide adequate moderation on their platforms.</p><p>One of the most obvious ways the big Silicon Valley companies have reduced competition is by repeatedly buying smaller startups, ensuring that none of them grow big enough to become a commercial rival. Some examples: Amazon's purchase of diapers.com, Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, and Google's acquisition of Waze. The companies sometimes buy potential competitors then shut them down: Amazon closed diapers.com, a purchase that seemed to have no purpose but to neutralize an emerging competitive threat.</p><p>In other cases, the companies simply use their market power to undercut would-be rivals. This is the notorious \"kill zone\" \u2014 companies that the Googles and Amazons of the world either buy or kill.</p><p>Other threats to competition are more subtle, but no less pernicious. Many of the companies assume the role of platform as well as participant; as such, they can bend algorithms and rules to their advantage. Amazon sells electronics and clothes while also writing the rules for other companies selling on its platform. Apple runs both its App Store and sells products in it. Google offers both a shopping product \u2014 and determines where other shopping sites show up in Google results. The company's double-dealing on shopping drew a $2.7 billion fine in Europe, but the potential for abuse won't go away as long as the companies play dual roles.</p><p>What can be done? Here's where to start:</p><p>\u2022 Beef up the Federal Trade Commission, which reviews mergers and provides consumer protection, by requiring the biggest companies to prove acquisitions won't harm competition. Insist on stiff fines for violations. The FTC is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree on data privacy, and if it finds they have, it needs to levy a Facebook-sized fine.</p><p>\u2022 To address monopolistic tendencies, the federal government could restrict data collection. Regulators could require that when companies collect data from a customer for one purpose, and then later use that data for a different product (for example, Instagram data feeding ads on Facebook.com), it be required to account for the transfer in the same way as if it had paid to buy that data from a third party. Then the government could require the collectors of data to license it to competitors at the same fee, similar to how patents are licensed. Conversely, the government could just make it illegal for companies to share data collected across products for advertising purposes \u2014 meaning that one's Instagram data could not add value to the ads seen on Facebook.</p><p>\u2022 Explore Warren's idea of designating Big Tech companies as \"platform utilities\" somewhat akin to telephone companies \u2014 and subject them to tighter regulation and large fines for abuses. Warren's idea of regulating them like utilities raises some knotty questions \u2014 including the danger that it would end up deterring would-be competitors \u2014 but lawmakers should at least examine it.</p><p>\u2022 Take a hard look at whether there are legal ways to force companies to divest ancillary businesses. The FTC recently formed a task force to examine the power of Big Tech and should use that process to determine whether it has the power to unwind mergers. If it doesn't, Congress could provide it.</p><p>So why haven't the feds been tougher on Big Tech already? One reason laws have been slow to catch up with the tech giants is because conventional understanding of antitrust law has required regulators to show that market concentration has resulted in some kind of direct harm to consumers. In this way of thinking, harm to competitors, or even to the broader market, isn't enough to trigger Justice Department intervention: There needs to be some way in which consumers are shown to be paying higher prices. Since most services offered by Facebook and Google are free to consumers, proving harm under that standard is close to impossible.</p><p>In the legal community, some scholars have called for a rethinking of antitrust law to keep pace with technological changes and to reemphasize harm to competition. That's an evolving debate, and it's clear that Warren and some other lawmakers agree that it's time to expand interpretations of antitrust law.</p><p>Still, while that debate plays out, there's also a case to be made that the companies' market power could be leading to consumer harms even under a more restrictive interpretation. Newly elected Missouri senator Josh Hawley, for instance, argues that the companies have made it impossible for consumers to participate in modern life without surrendering something of economic value \u2014 their personal information. \"Any robust definition of consumer welfare must acknowledge that these companies have harmed consumers by conditioning participation in the modern public square on giving away enormous \u2014 and growing \u2014 amounts of personal information,\" he wrote to the FTC earlier this month. Google and Facebook aren't really free: Personal data has a dollar value.</p><p>Some harms, though, may be harder to express in financial terms and touch on deeper questions of how the companies affect society. The market clout of the tech giants is bad enough. But their sheer size also reduces their incentive to solve another problem: the ways that the platforms have been, and continue to be, abused.</p><p>Recent years have seen a growing awareness of the ways in which firms have allowed their platforms to be put to harmful uses. Facebook recently live-streamed a terrorist attack in New Zealand; Instagram's algorithms steer impressionable teens to conspiracy theorists; YouTube suggests videos that send Americans deeper into their partisan corners. There is a wide recognition of the problem of online echo chambers and polarization fueled by social media, but without real competition, the companies have made only token efforts to stop it. Yes, it would be a challenge to catch live-streamed terrorist attacks in the moment, but the platforms have more aggressive ways to catch objectionable content when they want to.</p><p>And as we wake up to the harm \u2014 to Americans as consumers and entrepreneurs, and also to Americans as private citizens \u2014 the demands for change are growing louder. In the name of restoring competition to the marketplace, Warren called for unwinding Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp; separating Amazon from Whole Foods and Zappos; breaking up Google and Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick. After the plan's release, she expanded its scope somewhat by also pledging to break apart Apple and its App Store.</p><p>Among Democratic presidential candidates, Warren has offered the most detailed set of ideas to contain the companies, but she's not alone. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont are also calling for stricter regulation. On the Republican side, Hawley wants more aggressive investigations into the ways the companies use personal data.</p><p>President Trump also ought to see this moment as an opportunity to do better than his predecessor, who uncritically embraced the barons of Silicon Valley. It was President Obama's appointees who allowed the tech companies to balloon into the threats they've become.</p><p>The pressure to crack down on Silicon Valley is growing. In Europe, regulators are hitting the companies with multibillion-dollar fine after multibillion-dollar fine, and Americans too have grown increasingly aware of the harm Big Tech is doing to our economy, political system, and society. It's time for regulators and Congress to seize the moment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-5e02743a-4ffc-11e9-8ab3-ce0179ba21b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSX-HHK1-JC2G-C45X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 31, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The commission won some praise for standing up to big tech. But theatrics aside, this decision is misguided, harmful to consumers, and almost entirely beside the point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Start with the alleged offenses. Google licenses its Android software to phone-makers for free. If they want to offer its app store, called GooglePlay, they must also install a suite of the company's other products, such as its search engine and web browser. All told, this is a pretty popular trade-off: Android is now used in about 80 percent of the world's smartphones.</p><p> Europe's regulators object. \"These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits,\" says Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner. \"They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\"</p><p> This statement is wrong in nearly every particular.</p><p> For starters, Google isn't unduly inhibiting competition. Android users can select among more than 3 million apps on the Play store, including plenty of alternatives to the Google products that come pre-installed. It may be true, as Vestager says, that few users \"are curious enough to look for another search app or browser.\" But fostering curiosity probably isn't a job for antitrust regulators.</p><p> More to the point, the decision conceives of competition too narrowly. Android may be a dominant operating system. But because it's free and open-source, it has vastly expanded the range of choices otherwise available to consumers. Developers around the world have built products using Android  including many of the 1.6 million Europeans who make apps for a living  and often offer them free of charge.</p><p> All this, though, is premised on that initial trade-off: Manufacturers get a free operating system; consumers get cheap phones and free apps; and Google gets the resulting data and advertising dollars. If the EC throws a wrench into this cycle by making it harder for Google to serve ads, the likely result is that it will start charging for Android  thus leading to more expensive phones, reduced innovation and less choice for consumers.</p><p> The damage doesn't end there. One way Google imposes quality control over this ecosystem is by prohibiting manufacturers from using \"forked\" or customized versions of Android if they want to keep offering Google's apps. The EC wants to stop this practice in the interests of competition. Yet doing so would erode security and worsen the problem of \"fragmentation,\" or inconsistencies across different versions of Android. Neither is in the interests of consumers.</p><p> For all that, the EC's decision comes about a decade too late to achieve even its stated goals. Because Google's apps benefit from network effects and the power of big data, they get better as they become more popular. The better they are, in turn, the more people want them. After so many years of Google's dominance, few consumers want to do without its apps and few manufacturers want to make products that exclude them. No amount of meddling by Europe's bureaucrats is likely to change that dynamic.</p><p> In imposing this admittedly arbitrary penalty, then, the European Commission is threatening to harm consumers, impede innovation, make life difficult for developers, and undermine the security and usability of applications, all in pursuit of thoroughly implausible goals. If it is solving any problems along the way, it has yet to explain how.</p><p> Bloomberg Opinion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNC-6f20aeb17da295c68b5ac6c2631ec2753fd59c6d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E53F2A26ED0 NWBKNC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVG-42X1-DXVP-V00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401970</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"601\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times-News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Politicians who master it - from Donald Trump to Justin Trudeau - are the stars of the current era.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the companies that dominate social media - Facebook, Twitter and Google - have been slow to acknowledge their power or accept responsibility for how their platforms are used. And governments have been just as slow to react to the dangers posed when social media is used to manipulate public opinion and influence elections.</p><p>That's starting to change. Both Facebook and Twitter have just announced measures in Canada to make public more information about political advertising on their sites. Facebook Canada also launched what it calls its \"Canadian Election Integrity Initiative\" - essentially educating political players on how not to be hacked, and citizens on how to consume digital media without being led astray by purveyors of so-called \"fake news.\"</p><p>The social media giants clearly understand that if they don't get their houses in order, then someone else will do it for them. They're too powerful to be left alone.</p><p>Still, the steps they have taken so far fall far short of what is needed, given their enormous influence and the potential risks to our democracy.</p><p>That's true in the United States, where congressional investigators have discovered that groups linked to Russia placed thousands of ads on Facebook designed to influence the 2016 presidential election. And it's true in Canada, where a Senate committee this summer warned of holes in our election laws that could allow for foreign interference, especially through social media. At the same time, Canada's Communications Security Establishment warned of increasing cyber threats to the electoral system.</p><p>In the U.S., some legislators aren't prepared to let the big tech companies simply regulate themselves any longer. Two Democratic senators, joined by Republican John McCain, have introduced legislation that would bring the same level of accountability and regulation to online political advertising as now exists for political ads on television and radio.</p><p>Their bill, called the \"Honest Ads Act,\" would require social media and internet companies to make public detailed information about political advertisers who spend more than $500 on their platforms. That would allow voters and politicians to see who's behind the ads, what their target audience is, and how often they are viewed. The bill would also update U.S. laws to give online political ads the same level of protection against foreign interference as old-style ads.</p><p>These are sensible measures that would bring U.S. election regulations more in line with the reality of today's political campaigning, which is waged online as much as at traditional rallies or on TV.</p><p>Canadian legislators should watch and learn. Facebook and Twitter deserve credit for taking steps in this country to bring more openness to political advertising on their platforms. But it shouldn't be entirely up to ordinary voters, or even political operatives, to figure out whether they're being manipulated online by groups masking their true identity.</p><p>There's a role for government in regulating online advertising, at least to the same standards of accountability as exist for ads in print or traditional broadcast media.</p><p>At a minimum, Ottawa should give Elections Canada expanded powers to oversee digital political campaigns. The agency should be able to force internet companies to disclose more information about political ads, including who paid for them, where they were placed and who saw them.</p><p>All this would just shed more light on what's going on in the murky world of political \"dark advertising.\" It would not - and should not - police the actual content of ads, aside from banning outright hate speech.</p><p>That's a much trickier task. Facebook and Google have both introduced third-party fact-checking systems to weed out so-called \"fake news,\" with largely disappointing results. In the end, it's still up to citizens to figure out what, and who, to believe. But they should know far more than they do now about where the information comes from.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-fc1a52ed37d049c49ab4047da0008434</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVD-7TJ1-JBVR-32PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><timeReceived>02:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 30, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Many create no impact at all.</p><p> But the tech giants are reportedly taking the challenge seriously, alerting their lawyers and preparing their lobbying troops for battle in Washington.</p><p> They're right to be concerned \u2014 and not just because their stocks were pummeled on Wall Street after the antitrust news broke.</p><p> Political and consumer pressure has been mounting on the federal government to take action against the technology companies for years. In Europe, authorities have created an entirely new digital regulatory system and issued billions of dollars in fines for Google and other companies.</p><p> While the business-friendly U.S. is unlikely to follow of the lead of the European Union, the federal government obviously feels it needs to do something.</p><p> The question is, what?</p><p> A big part of the reason why federal regulators have dragged their feet on pursuing big technology companies on antitrust matters is because, at least by traditional standards, the consumer isn't harmed.</p><p>Google has a whopping 90% of the market share for search, but it offers the service to regular internet users for free. Your Facebook friends may be wringing their hands over invasions of their privacy on the platform, but at least Facebook isn't charging them for the privilege.</p><p> Most antitrust law is based around harm done to consumers on price. That framework doesn't work with an industry that operates by different rules.</p><p> To effectively unwind Big Tech's bad practices, the federal government will need to first fix the shortcomings in antitrust law.</p><p> It'll need to consider how monopoly effects lead to bad outcomes outside of price gouging \u2014 whether that's Facebook-style political misinformation or the fact that Google's ability to acquire so many companies has allowed it to achieve dominance in an ever-growing array of technology initiatives outside of search.</p><p> Rethinking these matters won't be easy for lawmakers, but done right, they could create a new framework for the U.S. economy of this century \u2014 as opposed to the one of the past. The House Judiciary Committee should let the two federal agencies pursue the exciting investigations and focus its attention on updating antitrust law.</p><p> The result would be fewer headlines \u2014 but a better result for Americans.</p><p> This commentary is from The Chronicle's editorial board.

It connects the nation like broadband, television, radio, or the railroad system of an earlier era. Yet leading companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon are so big and so unregulated that they can stifle competition and have enormous power\u00a0over public life.</p><p>The\u00a0regulatory concerns about\u00a0these\u00a0four companies are distinct\u00a0and Congress will need a complex but specific arsenal of rules\u00a0to address consumer and market concerns.\u00a0Yet\u00a0the companies' size and swagger present similar problems. Together, they are worth trillions of dollars. They are large enough to bully smaller companies, as Google tried to do with lyric website Genius, or simply absorb potential competitors, as Facebook did with Instagram. Like Amazon, they can leverage their own size,\u00a0making upstart challenges impossible and undercutting other retailers.\u00a0And Amazon's\u00a0dominance\u00a0over the cloud data storage business is enormous. Collectively, the tech giants\u00a0hold the keys that people all over the world need to gain access to the online world, be it Apple's iPhone or a Google search.</p><p>All that centralized and too-little-examined power is particularly troubling\u00a0when companies haphazardly skip out on taxes, disrupt other rule-following industries, or don't find it in their business interest to prevent the spread of false information on social media. That's something that the likes of Facebook and Twitter are just beginning to tackle, emphasis on \"beginning.\" As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeated Wednesday, his company does not want to be \"arbiters of truth.\"</p><p>Yet Zuckerberg and the other tech leaders - awash in billions from our clicks and likes - owe users more than a shrug.</p><p>The hearing itself was more election-year theater than a road map for improving antitrust enforcement.\u00a0It underscored the uphill battle to come as a sclerotic body rouses itself to tame a feisty engine of the world economy. On the one hand, composed tech founders cited\u00a0company stats\u00a0to\u00a0bat away questions.\u00a0On the other hand, representatives were still trying to play\u00a0catch-up in terms of\u00a0tech know-how.\u00a0Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, for one, used the Stone Age term \"the net\" during his remarks.</p><p>There was plenty of grandstanding and sometimes confusing lines of questioning as the committee performed for the cameras.\u00a0Still, Republicans who focused\u00a0on the alleged stifling of conservative thought on social media underscored the importance of all this: technology undergirds the modern public square. Decisions about technology are decisions about democracy.</p><p>Congress must use available regulatory powers or perhaps create new ones to bring more fairness and oversight into the technological Wild West. The European Union, which has swung a much bigger stick against the excesses of Big Tech, could be a helpful model. There are many ways to proceed.</p><p>The hearings served as an opening act for what's to come, finding a way to allow technology to continue improving our lives without taking over.</p><p>- The editorial board</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified Wednesday to Congress.

They also include a host of the country\u2019s political leaders, both Republican and Democrat.</p><p>Reason magazine reports that President Donald Trump is preparing an executive order intended to address accusations that Big Tech interests are removing conservative opinions from their online platforms.</p><p> The specifics of the order, which would probably hinge on an interpretation of the Communications Decency Act, remain unknown. But as Reason\u2019s Billy Binion noted this week, the move is likely to give federal bureaucrats the power to punish companies such as Facebook and Twitter if they can\u2019t demonstrate \u201cpolitical neutrality when they moderate content.\u201d</p><p> This would create a sort of \u201cFairness Doctrine\u201d for the internet, Mr. Binion argues, referring to the long-standing federal regulation  eliminated by the Reagan administration  that forced broadcasters to present opposing viewpoints. Rather than promote debate, the rule had a sanitizing effect and led many TV and radio stations to avoid offering opinion content at all.</p><p> The Fairness Doctrine was an assault on free speech  as would be a heavy handed effort to prevent private social media companies from overseeing their own content.</p><p> Meanwhile, in an effort to rewrite the Bill of Rights for the first time in the nation\u2019s history, the Senate Democratic Caucus  including Nevada\u2019s Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen  has embraced a constitutional amendment to allow the government to regulate political speech.</p><p>Senate Democrats claim they\u2019re acting on behalf of democracy by advocating for an amendment to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision. But during oral arguments in that case, the solicitor general acknowledged that the law in question would allow the federal government to ban books and political pamphlets.</p><p> In other words, Senate Democrats, in seeking to prevent groups and individuals from using their own money to promote or oppose policy positions, would edit the First Amendment to empower bureaucrats to limit debate and to potentially outlaw the showing of certain issue-themed films or the distribution of political publications.</p><p> The proposed amendment highlights the dominance of compulsion in leftist politics. The intrusive and activist regulatory state favored by many Democrats is the very sustenance that nourishes the lobbying apparatus they so loathe. But rather than working to ensure the federal government remains confined by constitutional boundaries, thus limited the need for Big Money groups and donors to seek protection, progressives instead prefer to amend the nation\u2019s founding document to actually curtail individual rights.</p><p> These are challenging times for free-speech advocates. But to preserve our First Amendment freedoms, they must oppose both the effort by the Trump administration to use the force of government against social media platforms and the crusade by Democrats to revise the Bill of Rights.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAVJNL-12565097</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E1147E54C7789 LAVJNL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WV3-1M71-DXVP-V2C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">441758</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Greenspun Media Group (Niche Media Holdings, LLC) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Las Vegas Review Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>17 August 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The bad news is that it's not those who are doing the actual work of producing journalism; instead, it's Google and Facebook, which have figured out how to \"monetize\" the publication of news.</p><p>A report Monday in a study for the News Media Alliance holds that Google made $4.7 billion from the work of news publishers in 2018 through advertising linked to its search engine results and its Google News page.</p><p> Journalists ought to see some of that revenue, argues David Chavern, the president and chief executive of the alliance, which represents 2,000 U.S. newspapers.</p><p> The tech companies \"make money off the arrangement,\" Chavern said in The New York Times, \"and there needs to be a better outcome for news publishers.\"</p><p> If independent journalism is going to survive \u2014 and continue to help communities, states and the nation sustain their democratic institutions \u2014 the work of journalists must be supported.</p><p> \"News publishers need to continue to invest in quality journalism, and they can't do that if the platforms take what they want without paying for it. Information wants to be free, but reporters need to get paid,\" Chavern said in a release.</p><p> The problem facing media outlets \u2014 newspapers, especially \u2014 is a decline in revenue from subscriptions and advertising, a decline that has accelerated as media consumption has moved from print to online platforms. It's not that people have lost their appetite for trustworthy and valuable journalism; fewer are reading newspapers and magazines, but much of that former audience has shifted online, particularly to mobile devices.</p><p> Between 2006 and 2016, U.S. newspaper revenues fell 63 percent; from $49 billion to $18 billion, according to a 2017 report by the Pew Research Center. Even as overall circulation has fallen, Pew found, circulation revenue has shown moderate increases. The biggest losses have been in advertising revenue.</p><p> Where did much of that money go?</p><p> This is where Google, Facebook and even Amazon have been successful; the tech companies have the advantage of their millions of users and the personal data that users have obligingly provided. By using the data the tech companies have been able to target advertising, piggybacking it on the journalism that their users are increasingly looking for.</p><p>Google has denied the News Media Alliance's $4.7 billion figure, but the study notes Pew's findings that 93 percent in the United States get at least some of their news from online sources; that Google has in recent years updated its search algorithms to emphasizes news in its search results; and that YouTube, which Google owns, has also increased its news content.</p><p> The proof is in the clicks, News Media Alliance's study finds: 39 percent of results and 40 percent of clicks on trending searches are news results; 16 percent of results and clicks on \"most searched\" queries are for news.</p><p> A few ideas already have been offered to correct the advertising duopoly, including breaking up the big tech companies, ending or limiting their ability to sell targeted ads and even \u2014 as proposed in the United Kingdom \u2014 requiring Google and Facebook to pay a \"journalism tax.\"</p><p> But what may be in the best interests of newspapers and other journalism producers is for those creating content to share in the advertising juggernaut that Google and Facebook have developed.</p><p> That's the solution proposed in legislation introduced in Congress, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act. Introduced by bipartisan sponsors in the Senate and House, the bill would allow the newspaper industry to collectively bargain with the big tech companies for a share of the advertising revenue, giving them a four-year window \u2014 free from antitrust regulation \u2014 to negotiate a deal.</p><p> The legislation is narrowly tailored to address antitrust concerns; particularly a requirement that the entire industry benefit and not just a few of the nation's top publishers.</p><p> \"At the heart of this bill is helping newspapers survive amid shrinking circulations and massive layoffs,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, who with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, introduced that chamber's bill. \"Google and Facebook now control the news kingdom. They've pitted themselves against newspapers in a David-and-Goliath battle in which newspapers don't have a stone to throw much less a slingshot to put it in. The readers are the true losers as newsrooms empty out across this country.\"</p><p> The legislation has support from 48 press associations in 49 states, including the Washington Newspaper Publishers Association, Allied Daily Newspapers of Washington and the Pacific Northwest Newspaper Association.</p><p> Why would Google or Facebook even entertain the idea of negotiating a deal to share advertising revenue?</p><p> Because, without a robust culture of newspapers and other sources of journalism to produce the content that users are demanding, eventually neither will have much with which to attract advertisers.</p><p> Or does either think they can make $4.7 billion a year in selling advertising next to cat videos?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, are shown in a January, 2013.

Not only have several major U.S. companies announced bonuses and investments in the month since the measure passed, but some businesses are now promising to beef up retirement benefits.</p><p>On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that at least a dozen large companies  including Visa, Nationwide Insurance and AutoNation  plan to boost contributions to employee 401(k) plans as a result of savings they\u2019ll gain from the new tax law.</p><p> \u201cThe change in the tax law, which cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, is the latest in a series of factors that are motivating companies to raise their 401(k) contributions,\u201d the Journal reported.</p><p> This all comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s recent announcement that, thanks to the new law, it will gladly take a $38 billion tax hit on the $250 billion it holds overseas. It would be the largest one-time tax payment in the country\u2019s history and will happen only because of tax reform.</p><p> The GOP tax bill imposes a 15.5 percent levy on foreign profits whether or not they are returned to the United States. Previously, corporations not only paid taxes abroad, but faced a 35 percent U.S. tax if the money was brought home. That was an incentive for companies such as Apple to keep such profits parked in foreign accounts.</p><p> But there\u2019s now no reason for Apple to shield the cash once it\u2019s paid the lower tax rate under the GOP measure. Thus, the company also announced it intends to invest some $350 billion in the United States over the next five years, creating 20,000 new jobs.</p><p> \u201cOther big tech companies, which also have stashed money offshore, are likely to pay big tax bills in coming months, although none will be as big as Apple\u2019s,\u201d Wired reported last week.</p><p> Would Democrats, who unanimously opposed the tax bill, prefer that the $2.8 trillion American companies collectively have in overseas holdings remain in foreign accounts rather than benefit the U.S. Treasury? Apparently so.</p><p> As a Journal editorial pointed out on Friday, Barack Obama \u201ccould have made all of this happen, but he refused to negotiate seriously with a GOP Congress. Companies continued to self-deport from the U.S. through corporate inversions and financial engineering that erodes the tax base. Democrats in Congress made the same calculation last year, and now not one can share in reform\u2019s political dividends.\u201d</p><p> Democrats may still be poised to ride a wave of dissatisfaction with the mercurial Mr. Trump to big gains in November. But their continued embrace of punitive taxes and a hyperactive regulatory state do little to dispel the notion that, when it comes to economic policy, they\u2019re trapped somewhere between incompetence and wishful thinking.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAVJNL-10004530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E1147E54C7789 LAVJNL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RG3-W2T1-DXVP-V28K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">441758</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"466\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Greenspun Media Group (Niche Media Holdings, LLC) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Las Vegas Review Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>22 January 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00024ZJ</classCode><className>NATIONWIDE MUTUAL INSURANCE CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00026LB</classCode><className>AUTONATION INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Some might have yet to embrace the internet.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But after the tsunami of revelations about Russian infiltration of Facebook's platform in the 2016 presidential election and the misuse of user data by Cambridge Analytica, these members of Congress finally have woken up to the urgency to protect the personal information collected by giant social media platforms.</p><p><br/><br/> Regulation is needed. Everyone knows it. The uncertainty and challenge are the form and extent of new privacy rules. But they must come, because Facebook has proved time and again that the government cannot leave that task to it and others like Instagram and Twitter.<br/><br/> In 2011, Facebook entered into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission regarding charges that it deceived users by telling them their data could remain private while allowing it to be made public and shared. Not much has changed. On the eve of Zuckerberg's testimony, advocacy and privacy groups accused YouTube, whose corporate parent is Google, of illegally collecting data on millions of child users.<br/><br/> The tipping point for this week's grilling of Zuckerberg was recent news that Cambridge Analytica, the British firm that received nearly $6 million from Donald Trump's campaign, improperly gained access to the data of 87 million Facebook users to develop psychological profiles for targeting voters.<br/><br/> Regulations should reflect basic principles. Users should have to agree to allow their data, which range from biographical information to personal interests and contacts, to be collected and shared. Users should not be forced to opt out of collection. The process of granting permission should be easy to understand. There should be limits on how data are shared with companies and how they use the information. A bipartisan Senate bill to require disclosures about who paid for online campaign ads is a starting point for a different, but similarly troublesome front. Europe is ahead of us, with privacy rules set to take effect in May. Congress must decide whether it also likes the European stick \u2014 fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies that misuse users' data.<br/><br/>America is at a turning point. Skepticism of big tech is growing. People are realizing that if they are not paying for something, they themselves are the product being sold. The #DeleteFacebook movement includes lots of regular folks among the platform's 2.2 billion users, and tech giants like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla/SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Privacy-oriented sites are seeing slow but steady increases in users.<br/><br/> Zuckerberg said he accepts responsibility for all the mistakes and spent lots of time this week apologizing. We've seen the apology tour before. And more might be necessary. Given Facebook's recent announcement that the data of vastly more people had been breached by Cambridge than originally thought, it seems unlikely that the company knows the full extent of possible data misuse by other parties.<br/><br/> The law, it is said, is always behind the technology. It's time for our government to catch up.<br/><br/> \u2014Newsday  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2018/0411/20180411__12dceediw~1.jpg\">Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg testifies Wednesday during a U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing about Facebook on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C,</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg testifies Wednesday during a U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing about Facebook on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C,</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYCAM-31798452</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYCAM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S39-JX71-JCW9-X48W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317177</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Prairie Mountain Publishing All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Camera (Boulder, Colorado)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

How long would Washington put up with that?</p><p>Canada is on solid ground here, and the Trudeau government could do worse than put this at the top of its legislative agenda.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019102856147404</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCK-8X61-F103-32R0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The CCPA had its origins in an initiative backed by real estate developer Alastair Mactaggart, who qualified the measure for the November 2018 ballot, then withdrew it when the Legislature agreed to pass a law aimed at accomplishing the same thing.</p><p> The law took effect on Jan. 1 of this year, but the drafting of the implementing regulations was so complex and contentious that Attorney General Xavier Becerra did not release the final, approved regulations until Aug. 14. Businesses that have struggled to comply now face the prospect of starting over with a new law.</p><p> The current law requires businesses that meet certain thresholds to tell consumers if they collect or sell personal information, and to notify them of their privacy rights. It also gives consumers the right to know what information has been collected on them and the right to request deletion in most cases. Violations carry penalties of up to $2,500 \u2014 $7,500 if intentional  \u2014 but the law gives businesses the opportunity to avoid penalties by addressing violations within 30 days of being told.</p><p> Proposition 24 would eliminate the ability of businesses to cure a violation and avoid fines. The new law would be enforced by a newly created state regulatory agency led by political appointees and charged with writing regulations to enforce controls on the use of consumer data by businesses. It would be empowered to conduct investigations and impose penalties.</p><p> In practice, this would mean affected companies that collect, buy, sell or share consumer data would be saddled with the ongoing costs of demonstrating and reporting their compliance with ever-evolving regulations. Plans to innovate or make changes to a company\u2019s services could be delayed or shelved to avoid the expense of repeated legal reviews. A complaint, even a meritless one, could lead to a lengthy and punitive investigation that drains the resources of a small company.</p><p> That won\u2019t bother the tech giants or other large companies, such as banks and insurers. But for small and midsize companies, the legal bills associated with regulatory compliance for every technological upgrade would be strangling. Invention could turn into stagnation. The creative energy that has rushed new products and services into the hands of consumers would be chilled. Never again will tech giants be threatened by a start-up company in somebody\u2019s garage.</p><p> The privacy-advocating Electronic Frontier Foundation, which does not support or oppose the measure, says Proposition 24 is \u201ca mixed bag of partial steps backwards and forwards.\u201d The ACLU, which opposes Prop. 24, says it was \u201cwritten behind closed doors\u201d and \u201cprotects big tech.\u201d Proponents told our editorial board that Sen. Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, worked on revisions to the 2018 law, but finding no consensus in the Legislature, reached out to Mactaggart to put the complex measure on the ballot.</p><p> However, if elected representatives cannot reach agreement on the regulation of fast-moving technology, the worst thing to do is give that power to a permanent bureaucracy of unelected regulators.</p><p> Vote No on Proposition 24.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSENT-4938781</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABCBCF9B2DC6 PRSENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N0-R0W1-JBCN-43KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153562</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Press Enterprise, Inc.

Morally, it represents an unconscionable abuse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to reporting by ProPublica and the Wall Street Journal, several dozen parents in well-off Chicago suburbs transferred guardianship of teens who were juniors or seniors in high school to friends or family members. The teens were then able to report only their own small income on financial aid forms, which allowed them to claim and receive money meant for poor students.</p><p>The investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Education has suggested a possible fix, according to the Journal: tightening the language about legal guardianship in the Federal Student Aid handbook. This seems like a good start. University financial aid offices and college counselors also have a role to play in ending this abuse.</p><p>And oh, yes: Parents and teens need to honestly report their financial circumstances. The college experience should be an accrual of life lessons. What does it teach teenagers when their parents sign them out of the family and ask them to declare poverty to position themselves for ill-gotten benefits?</p><p>Like the \"Varsity Blues\" college admissions scandal that broke earlier this year, in which rich families were accused of bribing their kids into elite colleges, this is not a victimless act. Money is diverted from students in real need, as grant money does run out. This could make the difference between whether a low-income teen can afford to attend college or not. Court resources are wasted on nonsense guardianship requests that flout the intention of financial aid regulations.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal found 38 similar incidents in a study of 1,000 probate cases in Lake County. The reporting described a Chicago-area woman with a household income of more than $250,000 a year who transferred guardianship of her then-17-year-old daughter to her business partner. Claiming only her $4,200 summer job earnings, instead of her parents' income, the teen secured $20,000 in need-based aid, including a federal Pell Grant. Yes, taxpayers foot the bill for some of this.</p><p>There is some credit due in this outrageous saga. Not to the \"college consulting\" company apparently involved, and not to the law firms who shepherded the guardianship requests. Rather, we salute the high school counselor, unnamed in the articles, who raised the issue after she smelled something rotten. And we applaud university officials who aren't varnishing their words.</p><p>\"It's a scam,\" Andy Borst, director of undergraduate admissions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told ProPublica.</p><p>True, that.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com\">https://www.chicagotribune.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 29</p><p>The Los Angeles Times on multiple deadly shootings in recent days, including one at a garlic festival in California:</p><p>Two American traditions - summer celebrations and gun violence - collided in jarring fashion over the weekend.</p><p>Here in California, a man armed with a military-style rifle snuck through a perimeter fence at the annual Gilroy Garlic Festival and opened fire late Sunday afternoon, killing three people, two of them children, while a dozen others were wounded or injured fleeing the pandemonium. Police on Monday morning were trying to determine why the gunman, identified as Santino William Legan, 19, of Gilroy, decided to shoot up the festival.</p><p>A day earlier and on the other side of the continent, gunmen opened fire during a neighborhood Old Timers Day celebration in a Brooklyn, N.Y., park, killing one person and wounding or injuring 11 others. Police were investigating whether the incident was gang-related.</p><p>As a nation, we've become slowly accustomed to such senseless violence, with attacks on houses of worship, on schools, at workplaces and on family members. Just last week, police in Los Angeles arrested Gerry Dean Zaragoza after he allegedly shot three family members in Canoga Park, killing two of them, then shot a former girlfriend and a man at a gas station, killing the woman. Then later still, police say, he shot dead a stranger on a bus. Separately, an off-duty Los Angeles police officer grabbing a late taco with his girlfriend and her two brothers in Lincoln Heights confronted a graffiti tagger and was shot and killed.</p><p>The inevitable debates after Gilroy will touch on the usual themes. It wasn't the gun, it was the poison in the man's mind. There's some truth to that, given that firearms are inanimate objects. But without a firearm, the man couldn't have shot anyone. And without the semiautomatic function of the firearm, he couldn't have shot so many so quickly. And military-style rifles like the one used Sunday are conceived and designed for battlefields and it's preposterous to sell them for hunting or \"self-defense.\"</p><p>The violence, of course, won't move President Trump or Congress to act. Trump tweeted Monday that the shooting was \"horrific\" and said we should continue to \"work together as communities and citizens\" to prevent violence. But in fact he has done virtually nothing to address our long-running national scourge. He has fallen into the full embrace of the National Rifle Assn. in ways no other recent president has done. \"You have a true friend in the White House,\" he told the NRA two years ago, after the group spent $30 million to help get him elected.</p><p>In truth, the fault is not Trump's alone. Successive administrations, and Congresses, have failed to break the gun lobby's stranglehold on federal gun policies. And so the nation will continue to suffer gunshot wounds by the dozens each day, and by the tens of thousands each year. And something so harmless as a celebration of garlic, or of a Brooklyn neighborhood, will continue to carry the possibility of violent death.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com\">https://www.latimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 29</p><p>The Wall Street Journal on a headline and a hashtag targeting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his track record on Russia:</p><p>Mitch McConnell, the most phlegmatic man in American politics, rarely gets riled up. But on Monday the Senate Majority Leader let it rip in defense of his reputation, and we're glad he did.</p><p>Mr. McConnell was responding to a Democratic-media onslaught seeking to portray the Kentucky defense hawk as a toady for Russia. His offense is opposing some Democratic proposals to protect the 2020 election from foreign meddling. In particular he opposes attempts to nationalize election rules and ballot procedures that have been historically managed by the states. This is his long-held position and makes sense since a national system would be easier to hack than the systems of 50 states.</p><p>But Mr. McConnell is running for re-election next year, and the left needs a villain for the failure of special counsel Robert Mueller to find collusion between Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. Enter #MoscowMitch, the hashtag that appeared on Twitter and was immediately picked up across the Democratic media landscape.</p><p>\"It started with the angry lies on MSNBC. The host lied and said that I've dismissed Russia's interference in our 2016 election as, quote, a 'hoax.' Of course I've never said any such thing,\" Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"A few hours later came the Washington Post column. It was authored by Dana Milbank, a pundit who spent much of the Obama Administration carrying water for its failed foreign policies and excusing President Obama's weakness on Russia.\"</p><p>The column was headlined, \"Mitch McConnell is a Russian asset,\" which the Senator rightly called \"a shameful smear.\"</p><p>The truth is that Mr. McConnell has been far tougher on Vladimir Putin than most Democrats were across the Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama Administrations. He pushed for tougher sanctions on Russia than the Obama crowd wanted and he supported the Magnitsky Act that has allowed the U.S. to sanction Mr. Putin's cronies. He has also supported the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian meddling in 2016.</p><p>Republicans can't count on a media phalanx to defend them from unfair attacks, so like Mr. McConnell they have to do it themselves.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 29</p><p>The New York Times on a Trump Administration proposal to change rules regarding food stamps:</p><p>The Trump administration, which often talks about the importance of reducing regulation, has found at least one place where it would like to add red tape. The Agriculture Department wants to make it more difficult for poor children to get enough food.</p><p>The department is proposing to end programs in 40 states and the District of Columbia that make it easier for low-income families to sign up for food stamps. The stated rationale is that some people who are getting help do not need it. But the evidence suggests that problem is quite small, while the proposed solution is likely to keep millions of Americans who do need help from getting it.</p><p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helped 33.5 million people in the average month over the last year - mostly families with children, older Americans and people with disabilities - to buy a limited range of groceries from a list of supervised retailers. In place of the original coupons, beneficiaries now get an average of $127 loaded on a special debit card.</p><p>The program is enormously successful in mitigating poverty. Studies of Americans born in the 1960s, when the program was implemented nationally, show that children in families that received benefits went on to lead healthier and more productive lives.</p><p>Most beneficiaries live in households with incomes up to 130 percent of the federal poverty line - $32,640 a year in 2019 for a family of two adults and two children. But in 1996, as part of a broad overhaul of federal aid for lower-income families, Congress let states expand eligibility even as it curtailed benefits. States can offer food stamps to households with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty line, or around $50,200 a year for a family with two children. States also can waive a requirement that beneficiaries must have no more than $2,250 in assets.</p><p>Critics have long argued that the expansion was overly generous; the Trump administration is proposing to substantially restore the old rules. Officials at the Agriculture Department have highlighted the example of Rob Undersander, a 66-year-old Minnesota resident who qualified to receive food stamps even though he had more than a million dollars in assets because Minnesota, like most states, has chosen to waive the asset cap.</p><p>Mr. Undersander applied for food stamps in 2016, in the manner of a man who robs a bank to demonstrate the need for more security. He collected more than $6,000 in benefits he did not need, donating the money to charity while seeking to publicize his story.</p><p>\"There may be other millionaires\" on food stamps, an administration official told reporters.</p><p>But the proposed changes are not tailored to keep millionaires from getting food stamps. They would keep millions of low-income families from getting food stamps.</p><p>The Trump administration estimates that 4.9 percent of beneficiaries live in households with incomes above 130 percent of the poverty line. But all recipients, including those households, still must demonstrate that their disposable incomes, after deductions for housing, child care, and other basic expenses, fall below the poverty line. That's hardly an open-door policy - which is why relatively few households qualify. And those with higher incomes get smaller monthly payments. The program is meant to cover the gap between income and need.</p><p>The administration estimates another 4.1 percent of beneficiaries live in households with more than $2,250 in eligible assets. The standard excludes some kinds of savings, like equity in a home or money in a retirement plan. But it is still draconian. A worker in a minimum-wage job who managed to save three months of salary for a rainy day would lose his or her eligibility for food stamps as a consequence. The threshold was set at $2,000 in the mid-1980s, but only indexed to inflation in 2008. As a result, it has become much more restrictive than the original intent.</p><p>A reasonable asset ceiling, set at a level that allows rainy-day savings, has obvious appeal. But the evidence suggests that it would exclude very few people, because those with low incomes tend to have scant savings, and would impose large costs. According to the Trump administration's own estimates, states would have to employ the equivalent of 6,672 new workers solely devoted to asset verification. The government, in other words, probably saved a lot of money by allowing Mr. Undersander to collect some benefits.</p><p>In all, the administration says the government can save about $2 billion a year by denying benefits to 3.1 million people who would not meet the old standards. By the same logic, the government could save $60 billion a year by suspending the entire program. But those savings will not come from denying food stamps to millionaires. The vast majority of the government's money is given to Americans who are hungry, so they may eat.</p><p>The proposal once again highlights the gap between Mr. Trump's rhetorical promises to help lower-income American families, and the reality of his policies, which have systematically made life more difficult for those very families. The administration has slashed taxes on affluent Americans and significantly increased total federal spending - on Thursday (July 25), it announced plans to give another $16 billion to farmers hurt by Mr. Trump's trade policies - even as it seeks to make a show of fiscal discipline at the expense of children.</p><p>Congress should move to codify the current food stamp rules, which have been embraced by red and blue states alike, to protect millions of Americans from this act of theatrical cruelty.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 27</p><p>The Baltimore Sun on President Trump's criticism of Maryland's seventh congressional district, represented by Congressman Elijah Cummings:</p><p>In case anyone missed it, the president of the United States had some choice words to describe Maryland's 7th congressional district on Saturday morning. Here are the key phrases: \"no human being would want to live there,\" it is a \"very dangerous &amp; filthy place,\" ''Worst in the USA\" and, our personal favorite: It is a \"rat and rodent infested mess.\" He wasn't really speaking of the 7th as a whole. He failed to mention Ellicott City, for example, or Baldwin or Monkton or Prettyboy, all of which are contained in the sprawling yet oddly-shaped district that runs from western Howard County to southern Harford County. No, Donald Trump's wrath was directed at Baltimore and specifically at Rep. Elijah Cummings, the 68-year-old son of a former South Carolina sharecropper who has represented the district in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1996.</p><p>It's not hard to see what's going on here. The congressman has been a thorn in this president's side, and Mr. Trump sees attacking African American members of Congress as good politics, as it both warms the cockles of the white supremacists who love him and causes so many of the thoughtful people who don't to scream. President Trump bad-mouthed Baltimore in order to make a point that the border camps are \"clean, efficient &amp; well run,\" which, of course, they are not - unless you are fine with all the overcrowding, squalor, cages and deprivation to be found in what the Department of Homeland Security's own inspector-general recently called \"a ticking time bomb.\"</p><p>In pointing to the 7th, the president wasn't hoping his supporters would recognize landmarks like Johns Hopkins Hospital, perhaps the nation's leading medical center. He wasn't conjuring images of the U.S. Social Security Administration, where they write the checks that so many retired and disabled Americans depend upon. It wasn't about the beauty of the Inner Harbor or the proud history of Fort McHenry. And it surely wasn't about the economic standing of a district where the median income is actually above the national average. No, he was returning to an old standby of attacking an African American lawmaker from a majority black district on the most emotional and bigoted of arguments. It was only surprising that there wasn't room for a few classic phrases like \"you people\" or \"welfare queens\" or \"crime-ridden ghettos\" or a suggestion that the congressman \"go back\" to where he came from.</p><p>This is a president who will happily debase himself at the slightest provocation. And given Mr. Cummings' criticisms of U.S. border policy, the various investigations he has launched as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, his willingness to call Mr. Trump a racist for his recent attacks on the freshmen congresswomen, and the fact that \"Fox &amp; Friends\" had recently aired a segment critical of the city, slamming Baltimore must have been irresistible in a Pavlovian way. Fox News rang the bell, the president salivated and his thumbs moved across his cell phone into action.</p><p>As heartening as it has been to witness public figures rise to Charm City's defense on Saturday, from native daughter House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Mayor Bernard C. \"Jack\" Young, we would above all remind Mr. Trump that the 7th District, Baltimore included, is part of the United States that he is supposedly governing. The White House has far more power to effect change in this city, for good or ill, than any single member of Congress including Mr. Cummings. If there are problems here, rodents included, they are as much his responsibility as anyone's, perhaps more because he holds the most powerful office in the land.</p><p>Finally, while we would not sink to name-calling in the Trumpian manner - or ruefully point out that he failed to spell the congressman's name correctly (it's Cummings, not Cumming) - we would tell the most dishonest man to ever occupy the Oval Office, the mocker of war heroes, the gleeful grabber of women's private parts, the serial bankrupter of businesses, the useful idiot of Vladimir Putin and the guy who insisted there are \"good people\" among murderous neo-Nazis that he's still not fooling most Americans into believing he's even slightly competent in his current post. Or that he possesses a scintilla of integrity. Better to have some vermin living in your neighborhood than to be one.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com\">https://www.baltimoresun.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 25</p><p>The Toronto Star on efforts to rein in the power of big technology companies:</p><p>\"In a lot of ways,\" Mark Zuckerberg has famously said, \"Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company.\"</p><p>Much the same could be said of the other tech giants that set the rules for so much of our lives - especially Google, Amazon and Apple. Real governments struggle to tame the beast in areas ranging from privacy and democracy to taxation and corporate clout. Facebook even has plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, called Libra.</p><p>Finally, though, there are signs governments are stirring themselves to meet the challenge - and not a moment too soon.</p><p>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a record fine of $5 billion (last) week for misleading its users about the privacy of their personal information. In addition, the FTC ordered the company to set up a new board-level committee on privacy and make its data practices more transparent.</p><p>That's a lot of money. But for Facebook, even a fine of that size is just the cost of doing business. It earned more than that in the last quarter alone and its stocked jumped 56 per cent last year while it weathered a storm of criticism.</p><p>The bigger potential challenge to Facebook and the rest comes from another direction. After years of leaving the big tech firms to pretty much regulate themselves, the U.S. government has launched investigations into how they have amassed so much market power and whether they've violated antitrust laws.</p><p>This is a big change. So far the tech companies have faced their biggest push-back in Europe while Washington tended to defend them as champions of innovation. But now the U.S. Justice Department and federal regulators are lining up Facebook et al in their sights.</p><p>And it isn't just about privacy, \"fake news\" and similar well-publicized concerns about social media and the health of democracy. Those are important, but the real stakes for the dominant tech companies lie in a challenge to the enormous market power they have accumulated in just a few years.</p><p>An antitrust review could put into question that power, the near-monopoly grip on key markets that lets them dominate billions of dollars in advertising revenue, squeeze out potential competitors, dictate terms of business, and avoid paying tax in many of the places they operate. Even breaking up some of the biggest companies would be a real possibility - especially if a Democrat wins the White House next year.</p><p>With all that, you might expect a lively debate among Canada's political parties on how to meet the tech challenge. For the most part, though, you'd be disappointed.</p><p>The Trudeau government brought in new rules governing election advertising online and foreign meddling in campaigns. But it had no effective response when Google simply said it won't carry any election ads rather than meet the Canadian requirements.</p><p>And Canada's privacy commissioner was left to sputter impotently when he rebuked the company for violating the privacy of 620,000 Canadian users and it brushed him off. It turns out he has no power to tell Facebook to do anything. Even if he takes the company to court and wins, the maximum fine would be a risible $100,000.</p><p>On the key issue of taxation, Canada's position is to wait to see what the big boys do. Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the Star's Heather Scoffield recently that Canada wants to see what G7 leaders decide at their summit in France next month, so there can be common rules for all.</p><p>As for the future, the best the Liberals can offer is the tepid \"digital charter\" that Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains unveiled in May. It points in the right direction on privacy and other issues, but there's no reason the government could not have moved faster in those areas.</p><p>Canadians deserve better. The trend across the developed world clearly favours reining in Big Tech, and Canada should be more than a bystander as these parallel governments are brought under control.</p><p>The coming election campaign will be an ideal time for the federal parties to spell out how they would meet that challenge.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com\">https://www.thestar.com</url>/</p><p>___</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-d3d1ece3bcdc483c9e6387bfd229b872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPM-5MH1-JC65-5265-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3814\"/><timeReceived>8:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.organization\"><classificationItem><className>Russia government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Senate</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Mitch McConnell, POLITICIAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller, GOVERNMENT_FIGURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dana Milbank, JOURNALIST</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vladimir Putin, POLITICIAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Barack Obama, POLITICIAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nancy Pelosi, POLITICIAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George W.

Morally, it represents an unconscionable abuse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to reporting by ProPublica and the Wall Street Journal, several dozen parents in well-off Chicago suburbs transferred guardianship of teens who were juniors or seniors in high school to friends or family members. The teens were then able to report only their own small income on financial aid forms, which allowed them to claim and receive money meant for poor students.</p><p>The investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Education has suggested a possible fix, according to the Journal: tightening the language about legal guardianship in the Federal Student Aid handbook. This seems like a good start. University financial aid offices and college counselors also have a role to play in ending this abuse.</p><p>And oh, yes: Parents and teens need to honestly report their financial circumstances. The college experience should be an accrual of life lessons. What does it teach teenagers when their parents sign them out of the family and ask them to declare poverty to position themselves for ill-gotten benefits?</p><p>Like the \"Varsity Blues\" college admissions scandal that broke earlier this year, in which rich families were accused of bribing their kids into elite colleges, this is not a victimless act. Money is diverted from students in real need, as grant money does run out. This could make the difference between whether a low-income teen can afford to attend college or not. Court resources are wasted on nonsense guardianship requests that flout the intention of financial aid regulations.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal found 38 similar incidents in a study of 1,000 probate cases in Lake County. The reporting described a Chicago-area woman with a household income of more than $250,000 a year who transferred guardianship of her then-17-year-old daughter to her business partner. Claiming only her $4,200 summer job earnings, instead of her parents' income, the teen secured $20,000 in need-based aid, including a federal Pell Grant. Yes, taxpayers foot the bill for some of this.</p><p>There is some credit due in this outrageous saga. Not to the \"college consulting\" company apparently involved, and not to the law firms who shepherded the guardianship requests. Rather, we salute the high school counselor, unnamed in the articles, who raised the issue after she smelled something rotten. And we applaud university officials who aren't varnishing their words.</p><p>\"It's a scam,\" Andy Borst, director of undergraduate admissions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told ProPublica.</p><p>True, that.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com\">https://www.chicagotribune.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 29</p><p>The Los Angeles Times on multiple deadly shootings in recent days, including one at a garlic festival in California:</p><p>Two American traditions - summer celebrations and gun violence - collided in jarring fashion over the weekend.</p><p>Here in California, a man armed with a military-style rifle snuck through a perimeter fence at the annual Gilroy Garlic Festival and opened fire late Sunday afternoon, killing three people, two of them children, while a dozen others were wounded or injured fleeing the pandemonium. Police on Monday morning were trying to determine why the gunman, identified as Santino William Legan, 19, of Gilroy, decided to shoot up the festival.</p><p>A day earlier and on the other side of the continent, gunmen opened fire during a neighborhood Old Timers Day celebration in a Brooklyn, N.Y., park, killing one person and wounding or injuring 11 others. Police were investigating whether the incident was gang-related.</p><p>As a nation, we've become slowly accustomed to such senseless violence, with attacks on houses of worship, on schools, at workplaces and on family members. Just last week, police in Los Angeles arrested Gerry Dean Zaragoza after he allegedly shot three family members in Canoga Park, killing two of them, then shot a former girlfriend and a man at a gas station, killing the woman. Then later still, police say, he shot dead a stranger on a bus. Separately, an off-duty Los Angeles police officer grabbing a late taco with his girlfriend and her two brothers in Lincoln Heights confronted a graffiti tagger and was shot and killed.</p><p>The inevitable debates after Gilroy will touch on the usual themes. It wasn't the gun, it was the poison in the man's mind. There's some truth to that, given that firearms are inanimate objects. But without a firearm, the man couldn't have shot anyone. And without the semiautomatic function of the firearm, he couldn't have shot so many so quickly. And military-style rifles like the one used Sunday are conceived and designed for battlefields and it's preposterous to sell them for hunting or \"self-defense.\"</p><p>The violence, of course, won't move President Trump or Congress to act. Trump tweeted Monday that the shooting was \"horrific\" and said we should continue to \"work together as communities and citizens\" to prevent violence. But in fact he has done virtually nothing to address our long-running national scourge. He has fallen into the full embrace of the National Rifle Assn. in ways no other recent president has done. \"You have a true friend in the White House,\" he told the NRA two years ago, after the group spent $30 million to help get him elected.</p><p>In truth, the fault is not Trump's alone. Successive administrations, and Congresses, have failed to break the gun lobby's stranglehold on federal gun policies. And so the nation will continue to suffer gunshot wounds by the dozens each day, and by the tens of thousands each year. And something so harmless as a celebration of garlic, or of a Brooklyn neighborhood, will continue to carry the possibility of violent death.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com\">https://www.latimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 29</p><p>The Wall Street Journal on a headline and a hashtag targeting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his track record on Russia:</p><p>Mitch McConnell, the most phlegmatic man in American politics, rarely gets riled up. But on Monday the Senate Majority Leader let it rip in defense of his reputation, and we're glad he did.</p><p>Mr. McConnell was responding to a Democratic-media onslaught seeking to portray the Kentucky defense hawk as a toady for Russia. His offense is opposing some Democratic proposals to protect the 2020 election from foreign meddling. In particular he opposes attempts to nationalize election rules and ballot procedures that have been historically managed by the states. This is his long-held position and makes sense since a national system would be easier to hack than the systems of 50 states.</p><p>But Mr. McConnell is running for re-election next year, and the left needs a villain for the failure of special counsel Robert Mueller to find collusion between Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. Enter #MoscowMitch, the hashtag that appeared on Twitter and was immediately picked up across the Democratic media landscape.</p><p>\"It started with the angry lies on MSNBC. The host lied and said that I've dismissed Russia's interference in our 2016 election as, quote, a 'hoax.' Of course I've never said any such thing,\" Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"A few hours later came the Washington Post column. It was authored by Dana Milbank, a pundit who spent much of the Obama Administration carrying water for its failed foreign policies and excusing President Obama's weakness on Russia.\"</p><p>The column was headlined, \"Mitch McConnell is a Russian asset,\" which the Senator rightly called \"a shameful smear.\"</p><p>The truth is that Mr. McConnell has been far tougher on Vladimir Putin than most Democrats were across the Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama Administrations. He pushed for tougher sanctions on Russia than the Obama crowd wanted and he supported the Magnitsky Act that has allowed the U.S. to sanction Mr. Putin's cronies. He has also supported the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian meddling in 2016.</p><p>Republicans can't count on a media phalanx to defend them from unfair attacks, so like Mr. McConnell they have to do it themselves.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 29</p><p>The New York Times on a Trump Administration proposal to change rules regarding food stamps:</p><p>The Trump administration, which often talks about the importance of reducing regulation, has found at least one place where it would like to add red tape. The Agriculture Department wants to make it more difficult for poor children to get enough food.</p><p>The department is proposing to end programs in 40 states and the District of Columbia that make it easier for low-income families to sign up for food stamps. The stated rationale is that some people who are getting help do not need it. But the evidence suggests that problem is quite small, while the proposed solution is likely to keep millions of Americans who do need help from getting it.</p><p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helped 33.5 million people in the average month over the last year - mostly families with children, older Americans and people with disabilities - to buy a limited range of groceries from a list of supervised retailers. In place of the original coupons, beneficiaries now get an average of $127 loaded on a special debit card.</p><p>The program is enormously successful in mitigating poverty. Studies of Americans born in the 1960s, when the program was implemented nationally, show that children in families that received benefits went on to lead healthier and more productive lives.</p><p>Most beneficiaries live in households with incomes up to 130 percent of the federal poverty line - $32,640 a year in 2019 for a family of two adults and two children. But in 1996, as part of a broad overhaul of federal aid for lower-income families, Congress let states expand eligibility even as it curtailed benefits. States can offer food stamps to households with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty line, or around $50,200 a year for a family with two children. States also can waive a requirement that beneficiaries must have no more than $2,250 in assets.</p><p>Critics have long argued that the expansion was overly generous; the Trump administration is proposing to substantially restore the old rules. Officials at the Agriculture Department have highlighted the example of Rob Undersander, a 66-year-old Minnesota resident who qualified to receive food stamps even though he had more than a million dollars in assets because Minnesota, like most states, has chosen to waive the asset cap.</p><p>Mr. Undersander applied for food stamps in 2016, in the manner of a man who robs a bank to demonstrate the need for more security. He collected more than $6,000 in benefits he did not need, donating the money to charity while seeking to publicize his story.</p><p>\"There may be other millionaires\" on food stamps, an administration official told reporters.</p><p>But the proposed changes are not tailored to keep millionaires from getting food stamps. They would keep millions of low-income families from getting food stamps.</p><p>The Trump administration estimates that 4.9 percent of beneficiaries live in households with incomes above 130 percent of the poverty line. But all recipients, including those households, still must demonstrate that their disposable incomes, after deductions for housing, child care, and other basic expenses, fall below the poverty line. That's hardly an open-door policy - which is why relatively few households qualify. And those with higher incomes get smaller monthly payments. The program is meant to cover the gap between income and need.</p><p>The administration estimates another 4.1 percent of beneficiaries live in households with more than $2,250 in eligible assets. The standard excludes some kinds of savings, like equity in a home or money in a retirement plan. But it is still draconian. A worker in a minimum-wage job who managed to save three months of salary for a rainy day would lose his or her eligibility for food stamps as a consequence. The threshold was set at $2,000 in the mid-1980s, but only indexed to inflation in 2008. As a result, it has become much more restrictive than the original intent.</p><p>A reasonable asset ceiling, set at a level that allows rainy-day savings, has obvious appeal. But the evidence suggests that it would exclude very few people, because those with low incomes tend to have scant savings, and would impose large costs. According to the Trump administration's own estimates, states would have to employ the equivalent of 6,672 new workers solely devoted to asset verification. The government, in other words, probably saved a lot of money by allowing Mr. Undersander to collect some benefits.</p><p>In all, the administration says the government can save about $2 billion a year by denying benefits to 3.1 million people who would not meet the old standards. By the same logic, the government could save $60 billion a year by suspending the entire program. But those savings will not come from denying food stamps to millionaires. The vast majority of the government's money is given to Americans who are hungry, so they may eat.</p><p>The proposal once again highlights the gap between Mr. Trump's rhetorical promises to help lower-income American families, and the reality of his policies, which have systematically made life more difficult for those very families. The administration has slashed taxes on affluent Americans and significantly increased total federal spending - on Thursday (July 25), it announced plans to give another $16 billion to farmers hurt by Mr. Trump's trade policies - even as it seeks to make a show of fiscal discipline at the expense of children.</p><p>Congress should move to codify the current food stamp rules, which have been embraced by red and blue states alike, to protect millions of Americans from this act of theatrical cruelty.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 27</p><p>The Baltimore Sun on President Trump's criticism of Maryland's seventh congressional district, represented by Congressman Elijah Cummings:</p><p>In case anyone missed it, the president of the United States had some choice words to describe Maryland's 7th congressional district on Saturday morning. Here are the key phrases: \"no human being would want to live there,\" it is a \"very dangerous &amp; filthy place,\" ''Worst in the USA\" and, our personal favorite: It is a \"rat and rodent infested mess.\" He wasn't really speaking of the 7th as a whole. He failed to mention Ellicott City, for example, or Baldwin or Monkton or Prettyboy, all of which are contained in the sprawling yet oddly-shaped district that runs from western Howard County to southern Harford County. No, Donald Trump's wrath was directed at Baltimore and specifically at Rep. Elijah Cummings, the 68-year-old son of a former South Carolina sharecropper who has represented the district in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1996.</p><p>It's not hard to see what's going on here. The congressman has been a thorn in this president's side, and Mr. Trump sees attacking African American members of Congress as good politics, as it both warms the cockles of the white supremacists who love him and causes so many of the thoughtful people who don't to scream. President Trump bad-mouthed Baltimore in order to make a point that the border camps are \"clean, efficient &amp; well run,\" which, of course, they are not - unless you are fine with all the overcrowding, squalor, cages and deprivation to be found in what the Department of Homeland Security's own inspector-general recently called \"a ticking time bomb.\"</p><p>In pointing to the 7th, the president wasn't hoping his supporters would recognize landmarks like Johns Hopkins Hospital, perhaps the nation's leading medical center. He wasn't conjuring images of the U.S. Social Security Administration, where they write the checks that so many retired and disabled Americans depend upon. It wasn't about the beauty of the Inner Harbor or the proud history of Fort McHenry. And it surely wasn't about the economic standing of a district where the median income is actually above the national average. No, he was returning to an old standby of attacking an African American lawmaker from a majority black district on the most emotional and bigoted of arguments. It was only surprising that there wasn't room for a few classic phrases like \"you people\" or \"welfare queens\" or \"crime-ridden ghettos\" or a suggestion that the congressman \"go back\" to where he came from.</p><p>This is a president who will happily debase himself at the slightest provocation. And given Mr. Cummings' criticisms of U.S. border policy, the various investigations he has launched as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, his willingness to call Mr. Trump a racist for his recent attacks on the freshmen congresswomen, and the fact that \"Fox &amp; Friends\" had recently aired a segment critical of the city, slamming Baltimore must have been irresistible in a Pavlovian way. Fox News rang the bell, the president salivated and his thumbs moved across his cell phone into action.</p><p>As heartening as it has been to witness public figures rise to Charm City's defense on Saturday, from native daughter House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Mayor Bernard C. \"Jack\" Young, we would above all remind Mr. Trump that the 7th District, Baltimore included, is part of the United States that he is supposedly governing. The White House has far more power to effect change in this city, for good or ill, than any single member of Congress including Mr. Cummings. If there are problems here, rodents included, they are as much his responsibility as anyone's, perhaps more because he holds the most powerful office in the land.</p><p>Finally, while we would not sink to name-calling in the Trumpian manner - or ruefully point out that he failed to spell the congressman's name correctly (it's Cummings, not Cumming) - we would tell the most dishonest man to ever occupy the Oval Office, the mocker of war heroes, the gleeful grabber of women's private parts, the serial bankrupter of businesses, the useful idiot of Vladimir Putin and the guy who insisted there are \"good people\" among murderous neo-Nazis that he's still not fooling most Americans into believing he's even slightly competent in his current post. Or that he possesses a scintilla of integrity. Better to have some vermin living in your neighborhood than to be one.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com\">https://www.baltimoresun.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 25</p><p>The Toronto Star on efforts to rein in the power of big technology companies:</p><p>\"In a lot of ways,\" Mark Zuckerberg has famously said, \"Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company.\"</p><p>Much the same could be said of the other tech giants that set the rules for so much of our lives - especially Google, Amazon and Apple. Real governments struggle to tame the beast in areas ranging from privacy and democracy to taxation and corporate clout. Facebook even has plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, called Libra.</p><p>Finally, though, there are signs governments are stirring themselves to meet the challenge - and not a moment too soon.</p><p>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a record fine of $5 billion (last) week for misleading its users about the privacy of their personal information. In addition, the FTC ordered the company to set up a new board-level committee on privacy and make its data practices more transparent.</p><p>That's a lot of money. But for Facebook, even a fine of that size is just the cost of doing business. It earned more than that in the last quarter alone and its stocked jumped 56 per cent last year while it weathered a storm of criticism.</p><p>The bigger potential challenge to Facebook and the rest comes from another direction. After years of leaving the big tech firms to pretty much regulate themselves, the U.S. government has launched investigations into how they have amassed so much market power and whether they've violated antitrust laws.</p><p>This is a big change. So far the tech companies have faced their biggest push-back in Europe while Washington tended to defend them as champions of innovation. But now the U.S. Justice Department and federal regulators are lining up Facebook et al in their sights.</p><p>And it isn't just about privacy, \"fake news\" and similar well-publicized concerns about social media and the health of democracy. Those are important, but the real stakes for the dominant tech companies lie in a challenge to the enormous market power they have accumulated in just a few years.</p><p>An antitrust review could put into question that power, the near-monopoly grip on key markets that lets them dominate billions of dollars in advertising revenue, squeeze out potential competitors, dictate terms of business, and avoid paying tax in many of the places they operate. Even breaking up some of the biggest companies would be a real possibility - especially if a Democrat wins the White House next year.</p><p>With all that, you might expect a lively debate among Canada's political parties on how to meet the tech challenge. For the most part, though, you'd be disappointed.</p><p>The Trudeau government brought in new rules governing election advertising online and foreign meddling in campaigns. But it had no effective response when Google simply said it won't carry any election ads rather than meet the Canadian requirements.</p><p>And Canada's privacy commissioner was left to sputter impotently when he rebuked the company for violating the privacy of 620,000 Canadian users and it brushed him off. It turns out he has no power to tell Facebook to do anything. Even if he takes the company to court and wins, the maximum fine would be a risible $100,000.</p><p>On the key issue of taxation, Canada's position is to wait to see what the big boys do. Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the Star's Heather Scoffield recently that Canada wants to see what G7 leaders decide at their summit in France next month, so there can be common rules for all.</p><p>As for the future, the best the Liberals can offer is the tepid \"digital charter\" that Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains unveiled in May. It points in the right direction on privacy and other issues, but there's no reason the government could not have moved faster in those areas.</p><p>Canadians deserve better. The trend across the developed world clearly favours reining in Big Tech, and Canada should be more than a bystander as these parallel governments are brought under control.</p><p>The coming election campaign will be an ideal time for the federal parties to spell out how they would meet that challenge.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com\">https://www.thestar.com</url>/</p><p>___</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-d3d1ece3bcdc483c9e6387bfd229b872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPM-5RT1-JC65-534D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3814\"/><timeReceived>8:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.organization\"><classificationItem><className>Russia government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Senate</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Mitch McConnell, POLITICIAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller, GOVERNMENT_FIGURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dana Milbank, JOURNALIST</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vladimir Putin, POLITICIAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Barack Obama, POLITICIAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nancy Pelosi, POLITICIAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George W.

The Justice Department will soon make its decision on the merger, and Democrats, unions and big business are lining up to defeat it at the expense of America's leadership in 5G telecom networks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The State AGs say the merger \"would eliminate Sprint as a competitor and reduce the number of (mobile network operators) with nationwide networks in the United States from four to three.\" But a market of three strong wireless players would be more competitive than a de facto duopoly led by AT&amp;T and Verizon. T-Mobile has 79 million customers while Sprint boasts 54 million compared to Verizon (118 million) and AT&amp;T (94 million). The Big Two need a strong competitor, not two weaklings that may not survive for long.</p><p>More spectrum improves connectivity and boosts download speeds, which helps the two giants attract more customers. With more revenue, they can procure more spectrum at government auctions to improve their networks. AT&amp;T also came into a sweet spectrum deal two years ago when the Commerce Department selected it to build a national emergency network for first-responders.</p><p>For years T-Mobile and Sprint have been slashing prices to compete with the Big Two. As the state AGs note, the average cost per megabyte of data declined by between 72% and 83% between 2013 and 2017. The problem is that all of the carriers have piled up debt that could retard their 5G build-out.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon have used much of their cash paying for content acquisitions rather than investing in 5G. AT&amp;T has curbed price cuts to pay down $171 billion in debt from buying DirecTV and Time Warner. Verizon has $113 billion in debt and is writing off its misconceived Yahoo and AOL acquisitions that were supposed to help it compete with Google.</p><p>While AT&amp;T and Verizon have begun to roll out 5G service in some markets, T-Mobile and Sprint lack the complementary spectrum and capital to compete nationwide. So there's less impetus for AT&amp;T and Verizon to accelerate their 5G plans, improve efficiency or redirect misallocated capital from more glamorous media plays.</p><p>The Democratic AGs claim to be standing for competition, but in opposing the T-Mobile-Sprint merger they're entrenching the Big Two. It's worth recalling that competition from Sprint and MCI is what finally broke AT&amp;T's monopoly on long-distance service in the 1980s. Long-distance prices fell rapidly.</p><p>Sprint and T-Mobile have already committed to deploying a 5G network that would cover 97% of the U.S. population within three years including 85% of rural Americans. They have also agreed to maintain current prices for at least three years, which is three years longer than either Verizon or AT&amp;T. The AG warnings about price increases are false.</p><p>As ever, there's a union-Democratic Party merger here. The Communications Workers of America, who represent AT&amp;T and Verizon workers, oppose the tie between the nonunion Sprint and T-Mobile. The last thing they want is a stronger nonunion competitor. The union is a big financier of Democrats, and it endorsed the AGs in coordinated fashion on Tuesday.</p><p>All of this lobbying is aimed directly at persuading Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim to oppose the deal. Justice attorneys have been demanding divestitures with perhaps an eye to recreating a fourth wireless carrier. Cable companies that aim to launch plans with wireless carriers' spectrum - Altice already has a contract with Sprint - have criticized the deal for thwarting competition. But cable companies merely want to fortify their regional monopolies, especially in rural areas where a merged T-Mobile-Sprint could compete.</p><p>While the media obsess about Big Tech and antitrust, the T-Mobile-Sprint merger may be more consequential for America's future. More of the world economy is becoming digital every day, and 5G is essential to capturing the benefits of artificial intelligence and much more. The U.S. can't afford to fall behind by depending on a unionized duopoly. While Democratic AGs and unions may not care if 5G plods along, anyone who wants to preserve America's global competitiveness should.</p><p>Online:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url></p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The Minneapolis Star Tribune on U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar:</p><p>U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is back in the news again, and not in a good way. The former state representative who won a seat in Congress last fall continues to be dogged by past missteps, this time eight violations of Minnesota campaign-finance law that will cost her nearly $3,500 in reimbursements and civil penalties.</p><p>So complex were the allegations that the state Campaign Finance Board spent nearly a year assessing the case, deposing staff people and former staff people, along with Omar herself. The investigation was broadened in October - just a month before her election to Congress - to look more deeply into the allegations. Board Executive Director Jeff Sigurdson said that between six and eight people were deposed separately.</p><p>In an October 2018 editorial, we called on Omar to more fully explain her travel and other expenses. We noted that the allegations \"suggest a pattern of carelessness and/or self-dealing with legally restricted funds. Neither conclusion inspires the confidence voters deserve to have in someone they send to the U.S. House to represent them.\"</p><p>It is even more disturbing, therefore, to learn that among the board's latest findings was a troubling discovery that is far beyond its jurisdiction, but worthy of greater scrutiny nevertheless. Omar, for two years running, filed joint tax returns with a man she was living with but not legally married to. Complicating matters further, she was legally married to another man at the time.</p><p>It's against the law in Minnesota to file jointly unless one filer is legally married to the other. Last year Omar told the Star Tribune that she had married her partner \"in her faith,\" and had earlier divorced her first husband \"in her faith.\" That's fine for religious purposes. But for tax purposes, only civil marriages qualify. It's not known whether she benefited materially by filing jointly. That is something that voters, who are obliged to follow tax laws no matter how painful, are entitled to know.</p><p>It's not too much to expect that a lawmaker would check with a tax attorney on a rather complicated marital status before filing. And when questions arise, it's a violation to use campaign funds to clear up those personal issues, as Omar apparently did. The Campaign Finance Board has ordered that she reimburse her campaign $3,469 for violations related to her tax returns and non-campaign travel costs. She must also pay a $500 civil penalty.</p><p>Omar is no stranger to controversy. As a new state House member, she collected $2,500 in speaking fees - $2,000 from Normandale Community College and $500 from Inver Hills Community College - for appearances made shortly after she took office. Rep. Steve Drazkowski, R-Mazeppa, who publicly noted that state law prohibits legislators from collecting such fees from groups that have business before the Legislature, made that public, and Omar returned the money. Drazkowski also filed the latest complaint. \"It's very clear there are huge ethical problems with Rep. Omar,\" he told an editorial writer, adding that the House should consider an ethics investigation.</p><p>If this pattern continues, further investigation may be necessary. Omar could have avoided nearly every infraction by taking simple measures in advance to determine whether her actions would pass legal muster. In its findings, the board noted that Minnesota \"House Research staff did explain that generally when they discuss whether a member can accept something of value, for example, travel and lodging reimbursement ... they discuss whether that would violate the gift prohibition,\" but do not advise. \"Rather, they commonly refer members to the Board. The Omar committee did not contact Board staff ... on the appropriateness of using committee funds for the travel reviewed in this investigation.\"</p><p>Omar's political rise has been marred by a series of unforced errors, including intemperate remarks and tweets earlier this year that were widely perceived as anti-Semitic. Every month seems to bring a fresh problem.</p><p>As an elected representative for Minnesota and one of the first Muslim women and Somali refugees elected to Congress, Omar is helping to break new ground. But more is expected of her than the symbolism attached to her victory. Omar has a special obligation to be worthy of the trust so many have placed in her, including many still-new Americans who expect better.</p><p>Online:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.startribune.com\">http://www.startribune.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The Los Angeles Times on the rising number of horse deaths at Santa Anita Park:</p><p>On Saturday, a 4-year-old gelding named Formal Dude was euthanized after injuring itself during a race at Santa Anita Park. Formal Dude was the 28th horse to die from racing or training at the beleaguered track since December.</p><p>At that point, the California Horse Racing Board had had enough, and it took the extraordinary step of asking Santa Anita to suspend racing for the few days remaining in this season at the park.</p><p>But Santa Anita's owners refused, and on Sunday the racing continued. That's when a 3-year-old filly, Truffalino, collapsed and died just after the jockey pulled the horse out of a race. Truffalino became the 29th fatality of the season.</p><p>Frankly, we're appalled. There have now been numerous calls for the Stronach Group, which owns the Santa Anita track, to suspend racing - from animal welfare groups and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), among others. On May 29, this editorial board also called for a suspension.</p><p>All have urged the park to wait for the results from the official necropsies on these horses and an investigation into the mysterious spate of deaths that has bedeviled the Santa Anita track all year. It's reckless enough to keep racing before the park has all the information it needs. But it's disdainful and arrogant to do it in defiance of the state horse racing regulators.</p><p>It's time to give the racing board the authority to compel a suspension. State Senate Bill 469 would, among other things, allow the board to suspend a track's license to conduct horse racing when necessary to protect the health and safety of horses or riders. The bill should be approved. Furthermore, a congressional bill, HR 1754, the Horseracing Integrity Act, would establish some national oversight of a fragmented sport that is governed by different racing boards with different rules in every state. The congressional bill would ban race-day use of a common diuretic, Lasix, and establish a uniform medication control program to be developed and enforced by an independent authority.</p><p>There's no question that Santa Anita has instituted some ground-breaking reforms governing the administration of drugs to horses on the track, and setting new rules for trainers and jockeys. After a spike in deaths from late December through March, the park closed for several weeks and put in place some of the new rules. After that, the park went six weeks with no deaths.</p><p>Then another rash of deaths began. Not all were broken legs. A couple were pelvic injuries. Some were what horse experts call rare or freak occurrences - such as shoulder injuries. Yet, two horses at the park suffered life-ending shoulder injuries in the last few weeks, making them seem less freakish. In the last week alone, there have been three deaths. But in a statement Sunday, the Stronach Group and the Thoroughbred Owners of California and the California Thoroughbred Trainers noted the drop in catastrophic injuries and reiterated that the reforms were working. The statement said that \"the reality is that our improvements and changes have been effective.\"</p><p>Really? Then why have we seen multiple deaths in a few weeks' time? At this point, the park has six days of racing left in its season, which closes June 23. Then it returns in the fall for about a month and a half.</p><p>In calendar year 2018, according to statistics kept by the Jockey Club, Santa Anita's rate of deaths per 1,000 \"starts\" (a horse literally starting a race) was 2.04. That's substantially higher than last year's national average of 1.68. It's lower, though, than the alarming death rate of 2.73 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>Over time, Americans have to decide how much death they are willing to tolerate in this ancient sport. More immediately, though, the owners of the track at Santa Anita have to face up to the troubling, unexplained deaths that have occurred this past year. And they should not risk any more horses' lives for the rest of this season.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com\">http://www.latimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The London Evening Standard on the challenges facing candidates for Prime Minister of the United Kingdom:</p><p>\"Never again,\" said the Conservative world, after Theresa May walked into the Tory leadership underprepared and unscrutinised three years ago. Next time, everyone insisted, candidates for the premiership, and their plans for office, should be put under the microscope. And yet here we are, in the week of the first ballot for choosing the next prime minister, and the most probing question being asked on TV and radio of the contenders is: what drugs did you take when you were younger? The unsurprising answer, like many people of their generation, is that, yes, most of them tried illegal substances at some point.</p><p>It's almost 30 years since Bill Clinton admitted smoking marijuana, 25 since Barack Obama confessed to taking cocaine, and 15 since David Cameron said politicians were entitled to a private past. It's time to move on to the serious questions that face anyone who wants to be prime minister. Let's start with the biggest: who has a plan to unblock the impasse over Brexit? Threatening a no-deal departure is hollow, because there isn't a parliamentary majority for one and (thankfully) no realistic way to stop Parliament meeting to express that majority. Promising a renegotiation with the EU, and wishing away the Irish backstop, isn't something anyone in the rest of Europe believes is credible. Passing a version of the existing deal on the table was something Mrs May failed three times to achieve. Meanwhile none of the leading contenders dare raise the prospect of a referendum, let alone an election. If candidates pretend it is easy to achieve what the current administration has found impossible, then they should be challenged.</p><p>Perhaps they can drive Brussels into submission; perhaps an Irish border commission involving the Republic might find a way through; perhaps a new leader will be able to reassemble a Tory majority. We need to see the evidence. To those who say they can deliver Brexit by October 31, we simply ask: how? To those who say they would be prepared to delay beyond that, we ask: how will that help? The very least the public deserve is that those who want to enter Number 10 in a few weeks' time are grilled seriously on their Brexit plan. The same applies to the other policy pledges that are coming thick and fast.</p><p>New ideas needed</p><p>A leadership contest is a time for new ideas, and it's right that - as the saying goes - in democracies we campaign in poetry and govern in prose. So we're not asking for every detail of every policy. But some idea of how things will be paid for is necessary if the country is not to be further misled by those who govern it.</p><p>Raising the tax threshold at which people pay 40 per cent beyond \u00a350,000 is a solid Conservative idea that builds on what has already been achieved. Every modern society will want to invest in education but why have the Tories given up talking about the reform that means investment will be well spent? We want more housing but where are you going to build it? We'd all like to provide decent social care without raiding people's homes and savings but the answer has eluded numerous governments. Using the \"headroom\" in the public finances to fund all these commitments, as the candidates suggest, is code for \"we'll borrow more\". There's nothing intrinsically wrong with that, if you explain it means a bigger national debt than would otherwise exist, and then higher taxes and spending cuts in the future.</p><p>Nor can candidates hide behind their \"consciences\" on social issues. Reducing the abortion limit is not solely a matter of personal belief when you're a legislator whose beliefs could impose serious, health-threatening restrictions on millions of women. Let's hear how you can morally justify that. And where is the debate about the disruption coming from technology? How do we harness all the exciting possibilities of artificial intelligence, genomics and robotics while mitigating the potential harm?</p><p>We've heard precious little. What we've had instead is more a replay of the Tory best hits from circa 1990. Britain faces the greatest political crisis for a generation. The foundations of our economic prosperity and security are threatened. We face profound change in our society. It's time the questions to our leaders matched the seriousness of the task that lies ahead of them.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.standard.co.uk\">http://www.standard.co.uk</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 9</p><p>The New York Times on the congressional response to an increase of migrants at the southern border:</p><p>Last week, as American and Mexican officials haggled over how to address the migrant crisis at their countries' shared border, United States Customs and Border Protection released its monthly migration statistics. They tell an alarming story.</p><p>In May, 144,278 migrants were taken into custody. It was the third consecutive month in which apprehensions topped 100,000 and the highest one-month total in 13 years.</p><p>Unequipped to deal with the crush, border facilities and migrant shelters are dangerously overcrowded, and the staff is overburdened. Dysfunction, disease and even death are a growing reality.</p><p>\"We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger: The system is broken,\" the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.</p><p>Also last week, officials said that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency assigned to care for unaccompanied migrant children, would begin cutting services \"not directly necessary for the protection of life and safety.\" This includes English classes, legal aid and recreational programs.</p><p>Democrats and other administration critics called the move \"cruel\" and \"illegal,\" but the financial reality is that the agency is overwhelmed. So far this fiscal year, it has taken charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied children - a 57 percent increase over last year. The entire program could run out of funding by the end of June.</p><p>In short, it is time for Congress to stop dithering and pass emergency funding to deal with this nightmare.</p><p>It has been more than a month since the administration sent Congress a request for $4.5 billion in additional border assistance. A large portion of the money, $3.3 billion, was earmarked for humanitarian aid - which most lawmakers agree is sorely needed. But a relatively modest piece of the request aimed at shoring up border security operations, roughly a quarter of the total, has tied negotiators in knots.</p><p>Early on, Democrats were opposed to funding additional detention beds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Republicans had problems with Democrats' demands for changes in the administration's asylum policies. At one point, negotiators thought they were close to resolving these conflicts, only to have other issues snarl the process. Beyond the money for security, one of the remaining disagreements is how much data sharing will be allowed between the agencies responsible for caring for migrant children and those that handle border enforcement.</p><p>The broader problem is that many Democrats have come to view the Trump administration as untrustworthy, and they are loath to hand over one more penny for anything to do with immigration. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have been particularly adamant, insisting that their leadership take a hard line in negotiations. In part, they fear that the administration, despite its promises, will spend any additional funding on enforcement rather than humanitarian needs.</p><p>There is much to despise about this administration's immigration policies, which are exacerbating this crisis, but there should be no ambivalence about the urgency of addressing the humanitarian needs. While lawmakers wring their hands and drag their feet, tens of thousands of migrant children are suffering.</p><p>Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that suffering.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com\">http://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 7</p><p>The Boston Globe on CBD, the nonintoxicating, natural molecule extracted from the cannabis plant:</p><p>If you believe the hype, one little bottle of CBD contains miracles. It treats diabetes; reduces stress; alleviates chronic pain and anxiety; even cures acne. Trouble sleeping? Panicky pet? CBD to the rescue.</p><p>All that, and so much more - at a bargain price as low as $40 for some formulas. This potent potable also comes mixed into body lotions, bath salts, coffee, smoothies, gummy bears, chocolate, cheese pizza, and dog biscuits.</p><p>The fad for cannabidiol, or CBD, has clearly gone mainstream. From virtually nothing a few years ago, sales of the cannabis-related compound have exploded into a billion-dollar market. CBD's true believers tout one miraculous health claim after the next.</p><p>In light of the wide dissemination of these beliefs, CBD claims deserve careful scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration - and some attention from state regulators, too. Despite its ubiquity, CBD is still largely an unresearched substance in the United States. Exaggerated or unproven claims need to be challenged, and the industry shouldn't be permitted to introduce CBD into food products until the compound is better understood.</p><p>CBD is the nonintoxicating, natural molecule extracted from the cannabis plant. CBD is found in marijuana, of course, but it's also present in hemp, the related plant whose cultivation in the US was legalized by Congress in December.</p><p>Its proven medical uses are confined to a drug the FDA approved last summer to treat two rare forms of pediatric epilepsy. It's the first - and only - medicine derived from cannabis that has been green-lighted by the federal agency.</p><p>Because CBD is already sold as a drug, federal law technically bans its use in food and drink that crosses state lines. \"Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk, as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective,\" Scott Gottlieb, then the FDA commissioner, wrote in a statement when hemp production was legalized.</p><p>But enforcement is largely left to states, where it has been uneven. Earlier this year, New York City health officials banned bakeries and restaurants from selling food and beverages with CBD. Ohio and Maine have also moved proactively.</p><p>In Massachusetts, though, the sale of products containing hemp-derived CBD is still loosely regulated. For instance, the state has not addressed sales of food and drink made with CBD. But it has at least issued guidance for commercial growers and processors of industrial hemp. Among other things, the state Department of Agricultural Resources requires producers to label any product they make for human consumption that contains CBD with a warning stating the product is derived from industrial hemp, that it \"has not been analyzed or approved by the FDA,\" and that it \"has not been tested or approved by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources.\"</p><p>Now, maybe adding CBD to food is safe. And maybe it really can deliver medicinal benefits. But sorting through the safety and efficacy claims requires a more muscular FDA role. Last month, the FDA held a much-awaited hearing on how to regulate CBD consumer products and got an earful on the need for a science-based approach to regulation. \"Currently, states are struggling with the lack of sound scientific research available in CBD and long-term health impacts, including those to children,\" said a Virginia state official. Most medical experts agreed that CBD holds potential medicinal properties, but more clinical trials are needed before allowing the hemp extract to be added to food and drink.</p><p>The hazy legal status of hemp-derived CBD until December, coupled with lack of funding, deterred studies in the past. Now researchers need to determine how different doses affect consumers; how CBD affects children; how it interacts with medical conditions and medications; how it affects pregnant women; whether long-term use carries risks; and if the purported benefits are scientifically verifiable.</p><p>None of which is to say that CBD itself should be banned. Coke is still available, after all; the company just no longer claims that the beverage cures headaches and upset stomach. ...</p><p>Online:</p><p><url

The Justice Department will soon make its decision on the merger, and Democrats, unions and big business are lining up to defeat it at the expense of America's leadership in 5G telecom networks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The State AGs say the merger \"would eliminate Sprint as a competitor and reduce the number of (mobile network operators) with nationwide networks in the United States from four to three.\" But a market of three strong wireless players would be more competitive than a de facto duopoly led by AT&amp;T and Verizon. T-Mobile has 79 million customers while Sprint boasts 54 million compared to Verizon (118 million) and AT&amp;T (94 million). The Big Two need a strong competitor, not two weaklings that may not survive for long.</p><p>More spectrum improves connectivity and boosts download speeds, which helps the two giants attract more customers. With more revenue, they can procure more spectrum at government auctions to improve their networks. AT&amp;T also came into a sweet spectrum deal two years ago when the Commerce Department selected it to build a national emergency network for first-responders.</p><p>For years T-Mobile and Sprint have been slashing prices to compete with the Big Two. As the state AGs note, the average cost per megabyte of data declined by between 72% and 83% between 2013 and 2017. The problem is that all of the carriers have piled up debt that could retard their 5G build-out.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon have used much of their cash paying for content acquisitions rather than investing in 5G. AT&amp;T has curbed price cuts to pay down $171 billion in debt from buying DirecTV and Time Warner. Verizon has $113 billion in debt and is writing off its misconceived Yahoo and AOL acquisitions that were supposed to help it compete with Google.</p><p>While AT&amp;T and Verizon have begun to roll out 5G service in some markets, T-Mobile and Sprint lack the complementary spectrum and capital to compete nationwide. So there's less impetus for AT&amp;T and Verizon to accelerate their 5G plans, improve efficiency or redirect misallocated capital from more glamorous media plays.</p><p>The Democratic AGs claim to be standing for competition, but in opposing the T-Mobile-Sprint merger they're entrenching the Big Two. It's worth recalling that competition from Sprint and MCI is what finally broke AT&amp;T's monopoly on long-distance service in the 1980s. Long-distance prices fell rapidly.</p><p>Sprint and T-Mobile have already committed to deploying a 5G network that would cover 97% of the U.S. population within three years including 85% of rural Americans. They have also agreed to maintain current prices for at least three years, which is three years longer than either Verizon or AT&amp;T. The AG warnings about price increases are false.</p><p>As ever, there's a union-Democratic Party merger here. The Communications Workers of America, who represent AT&amp;T and Verizon workers, oppose the tie between the nonunion Sprint and T-Mobile. The last thing they want is a stronger nonunion competitor. The union is a big financier of Democrats, and it endorsed the AGs in coordinated fashion on Tuesday.</p><p>All of this lobbying is aimed directly at persuading Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim to oppose the deal. Justice attorneys have been demanding divestitures with perhaps an eye to recreating a fourth wireless carrier. Cable companies that aim to launch plans with wireless carriers' spectrum - Altice already has a contract with Sprint - have criticized the deal for thwarting competition. But cable companies merely want to fortify their regional monopolies, especially in rural areas where a merged T-Mobile-Sprint could compete.</p><p>While the media obsess about Big Tech and antitrust, the T-Mobile-Sprint merger may be more consequential for America's future. More of the world economy is becoming digital every day, and 5G is essential to capturing the benefits of artificial intelligence and much more. The U.S. can't afford to fall behind by depending on a unionized duopoly. While Democratic AGs and unions may not care if 5G plods along, anyone who wants to preserve America's global competitiveness should.</p><p>Online:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url></p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The Minneapolis Star Tribune on U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar:</p><p>U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is back in the news again, and not in a good way. The former state representative who won a seat in Congress last fall continues to be dogged by past missteps, this time eight violations of Minnesota campaign-finance law that will cost her nearly $3,500 in reimbursements and civil penalties.</p><p>So complex were the allegations that the state Campaign Finance Board spent nearly a year assessing the case, deposing staff people and former staff people, along with Omar herself. The investigation was broadened in October - just a month before her election to Congress - to look more deeply into the allegations. Board Executive Director Jeff Sigurdson said that between six and eight people were deposed separately.</p><p>In an October 2018 editorial, we called on Omar to more fully explain her travel and other expenses. We noted that the allegations \"suggest a pattern of carelessness and/or self-dealing with legally restricted funds. Neither conclusion inspires the confidence voters deserve to have in someone they send to the U.S. House to represent them.\"</p><p>It is even more disturbing, therefore, to learn that among the board's latest findings was a troubling discovery that is far beyond its jurisdiction, but worthy of greater scrutiny nevertheless. Omar, for two years running, filed joint tax returns with a man she was living with but not legally married to. Complicating matters further, she was legally married to another man at the time.</p><p>It's against the law in Minnesota to file jointly unless one filer is legally married to the other. Last year Omar told the Star Tribune that she had married her partner \"in her faith,\" and had earlier divorced her first husband \"in her faith.\" That's fine for religious purposes. But for tax purposes, only civil marriages qualify. It's not known whether she benefited materially by filing jointly. That is something that voters, who are obliged to follow tax laws no matter how painful, are entitled to know.</p><p>It's not too much to expect that a lawmaker would check with a tax attorney on a rather complicated marital status before filing. And when questions arise, it's a violation to use campaign funds to clear up those personal issues, as Omar apparently did. The Campaign Finance Board has ordered that she reimburse her campaign $3,469 for violations related to her tax returns and non-campaign travel costs. She must also pay a $500 civil penalty.</p><p>Omar is no stranger to controversy. As a new state House member, she collected $2,500 in speaking fees - $2,000 from Normandale Community College and $500 from Inver Hills Community College - for appearances made shortly after she took office. Rep. Steve Drazkowski, R-Mazeppa, who publicly noted that state law prohibits legislators from collecting such fees from groups that have business before the Legislature, made that public, and Omar returned the money. Drazkowski also filed the latest complaint. \"It's very clear there are huge ethical problems with Rep. Omar,\" he told an editorial writer, adding that the House should consider an ethics investigation.</p><p>If this pattern continues, further investigation may be necessary. Omar could have avoided nearly every infraction by taking simple measures in advance to determine whether her actions would pass legal muster. In its findings, the board noted that Minnesota \"House Research staff did explain that generally when they discuss whether a member can accept something of value, for example, travel and lodging reimbursement ... they discuss whether that would violate the gift prohibition,\" but do not advise. \"Rather, they commonly refer members to the Board. The Omar committee did not contact Board staff ... on the appropriateness of using committee funds for the travel reviewed in this investigation.\"</p><p>Omar's political rise has been marred by a series of unforced errors, including intemperate remarks and tweets earlier this year that were widely perceived as anti-Semitic. Every month seems to bring a fresh problem.</p><p>As an elected representative for Minnesota and one of the first Muslim women and Somali refugees elected to Congress, Omar is helping to break new ground. But more is expected of her than the symbolism attached to her victory. Omar has a special obligation to be worthy of the trust so many have placed in her, including many still-new Americans who expect better.</p><p>Online:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.startribune.com\">http://www.startribune.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The Los Angeles Times on the rising number of horse deaths at Santa Anita Park:</p><p>On Saturday, a 4-year-old gelding named Formal Dude was euthanized after injuring itself during a race at Santa Anita Park. Formal Dude was the 28th horse to die from racing or training at the beleaguered track since December.</p><p>At that point, the California Horse Racing Board had had enough, and it took the extraordinary step of asking Santa Anita to suspend racing for the few days remaining in this season at the park.</p><p>But Santa Anita's owners refused, and on Sunday the racing continued. That's when a 3-year-old filly, Truffalino, collapsed and died just after the jockey pulled the horse out of a race. Truffalino became the 29th fatality of the season.</p><p>Frankly, we're appalled. There have now been numerous calls for the Stronach Group, which owns the Santa Anita track, to suspend racing - from animal welfare groups and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), among others. On May 29, this editorial board also called for a suspension.</p><p>All have urged the park to wait for the results from the official necropsies on these horses and an investigation into the mysterious spate of deaths that has bedeviled the Santa Anita track all year. It's reckless enough to keep racing before the park has all the information it needs. But it's disdainful and arrogant to do it in defiance of the state horse racing regulators.</p><p>It's time to give the racing board the authority to compel a suspension. State Senate Bill 469 would, among other things, allow the board to suspend a track's license to conduct horse racing when necessary to protect the health and safety of horses or riders. The bill should be approved. Furthermore, a congressional bill, HR 1754, the Horseracing Integrity Act, would establish some national oversight of a fragmented sport that is governed by different racing boards with different rules in every state. The congressional bill would ban race-day use of a common diuretic, Lasix, and establish a uniform medication control program to be developed and enforced by an independent authority.</p><p>There's no question that Santa Anita has instituted some ground-breaking reforms governing the administration of drugs to horses on the track, and setting new rules for trainers and jockeys. After a spike in deaths from late December through March, the park closed for several weeks and put in place some of the new rules. After that, the park went six weeks with no deaths.</p><p>Then another rash of deaths began. Not all were broken legs. A couple were pelvic injuries. Some were what horse experts call rare or freak occurrences - such as shoulder injuries. Yet, two horses at the park suffered life-ending shoulder injuries in the last few weeks, making them seem less freakish. In the last week alone, there have been three deaths. But in a statement Sunday, the Stronach Group and the Thoroughbred Owners of California and the California Thoroughbred Trainers noted the drop in catastrophic injuries and reiterated that the reforms were working. The statement said that \"the reality is that our improvements and changes have been effective.\"</p><p>Really? Then why have we seen multiple deaths in a few weeks' time? At this point, the park has six days of racing left in its season, which closes June 23. Then it returns in the fall for about a month and a half.</p><p>In calendar year 2018, according to statistics kept by the Jockey Club, Santa Anita's rate of deaths per 1,000 \"starts\" (a horse literally starting a race) was 2.04. That's substantially higher than last year's national average of 1.68. It's lower, though, than the alarming death rate of 2.73 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>Over time, Americans have to decide how much death they are willing to tolerate in this ancient sport. More immediately, though, the owners of the track at Santa Anita have to face up to the troubling, unexplained deaths that have occurred this past year. And they should not risk any more horses' lives for the rest of this season.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com\">http://www.latimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The London Evening Standard on the challenges facing candidates for Prime Minister of the United Kingdom:</p><p>\"Never again,\" said the Conservative world, after Theresa May walked into the Tory leadership underprepared and unscrutinised three years ago. Next time, everyone insisted, candidates for the premiership, and their plans for office, should be put under the microscope. And yet here we are, in the week of the first ballot for choosing the next prime minister, and the most probing question being asked on TV and radio of the contenders is: what drugs did you take when you were younger? The unsurprising answer, like many people of their generation, is that, yes, most of them tried illegal substances at some point.</p><p>It's almost 30 years since Bill Clinton admitted smoking marijuana, 25 since Barack Obama confessed to taking cocaine, and 15 since David Cameron said politicians were entitled to a private past. It's time to move on to the serious questions that face anyone who wants to be prime minister. Let's start with the biggest: who has a plan to unblock the impasse over Brexit? Threatening a no-deal departure is hollow, because there isn't a parliamentary majority for one and (thankfully) no realistic way to stop Parliament meeting to express that majority. Promising a renegotiation with the EU, and wishing away the Irish backstop, isn't something anyone in the rest of Europe believes is credible. Passing a version of the existing deal on the table was something Mrs May failed three times to achieve. Meanwhile none of the leading contenders dare raise the prospect of a referendum, let alone an election. If candidates pretend it is easy to achieve what the current administration has found impossible, then they should be challenged.</p><p>Perhaps they can drive Brussels into submission; perhaps an Irish border commission involving the Republic might find a way through; perhaps a new leader will be able to reassemble a Tory majority. We need to see the evidence. To those who say they can deliver Brexit by October 31, we simply ask: how? To those who say they would be prepared to delay beyond that, we ask: how will that help? The very least the public deserve is that those who want to enter Number 10 in a few weeks' time are grilled seriously on their Brexit plan. The same applies to the other policy pledges that are coming thick and fast.</p><p>New ideas needed</p><p>A leadership contest is a time for new ideas, and it's right that - as the saying goes - in democracies we campaign in poetry and govern in prose. So we're not asking for every detail of every policy. But some idea of how things will be paid for is necessary if the country is not to be further misled by those who govern it.</p><p>Raising the tax threshold at which people pay 40 per cent beyond \u00a350,000 is a solid Conservative idea that builds on what has already been achieved. Every modern society will want to invest in education but why have the Tories given up talking about the reform that means investment will be well spent? We want more housing but where are you going to build it? We'd all like to provide decent social care without raiding people's homes and savings but the answer has eluded numerous governments. Using the \"headroom\" in the public finances to fund all these commitments, as the candidates suggest, is code for \"we'll borrow more\". There's nothing intrinsically wrong with that, if you explain it means a bigger national debt than would otherwise exist, and then higher taxes and spending cuts in the future.</p><p>Nor can candidates hide behind their \"consciences\" on social issues. Reducing the abortion limit is not solely a matter of personal belief when you're a legislator whose beliefs could impose serious, health-threatening restrictions on millions of women. Let's hear how you can morally justify that. And where is the debate about the disruption coming from technology? How do we harness all the exciting possibilities of artificial intelligence, genomics and robotics while mitigating the potential harm?</p><p>We've heard precious little. What we've had instead is more a replay of the Tory best hits from circa 1990. Britain faces the greatest political crisis for a generation. The foundations of our economic prosperity and security are threatened. We face profound change in our society. It's time the questions to our leaders matched the seriousness of the task that lies ahead of them.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.standard.co.uk\">http://www.standard.co.uk</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 9</p><p>The New York Times on the congressional response to an increase of migrants at the southern border:</p><p>Last week, as American and Mexican officials haggled over how to address the migrant crisis at their countries' shared border, United States Customs and Border Protection released its monthly migration statistics. They tell an alarming story.</p><p>In May, 144,278 migrants were taken into custody. It was the third consecutive month in which apprehensions topped 100,000 and the highest one-month total in 13 years.</p><p>Unequipped to deal with the crush, border facilities and migrant shelters are dangerously overcrowded, and the staff is overburdened. Dysfunction, disease and even death are a growing reality.</p><p>\"We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger: The system is broken,\" the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.</p><p>Also last week, officials said that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency assigned to care for unaccompanied migrant children, would begin cutting services \"not directly necessary for the protection of life and safety.\" This includes English classes, legal aid and recreational programs.</p><p>Democrats and other administration critics called the move \"cruel\" and \"illegal,\" but the financial reality is that the agency is overwhelmed. So far this fiscal year, it has taken charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied children - a 57 percent increase over last year. The entire program could run out of funding by the end of June.</p><p>In short, it is time for Congress to stop dithering and pass emergency funding to deal with this nightmare.</p><p>It has been more than a month since the administration sent Congress a request for $4.5 billion in additional border assistance. A large portion of the money, $3.3 billion, was earmarked for humanitarian aid - which most lawmakers agree is sorely needed. But a relatively modest piece of the request aimed at shoring up border security operations, roughly a quarter of the total, has tied negotiators in knots.</p><p>Early on, Democrats were opposed to funding additional detention beds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Republicans had problems with Democrats' demands for changes in the administration's asylum policies. At one point, negotiators thought they were close to resolving these conflicts, only to have other issues snarl the process. Beyond the money for security, one of the remaining disagreements is how much data sharing will be allowed between the agencies responsible for caring for migrant children and those that handle border enforcement.</p><p>The broader problem is that many Democrats have come to view the Trump administration as untrustworthy, and they are loath to hand over one more penny for anything to do with immigration. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have been particularly adamant, insisting that their leadership take a hard line in negotiations. In part, they fear that the administration, despite its promises, will spend any additional funding on enforcement rather than humanitarian needs.</p><p>There is much to despise about this administration's immigration policies, which are exacerbating this crisis, but there should be no ambivalence about the urgency of addressing the humanitarian needs. While lawmakers wring their hands and drag their feet, tens of thousands of migrant children are suffering.</p><p>Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that suffering.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com\">http://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 7</p><p>The Boston Globe on CBD, the nonintoxicating, natural molecule extracted from the cannabis plant:</p><p>If you believe the hype, one little bottle of CBD contains miracles. It treats diabetes; reduces stress; alleviates chronic pain and anxiety; even cures acne. Trouble sleeping? Panicky pet? CBD to the rescue.</p><p>All that, and so much more - at a bargain price as low as $40 for some formulas. This potent potable also comes mixed into body lotions, bath salts, coffee, smoothies, gummy bears, chocolate, cheese pizza, and dog biscuits.</p><p>The fad for cannabidiol, or CBD, has clearly gone mainstream. From virtually nothing a few years ago, sales of the cannabis-related compound have exploded into a billion-dollar market. CBD's true believers tout one miraculous health claim after the next.</p><p>In light of the wide dissemination of these beliefs, CBD claims deserve careful scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration - and some attention from state regulators, too. Despite its ubiquity, CBD is still largely an unresearched substance in the United States. Exaggerated or unproven claims need to be challenged, and the industry shouldn't be permitted to introduce CBD into food products until the compound is better understood.</p><p>CBD is the nonintoxicating, natural molecule extracted from the cannabis plant. CBD is found in marijuana, of course, but it's also present in hemp, the related plant whose cultivation in the US was legalized by Congress in December.</p><p>Its proven medical uses are confined to a drug the FDA approved last summer to treat two rare forms of pediatric epilepsy. It's the first - and only - medicine derived from cannabis that has been green-lighted by the federal agency.</p><p>Because CBD is already sold as a drug, federal law technically bans its use in food and drink that crosses state lines. \"Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk, as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective,\" Scott Gottlieb, then the FDA commissioner, wrote in a statement when hemp production was legalized.</p><p>But enforcement is largely left to states, where it has been uneven. Earlier this year, New York City health officials banned bakeries and restaurants from selling food and beverages with CBD. Ohio and Maine have also moved proactively.</p><p>In Massachusetts, though, the sale of products containing hemp-derived CBD is still loosely regulated. For instance, the state has not addressed sales of food and drink made with CBD. But it has at least issued guidance for commercial growers and processors of industrial hemp. Among other things, the state Department of Agricultural Resources requires producers to label any product they make for human consumption that contains CBD with a warning stating the product is derived from industrial hemp, that it \"has not been analyzed or approved by the FDA,\" and that it \"has not been tested or approved by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources.\"</p><p>Now, maybe adding CBD to food is safe. And maybe it really can deliver medicinal benefits. But sorting through the safety and efficacy claims requires a more muscular FDA role. Last month, the FDA held a much-awaited hearing on how to regulate CBD consumer products and got an earful on the need for a science-based approach to regulation. \"Currently, states are struggling with the lack of sound scientific research available in CBD and long-term health impacts, including those to children,\" said a Virginia state official. Most medical experts agreed that CBD holds potential medicinal properties, but more clinical trials are needed before allowing the hemp extract to be added to food and drink.</p><p>The hazy legal status of hemp-derived CBD until December, coupled with lack of funding, deterred studies in the past. Now researchers need to determine how different doses affect consumers; how CBD affects children; how it interacts with medical conditions and medications; how it affects pregnant women; whether long-term use carries risks; and if the purported benefits are scientifically verifiable.</p><p>None of which is to say that CBD itself should be banned. Coke is still available, after all; the company just no longer claims that the beverage cures headaches and upset stomach. ...</p><p>Online:</p><p><url

The Justice Department will soon make its decision on the merger, and Democrats, unions and big business are lining up to defeat it at the expense of America's leadership in 5G telecom networks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The State AGs say the merger \"would eliminate Sprint as a competitor and reduce the number of (mobile network operators) with nationwide networks in the United States from four to three.\" But a market of three strong wireless players would be more competitive than a de facto duopoly led by AT&amp;T and Verizon. T-Mobile has 79 million customers while Sprint boasts 54 million compared to Verizon (118 million) and AT&amp;T (94 million). The Big Two need a strong competitor, not two weaklings that may not survive for long.</p><p>More spectrum improves connectivity and boosts download speeds, which helps the two giants attract more customers. With more revenue, they can procure more spectrum at government auctions to improve their networks. AT&amp;T also came into a sweet spectrum deal two years ago when the Commerce Department selected it to build a national emergency network for first-responders.</p><p>For years T-Mobile and Sprint have been slashing prices to compete with the Big Two. As the state AGs note, the average cost per megabyte of data declined by between 72% and 83% between 2013 and 2017. The problem is that all of the carriers have piled up debt that could retard their 5G build-out.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon have used much of their cash paying for content acquisitions rather than investing in 5G. AT&amp;T has curbed price cuts to pay down $171 billion in debt from buying DirecTV and Time Warner. Verizon has $113 billion in debt and is writing off its misconceived Yahoo and AOL acquisitions that were supposed to help it compete with Google.</p><p>While AT&amp;T and Verizon have begun to roll out 5G service in some markets, T-Mobile and Sprint lack the complementary spectrum and capital to compete nationwide. So there's less impetus for AT&amp;T and Verizon to accelerate their 5G plans, improve efficiency or redirect misallocated capital from more glamorous media plays.</p><p>The Democratic AGs claim to be standing for competition, but in opposing the T-Mobile-Sprint merger they're entrenching the Big Two. It's worth recalling that competition from Sprint and MCI is what finally broke AT&amp;T's monopoly on long-distance service in the 1980s. Long-distance prices fell rapidly.</p><p>Sprint and T-Mobile have already committed to deploying a 5G network that would cover 97% of the U.S. population within three years including 85% of rural Americans. They have also agreed to maintain current prices for at least three years, which is three years longer than either Verizon or AT&amp;T. The AG warnings about price increases are false.</p><p>As ever, there's a union-Democratic Party merger here. The Communications Workers of America, who represent AT&amp;T and Verizon workers, oppose the tie between the nonunion Sprint and T-Mobile. The last thing they want is a stronger nonunion competitor. The union is a big financier of Democrats, and it endorsed the AGs in coordinated fashion on Tuesday.</p><p>All of this lobbying is aimed directly at persuading Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim to oppose the deal. Justice attorneys have been demanding divestitures with perhaps an eye to recreating a fourth wireless carrier. Cable companies that aim to launch plans with wireless carriers' spectrum - Altice already has a contract with Sprint - have criticized the deal for thwarting competition. But cable companies merely want to fortify their regional monopolies, especially in rural areas where a merged T-Mobile-Sprint could compete.</p><p>While the media obsess about Big Tech and antitrust, the T-Mobile-Sprint merger may be more consequential for America's future. More of the world economy is becoming digital every day, and 5G is essential to capturing the benefits of artificial intelligence and much more. The U.S. can't afford to fall behind by depending on a unionized duopoly. While Democratic AGs and unions may not care if 5G plods along, anyone who wants to preserve America's global competitiveness should.</p><p>Online:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url></p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The Minneapolis Star Tribune on U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar:</p><p>U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is back in the news again, and not in a good way. The former state representative who won a seat in Congress last fall continues to be dogged by past missteps, this time eight violations of Minnesota campaign-finance law that will cost her nearly $3,500 in reimbursements and civil penalties.</p><p>So complex were the allegations that the state Campaign Finance Board spent nearly a year assessing the case, deposing staff people and former staff people, along with Omar herself. The investigation was broadened in October - just a month before her election to Congress - to look more deeply into the allegations. Board Executive Director Jeff Sigurdson said that between six and eight people were deposed separately.</p><p>In an October 2018 editorial, we called on Omar to more fully explain her travel and other expenses. We noted that the allegations \"suggest a pattern of carelessness and/or self-dealing with legally restricted funds. Neither conclusion inspires the confidence voters deserve to have in someone they send to the U.S. House to represent them.\"</p><p>It is even more disturbing, therefore, to learn that among the board's latest findings was a troubling discovery that is far beyond its jurisdiction, but worthy of greater scrutiny nevertheless. Omar, for two years running, filed joint tax returns with a man she was living with but not legally married to. Complicating matters further, she was legally married to another man at the time.</p><p>It's against the law in Minnesota to file jointly unless one filer is legally married to the other. Last year Omar told the Star Tribune that she had married her partner \"in her faith,\" and had earlier divorced her first husband \"in her faith.\" That's fine for religious purposes. But for tax purposes, only civil marriages qualify. It's not known whether she benefited materially by filing jointly. That is something that voters, who are obliged to follow tax laws no matter how painful, are entitled to know.</p><p>It's not too much to expect that a lawmaker would check with a tax attorney on a rather complicated marital status before filing. And when questions arise, it's a violation to use campaign funds to clear up those personal issues, as Omar apparently did. The Campaign Finance Board has ordered that she reimburse her campaign $3,469 for violations related to her tax returns and non-campaign travel costs. She must also pay a $500 civil penalty.</p><p>Omar is no stranger to controversy. As a new state House member, she collected $2,500 in speaking fees - $2,000 from Normandale Community College and $500 from Inver Hills Community College - for appearances made shortly after she took office. Rep. Steve Drazkowski, R-Mazeppa, who publicly noted that state law prohibits legislators from collecting such fees from groups that have business before the Legislature, made that public, and Omar returned the money. Drazkowski also filed the latest complaint. \"It's very clear there are huge ethical problems with Rep. Omar,\" he told an editorial writer, adding that the House should consider an ethics investigation.</p><p>If this pattern continues, further investigation may be necessary. Omar could have avoided nearly every infraction by taking simple measures in advance to determine whether her actions would pass legal muster. In its findings, the board noted that Minnesota \"House Research staff did explain that generally when they discuss whether a member can accept something of value, for example, travel and lodging reimbursement ... they discuss whether that would violate the gift prohibition,\" but do not advise. \"Rather, they commonly refer members to the Board. The Omar committee did not contact Board staff ... on the appropriateness of using committee funds for the travel reviewed in this investigation.\"</p><p>Omar's political rise has been marred by a series of unforced errors, including intemperate remarks and tweets earlier this year that were widely perceived as anti-Semitic. Every month seems to bring a fresh problem.</p><p>As an elected representative for Minnesota and one of the first Muslim women and Somali refugees elected to Congress, Omar is helping to break new ground. But more is expected of her than the symbolism attached to her victory. Omar has a special obligation to be worthy of the trust so many have placed in her, including many still-new Americans who expect better.</p><p>Online:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.startribune.com\">http://www.startribune.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The Los Angeles Times on the rising number of horse deaths at Santa Anita Park:</p><p>On Saturday, a 4-year-old gelding named Formal Dude was euthanized after injuring itself during a race at Santa Anita Park. Formal Dude was the 28th horse to die from racing or training at the beleaguered track since December.</p><p>At that point, the California Horse Racing Board had had enough, and it took the extraordinary step of asking Santa Anita to suspend racing for the few days remaining in this season at the park.</p><p>But Santa Anita's owners refused, and on Sunday the racing continued. That's when a 3-year-old filly, Truffalino, collapsed and died just after the jockey pulled the horse out of a race. Truffalino became the 29th fatality of the season.</p><p>Frankly, we're appalled. There have now been numerous calls for the Stronach Group, which owns the Santa Anita track, to suspend racing - from animal welfare groups and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), among others. On May 29, this editorial board also called for a suspension.</p><p>All have urged the park to wait for the results from the official necropsies on these horses and an investigation into the mysterious spate of deaths that has bedeviled the Santa Anita track all year. It's reckless enough to keep racing before the park has all the information it needs. But it's disdainful and arrogant to do it in defiance of the state horse racing regulators.</p><p>It's time to give the racing board the authority to compel a suspension. State Senate Bill 469 would, among other things, allow the board to suspend a track's license to conduct horse racing when necessary to protect the health and safety of horses or riders. The bill should be approved. Furthermore, a congressional bill, HR 1754, the Horseracing Integrity Act, would establish some national oversight of a fragmented sport that is governed by different racing boards with different rules in every state. The congressional bill would ban race-day use of a common diuretic, Lasix, and establish a uniform medication control program to be developed and enforced by an independent authority.</p><p>There's no question that Santa Anita has instituted some ground-breaking reforms governing the administration of drugs to horses on the track, and setting new rules for trainers and jockeys. After a spike in deaths from late December through March, the park closed for several weeks and put in place some of the new rules. After that, the park went six weeks with no deaths.</p><p>Then another rash of deaths began. Not all were broken legs. A couple were pelvic injuries. Some were what horse experts call rare or freak occurrences - such as shoulder injuries. Yet, two horses at the park suffered life-ending shoulder injuries in the last few weeks, making them seem less freakish. In the last week alone, there have been three deaths. But in a statement Sunday, the Stronach Group and the Thoroughbred Owners of California and the California Thoroughbred Trainers noted the drop in catastrophic injuries and reiterated that the reforms were working. The statement said that \"the reality is that our improvements and changes have been effective.\"</p><p>Really? Then why have we seen multiple deaths in a few weeks' time? At this point, the park has six days of racing left in its season, which closes June 23. Then it returns in the fall for about a month and a half.</p><p>In calendar year 2018, according to statistics kept by the Jockey Club, Santa Anita's rate of deaths per 1,000 \"starts\" (a horse literally starting a race) was 2.04. That's substantially higher than last year's national average of 1.68. It's lower, though, than the alarming death rate of 2.73 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>Over time, Americans have to decide how much death they are willing to tolerate in this ancient sport. More immediately, though, the owners of the track at Santa Anita have to face up to the troubling, unexplained deaths that have occurred this past year. And they should not risk any more horses' lives for the rest of this season.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com\">http://www.latimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The London Evening Standard on the challenges facing candidates for Prime Minister of the United Kingdom:</p><p>\"Never again,\" said the Conservative world, after Theresa May walked into the Tory leadership underprepared and unscrutinised three years ago. Next time, everyone insisted, candidates for the premiership, and their plans for office, should be put under the microscope. And yet here we are, in the week of the first ballot for choosing the next prime minister, and the most probing question being asked on TV and radio of the contenders is: what drugs did you take when you were younger? The unsurprising answer, like many people of their generation, is that, yes, most of them tried illegal substances at some point.</p><p>It's almost 30 years since Bill Clinton admitted smoking marijuana, 25 since Barack Obama confessed to taking cocaine, and 15 since David Cameron said politicians were entitled to a private past. It's time to move on to the serious questions that face anyone who wants to be prime minister. Let's start with the biggest: who has a plan to unblock the impasse over Brexit? Threatening a no-deal departure is hollow, because there isn't a parliamentary majority for one and (thankfully) no realistic way to stop Parliament meeting to express that majority. Promising a renegotiation with the EU, and wishing away the Irish backstop, isn't something anyone in the rest of Europe believes is credible. Passing a version of the existing deal on the table was something Mrs May failed three times to achieve. Meanwhile none of the leading contenders dare raise the prospect of a referendum, let alone an election. If candidates pretend it is easy to achieve what the current administration has found impossible, then they should be challenged.</p><p>Perhaps they can drive Brussels into submission; perhaps an Irish border commission involving the Republic might find a way through; perhaps a new leader will be able to reassemble a Tory majority. We need to see the evidence. To those who say they can deliver Brexit by October 31, we simply ask: how? To those who say they would be prepared to delay beyond that, we ask: how will that help? The very least the public deserve is that those who want to enter Number 10 in a few weeks' time are grilled seriously on their Brexit plan. The same applies to the other policy pledges that are coming thick and fast.</p><p>New ideas needed</p><p>A leadership contest is a time for new ideas, and it's right that - as the saying goes - in democracies we campaign in poetry and govern in prose. So we're not asking for every detail of every policy. But some idea of how things will be paid for is necessary if the country is not to be further misled by those who govern it.</p><p>Raising the tax threshold at which people pay 40 per cent beyond \u00a350,000 is a solid Conservative idea that builds on what has already been achieved. Every modern society will want to invest in education but why have the Tories given up talking about the reform that means investment will be well spent? We want more housing but where are you going to build it? We'd all like to provide decent social care without raiding people's homes and savings but the answer has eluded numerous governments. Using the \"headroom\" in the public finances to fund all these commitments, as the candidates suggest, is code for \"we'll borrow more\". There's nothing intrinsically wrong with that, if you explain it means a bigger national debt than would otherwise exist, and then higher taxes and spending cuts in the future.</p><p>Nor can candidates hide behind their \"consciences\" on social issues. Reducing the abortion limit is not solely a matter of personal belief when you're a legislator whose beliefs could impose serious, health-threatening restrictions on millions of women. Let's hear how you can morally justify that. And where is the debate about the disruption coming from technology? How do we harness all the exciting possibilities of artificial intelligence, genomics and robotics while mitigating the potential harm?</p><p>We've heard precious little. What we've had instead is more a replay of the Tory best hits from circa 1990. Britain faces the greatest political crisis for a generation. The foundations of our economic prosperity and security are threatened. We face profound change in our society. It's time the questions to our leaders matched the seriousness of the task that lies ahead of them.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.standard.co.uk\">http://www.standard.co.uk</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 9</p><p>The New York Times on the congressional response to an increase of migrants at the southern border:</p><p>Last week, as American and Mexican officials haggled over how to address the migrant crisis at their countries' shared border, United States Customs and Border Protection released its monthly migration statistics. They tell an alarming story.</p><p>In May, 144,278 migrants were taken into custody. It was the third consecutive month in which apprehensions topped 100,000 and the highest one-month total in 13 years.</p><p>Unequipped to deal with the crush, border facilities and migrant shelters are dangerously overcrowded, and the staff is overburdened. Dysfunction, disease and even death are a growing reality.</p><p>\"We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger: The system is broken,\" the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.</p><p>Also last week, officials said that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency assigned to care for unaccompanied migrant children, would begin cutting services \"not directly necessary for the protection of life and safety.\" This includes English classes, legal aid and recreational programs.</p><p>Democrats and other administration critics called the move \"cruel\" and \"illegal,\" but the financial reality is that the agency is overwhelmed. So far this fiscal year, it has taken charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied children - a 57 percent increase over last year. The entire program could run out of funding by the end of June.</p><p>In short, it is time for Congress to stop dithering and pass emergency funding to deal with this nightmare.</p><p>It has been more than a month since the administration sent Congress a request for $4.5 billion in additional border assistance. A large portion of the money, $3.3 billion, was earmarked for humanitarian aid - which most lawmakers agree is sorely needed. But a relatively modest piece of the request aimed at shoring up border security operations, roughly a quarter of the total, has tied negotiators in knots.</p><p>Early on, Democrats were opposed to funding additional detention beds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Republicans had problems with Democrats' demands for changes in the administration's asylum policies. At one point, negotiators thought they were close to resolving these conflicts, only to have other issues snarl the process. Beyond the money for security, one of the remaining disagreements is how much data sharing will be allowed between the agencies responsible for caring for migrant children and those that handle border enforcement.</p><p>The broader problem is that many Democrats have come to view the Trump administration as untrustworthy, and they are loath to hand over one more penny for anything to do with immigration. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have been particularly adamant, insisting that their leadership take a hard line in negotiations. In part, they fear that the administration, despite its promises, will spend any additional funding on enforcement rather than humanitarian needs.</p><p>There is much to despise about this administration's immigration policies, which are exacerbating this crisis, but there should be no ambivalence about the urgency of addressing the humanitarian needs. While lawmakers wring their hands and drag their feet, tens of thousands of migrant children are suffering.</p><p>Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that suffering.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com\">http://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 7</p><p>The Boston Globe on CBD, the nonintoxicating, natural molecule extracted from the cannabis plant:</p><p>If you believe the hype, one little bottle of CBD contains miracles. It treats diabetes; reduces stress; alleviates chronic pain and anxiety; even cures acne. Trouble sleeping? Panicky pet? CBD to the rescue.</p><p>All that, and so much more - at a bargain price as low as $40 for some formulas. This potent potable also comes mixed into body lotions, bath salts, coffee, smoothies, gummy bears, chocolate, cheese pizza, and dog biscuits.</p><p>The fad for cannabidiol, or CBD, has clearly gone mainstream. From virtually nothing a few years ago, sales of the cannabis-related compound have exploded into a billion-dollar market. CBD's true believers tout one miraculous health claim after the next.</p><p>In light of the wide dissemination of these beliefs, CBD claims deserve careful scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration - and some attention from state regulators, too. Despite its ubiquity, CBD is still largely an unresearched substance in the United States. Exaggerated or unproven claims need to be challenged, and the industry shouldn't be permitted to introduce CBD into food products until the compound is better understood.</p><p>CBD is the nonintoxicating, natural molecule extracted from the cannabis plant. CBD is found in marijuana, of course, but it's also present in hemp, the related plant whose cultivation in the US was legalized by Congress in December.</p><p>Its proven medical uses are confined to a drug the FDA approved last summer to treat two rare forms of pediatric epilepsy. It's the first - and only - medicine derived from cannabis that has been green-lighted by the federal agency.</p><p>Because CBD is already sold as a drug, federal law technically bans its use in food and drink that crosses state lines. \"Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk, as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective,\" Scott Gottlieb, then the FDA commissioner, wrote in a statement when hemp production was legalized.</p><p>But enforcement is largely left to states, where it has been uneven. Earlier this year, New York City health officials banned bakeries and restaurants from selling food and beverages with CBD. Ohio and Maine have also moved proactively.</p><p>In Massachusetts, though, the sale of products containing hemp-derived CBD is still loosely regulated. For instance, the state has not addressed sales of food and drink made with CBD. But it has at least issued guidance for commercial growers and processors of industrial hemp. Among other things, the state Department of Agricultural Resources requires producers to label any product they make for human consumption that contains CBD with a warning stating the product is derived from industrial hemp, that it \"has not been analyzed or approved by the FDA,\" and that it \"has not been tested or approved by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources.\"</p><p>Now, maybe adding CBD to food is safe. And maybe it really can deliver medicinal benefits. But sorting through the safety and efficacy claims requires a more muscular FDA role. Last month, the FDA held a much-awaited hearing on how to regulate CBD consumer products and got an earful on the need for a science-based approach to regulation. \"Currently, states are struggling with the lack of sound scientific research available in CBD and long-term health impacts, including those to children,\" said a Virginia state official. Most medical experts agreed that CBD holds potential medicinal properties, but more clinical trials are needed before allowing the hemp extract to be added to food and drink.</p><p>The hazy legal status of hemp-derived CBD until December, coupled with lack of funding, deterred studies in the past. Now researchers need to determine how different doses affect consumers; how CBD affects children; how it interacts with medical conditions and medications; how it affects pregnant women; whether long-term use carries risks; and if the purported benefits are scientifically verifiable.</p><p>None of which is to say that CBD itself should be banned. Coke is still available, after all; the company just no longer claims that the beverage cures headaches and upset stomach. ...</p><p>Online:</p><p><url

Now that he has announced his retirement from Congress, we urge him to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ryan must be clear: Any attempt by the president to quash the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller is an attack on the rule of law. The House Speaker should throw his support behind legislation to protect Mueller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ryan will leave behind a legacy of honest, thoughtful conservatism - he fought for what he thought was best for his constituents and the country, based on a vision of smaller, less intrusive government and personal freedom. His rise to power in Washington over the past two decades put Wisconsin at the center of some of our most important political debates.</p><p>But Ryan's decision to leave Congress, while a blow to Wisconsin's political might, could be good for our democracy if Ryan finds his voice.</p><p>The Speaker has consistently defended Mueller. He repeated Wednesday what he has said before, that he doesn't believe <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>will fire Mueller before the investigation is complete.</p><p>But after an early morning raid on the offices of Trump's personal attorney on Monday, the president erupted in anger. He called it an \"attack on the country,\" saying Mueller's investigators were \"the most biased group of people\" and that \"Many people have said, 'You should fire him.'\"</p><p>Maybe this is just Trump venting. With Trump, a New York real estate tycoon who has associated with fixers and con men his entire adult life, you never know. But with the law closing in, a president already given to rash judgment may act rashly.</p><p>If Trump moves to fire Mueller or his boss at the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, Ryan and his colleagues in Congress must be ready to act.</p><p>And not just with words. They should throw their support behind a bill that would protect the special counsel. Two bills under consideration would give a panel of federal judges the power to review any dismissal of the special counsel and decide whether there was \"good cause\" to fire him.</p><p>During the Watergate crisis, it was Republican leaders in the legislative and judicial branches who stood strong in defense of democracy and the fundamental principle that no person is above the law and certainly not an elected public servant of the people, which is what the president of the United States remains.</p><p>Republican Senator Howard Baker was the one who asked, \"What did the President know and when did he know it?\"</p><p>Republican Judge John Sirica, an Eisenhower appointee, ordered President Nixon to turn over his tapes of White House conversations, which revealed his crimes and ended his presidency.</p><p>It is time now for Republicans to stand up again to defend an investigation of an administration, especially as we've learned more and more about Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Speaker Ryan, if anything is done to interfere with or stop the Mueller investigation before it concludes, you should do everything your power to retain all findings, all records and all investigators through the Legislative Branch.</p><p>Our nation's founders set up three separate branches for exactly this purpose - to help us keep democracy alive. It becomes especially important when one party controls all three branches, as Republicans do today, that our representatives in Congress stand strong to ensure the citizens of our democracy remain in charge.</p><p>We live in a dangerous world, one that requires steady American leadership. A constitutional crisis, prompted by a president eager to cover his tracks, would be like nothing we have seen since Watergate and would severely weaken the nation both at home and abroad.</p><p>Republican leaders in the other two branches stood up in defense of democracy in the 1970s.</p><p>Your time is now, <person><nameText>Paul Ryan.</nameText></person></p><p>Stand strong.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jsonline.com\">https://www.jsonline.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 9</p><p>The New York Times on Syria:</p><p>A world grown numb to the slaughter of civilians in Syria has been roused in the last 48 hours by photographs on social media of lifeless men, women and children in the rebel-held town of Douma, many with white foam coming from their mouths and nostrils, victims of chemical weapons. Outraged Western nations blame President Bashar al-Assad's regime and demand retaliation.</p><p>Russia and Iran, Mr. Assad's callous enablers, have denied that he has once again used these horrific weapons on his own people. But Douma is surrounded by Syrian forces, whom experts have blamed for most of the 85 chemical attacks in the country over the past five years. Syria had a major chemical weapons program before pledging to surrender it after chemical attacks in 2013, a commitment it failed to fully honor.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>took limited military action against Syria after a chemical weapons attack last year, largely ignored the issue after that and then last week surprised his military commanders by announcing plans to soon withdraw 2,000 troops in the fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump vowed on Sunday on Twitter that there would be a \"big price to pay\" for the latest killings, estimated at up to 70 people dead, according to aid groups.</p><p>But the president should know by now that tough talk without a coherent strategy or follow-through is dangerous.</p><p>What to do next in Syria is a crucial test for Mr. Trump, who has shirked America's traditional leadership role. He has tried to seem like a macho leader who would aggressively use American power where President <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>wouldn't, while talking about pulling out of the Middle East and walking away from international commitments.</p><p>With such inconstancy, he will not be able to stop the violence in Syria, and with no clear, unified plan with the Western allies, he will only empower Mr. Assad.</p><p>Mr. Trump needs to work with the other major powers on a broad plan that could force Mr. Assad, Russia and Iran to end the carnage and be held accountable. The United Nations Security Council needs to recommit to the Chemical Weapons Convention's ban on such weapons, authorize experts to verify who was responsible in Douma and create an independent investigation that could lead to prosecution in a tribunal like the International Criminal Court.</p><p>If the Syrian regime's guilt is determined, the United States should impose tough new sanctions, like a freeze on financial assets, as well. If military action is considered, Congress - which has long avoided its constitutional war-making responsibilities - needs to approve it. If a Russian veto prevents Security Council action, then Mr. Trump needs to work with our allies, through NATO or otherwise.</p><p>The timing isn't great - Mr. Trump's newly appointed national security adviser, John Bolton, only showed up for his first day at the White House on Monday, and his secretary of state nominee, <person><nameText>Mike Pompeo, </nameText></person>hasn't been confirmed - but this work is too important to wait. The use of poison gas, a war crime under international law, has been integral to Mr. Assad's scorched-earth drive to regain control of the last rebel-held areas. As Mr. Trump said on Monday, \"We cannot allow atrocities like that.\"</p><p>Just to reiterate: To have any chance of success, any international retaliatory action must be part of a coherent diplomatic strategy for stabilizing Syria and putting a political settlement in place. Since 2011, more than 500,000 Syrians have been killed and millions of refugees have fled to neighboring countries and Europe. The conflict has allowed Russia, Iran, Turkey and the Islamic State, now degraded by an American-led coalition, to gain a foothold in Syria.</p><p>During a Security Council briefing on Monday, Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador, lamented that chemical weapons were becoming \"normalized\" and argued \"Russia could stop this senseless slaughter\" in Syria if it chose to.</p><p>\"Only a monster targets civilians and then ensures that there are no ambulances to transfer the wounded. No hospitals to save their lives,\" she said. \"No doctors or medicine to ease their pain.\"</p><p>Ms. Haley called for the appointment of an expert group to investigate the attack, demanded humanitarian access to Douma and warned that if Russia continued to block Security Council action, \"the United States will respond.\"</p><p>After each new atrocity, Mr. Trump and others tend to blame Mr. Obama, because Mr. Obama \"did nothing\" to enforce his red line against chemical weapons after an attack near Damascus in August 2013.</p><p>Mr. Obama forswore military action after that attack in favor of working with Russia to get Syria to destroy its chemical weapons. The resulting agreement deprived Mr. Assad of much of his arsenal, though not all, despite Moscow's promises.</p><p>In those days, Mr. Trump wasn't a fan of military action, either, warning Mr. Obama against it. Once president, though, he made a different choice and, operating under dubious legal authority, sent cruise missiles to strike a Syrian airfield last year after the attack on Khan Sheikhoun.</p><p>But lacking a plan to keep up the pressure, his one-off military operation failed to deter Mr. Assad from using chemical weapons; there have been at least seven other attacks this year. Now, the military option is back on the table.</p><p>Mr. Assad, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Iran's leaders came to believe that they could do what they wanted in Syria; Mr. Trump reinforced that when he called for the early withdrawal of the 2,000 troops there.</p><p>He further reinforced a sense of impunity every time he exempted Mr. Putin from direct criticism for Russia's reprehensible behavior. So it was significant that Mr. Trump finally drew a line, saying in a tweet, \"President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad.\"</p><p>The question is what comes next.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 6</p><p>The Denver Post on a hedge fund's management of the newspaper and other media properties:</p><p>At The Denver Post on Monday, more than two dozen reporters, editors, photographers, videographers, page designers, digital producers and opinion staff will walk out the door. Our marching orders are to cut a full 30 by the start of July.</p><p>These heartbreaking instructions raise the question: Does this cut, which follows so many in recent years that our ranks have shriveled from more than 250 to fewer than 100 today, represent the beginning of the end for the Voice of the Rocky Mountain Empire?</p><p>The cuts, backed by our owner, the New York City hedge fund Alden Global Capital, also are a mystery, if you look at them from the point of view of those of us intent on running a serious news operation befitting the city that bears our name. Media experts locally and nationally question why our future looks so bleak, as many newspapers still enjoy double-digit profits and our management reported solid profits as recently as last year.</p><p>We call for action. Consider this editorial and this Sunday's Perspective offerings a plea to Alden - owner of Digital First Media, one of the largest newspaper chains in the country - to rethink its business strategy across all its newspaper holdings. Consider this also a signal to our community and civic leaders that they ought to demand better. Denver deserves a newspaper owner who supports its newsroom. If Alden isn't willing to do good journalism here, it should sell The Post to owners who will.</p><p>A flagship local newspaper like The Post plays a critically important role in its city and state: It provides a public record of the good and the bad, serves as a watchdog against public and private corruption, offers a free marketplace of ideas and stands as a lighthouse reflective and protective of - and accountable to - a community's values and goals. A news organization like ours ought to be seen, especially by our owner, as a necessary public institution vital to the very maintenance of our grand democratic experiment.</p><p>Yes, for years now, large media chains have struggled to responsibly downsize newsrooms. But some have done so less responsibly than others.</p><p>Here in Colorado, Alden has embarked on a cynical strategy of constantly reducing the amount and quality of its offerings, while steadily increasing its subscription rates. In doing so, the hedge fund managers - often tellingly referred to as \"vulture capitalists\" - have hidden behind a narrative that adequately staffed newsrooms and newspapers can no longer survive in the digital marketplace. Try to square that with a recent lawsuit filed by one of Digital First Media's minority shareholders that claims Alden has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars of its newspaper profits into shaky investments completely unrelated to the business of gathering news.</p><p>Coloradans feel the insanity of it in their bones. And what a sad history.</p><p>In 2009, the large chain that owned the Rocky Mountain News closed that storied paper's doors. In 2010, Alden bought the chain of papers that features The Denver Post. The hedge fund gained a talented team of journalists reporting from all over the state, the nation and some of the biggest hotspots in the world, a winner of numerous Pulitzer Prizes, including newsroom-wide awards for its coverage of the massacres at Columbine and, more recently, a theater in Aurora.</p><p>Since Alden took control, the decline of local news has been as obvious as it's been precipitous. The editor who oversaw coverage of the Aurora theater shooting, Gregory L. Moore, decamped in 2016, unable to endure the new fund's directives any longer.</p><p>This year began with The Post recovering from more bloodshed as it packed up to leave its namesake city, its journalists clinging to the hope that a newly launched initiative to charge for online content would improve its fortunes. Before journalists were even in their new headquarters, our publisher and former editorial board member, Mac Tully, resigned.</p><p>Still more reductions came, and they did so as fast and as chilling as a high-desert storm.</p><p>The cuts come despite constant adaptation and innovation within our organization that grew our online reach exponentially.</p><p>This in a city that has seen more than 100,000 newcomers since Alden took control, and in a country where other cities Denver's size and smaller enjoy larger newsrooms and papers. (The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's newsroom, for example, has upwards of 170 managers and staff.)</p><p>This in a state and region thrumming with energy and enthusiasm for its future.</p><p>This in a market filled with hyper-educated citizens ready and able to afford great journalism should it be offered them.</p><p>The inevitable result is that the reduction in quality leads to a reduction of trust. So when errant politicians and public figures push back against even the most credible of reports, they find a fertile environment for doubt.</p><p>Yes, other media chains and operations haven't been spared the same market realities Alden faces. The transition from print to digital publication is a challenging one.</p><p>Another factor: Critics on both sides of America's ever-widening political divide heap blame for the loss of readership on claims - too many of them credible - that newsrooms have lost sight of their responsibility to be truly objective. Such criticisms help fuel spectacularly successful social media companies, which also reap profits from links to traditional newsroom offerings.</p><p>Another regrettable result of the fracturing of newsrooms has been the rush by political interests to lavish investments in echo-chamber outlets that merely seek to report from biased perspectives, leaving the hollowed-out shells of newsrooms loyal to traditional journalistic values to find their voice in the maelstrom.</p><p>Still we take the moment to acknowledge fundamental truths. When newsroom owners view profits as the only goal, quality, reliability and accountability suffer. Their very mission is compromised. The course correction that needs to come for the benefit of communities across the land depends on owners committed to serving their readers and viewers and users.</p><p>We get it that things change. We get it that our feelings are raw and no doubt color our judgment. But we've been quiet too long.</p><p>We believe without question that if community leaders and our readers care about our mission, and what our newsroom ought to be instead of this shadow of what it once was, it's time for their voices to be heard.</p><p>The smart money is that in a few years The Denver Post will be rotting bones. And a major city in an important political region will find itself without a newspaper.</p><p>It's time for those Coloradans who care most about their civic future to get involved and see to it that Denver gets the newsroom it deserves.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.denverpost.com\">https://www.denverpost.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 6</p><p>The Tennessean calls for the release of journalist Manuel Duran, who was detained while covering Memphis protests and now faces deportation:</p><p>Journalist Manuel Duran was arrested for doing his job: For exercising his First Amendment rights.</p><p>He now he faces deportation from the United States.</p><p>The 42-year-old Salvadoran immigrant was live-streaming demonstrators in Memphis protesting immigration detention and enforcement policies on Tuesday when he was wrongfully detained.</p><p>Duran's status as an undocumented immigrant complicated his release from Shelby County jail, but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges.</p><p>Unfortunately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were waiting in court to seize him.</p><p>He will likely be booted out of what has become his home unless ICE releases him. The federal agency should free him because Duran should never have been arrested.</p><p>It is a difficult case, exposing a broken immigration system that makes it hard for undocumented residents who want to contribute to their communities but cannot earn their legal status.</p><p>There are 11 million people in this nation who are living in the shadows because of their legal status.</p><p>Not Duran. He has been a voice for his community and has documented the good and the bad.</p><p>He started in Memphis in 2008 on La Voz 1240 radio, where he was co-anchor of a morning radio show and a newscaster on \"Minuto 60.\"</p><p>He was news director and co-anchor at Ambiente 1030 radio station until 2017. Now, he owns Memphis Noticias, a local news source for the Latino community.</p><p>He has interviewed local officials such as Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell.</p><p>He also has been at risk for deportation for some time.</p><p>An ICE spokesman said an immigration judge ordered Duran be deported in 2007 for failing to make a scheduled court date. That was 11 years ago, during the George W. Bush presidency.</p><p>The Trump Administration has begun a purge of undocumented men, women and children - some who have lived peacefully for decades in America. That includes Thursday's raid of a meatpacking plant in Grainger County, where ICE held 86 people to check their immigration status. Of those, 54 were detained for further immigration proceedings.</p><p>They have worked at jobs - not stolen them - and they have also paid taxes without receiving benefits like Medicare or Social Security.</p><p>There should be a solution to fix the system and allow immigrants like Duran a path to experience and enjoy the American Dream and contribute to the nation's success.</p><p>Congress has failed numerous times over the years to do so. This year, shamefully, Congress abandoned an effort to provide a permanent solution to recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>ended. Without a solution, 800,000 people - including 9,300 Tennesseans - who are working or going to school will be at risk of being deported.</p><p>Regarding Duran, the Constitution does not distinguish between citizens and non-citizens when it comes to exercising First Amendment freedoms.</p><p>He was exercising the right of freedom of the press to hold government accountable, and he was wrongfully punished for it.</p><p>Journalists like Duran should not be arrested for doing their jobs. ICE should free him so he can continue fearlessly reporting on his community.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tennessean.com\">https://www.tennessean.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 11</p><p>The Orange County Register on the DACA impasse:</p><p>While <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>blames the failure of any emergent DACA fix on the Democrats, a closer look reveals a more complicated situation.</p><p>Last September, Trump issued an executive order giving Congress six months to come up with a permanent, legislative solution to the situation of the up to 2 million young people who qualified for deferred deportations under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p><p>Trump's reasoning for this was sound. The program, which shielded young people who entered the country illegally before the age of 16 and have lived in the U.S. continuously since June 15, 2007, among other qualifications, offered only temporary protections and was created by highly questionable executive fiat.</p><p>A March 5 deadline for the expiration of DACA as a result of Trump's rescission of Obama's order has since been rendered moot as a result of legal challenges by defenders of the program, and at least in theory gives Congress more time to actually come up with a fix.</p><p>Unfortunately, efforts to legislatively resolve the issue have consistently fallen short, despite widespread bipartisan agreement that it makes little sense for the United States to deport millions of young people raised, educated and integrated in the United States.</p><p>\"They really let them down,\" Trump said April 2. \"They had this great opportunity. The Democrats have really let them down. It's a shame. And now people are taking advantage of DACA and that's a shame.\"</p><p>To his credit, there seems to be a kernel of truth in Trump's version of events. Congressional Democrats have repeatedly threatened to hold up government spending bills if a DACA fix wasn't included, yet they've inevitably and even predictably folded every time.</p><p>Senate Democrats also didn't vote for the White House's preferred DACA fix in February.</p><p>The bill, backed by <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, offered a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million young people brought to the United States illegally as minors. In exchange, the bill called for an end to the diversity visa lottery program and restrictions on so-called chain migration.</p><p>However, a lot of Republicans didn't vote for that bill either. The bill only mustered 39 votes in support with 60 opposed.</p><p>Trump's insistence on an unpopular border wall and adding unrelated legal immigration restrictions into the discussion have done far more to prevent a DACA fix than an unwillingness on the part of congressional Democrats to compromise. We know this because Democrats did join Republicans in voting for two compromise bills to trade a DACA fix in exchange for additional border security measures.</p><p>The proposal that got closest - a plan put forward by the Common Sense Caucus to provide $25 billion in border security funding and prevent DACA recipients from sponsoring their parents for legal status - received the support of most Democrats and eight Republicans, in total receiving 54 votes in favor, 45 against.</p><p>For Trump to put the blame on the Democrats for the failure of a DACA fix might be red meat for his staunchest supporters to cover for his failure to get anything meaningful done on immigration, but it's an incomplete narrative at best.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ocregister.com\">https://www.ocregister.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 11</p><p>The Evening Standard (London) on tech and politics:</p><p>Big tech met big politics yesterday - and came off best.</p><p>Swapping his usual grey T-shirt for a sober suit and tidy blue tie, Facebook's chief executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>spent five hours giving evidence to the US Congress about the data scandal that has hit his business.</p><p>Even for a billionaire it was an intimidating event. But as he spoke, his company's share price climbed and that more than anything else revealed the final score.</p><p>Senators tried to put him under pressure. Some of their questions were good ones; others were not.</p><p>It would be easy to mock the senator who asked how Facebook made money - apparently unaware of its vast revenues from advertising and data.</p><p>But mockery would be the wrong response.</p><p>Governments, courts and parliaments all over the world are struggling to respond to the vast and rapid changes to politics, society and economics being brought by businesses such as Facebook.</p><p>Would British MPs have asked better questions than the senators? No.</p><p>Do they have the knowledge and the tools to respond to the power of social media? No.</p><p>Do our regulators or our courts? No.</p><p>Digital technology is no longer just one industry among many others: it is a fundamental dynamic in almost every part of modern life and its power is only going to become greater.</p><p>The established ways of business, politics and Government can no longer deal with this adequately - as everything from the influence of fake social media in the US presidential election to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, to the epidemic of gang violence on London's streets shows.</p><p>So the big question we should all be asking is: what needs to change? And how do we make it happen?</p><p>The wrong response would be to fear technology or to try to contain its impact.</p><p>It is improving lives fundamentally but our governments, parliaments and courts need to make a systematic attempt to understand its consequences so they can better regulate it, support it and improve it.</p><p>As Congress has just found out, ignorance isn't bliss.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk\">https://www.standard.co.uk</url>/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-ff589014f09a47fda135a78a4125f15a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S34-2801-JC65-52K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4246\"/><timeReceived>6:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>US IMMIGRATION &amp; CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.organization\"><classificationItem><className>U.S. Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S. Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Syria government</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Nikki Haley, GOVERNMENT_FIGURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Howard Baker, GOVERNMENT_FIGURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George W.

Now that he has announced his retirement from Congress, we urge him to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ryan must be clear: Any attempt by the president to quash the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller is an attack on the rule of law. The House Speaker should throw his support behind legislation to protect Mueller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ryan will leave behind a legacy of honest, thoughtful conservatism - he fought for what he thought was best for his constituents and the country, based on a vision of smaller, less intrusive government and personal freedom. His rise to power in Washington over the past two decades put Wisconsin at the center of some of our most important political debates.</p><p>But Ryan's decision to leave Congress, while a blow to Wisconsin's political might, could be good for our democracy if Ryan finds his voice.</p><p>The Speaker has consistently defended Mueller. He repeated Wednesday what he has said before, that he doesn't believe <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>will fire Mueller before the investigation is complete.</p><p>But after an early morning raid on the offices of Trump's personal attorney on Monday, the president erupted in anger. He called it an \"attack on the country,\" saying Mueller's investigators were \"the most biased group of people\" and that \"Many people have said, 'You should fire him.'\"</p><p>Maybe this is just Trump venting. With Trump, a New York real estate tycoon who has associated with fixers and con men his entire adult life, you never know. But with the law closing in, a president already given to rash judgment may act rashly.</p><p>If Trump moves to fire Mueller or his boss at the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, Ryan and his colleagues in Congress must be ready to act.</p><p>And not just with words. They should throw their support behind a bill that would protect the special counsel. Two bills under consideration would give a panel of federal judges the power to review any dismissal of the special counsel and decide whether there was \"good cause\" to fire him.</p><p>During the Watergate crisis, it was Republican leaders in the legislative and judicial branches who stood strong in defense of democracy and the fundamental principle that no person is above the law and certainly not an elected public servant of the people, which is what the president of the United States remains.</p><p>Republican Senator Howard Baker was the one who asked, \"What did the President know and when did he know it?\"</p><p>Republican Judge John Sirica, an Eisenhower appointee, ordered President Nixon to turn over his tapes of White House conversations, which revealed his crimes and ended his presidency.</p><p>It is time now for Republicans to stand up again to defend an investigation of an administration, especially as we've learned more and more about Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Speaker Ryan, if anything is done to interfere with or stop the Mueller investigation before it concludes, you should do everything your power to retain all findings, all records and all investigators through the Legislative Branch.</p><p>Our nation's founders set up three separate branches for exactly this purpose - to help us keep democracy alive. It becomes especially important when one party controls all three branches, as Republicans do today, that our representatives in Congress stand strong to ensure the citizens of our democracy remain in charge.</p><p>We live in a dangerous world, one that requires steady American leadership. A constitutional crisis, prompted by a president eager to cover his tracks, would be like nothing we have seen since Watergate and would severely weaken the nation both at home and abroad.</p><p>Republican leaders in the other two branches stood up in defense of democracy in the 1970s.</p><p>Your time is now, <person><nameText>Paul Ryan.</nameText></person></p><p>Stand strong.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jsonline.com\">https://www.jsonline.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 9</p><p>The New York Times on Syria:</p><p>A world grown numb to the slaughter of civilians in Syria has been roused in the last 48 hours by photographs on social media of lifeless men, women and children in the rebel-held town of Douma, many with white foam coming from their mouths and nostrils, victims of chemical weapons. Outraged Western nations blame President Bashar al-Assad's regime and demand retaliation.</p><p>Russia and Iran, Mr. Assad's callous enablers, have denied that he has once again used these horrific weapons on his own people. But Douma is surrounded by Syrian forces, whom experts have blamed for most of the 85 chemical attacks in the country over the past five years. Syria had a major chemical weapons program before pledging to surrender it after chemical attacks in 2013, a commitment it failed to fully honor.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>took limited military action against Syria after a chemical weapons attack last year, largely ignored the issue after that and then last week surprised his military commanders by announcing plans to soon withdraw 2,000 troops in the fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump vowed on Sunday on Twitter that there would be a \"big price to pay\" for the latest killings, estimated at up to 70 people dead, according to aid groups.</p><p>But the president should know by now that tough talk without a coherent strategy or follow-through is dangerous.</p><p>What to do next in Syria is a crucial test for Mr. Trump, who has shirked America's traditional leadership role. He has tried to seem like a macho leader who would aggressively use American power where President <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>wouldn't, while talking about pulling out of the Middle East and walking away from international commitments.</p><p>With such inconstancy, he will not be able to stop the violence in Syria, and with no clear, unified plan with the Western allies, he will only empower Mr. Assad.</p><p>Mr. Trump needs to work with the other major powers on a broad plan that could force Mr. Assad, Russia and Iran to end the carnage and be held accountable. The United Nations Security Council needs to recommit to the Chemical Weapons Convention's ban on such weapons, authorize experts to verify who was responsible in Douma and create an independent investigation that could lead to prosecution in a tribunal like the International Criminal Court.</p><p>If the Syrian regime's guilt is determined, the United States should impose tough new sanctions, like a freeze on financial assets, as well. If military action is considered, Congress - which has long avoided its constitutional war-making responsibilities - needs to approve it. If a Russian veto prevents Security Council action, then Mr. Trump needs to work with our allies, through NATO or otherwise.</p><p>The timing isn't great - Mr. Trump's newly appointed national security adviser, John Bolton, only showed up for his first day at the White House on Monday, and his secretary of state nominee, <person><nameText>Mike Pompeo, </nameText></person>hasn't been confirmed - but this work is too important to wait. The use of poison gas, a war crime under international law, has been integral to Mr. Assad's scorched-earth drive to regain control of the last rebel-held areas. As Mr. Trump said on Monday, \"We cannot allow atrocities like that.\"</p><p>Just to reiterate: To have any chance of success, any international retaliatory action must be part of a coherent diplomatic strategy for stabilizing Syria and putting a political settlement in place. Since 2011, more than 500,000 Syrians have been killed and millions of refugees have fled to neighboring countries and Europe. The conflict has allowed Russia, Iran, Turkey and the Islamic State, now degraded by an American-led coalition, to gain a foothold in Syria.</p><p>During a Security Council briefing on Monday, Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador, lamented that chemical weapons were becoming \"normalized\" and argued \"Russia could stop this senseless slaughter\" in Syria if it chose to.</p><p>\"Only a monster targets civilians and then ensures that there are no ambulances to transfer the wounded. No hospitals to save their lives,\" she said. \"No doctors or medicine to ease their pain.\"</p><p>Ms. Haley called for the appointment of an expert group to investigate the attack, demanded humanitarian access to Douma and warned that if Russia continued to block Security Council action, \"the United States will respond.\"</p><p>After each new atrocity, Mr. Trump and others tend to blame Mr. Obama, because Mr. Obama \"did nothing\" to enforce his red line against chemical weapons after an attack near Damascus in August 2013.</p><p>Mr. Obama forswore military action after that attack in favor of working with Russia to get Syria to destroy its chemical weapons. The resulting agreement deprived Mr. Assad of much of his arsenal, though not all, despite Moscow's promises.</p><p>In those days, Mr. Trump wasn't a fan of military action, either, warning Mr. Obama against it. Once president, though, he made a different choice and, operating under dubious legal authority, sent cruise missiles to strike a Syrian airfield last year after the attack on Khan Sheikhoun.</p><p>But lacking a plan to keep up the pressure, his one-off military operation failed to deter Mr. Assad from using chemical weapons; there have been at least seven other attacks this year. Now, the military option is back on the table.</p><p>Mr. Assad, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Iran's leaders came to believe that they could do what they wanted in Syria; Mr. Trump reinforced that when he called for the early withdrawal of the 2,000 troops there.</p><p>He further reinforced a sense of impunity every time he exempted Mr. Putin from direct criticism for Russia's reprehensible behavior. So it was significant that Mr. Trump finally drew a line, saying in a tweet, \"President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad.\"</p><p>The question is what comes next.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 6</p><p>The Denver Post on a hedge fund's management of the newspaper and other media properties:</p><p>At The Denver Post on Monday, more than two dozen reporters, editors, photographers, videographers, page designers, digital producers and opinion staff will walk out the door. Our marching orders are to cut a full 30 by the start of July.</p><p>These heartbreaking instructions raise the question: Does this cut, which follows so many in recent years that our ranks have shriveled from more than 250 to fewer than 100 today, represent the beginning of the end for the Voice of the Rocky Mountain Empire?</p><p>The cuts, backed by our owner, the New York City hedge fund Alden Global Capital, also are a mystery, if you look at them from the point of view of those of us intent on running a serious news operation befitting the city that bears our name. Media experts locally and nationally question why our future looks so bleak, as many newspapers still enjoy double-digit profits and our management reported solid profits as recently as last year.</p><p>We call for action. Consider this editorial and this Sunday's Perspective offerings a plea to Alden - owner of Digital First Media, one of the largest newspaper chains in the country - to rethink its business strategy across all its newspaper holdings. Consider this also a signal to our community and civic leaders that they ought to demand better. Denver deserves a newspaper owner who supports its newsroom. If Alden isn't willing to do good journalism here, it should sell The Post to owners who will.</p><p>A flagship local newspaper like The Post plays a critically important role in its city and state: It provides a public record of the good and the bad, serves as a watchdog against public and private corruption, offers a free marketplace of ideas and stands as a lighthouse reflective and protective of - and accountable to - a community's values and goals. A news organization like ours ought to be seen, especially by our owner, as a necessary public institution vital to the very maintenance of our grand democratic experiment.</p><p>Yes, for years now, large media chains have struggled to responsibly downsize newsrooms. But some have done so less responsibly than others.</p><p>Here in Colorado, Alden has embarked on a cynical strategy of constantly reducing the amount and quality of its offerings, while steadily increasing its subscription rates. In doing so, the hedge fund managers - often tellingly referred to as \"vulture capitalists\" - have hidden behind a narrative that adequately staffed newsrooms and newspapers can no longer survive in the digital marketplace. Try to square that with a recent lawsuit filed by one of Digital First Media's minority shareholders that claims Alden has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars of its newspaper profits into shaky investments completely unrelated to the business of gathering news.</p><p>Coloradans feel the insanity of it in their bones. And what a sad history.</p><p>In 2009, the large chain that owned the Rocky Mountain News closed that storied paper's doors. In 2010, Alden bought the chain of papers that features The Denver Post. The hedge fund gained a talented team of journalists reporting from all over the state, the nation and some of the biggest hotspots in the world, a winner of numerous Pulitzer Prizes, including newsroom-wide awards for its coverage of the massacres at Columbine and, more recently, a theater in Aurora.</p><p>Since Alden took control, the decline of local news has been as obvious as it's been precipitous. The editor who oversaw coverage of the Aurora theater shooting, Gregory L. Moore, decamped in 2016, unable to endure the new fund's directives any longer.</p><p>This year began with The Post recovering from more bloodshed as it packed up to leave its namesake city, its journalists clinging to the hope that a newly launched initiative to charge for online content would improve its fortunes. Before journalists were even in their new headquarters, our publisher and former editorial board member, Mac Tully, resigned.</p><p>Still more reductions came, and they did so as fast and as chilling as a high-desert storm.</p><p>The cuts come despite constant adaptation and innovation within our organization that grew our online reach exponentially.</p><p>This in a city that has seen more than 100,000 newcomers since Alden took control, and in a country where other cities Denver's size and smaller enjoy larger newsrooms and papers. (The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's newsroom, for example, has upwards of 170 managers and staff.)</p><p>This in a state and region thrumming with energy and enthusiasm for its future.</p><p>This in a market filled with hyper-educated citizens ready and able to afford great journalism should it be offered them.</p><p>The inevitable result is that the reduction in quality leads to a reduction of trust. So when errant politicians and public figures push back against even the most credible of reports, they find a fertile environment for doubt.</p><p>Yes, other media chains and operations haven't been spared the same market realities Alden faces. The transition from print to digital publication is a challenging one.</p><p>Another factor: Critics on both sides of America's ever-widening political divide heap blame for the loss of readership on claims - too many of them credible - that newsrooms have lost sight of their responsibility to be truly objective. Such criticisms help fuel spectacularly successful social media companies, which also reap profits from links to traditional newsroom offerings.</p><p>Another regrettable result of the fracturing of newsrooms has been the rush by political interests to lavish investments in echo-chamber outlets that merely seek to report from biased perspectives, leaving the hollowed-out shells of newsrooms loyal to traditional journalistic values to find their voice in the maelstrom.</p><p>Still we take the moment to acknowledge fundamental truths. When newsroom owners view profits as the only goal, quality, reliability and accountability suffer. Their very mission is compromised. The course correction that needs to come for the benefit of communities across the land depends on owners committed to serving their readers and viewers and users.</p><p>We get it that things change. We get it that our feelings are raw and no doubt color our judgment. But we've been quiet too long.</p><p>We believe without question that if community leaders and our readers care about our mission, and what our newsroom ought to be instead of this shadow of what it once was, it's time for their voices to be heard.</p><p>The smart money is that in a few years The Denver Post will be rotting bones. And a major city in an important political region will find itself without a newspaper.</p><p>It's time for those Coloradans who care most about their civic future to get involved and see to it that Denver gets the newsroom it deserves.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.denverpost.com\">https://www.denverpost.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 6</p><p>The Tennessean calls for the release of journalist Manuel Duran, who was detained while covering Memphis protests and now faces deportation:</p><p>Journalist Manuel Duran was arrested for doing his job: For exercising his First Amendment rights.</p><p>He now he faces deportation from the United States.</p><p>The 42-year-old Salvadoran immigrant was live-streaming demonstrators in Memphis protesting immigration detention and enforcement policies on Tuesday when he was wrongfully detained.</p><p>Duran's status as an undocumented immigrant complicated his release from Shelby County jail, but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges.</p><p>Unfortunately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were waiting in court to seize him.</p><p>He will likely be booted out of what has become his home unless ICE releases him. The federal agency should free him because Duran should never have been arrested.</p><p>It is a difficult case, exposing a broken immigration system that makes it hard for undocumented residents who want to contribute to their communities but cannot earn their legal status.</p><p>There are 11 million people in this nation who are living in the shadows because of their legal status.</p><p>Not Duran. He has been a voice for his community and has documented the good and the bad.</p><p>He started in Memphis in 2008 on La Voz 1240 radio, where he was co-anchor of a morning radio show and a newscaster on \"Minuto 60.\"</p><p>He was news director and co-anchor at Ambiente 1030 radio station until 2017. Now, he owns Memphis Noticias, a local news source for the Latino community.</p><p>He has interviewed local officials such as Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell.</p><p>He also has been at risk for deportation for some time.</p><p>An ICE spokesman said an immigration judge ordered Duran be deported in 2007 for failing to make a scheduled court date. That was 11 years ago, during the George W. Bush presidency.</p><p>The Trump Administration has begun a purge of undocumented men, women and children - some who have lived peacefully for decades in America. That includes Thursday's raid of a meatpacking plant in Grainger County, where ICE held 86 people to check their immigration status. Of those, 54 were detained for further immigration proceedings.</p><p>They have worked at jobs - not stolen them - and they have also paid taxes without receiving benefits like Medicare or Social Security.</p><p>There should be a solution to fix the system and allow immigrants like Duran a path to experience and enjoy the American Dream and contribute to the nation's success.</p><p>Congress has failed numerous times over the years to do so. This year, shamefully, Congress abandoned an effort to provide a permanent solution to recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>ended. Without a solution, 800,000 people - including 9,300 Tennesseans - who are working or going to school will be at risk of being deported.</p><p>Regarding Duran, the Constitution does not distinguish between citizens and non-citizens when it comes to exercising First Amendment freedoms.</p><p>He was exercising the right of freedom of the press to hold government accountable, and he was wrongfully punished for it.</p><p>Journalists like Duran should not be arrested for doing their jobs. ICE should free him so he can continue fearlessly reporting on his community.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tennessean.com\">https://www.tennessean.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 11</p><p>The Orange County Register on the DACA impasse:</p><p>While <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>blames the failure of any emergent DACA fix on the Democrats, a closer look reveals a more complicated situation.</p><p>Last September, Trump issued an executive order giving Congress six months to come up with a permanent, legislative solution to the situation of the up to 2 million young people who qualified for deferred deportations under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p><p>Trump's reasoning for this was sound. The program, which shielded young people who entered the country illegally before the age of 16 and have lived in the U.S. continuously since June 15, 2007, among other qualifications, offered only temporary protections and was created by highly questionable executive fiat.</p><p>A March 5 deadline for the expiration of DACA as a result of Trump's rescission of Obama's order has since been rendered moot as a result of legal challenges by defenders of the program, and at least in theory gives Congress more time to actually come up with a fix.</p><p>Unfortunately, efforts to legislatively resolve the issue have consistently fallen short, despite widespread bipartisan agreement that it makes little sense for the United States to deport millions of young people raised, educated and integrated in the United States.</p><p>\"They really let them down,\" Trump said April 2. \"They had this great opportunity. The Democrats have really let them down. It's a shame. And now people are taking advantage of DACA and that's a shame.\"</p><p>To his credit, there seems to be a kernel of truth in Trump's version of events. Congressional Democrats have repeatedly threatened to hold up government spending bills if a DACA fix wasn't included, yet they've inevitably and even predictably folded every time.</p><p>Senate Democrats also didn't vote for the White House's preferred DACA fix in February.</p><p>The bill, backed by <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, offered a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million young people brought to the United States illegally as minors. In exchange, the bill called for an end to the diversity visa lottery program and restrictions on so-called chain migration.</p><p>However, a lot of Republicans didn't vote for that bill either. The bill only mustered 39 votes in support with 60 opposed.</p><p>Trump's insistence on an unpopular border wall and adding unrelated legal immigration restrictions into the discussion have done far more to prevent a DACA fix than an unwillingness on the part of congressional Democrats to compromise. We know this because Democrats did join Republicans in voting for two compromise bills to trade a DACA fix in exchange for additional border security measures.</p><p>The proposal that got closest - a plan put forward by the Common Sense Caucus to provide $25 billion in border security funding and prevent DACA recipients from sponsoring their parents for legal status - received the support of most Democrats and eight Republicans, in total receiving 54 votes in favor, 45 against.</p><p>For Trump to put the blame on the Democrats for the failure of a DACA fix might be red meat for his staunchest supporters to cover for his failure to get anything meaningful done on immigration, but it's an incomplete narrative at best.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ocregister.com\">https://www.ocregister.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 11</p><p>The Evening Standard (London) on tech and politics:</p><p>Big tech met big politics yesterday - and came off best.</p><p>Swapping his usual grey T-shirt for a sober suit and tidy blue tie, Facebook's chief executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>spent five hours giving evidence to the US Congress about the data scandal that has hit his business.</p><p>Even for a billionaire it was an intimidating event. But as he spoke, his company's share price climbed and that more than anything else revealed the final score.</p><p>Senators tried to put him under pressure. Some of their questions were good ones; others were not.</p><p>It would be easy to mock the senator who asked how Facebook made money - apparently unaware of its vast revenues from advertising and data.</p><p>But mockery would be the wrong response.</p><p>Governments, courts and parliaments all over the world are struggling to respond to the vast and rapid changes to politics, society and economics being brought by businesses such as Facebook.</p><p>Would British MPs have asked better questions than the senators? No.</p><p>Do they have the knowledge and the tools to respond to the power of social media? No.</p><p>Do our regulators or our courts? No.</p><p>Digital technology is no longer just one industry among many others: it is a fundamental dynamic in almost every part of modern life and its power is only going to become greater.</p><p>The established ways of business, politics and Government can no longer deal with this adequately - as everything from the influence of fake social media in the US presidential election to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, to the epidemic of gang violence on London's streets shows.</p><p>So the big question we should all be asking is: what needs to change? And how do we make it happen?</p><p>The wrong response would be to fear technology or to try to contain its impact.</p><p>It is improving lives fundamentally but our governments, parliaments and courts need to make a systematic attempt to understand its consequences so they can better regulate it, support it and improve it.</p><p>As Congress has just found out, ignorance isn't bliss.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk\">https://www.standard.co.uk</url>/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APNE-ff589014f09a47fda135a78a4125f15a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S34-2FP1-JC65-53KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4246\"/><timeReceived>6:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>US IMMIGRATION &amp; CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.organization\"><classificationItem><className>U.S. Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S. Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Syria government</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Nikki Haley, GOVERNMENT_FIGURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Howard Baker, GOVERNMENT_FIGURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George W.

Morally, it represents an unconscionable abuse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to reporting by ProPublica and the Wall Street Journal, several dozen parents in well-off Chicago suburbs transferred guardianship of teens who were juniors or seniors in high school to friends or family members. The teens were then able to report only their own small income on financial aid forms, which allowed them to claim and receive money meant for poor students.</p><p>The investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Education has suggested a possible fix, according to the Journal: tightening the language about legal guardianship in the Federal Student Aid handbook. This seems like a good start. University financial aid offices and college counsellors also have a role to play in ending this abuse.</p><p>And oh, yes: Parents and teens need to honestly report their financial circumstances. The college experience should be an accrual of life lessons. What does it teach teenagers when their parents sign them out of the family and ask them to declare poverty to position themselves for ill-gotten benefits?</p><p>Like the \"Varsity Blues\" college admissions scandal that broke earlier this year, in which rich families were accused of bribing their kids into elite colleges, this is not a victimless act. Money is diverted from students in real need, as grant money does run out. This could make the difference between whether a low-income teen can afford to attend college or not. Court resources are wasted on nonsense guardianship requests that flout the intention of financial aid regulations.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal found 38 similar incidents in a study of 1,000 probate cases in Lake County. The reporting described a Chicago-area woman with a household income of more than $250,000 a year who transferred guardianship of her then-17-year-old daughter to her business partner. Claiming only her $4,200 summer job earnings, instead of her parents' income, the teen secured $20,000 in need-based aid, including a federal Pell Grant. Yes, taxpayers foot the bill for some of this.</p><p>There is some credit due in this outrageous saga. Not to the \"college consulting\" company apparently involved, and not to the law firms who shepherded the guardianship requests. Rather, we salute the high school counsellor, unnamed in the articles, who raised the issue after she smelled something rotten. And we applaud university officials who aren't varnishing their words.</p><p>\"It's a scam,\" Andy Borst, director of undergraduate admissions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told ProPublica.</p><p>True, that.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com\">https://www.chicagotribune.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 29</p><p>The Los Angeles Times on multiple deadly shootings in recent days, including one at a garlic festival in California:</p><p>Two American traditions - summer celebrations and gun violence - collided in jarring fashion over the weekend.</p><p>Here in California, a man armed with a military-style rifle snuck through a perimeter fence at the annual Gilroy Garlic Festival and opened fire late Sunday afternoon, killing three people, two of them children, while a dozen others were wounded or injured fleeing the pandemonium. Police on Monday morning were trying to determine why the gunman, identified as Santino William Legan, 19, of Gilroy, decided to shoot up the festival.</p><p>A day earlier and on the other side of the continent, gunmen opened fire during a neighbourhood Old Timers Day celebration in a Brooklyn, N.Y., park, killing one person and wounding or injuring 11 others. Police were investigating whether the incident was gang-related.</p><p>As a nation, we've become slowly accustomed to such senseless violence, with attacks on houses of worship, on schools, at workplaces and on family members. Just last week, police in Los Angeles arrested Gerry Dean Zaragoza after he allegedly shot three family members in Canoga Park, killing two of them, then shot a former girlfriend and a man at a gas station, killing the woman. Then later still, police say, he shot dead a stranger on a bus. Separately, an off-duty Los Angeles police officer grabbing a late taco with his girlfriend and her two brothers in Lincoln Heights confronted a graffiti tagger and was shot and killed.</p><p>The inevitable debates after Gilroy will touch on the usual themes. It wasn't the gun, it was the poison in the man's mind. There's some truth to that, given that firearms are inanimate objects. But without a firearm, the man couldn't have shot anyone. And without the semiautomatic function of the firearm, he couldn't have shot so many so quickly. And military-style rifles like the one used Sunday are conceived and designed for battlefields and it's preposterous to sell them for hunting or \"self-defence.\"</p><p>The violence, of course, won't move President Trump or Congress to act. Trump tweeted Monday that the shooting was \"horrific\" and said we should continue to \"work together as communities and citizens\" to prevent violence. But in fact he has done virtually nothing to address our long-running national scourge. He has fallen into the full embrace of the National Rifle Assn. in ways no other recent president has done. \"You have a true friend in the White House,\" he told the NRA two years ago, after the group spent $30 million to help get him elected.</p><p>In truth, the fault is not Trump's alone. Successive administrations, and Congresses, have failed to break the gun lobby's stranglehold on federal gun policies. And so the nation will continue to suffer gunshot wounds by the dozens each day, and by the tens of thousands each year. And something so harmless as a celebration of garlic, or of a Brooklyn neighbourhood, will continue to carry the possibility of violent death.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com\">https://www.latimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 29</p><p>The Wall Street Journal on a headline and a hashtag targeting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his track record on Russia:</p><p>Mitch McConnell, the most phlegmatic man in American politics, rarely gets riled up. But on Monday the Senate Majority Leader let it rip in defence of his reputation, and we're glad he did.</p><p>Mr. McConnell was responding to a Democratic-media onslaught seeking to portray the Kentucky defence hawk as a toady for Russia. His offence is opposing some Democratic proposals to protect the 2020 election from foreign meddling. In particular he opposes attempts to nationalize election rules and ballot procedures that have been historically managed by the states. This is his long-held position and makes sense since a national system would be easier to hack than the systems of 50 states.</p><p>But Mr. McConnell is running for re-election next year, and the left needs a villain for the failure of special counsel Robert Mueller to find collusion between Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. Enter #MoscowMitch, the hashtag that appeared on Twitter and was immediately picked up across the Democratic media landscape.</p><p>\"It started with the angry lies on MSNBC. The host lied and said that I've dismissed Russia's interference in our 2016 election as, quote, a 'hoax.' Of course I've never said any such thing,\" Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"A few hours later came the Washington Post column. It was authored by Dana Milbank, a pundit who spent much of the Obama Administration carrying water for its failed foreign policies and excusing President Obama's weakness on Russia.\"</p><p>The column was headlined, \"Mitch McConnell is a Russian asset,\" which the Senator rightly called \"a shameful smear.\"</p><p>The truth is that Mr. McConnell has been far tougher on Vladimir Putin than most Democrats were across the Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama Administrations. He pushed for tougher sanctions on Russia than the Obama crowd wanted and he supported the Magnitsky Act that has allowed the U.S. to sanction Mr. Putin's cronies. He has also supported the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian meddling in 2016.</p><p>Republicans can't count on a media phalanx to defend them from unfair attacks, so like Mr. McConnell they have to do it themselves.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 29</p><p>The New York Times on a Trump Administration proposal to change rules regarding food stamps:</p><p>The Trump administration, which often talks about the importance of reducing regulation, has found at least one place where it would like to add red tape. The Agriculture Department wants to make it more difficult for poor children to get enough food.</p><p>The department is proposing to end programs in 40 states and the District of Columbia that make it easier for low-income families to sign up for food stamps. The stated rationale is that some people who are getting help do not need it. But the evidence suggests that problem is quite small, while the proposed solution is likely to keep millions of Americans who do need help from getting it.</p><p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helped 33.5 million people in the average month over the last year - mostly families with children, older Americans and people with disabilities - to buy a limited range of groceries from a list of supervised retailers. In place of the original coupons, beneficiaries now get an average of $127 loaded on a special debit card.</p><p>The program is enormously successful in mitigating poverty. Studies of Americans born in the 1960s, when the program was implemented nationally, show that children in families that received benefits went on to lead healthier and more productive lives.</p><p>Most beneficiaries live in households with incomes up to 130 per cent of the federal poverty line - $32,640 a year in 2019 for a family of two adults and two children. But in 1996, as part of a broad overhaul of federal aid for lower-income families, Congress let states expand eligibility even as it curtailed benefits. States can offer food stamps to households with incomes up to 200 per cent of the poverty line, or around $50,200 a year for a family with two children. States also can waive a requirement that beneficiaries must have no more than $2,250 in assets.</p><p>Critics have long argued that the expansion was overly generous; the Trump administration is proposing to substantially restore the old rules. Officials at the Agriculture Department have highlighted the example of Rob Undersander, a 66-year-old Minnesota resident who qualified to receive food stamps even though he had more than a million dollars in assets because Minnesota, like most states, has chosen to waive the asset cap.</p><p>Mr. Undersander applied for food stamps in 2016, in the manner of a man who robs a bank to demonstrate the need for more security. He collected more than $6,000 in benefits he did not need, donating the money to charity while seeking to publicize his story.</p><p>\"There may be other millionaires\" on food stamps, an administration official told reporters.</p><p>But the proposed changes are not tailored to keep millionaires from getting food stamps. They would keep millions of low-income families from getting food stamps.</p><p>The Trump administration estimates that 4.9 per cent of beneficiaries live in households with incomes above 130 per cent of the poverty line. But all recipients, including those households, still must demonstrate that their disposable incomes, after deductions for housing, child care, and other basic expenses, fall below the poverty line. That's hardly an open-door policy - which is why relatively few households qualify. And those with higher incomes get smaller monthly payments. The program is meant to cover the gap between income and need.</p><p>The administration estimates another 4.1 per cent of beneficiaries live in households with more than $2,250 in eligible assets. The standard excludes some kinds of savings, like equity in a home or money in a retirement plan. But it is still draconian. A worker in a minimum-wage job who managed to save three months of salary for a rainy day would lose his or her eligibility for food stamps as a consequence. The threshold was set at $2,000 in the mid-1980s, but only indexed to inflation in 2008. As a result, it has become much more restrictive than the original intent.</p><p>A reasonable asset ceiling, set at a level that allows rainy-day savings, has obvious appeal. But the evidence suggests that it would exclude very few people, because those with low incomes tend to have scant savings, and would impose large costs. According to the Trump administration's own estimates, states would have to employ the equivalent of 6,672 new workers solely devoted to asset verification. The government, in other words, probably saved a lot of money by allowing Mr. Undersander to collect some benefits.</p><p>In all, the administration says the government can save about $2 billion a year by denying benefits to 3.1 million people who would not meet the old standards. By the same logic, the government could save $60 billion a year by suspending the entire program. But those savings will not come from denying food stamps to millionaires. The vast majority of the government's money is given to Americans who are hungry, so they may eat.</p><p>The proposal once again highlights the gap between Mr. Trump's rhetorical promises to help lower-income American families, and the reality of his policies, which have systematically made life more difficult for those very families. The administration has slashed taxes on affluent Americans and significantly increased total federal spending - on Thursday (July 25), it announced plans to give another $16 billion to farmers hurt by Mr. Trump's trade policies - even as it seeks to make a show of fiscal discipline at the expense of children.</p><p>Congress should move to codify the current food stamp rules, which have been embraced by red and blue states alike, to protect millions of Americans from this act of theatrical cruelty.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 27</p><p>The Baltimore Sun on President Trump's criticism of Maryland's seventh congressional district, represented by Congressman Elijah Cummings:</p><p>In case anyone missed it, the president of the United States had some choice words to describe Maryland's 7th congressional district on Saturday morning. Here are the key phrases: \"no human being would want to live there,\" it is a \"very dangerous &amp; filthy place,\" ''Worst in the USA\" and, our personal favourite: It is a \"rat and rodent infested mess.\" He wasn't really speaking of the 7th as a whole. He failed to mention Ellicott City, for example, or Baldwin or Monkton or Prettyboy, all of which are contained in the sprawling yet oddly-shaped district that runs from western Howard County to southern Harford County. No, Donald Trump's wrath was directed at Baltimore and specifically at Rep. Elijah Cummings, the 68-year-old son of a former South Carolina sharecropper who has represented the district in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1996.</p><p>It's not hard to see what's going on here. The congressman has been a thorn in this president's side, and Mr. Trump sees attacking African American members of Congress as good politics, as it both warms the cockles of the white supremacists who love him and causes so many of the thoughtful people who don't to scream. President Trump bad-mouthed Baltimore in order to make a point that the border camps are \"clean, efficient &amp; well run,\" which, of course, they are not - unless you are fine with all the overcrowding, squalor, cages and deprivation to be found in what the Department of Homeland Security's own inspector-general recently called \"a ticking time bomb.\"</p><p>In pointing to the 7th, the president wasn't hoping his supporters would recognize landmarks like Johns Hopkins Hospital, perhaps the nation's leading medical centre. He wasn't conjuring images of the U.S. Social Security Administration, where they write the checks that so many retired and disabled Americans depend upon. It wasn't about the beauty of the Inner Harbor or the proud history of Fort McHenry. And it surely wasn't about the economic standing of a district where the median income is actually above the national average. No, he was returning to an old standby of attacking an African American lawmaker from a majority black district on the most emotional and bigoted of arguments. It was only surprising that there wasn't room for a few classic phrases like \"you people\" or \"welfare queens\" or \"crime-ridden ghettos\" or a suggestion that the congressman \"go back\" to where he came from.</p><p>This is a president who will happily debase himself at the slightest provocation. And given Mr. Cummings' criticisms of U.S. border policy, the various investigations he has launched as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, his willingness to call Mr. Trump a racist for his recent attacks on the freshmen congresswomen, and the fact that \"Fox &amp; Friends\" had recently aired a segment critical of the city, slamming Baltimore must have been irresistible in a Pavlovian way. Fox News rang the bell, the president salivated and his thumbs moved across his cellphone into action.</p><p>As heartening as it has been to witness public figures rise to Charm City's defence on Saturday, from native daughter House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Mayor Bernard C. \"Jack\" Young, we would above all remind Mr. Trump that the 7th District, Baltimore included, is part of the United States that he is supposedly governing. The White House has far more power to effect change in this city, for good or ill, than any single member of Congress including Mr. Cummings. If there are problems here, rodents included, they are as much his responsibility as anyone's, perhaps more because he holds the most powerful office in the land.</p><p>Finally, while we would not sink to name-calling in the Trumpian manner - or ruefully point out that he failed to spell the congressman's name correctly (it's Cummings, not Cumming) - we would tell the most dishonest man to ever occupy the Oval Office, the mocker of war heroes, the gleeful grabber of women's private parts, the serial bankrupter of businesses, the useful idiot of Vladimir Putin and the guy who insisted there are \"good people\" among murderous neo-Nazis that he's still not fooling most Americans into believing he's even slightly competent in his current post. Or that he possesses a scintilla of integrity. Better to have some vermin living in your neighbourhood than to be one.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com\">https://www.baltimoresun.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>July 25</p><p>The Toronto Star on efforts to rein in the power of big technology companies:</p><p>\"In a lot of ways,\" Mark Zuckerberg has famously said, \"Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company.\"</p><p>Much the same could be said of the other tech giants that set the rules for so much of our lives - especially Google, Amazon and Apple. Real governments struggle to tame the beast in areas ranging from privacy and democracy to taxation and corporate clout. Facebook even has plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, called Libra.</p><p>Finally, though, there are signs governments are stirring themselves to meet the challenge - and not a moment too soon.</p><p>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a record fine of $5 billion (last) week for misleading its users about the privacy of their personal information. In addition, the FTC ordered the company to set up a new board-level committee on privacy and make its data practices more transparent.</p><p>That's a lot of money. But for Facebook, even a fine of that size is just the cost of doing business. It earned more than that in the last quarter alone and its stocked jumped 56 per cent last year while it weathered a storm of criticism.</p><p>The bigger potential challenge to Facebook and the rest comes from another direction. After years of leaving the big tech firms to pretty much regulate themselves, the U.S. government has launched investigations into how they have amassed so much market power and whether they've violated antitrust laws.</p><p>This is a big change. So far the tech companies have faced their biggest push-back in Europe while Washington tended to defend them as champions of innovation. But now the U.S. Justice Department and federal regulators are lining up Facebook et al in their sights.</p><p>And it isn't just about privacy, \"fake news\" and similar well-publicized concerns about social media and the health of democracy. Those are important, but the real stakes for the dominant tech companies lie in a challenge to the enormous market power they have accumulated in just a few years.</p><p>An antitrust review could put into question that power, the near-monopoly grip on key markets that lets them dominate billions of dollars in advertising revenue, squeeze out potential competitors, dictate terms of business, and avoid paying tax in many of the places they operate. Even breaking up some of the biggest companies would be a real possibility - especially if a Democrat wins the White House next year.</p><p>With all that, you might expect a lively debate among Canada's political parties on how to meet the tech challenge. For the most part, though, you'd be disappointed.</p><p>The Trudeau government brought in new rules governing election advertising online and foreign meddling in campaigns. But it had no effective response when Google simply said it won't carry any election ads rather than meet the Canadian requirements.</p><p>And Canada's privacy commissioner was left to sputter impotently when he rebuked the company for violating the privacy of 620,000 Canadian users and it brushed him off. It turns out he has no power to tell Facebook to do anything. Even if he takes the company to court and wins, the maximum fine would be a risible $100,000.</p><p>On the key issue of taxation, Canada's position is to wait to see what the big boys do. Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the Star's Heather Scoffield recently that Canada wants to see what G7 leaders decide at their summit in France next month, so there can be common rules for all.</p><p>As for the future, the best the Liberals can offer is the tepid \"digital charter\" that Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains unveiled in May. It points in the right direction on privacy and other issues, but there's no reason the government could not have moved faster in those areas.</p><p>Canadians deserve better. The trend across the developed world clearly favours reining in Big Tech, and Canada should be more than a bystander as these parallel governments are brought under control.</p><p>The coming election campaign will be an ideal time for the federal parties to spell out how they would meet that challenge.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com\">https://www.thestar.com</url>/</p><p>___</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d3d1ece3bcdc483c9e6387bfd229b872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPN-KHY1-JBVR-347S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3815\"/><timeReceived>04:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Justice Department will soon make its decision on the merger, and Democrats, unions and big business are lining up to defeat it at the expense of America's leadership in 5G telecom networks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The State AGs say the merger \"would eliminate Sprint as a competitor and reduce the number of (mobile network operators) with nationwide networks in the United States from four to three.\" But a market of three strong wireless players would be more competitive than a de facto duopoly led by AT&amp;T and Verizon. T-Mobile has 79 million customers while Sprint boasts 54 million compared to Verizon (118 million) and AT&amp;T (94 million). The Big Two need a strong competitor, not two weaklings that may not survive for long.</p><p>More spectrum improves connectivity and boosts download speeds, which helps the two giants attract more customers. With more revenue, they can procure more spectrum at government auctions to improve their networks. AT&amp;T also came into a sweet spectrum deal two years ago when the Commerce Department selected it to build a national emergency network for first-responders.</p><p>For years T-Mobile and Sprint have been slashing prices to compete with the Big Two. As the state AGs note, the average cost per megabyte of data declined by between 72% and 83% between 2013 and 2017. The problem is that all of the carriers have piled up debt that could retard their 5G build-out.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon have used much of their cash paying for content acquisitions rather than investing in 5G. AT&amp;T has curbed price cuts to pay down $171 billion in debt from buying DirecTV and Time Warner. Verizon has $113 billion in debt and is writing off its misconceived Yahoo and AOL acquisitions that were supposed to help it compete with Google.</p><p>While AT&amp;T and Verizon have begun to roll out 5G service in some markets, T-Mobile and Sprint lack the complementary spectrum and capital to compete nationwide. So there's less impetus for AT&amp;T and Verizon to accelerate their 5G plans, improve efficiency or redirect misallocated capital from more glamorous media plays.</p><p>The Democratic AGs claim to be standing for competition, but in opposing the T-Mobile-Sprint merger they're entrenching the Big Two. It's worth recalling that competition from Sprint and MCI is what finally broke AT&amp;T's monopoly on long-distance service in the 1980s. Long-distance prices fell rapidly.</p><p>Sprint and T-Mobile have already committed to deploying a 5G network that would cover 97% of the U.S. population within three years including 85% of rural Americans. They have also agreed to maintain current prices for at least three years, which is three years longer than either Verizon or AT&amp;T. The AG warnings about price increases are false.</p><p>As ever, there's a union-Democratic Party merger here. The Communications Workers of America, who represent AT&amp;T and Verizon workers, oppose the tie between the nonunion Sprint and T-Mobile. The last thing they want is a stronger nonunion competitor. The union is a big financier of Democrats, and it endorsed the AGs in co-ordinated fashion on Tuesday.</p><p>All of this lobbying is aimed directly at persuading Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim to oppose the deal. Justice attorneys have been demanding divestitures with perhaps an eye to recreating a fourth wireless carrier. Cable companies that aim to launch plans with wireless carriers' spectrum - Altice already has a contract with Sprint - have criticized the deal for thwarting competition. But cable companies merely want to fortify their regional monopolies, especially in rural areas where a merged T-Mobile-Sprint could compete.</p><p>While the media obsess about Big Tech and antitrust, the T-Mobile-Sprint merger may be more consequential for America's future. More of the world economy is becoming digital every day, and 5G is essential to capturing the benefits of artificial intelligence and much more. The U.S. can't afford to fall behind by depending on a unionized duopoly. While Democratic AGs and unions may not care if 5G plods along, anyone who wants to preserve America's global competitiveness should.</p><p>Online:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url></p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The Minneapolis Star Tribune on U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar:</p><p>U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is back in the news again, and not in a good way. The former state representative who won a seat in Congress last fall continues to be dogged by past missteps, this time eight violations of Minnesota campaign-finance law that will cost her nearly $3,500 in reimbursements and civil penalties.</p><p>So complex were the allegations that the state Campaign Finance Board spent nearly a year assessing the case, deposing staff people and former staff people, along with Omar herself. The investigation was broadened in October - just a month before her election to Congress - to look more deeply into the allegations. Board Executive Director Jeff Sigurdson said that between six and eight people were deposed separately.</p><p>In an October 2018 editorial, we called on Omar to more fully explain her travel and other expenses. We noted that the allegations \"suggest a pattern of carelessness and/or self-dealing with legally restricted funds. Neither conclusion inspires the confidence voters deserve to have in someone they send to the U.S. House to represent them.\"</p><p>It is even more disturbing, therefore, to learn that among the board's latest findings was a troubling discovery that is far beyond its jurisdiction, but worthy of greater scrutiny nevertheless. Omar, for two years running, filed joint tax returns with a man she was living with but not legally married to. Complicating matters further, she was legally married to another man at the time.</p><p>It's against the law in Minnesota to file jointly unless one filer is legally married to the other. Last year Omar told the Star Tribune that she had married her partner \"in her faith,\" and had earlier divorced her first husband \"in her faith.\" That's fine for religious purposes. But for tax purposes, only civil marriages qualify. It's not known whether she benefited materially by filing jointly. That is something that voters, who are obliged to follow tax laws no matter how painful, are entitled to know.</p><p>It's not too much to expect that a lawmaker would check with a tax attorney on a rather complicated marital status before filing. And when questions arise, it's a violation to use campaign funds to clear up those personal issues, as Omar apparently did. The Campaign Finance Board has ordered that she reimburse her campaign $3,469 for violations related to her tax returns and non-campaign travel costs. She must also pay a $500 civil penalty.</p><p>Omar is no stranger to controversy. As a new state House member, she collected $2,500 in speaking fees - $2,000 from Normandale Community College and $500 from Inver Hills Community College - for appearances made shortly after she took office. Rep. Steve Drazkowski, R-Mazeppa, who publicly noted that state law prohibits legislators from collecting such fees from groups that have business before the Legislature, made that public, and Omar returned the money. Drazkowski also filed the latest complaint. \"It's very clear there are huge ethical problems with Rep. Omar,\" he told an editorial writer, adding that the House should consider an ethics investigation.</p><p>If this pattern continues, further investigation may be necessary. Omar could have avoided nearly every infraction by taking simple measures in advance to determine whether her actions would pass legal muster. In its findings, the board noted that Minnesota \"House Research staff did explain that generally when they discuss whether a member can accept something of value, for example, travel and lodging reimbursement ... they discuss whether that would violate the gift prohibition,\" but do not advise. \"Rather, they commonly refer members to the Board. The Omar committee did not contact Board staff ... on the appropriateness of using committee funds for the travel reviewed in this investigation.\"</p><p>Omar's political rise has been marred by a series of unforced errors, including intemperate remarks and tweets earlier this year that were widely perceived as anti-Semitic. Every month seems to bring a fresh problem.</p><p>As an elected representative for Minnesota and one of the first Muslim women and Somali refugees elected to Congress, Omar is helping to break new ground. But more is expected of her than the symbolism attached to her victory. Omar has a special obligation to be worthy of the trust so many have placed in her, including many still-new Americans who expect better.</p><p>Online:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.startribune.com\">http://www.startribune.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The Los Angeles Times on the rising number of horse deaths at Santa Anita Park:</p><p>On Saturday, a 4-year-old gelding named Formal Dude was euthanized after injuring itself during a race at Santa Anita Park. Formal Dude was the 28th horse to die from racing or training at the beleaguered track since December.</p><p>At that point, the California Horse Racing Board had had enough, and it took the extraordinary step of asking Santa Anita to suspend racing for the few days remaining in this season at the park.</p><p>But Santa Anita's owners refused, and on Sunday the racing continued. That's when a 3-year-old filly, Truffalino, collapsed and died just after the jockey pulled the horse out of a race. Truffalino became the 29th fatality of the season.</p><p>Frankly, we're appalled. There have now been numerous calls for the Stronach Group, which owns the Santa Anita track, to suspend racing - from animal welfare groups and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), among others. On May 29, this editorial board also called for a suspension.</p><p>All have urged the park to wait for the results from the official necropsies on these horses and an investigation into the mysterious spate of deaths that has bedeviled the Santa Anita track all year. It's reckless enough to keep racing before the park has all the information it needs. But it's disdainful and arrogant to do it in defiance of the state horse racing regulators.</p><p>It's time to give the racing board the authority to compel a suspension. State Senate Bill 469 would, among other things, allow the board to suspend a track's license to conduct horse racing when necessary to protect the health and safety of horses or riders. The bill should be approved. Furthermore, a congressional bill, HR 1754, the Horseracing Integrity Act, would establish some national oversight of a fragmented sport that is governed by different racing boards with different rules in every state. The congressional bill would ban race-day use of a common diuretic, Lasix, and establish a uniform medication control program to be developed and enforced by an independent authority.</p><p>There's no question that Santa Anita has instituted some ground-breaking reforms governing the administration of drugs to horses on the track, and setting new rules for trainers and jockeys. After a spike in deaths from late December through March, the park closed for several weeks and put in place some of the new rules. After that, the park went six weeks with no deaths.</p><p>Then another rash of deaths began. Not all were broken legs. A couple were pelvic injuries. Some were what horse experts call rare or freak occurrences - such as shoulder injuries. Yet, two horses at the park suffered life-ending shoulder injuries in the last few weeks, making them seem less freakish. In the last week alone, there have been three deaths. But in a statement Sunday, the Stronach Group and the Thoroughbred Owners of California and the California Thoroughbred Trainers noted the drop in catastrophic injuries and reiterated that the reforms were working. The statement said that \"the reality is that our improvements and changes have been effective.\"</p><p>Really? Then why have we seen multiple deaths in a few weeks' time? At this point, the park has six days of racing left in its season, which closes June 23. Then it returns in the fall for about a month and a half.</p><p>In calendar year 2018, according to statistics kept by the Jockey Club, Santa Anita's rate of deaths per 1,000 \"starts\" (a horse literally starting a race) was 2.04. That's substantially higher than last year's national average of 1.68. It's lower, though, than the alarming death rate of 2.73 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>Over time, Americans have to decide how much death they are willing to tolerate in this ancient sport. More immediately, though, the owners of the track at Santa Anita have to face up to the troubling, unexplained deaths that have occurred this past year. And they should not risk any more horses' lives for the rest of this season.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com\">http://www.latimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 11</p><p>The London Evening Standard on the challenges facing candidates for Prime Minister of the United Kingdom:</p><p>\"Never again,\" said the Conservative world, after Theresa May walked into the Tory leadership underprepared and unscrutinised three years ago. Next time, everyone insisted, candidates for the premiership, and their plans for office, should be put under the microscope. And yet here we are, in the week of the first ballot for choosing the next prime minister, and the most probing question being asked on TV and radio of the contenders is: what drugs did you take when you were younger? The unsurprising answer, like many people of their generation, is that, yes, most of them tried illegal substances at some point.</p><p>It's almost 30 years since Bill Clinton admitted smoking marijuana, 25 since Barack Obama confessed to taking cocaine, and 15 since David Cameron said politicians were entitled to a private past. It's time to move on to the serious questions that face anyone who wants to be prime minister. Let's start with the biggest: who has a plan to unblock the impasse over Brexit? Threatening a no-deal departure is hollow, because there isn't a parliamentary majority for one and (thankfully) no realistic way to stop Parliament meeting to express that majority. Promising a renegotiation with the EU, and wishing away the Irish backstop, isn't something anyone in the rest of Europe believes is credible. Passing a version of the existing deal on the table was something Mrs May failed three times to achieve. Meanwhile none of the leading contenders dare raise the prospect of a referendum, let alone an election. If candidates pretend it is easy to achieve what the current administration has found impossible, then they should be challenged.</p><p>Perhaps they can drive Brussels into submission; perhaps an Irish border commission involving the Republic might find a way through; perhaps a new leader will be able to reassemble a Tory majority. We need to see the evidence. To those who say they can deliver Brexit by October 31, we simply ask: how? To those who say they would be prepared to delay beyond that, we ask: how will that help? The very least the public deserve is that those who want to enter Number 10 in a few weeks' time are grilled seriously on their Brexit plan. The same applies to the other policy pledges that are coming thick and fast.</p><p>New ideas needed</p><p>A leadership contest is a time for new ideas, and it's right that - as the saying goes - in democracies we campaign in poetry and govern in prose. So we're not asking for every detail of every policy. But some idea of how things will be paid for is necessary if the country is not to be further misled by those who govern it.</p><p>Raising the tax threshold at which people pay 40 per cent beyond \u00a350,000 is a solid Conservative idea that builds on what has already been achieved. Every modern society will want to invest in education but why have the Tories given up talking about the reform that means investment will be well spent? We want more housing but where are you going to build it? We'd all like to provide decent social care without raiding people's homes and savings but the answer has eluded numerous governments. Using the \"headroom\" in the public finances to fund all these commitments, as the candidates suggest, is code for \"we'll borrow more\". There's nothing intrinsically wrong with that, if you explain it means a bigger national debt than would otherwise exist, and then higher taxes and spending cuts in the future.</p><p>Nor can candidates hide behind their \"consciences\" on social issues. Reducing the abortion limit is not solely a matter of personal belief when you're a legislator whose beliefs could impose serious, health-threatening restrictions on millions of women. Let's hear how you can morally justify that. And where is the debate about the disruption coming from technology? How do we harness all the exciting possibilities of artificial intelligence, genomics and robotics while mitigating the potential harm?</p><p>We've heard precious little. What we've had instead is more a replay of the Tory best hits from circa 1990. Britain faces the greatest political crisis for a generation. The foundations of our economic prosperity and security are threatened. We face profound change in our society. It's time the questions to our leaders matched the seriousness of the task that lies ahead of them.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.standard.co.uk\">http://www.standard.co.uk</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 9</p><p>The New York Times on the congressional response to an increase of migrants at the southern border:</p><p>Last week, as American and Mexican officials haggled over how to address the migrant crisis at their countries' shared border, United States Customs and Border Protection released its monthly migration statistics. They tell an alarming story.</p><p>In May, 144,278 migrants were taken into custody. It was the third consecutive month in which apprehensions topped 100,000 and the highest one-month total in 13 years.</p><p>Unequipped to deal with the crush, border facilities and migrant shelters are dangerously overcrowded, and the staff is overburdened. Dysfunction, disease and even death are a growing reality.</p><p>\"We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger: The system is broken,\" the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.</p><p>Also last week, officials said that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency assigned to care for unaccompanied migrant children, would begin cutting services \"not directly necessary for the protection of life and safety.\" This includes English classes, legal aid and recreational programs.</p><p>Democrats and other administration critics called the move \"cruel\" and \"illegal,\" but the financial reality is that the agency is overwhelmed. So far this fiscal year, it has taken charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied children - a 57 per cent increase over last year. The entire program could run out of funding by the end of June.</p><p>In short, it is time for Congress to stop dithering and pass emergency funding to deal with this nightmare.</p><p>It has been more than a month since the administration sent Congress a request for $4.5 billion in additional border assistance. A large portion of the money, $3.3 billion, was earmarked for humanitarian aid - which most lawmakers agree is sorely needed. But a relatively modest piece of the request aimed at shoring up border security operations, roughly a quarter of the total, has tied negotiators in knots.</p><p>Early on, Democrats were opposed to funding additional detention beds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Republicans had problems with Democrats' demands for changes in the administration's asylum policies. At one point, negotiators thought they were close to resolving these conflicts, only to have other issues snarl the process. Beyond the money for security, one of the remaining disagreements is how much data sharing will be allowed between the agencies responsible for caring for migrant children and those that handle border enforcement.</p><p>The broader problem is that many Democrats have come to view the Trump administration as untrustworthy, and they are loath to hand over one more penny for anything to do with immigration. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have been particularly adamant, insisting that their leadership take a hard line in negotiations. In part, they fear that the administration, despite its promises, will spend any additional funding on enforcement rather than humanitarian needs.</p><p>There is much to despise about this administration's immigration policies, which are exacerbating this crisis, but there should be no ambivalence about the urgency of addressing the humanitarian needs. While lawmakers wring their hands and drag their feet, tens of thousands of migrant children are suffering.</p><p>Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that suffering.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com\">http://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>June 7</p><p>The Boston Globe on CBD, the nonintoxicating, natural molecule extracted from the cannabis plant:</p><p>If you believe the hype, one little bottle of CBD contains miracles. It treats diabetes; reduces stress; alleviates chronic pain and anxiety; even cures acne. Trouble sleeping? Panicky pet? CBD to the rescue.</p><p>All that, and so much more - at a bargain price as low as $40 for some formulas. This potent potable also comes mixed into body lotions, bath salts, coffee, smoothies, gummy bears, chocolate, cheese pizza, and dog biscuits.</p><p>The fad for cannabidiol, or CBD, has clearly gone mainstream. From virtually nothing a few years ago, sales of the cannabis-related compound have exploded into a billion-dollar market. CBD's true believers tout one miraculous health claim after the next.</p><p>In light of the wide dissemination of these beliefs, CBD claims deserve careful scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration - and some attention from state regulators, too. Despite its ubiquity, CBD is still largely an unresearched substance in the United States. Exaggerated or unproven claims need to be challenged, and the industry shouldn't be permitted to introduce CBD into food products until the compound is better understood.</p><p>CBD is the nonintoxicating, natural molecule extracted from the cannabis plant. CBD is found in marijuana, of course, but it's also present in hemp, the related plant whose cultivation in the US was legalized by Congress in December.</p><p>Its proven medical uses are confined to a drug the FDA approved last summer to treat two rare forms of pediatric epilepsy. It's the first - and only - medicine derived from cannabis that has been green-lighted by the federal agency.</p><p>Because CBD is already sold as a drug, federal law technically bans its use in food and drink that crosses state lines. \"Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk, as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective,\" Scott Gottlieb, then the FDA commissioner, wrote in a statement when hemp production was legalized.</p><p>But enforcement is largely left to states, where it has been uneven. Earlier this year, New York City health officials banned bakeries and restaurants from selling food and beverages with CBD. Ohio and Maine have also moved proactively.</p><p>In Massachusetts, though, the sale of products containing hemp-derived CBD is still loosely regulated. For instance, the state has not addressed sales of food and drink made with CBD. But it has at least issued guidance for commercial growers and processors of industrial hemp. Among other things, the state Department of Agricultural Resources requires producers to label any product they make for human consumption that contains CBD with a warning stating the product is derived from industrial hemp, that it \"has not been analyzed or approved by the FDA,\" and that it \"has not been tested or approved by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources.\"</p><p>Now, maybe adding CBD to food is safe. And maybe it really can deliver medicinal benefits. But sorting through the safety and efficacy claims requires a more muscular FDA role. Last month, the FDA held a much-awaited hearing on how to regulate CBD consumer products and got an earful on the need for a science-based approach to regulation. \"Currently, states are struggling with the lack of sound scientific research available in CBD and long-term health impacts, including those to children,\" said a Virginia state official. Most medical experts agreed that CBD holds potential medicinal properties, but more clinical trials are needed before allowing the hemp extract to be added to food and drink.</p><p>The hazy legal status of hemp-derived CBD until December, coupled with lack of funding, deterred studies in the past. Now researchers need to determine how different doses affect consumers; how CBD affects children; how it interacts with medical conditions and medications; how it affects pregnant women; whether long-term use carries risks; and if the purported benefits are scientifically verifiable.</p><p>None of which is to say that CBD itself should be banned. Coke is still available, after all; the company just no longer claims that the beverage cures headaches and upset stomach. ...</p><p>Online:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com\">https://www.bostonglobe.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5a5ae7924f7244e8b3a6a0400dcc1835</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB7-1FG1-DY9S-T0S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4197\"/><timeReceived>05:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now that he has announced his retirement from Congress, we urge him to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ryan must be clear: Any attempt by the president to quash the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller is an attack on the rule of law. The House Speaker should throw his support behind legislation to protect Mueller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ryan will leave behind a legacy of honest, thoughtful conservatism - he fought for what he thought was best for his constituents and the country, based on a vision of smaller, less intrusive government and personal freedom. His rise to power in Washington over the past two decades put Wisconsin at the centre of some of our most important political debates.</p><p>But Ryan's decision to leave Congress, while a blow to Wisconsin's political might, could be good for our democracy if Ryan finds his voice.</p><p>The Speaker has consistently defended Mueller. He repeated Wednesday what he has said before, that he doesn't believe President Trump will fire Mueller before the investigation is complete.</p><p>But after an early morning raid on the offices of Trump's personal attorney on Monday, the president erupted in anger. He called it an \"attack on the country,\" saying Mueller's investigators were \"the most biased group of people\" and that \"Many people have said, 'You should fire him.'\"</p><p>Maybe this is just Trump venting. With Trump, a New York real estate tycoon who has associated with fixers and con men his entire adult life, you never know. But with the law closing in, a president already given to rash judgment may act rashly.</p><p>If Trump moves to fire Mueller or his boss at the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, Ryan and his colleagues in Congress must be ready to act.</p><p>And not just with words. They should throw their support behind a bill that would protect the special counsel. Two bills under consideration would give a panel of federal judges the power to review any dismissal of the special counsel and decide whether there was \"good cause\" to fire him.</p><p>During the Watergate crisis, it was Republican leaders in the legislative and judicial branches who stood strong in defence of democracy and the fundamental principle that no person is above the law and certainly not an elected public servant of the people, which is what the president of the United States remains.</p><p>Republican Senator Howard Baker was the one who asked, \"What did the President know and when did he know it?\"</p><p>Republican Judge John Sirica, an Eisenhower appointee, ordered President Nixon to turn over his tapes of White House conversations, which revealed his crimes and ended his presidency.</p><p>It is time now for Republicans to stand up again to defend an investigation of an administration, especially as we've learned more and more about Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Speaker Ryan, if anything is done to interfere with or stop the Mueller investigation before it concludes, you should do everything your power to retain all findings, all records and all investigators through the Legislative Branch.</p><p>Our nation's founders set up three separate branches for exactly this purpose - to help us keep democracy alive. It becomes especially important when one party controls all three branches, as Republicans do today, that our representatives in Congress stand strong to ensure the citizens of our democracy remain in charge.</p><p>We live in a dangerous world, one that requires steady American leadership. A constitutional crisis, prompted by a president eager to cover his tracks, would be like nothing we have seen since Watergate and would severely weaken the nation both at home and abroad.</p><p>Republican leaders in the other two branches stood up in defence of democracy in the 1970s.</p><p>Your time is now, Paul Ryan.</p><p>Stand strong.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jsonline.com\">https://www.jsonline.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 9</p><p>The New York Times on Syria:</p><p>A world grown numb to the slaughter of civilians in Syria has been roused in the last 48 hours by photographs on social media of lifeless men, women and children in the rebel-held town of Douma, many with white foam coming from their mouths and nostrils, victims of chemical weapons. Outraged Western nations blame President Bashar al-Assad's regime and demand retaliation.</p><p>Russia and Iran, Mr. Assad's callous enablers, have denied that he has once again used these horrific weapons on his own people. But Douma is surrounded by Syrian forces, whom experts have blamed for most of the 85 chemical attacks in the country over the past five years. Syria had a major chemical weapons program before pledging to surrender it after chemical attacks in 2013, a commitment it failed to fully honour.</p><p>President Trump took limited military action against Syria after a chemical weapons attack last year, largely ignored the issue after that and then last week surprised his military commanders by announcing plans to soon withdraw 2,000 troops in the fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump vowed on Sunday on Twitter that there would be a \"big price to pay\" for the latest killings, estimated at up to 70 people dead, according to aid groups.</p><p>But the president should know by now that tough talk without a coherent strategy or follow-through is dangerous.</p><p>What to do next in Syria is a crucial test for Mr. Trump, who has shirked America's traditional leadership role. He has tried to seem like a macho leader who would aggressively use American power where President Barack Obama wouldn't, while talking about pulling out of the Middle East and walking away from international commitments.</p><p>With such inconstancy, he will not be able to stop the violence in Syria, and with no clear, unified plan with the Western allies, he will only empower Mr. Assad.</p><p>Mr. Trump needs to work with the other major powers on a broad plan that could force Mr. Assad, Russia and Iran to end the carnage and be held accountable. The United Nations Security Council needs to recommit to the Chemical Weapons Convention's ban on such weapons, authorize experts to verify who was responsible in Douma and create an independent investigation that could lead to prosecution in a tribunal like the International Criminal Court.</p><p>If the Syrian regime's guilt is determined, the United States should impose tough new sanctions, like a freeze on financial assets, as well. If military action is considered, Congress - which has long avoided its constitutional war-making responsibilities - needs to approve it. If a Russian veto prevents Security Council action, then Mr. Trump needs to work with our allies, through NATO or otherwise.</p><p>The timing isn't great - Mr. Trump's newly appointed national security adviser, John Bolton, only showed up for his first day at the White House on Monday, and his secretary of state nominee, Mike Pompeo, hasn't been confirmed - but this work is too important to wait. The use of poison gas, a war crime under international law, has been integral to Mr. Assad's scorched-earth drive to regain control of the last rebel-held areas. As Mr. Trump said on Monday, \"We cannot allow atrocities like that.\"</p><p>Just to reiterate: To have any chance of success, any international retaliatory action must be part of a coherent diplomatic strategy for stabilizing Syria and putting a political settlement in place. Since 2011, more than 500,000 Syrians have been killed and millions of refugees have fled to neighbouring countries and Europe. The conflict has allowed Russia, Iran, Turkey and the Islamic State, now degraded by an American-led coalition, to gain a foothold in Syria.</p><p>During a Security Council briefing on Monday, Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador, lamented that chemical weapons were becoming \"normalized\" and argued \"Russia could stop this senseless slaughter\" in Syria if it chose to.</p><p>\"Only a monster targets civilians and then ensures that there are no ambulances to transfer the wounded. No hospitals to save their lives,\" she said. \"No doctors or medicine to ease their pain.\"</p><p>Ms. Haley called for the appointment of an expert group to investigate the attack, demanded humanitarian access to Douma and warned that if Russia continued to block Security Council action, \"the United States will respond.\"</p><p>After each new atrocity, Mr. Trump and others tend to blame Mr. Obama, because Mr. Obama \"did nothing\" to enforce his red line against chemical weapons after an attack near Damascus in August 2013.</p><p>Mr. Obama forswore military action after that attack in favour of working with Russia to get Syria to destroy its chemical weapons. The resulting agreement deprived Mr. Assad of much of his arsenal, though not all, despite Moscow's promises.</p><p>In those days, Mr. Trump wasn't a fan of military action, either, warning Mr. Obama against it. Once president, though, he made a different choice and, operating under dubious legal authority, sent cruise missiles to strike a Syrian airfield last year after the attack on Khan Sheikhoun.</p><p>But lacking a plan to keep up the pressure, his one-off military operation failed to deter Mr. Assad from using chemical weapons; there have been at least seven other attacks this year. Now, the military option is back on the table.</p><p>Mr. Assad, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Iran's leaders came to believe that they could do what they wanted in Syria; Mr. Trump reinforced that when he called for the early withdrawal of the 2,000 troops there.</p><p>He further reinforced a sense of impunity every time he exempted Mr. Putin from direct criticism for Russia's reprehensible behaviour. So it was significant that Mr. Trump finally drew a line, saying in a tweet, \"President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad.\"</p><p>The question is what comes next.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 6</p><p>The Denver Post on a hedge fund's management of the newspaper and other media properties:</p><p>At The Denver Post on Monday, more than two dozen reporters, editors, photographers, videographers, page designers, digital producers and opinion staff will walk out the door. Our marching orders are to cut a full 30 by the start of July.</p><p>These heartbreaking instructions raise the question: Does this cut, which follows so many in recent years that our ranks have shriveled from more than 250 to fewer than 100 today, represent the beginning of the end for the Voice of the Rocky Mountain Empire?</p><p>The cuts, backed by our owner, the New York City hedge fund Alden Global Capital, also are a mystery, if you look at them from the point of view of those of us intent on running a serious news operation befitting the city that bears our name. Media experts locally and nationally question why our future looks so bleak, as many newspapers still enjoy double-digit profits and our management reported solid profits as recently as last year.</p><p>We call for action. Consider this editorial and this Sunday's Perspective offerings a plea to Alden - owner of Digital First Media, one of the largest newspaper chains in the country - to rethink its business strategy across all its newspaper holdings. Consider this also a signal to our community and civic leaders that they ought to demand better. Denver deserves a newspaper owner who supports its newsroom. If Alden isn't willing to do good journalism here, it should sell The Post to owners who will.</p><p>A flagship local newspaper like The Post plays a critically important role in its city and state: It provides a public record of the good and the bad, serves as a watchdog against public and private corruption, offers a free marketplace of ideas and stands as a lighthouse reflective and protective of - and accountable to - a community's values and goals. A news organization like ours ought to be seen, especially by our owner, as a necessary public institution vital to the very maintenance of our grand democratic experiment.</p><p>Yes, for years now, large media chains have struggled to responsibly downsize newsrooms. But some have done so less responsibly than others.</p><p>Here in Colorado, Alden has embarked on a cynical strategy of constantly reducing the amount and quality of its offerings, while steadily increasing its subscription rates. In doing so, the hedge fund managers - often tellingly referred to as \"vulture capitalists\" - have hidden behind a narrative that adequately staffed newsrooms and newspapers can no longer survive in the digital marketplace. Try to square that with a recent lawsuit filed by one of Digital First Media's minority shareholders that claims Alden has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars of its newspaper profits into shaky investments completely unrelated to the business of gathering news.</p><p>Coloradans feel the insanity of it in their bones. And what a sad history.</p><p>In 2009, the large chain that owned the Rocky Mountain News closed that storied paper's doors. In 2010, Alden bought the chain of papers that features The Denver Post. The hedge fund gained a talented team of journalists reporting from all over the state, the nation and some of the biggest hotspots in the world, a winner of numerous Pulitzer Prizes, including newsroom-wide awards for its coverage of the massacres at Columbine and, more recently, a theatre in Aurora.</p><p>Since Alden took control, the decline of local news has been as obvious as it's been precipitous. The editor who oversaw coverage of the Aurora theatre shooting, Gregory L. Moore, decamped in 2016, unable to endure the new fund's directives any longer.</p><p>This year began with The Post recovering from more bloodshed as it packed up to leave its namesake city, its journalists clinging to the hope that a newly launched initiative to charge for online content would improve its fortunes. Before journalists were even in their new headquarters, our publisher and former editorial board member, Mac Tully, resigned.</p><p>Still more reductions came, and they did so as fast and as chilling as a high-desert storm.</p><p>The cuts come despite constant adaptation and innovation within our organization that grew our online reach exponentially.</p><p>This in a city that has seen more than 100,000 newcomers since Alden took control, and in a country where other cities Denver's size and smaller enjoy larger newsrooms and papers. (The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's newsroom, for example, has upwards of 170 managers and staff.)</p><p>This in a state and region thrumming with energy and enthusiasm for its future.</p><p>This in a market filled with hyper-educated citizens ready and able to afford great journalism should it be offered them.</p><p>The inevitable result is that the reduction in quality leads to a reduction of trust. So when errant politicians and public figures push back against even the most credible of reports, they find a fertile environment for doubt.</p><p>Yes, other media chains and operations haven't been spared the same market realities Alden faces. The transition from print to digital publication is a challenging one.</p><p>Another factor: Critics on both sides of America's ever-widening political divide heap blame for the loss of readership on claims - too many of them credible - that newsrooms have lost sight of their responsibility to be truly objective. Such criticisms help fuel spectacularly successful social media companies, which also reap profits from links to traditional newsroom offerings.</p><p>Another regrettable result of the fracturing of newsrooms has been the rush by political interests to lavish investments in echo-chamber outlets that merely seek to report from biased perspectives, leaving the hollowed-out shells of newsrooms loyal to traditional journalistic values to find their voice in the maelstrom.</p><p>Still we take the moment to acknowledge fundamental truths. When newsroom owners view profits as the only goal, quality, reliability and accountability suffer. Their very mission is compromised. The course correction that needs to come for the benefit of communities across the land depends on owners committed to serving their readers and viewers and users.</p><p>We get it that things change. We get it that our feelings are raw and no doubt colour our judgment. But we've been quiet too long.</p><p>We believe without question that if community leaders and our readers care about our mission, and what our newsroom ought to be instead of this shadow of what it once was, it's time for their voices to be heard.</p><p>The smart money is that in a few years The Denver Post will be rotting bones. And a major city in an important political region will find itself without a newspaper.</p><p>It's time for those Coloradans who care most about their civic future to get involved and see to it that Denver gets the newsroom it deserves.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.denverpost.com\">https://www.denverpost.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 6</p><p>The Tennessean calls for the release of journalist Manuel Duran, who was detained while covering Memphis protests and now faces deportation:</p><p>Journalist Manuel Duran was arrested for doing his job: For exercising his First Amendment rights.</p><p>He now he faces deportation from the United States.</p><p>The 42-year-old Salvadoran immigrant was live-streaming demonstrators in Memphis protesting immigration detention and enforcement policies on Tuesday when he was wrongfully detained.</p><p>Duran's status as an undocumented immigrant complicated his release from Shelby County jail, but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges.</p><p>Unfortunately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were waiting in court to seize him.</p><p>He will likely be booted out of what has become his home unless ICE releases him. The federal agency should free him because Duran should never have been arrested.</p><p>It is a difficult case, exposing a broken immigration system that makes it hard for undocumented residents who want to contribute to their communities but cannot earn their legal status.</p><p>There are 11 million people in this nation who are living in the shadows because of their legal status.</p><p>Not Duran. He has been a voice for his community and has documented the good and the bad.</p><p>He started in Memphis in 2008 on La Voz 1240 radio, where he was co-anchor of a morning radio show and a newscaster on \"Minuto 60.\"</p><p>He was news director and co-anchor at Ambiente 1030 radio station until 2017. Now, he owns Memphis Noticias, a local news source for the Latino community.</p><p>He has interviewed local officials such as Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell.</p><p>He also has been at risk for deportation for some time.</p><p>An ICE spokesman said an immigration judge ordered Duran be deported in 2007 for failing to make a scheduled court date. That was 11 years ago, during the George W. Bush presidency.</p><p>The Trump Administration has begun a purge of undocumented men, women and children - some who have lived peacefully for decades in America. That includes Thursday's raid of a meatpacking plant in Grainger County, where ICE held 86 people to check their immigration status. Of those, 54 were detained for further immigration proceedings.</p><p>They have worked at jobs - not stolen them - and they have also paid taxes without receiving benefits like Medicare or Social Security.</p><p>There should be a solution to fix the system and allow immigrants like Duran a path to experience and enjoy the American Dream and contribute to the nation's success.</p><p>Congress has failed numerous times over the years to do so. This year, shamefully, Congress abandoned an effort to provide a permanent solution to recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that President Trump ended. Without a solution, 800,000 people - including 9,300 Tennesseans - who are working or going to school will be at risk of being deported.</p><p>Regarding Duran, the Constitution does not distinguish between citizens and non-citizens when it comes to exercising First Amendment freedoms.</p><p>He was exercising the right of freedom of the press to hold government accountable, and he was wrongfully punished for it.</p><p>Journalists like Duran should not be arrested for doing their jobs. ICE should free him so he can continue fearlessly reporting on his community.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tennessean.com\">https://www.tennessean.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 11</p><p>The Orange County Register on the DACA impasse:</p><p>While President Trump blames the failure of any emergent DACA fix on the Democrats, a closer look reveals a more complicated situation.</p><p>Last September, Trump issued an executive order giving Congress six months to come up with a permanent, legislative solution to the situation of the up to 2 million young people who qualified for deferred deportations under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p><p>Trump's reasoning for this was sound. The program, which shielded young people who entered the country illegally before the age of 16 and have lived in the U.S. continuously since June 15, 2007, among other qualifications, offered only temporary protections and was created by highly questionable executive fiat.</p><p>A March 5 deadline for the expiration of DACA as a result of Trump's rescission of Obama's order has since been rendered moot as a result of legal challenges by defenders of the program, and at least in theory gives Congress more time to actually come up with a fix.</p><p>Unfortunately, efforts to legislatively resolve the issue have consistently fallen short, despite widespread bipartisan agreement that it makes little sense for the United States to deport millions of young people raised, educated and integrated in the United States.</p><p>\"They really let them down,\" Trump said April 2. \"They had this great opportunity. The Democrats have really let them down. It's a shame. And now people are taking advantage of DACA and that's a shame.\"</p><p>To his credit, there seems to be a kernel of truth in Trump's version of events. Congressional Democrats have repeatedly threatened to hold up government spending bills if a DACA fix wasn't included, yet they've inevitably and even predictably folded every time.</p><p>Senate Democrats also didn't vote for the White House's preferred DACA fix in February.</p><p>The bill, backed by President Trump and introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, offered a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million young people brought to the United States illegally as minors. In exchange, the bill called for an end to the diversity visa lottery program and restrictions on so-called chain migration.</p><p>However, a lot of Republicans didn't vote for that bill either. The bill only mustered 39 votes in support with 60 opposed.</p><p>Trump's insistence on an unpopular border wall and adding unrelated legal immigration restrictions into the discussion have done far more to prevent a DACA fix than an unwillingness on the part of congressional Democrats to compromise. We know this because Democrats did join Republicans in voting for two compromise bills to trade a DACA fix in exchange for additional border security measures.</p><p>The proposal that got closest - a plan put forward by the Common Sense Caucus to provide $25 billion in border security funding and prevent DACA recipients from sponsoring their parents for legal status - received the support of most Democrats and eight Republicans, in total receiving 54 votes in favour, 45 against.</p><p>For Trump to put the blame on the Democrats for the failure of a DACA fix might be red meat for his staunchest supporters to cover for his failure to get anything meaningful done on immigration, but it's an incomplete narrative at best.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ocregister.com\">https://www.ocregister.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>April 11</p><p>The Evening Standard (London) on tech and politics:</p><p>Big tech met big politics yesterday - and came off best.</p><p>Swapping his usual grey T-shirt for a sober suit and tidy blue tie, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg spent five hours giving evidence to the US Congress about the data scandal that has hit his business.</p><p>Even for a billionaire it was an intimidating event. But as he spoke, his company's share price climbed and that more than anything else revealed the final score.</p><p>Senators tried to put him under pressure. Some of their questions were good ones; others were not.</p><p>It would be easy to mock the senator who asked how Facebook made money - apparently unaware of its vast revenues from advertising and data.</p><p>But mockery would be the wrong response.</p><p>Governments, courts and parliaments all over the world are struggling to respond to the vast and rapid changes to politics, society and economics being brought by businesses such as Facebook.</p><p>Would British MPs have asked better questions than the senators? No.</p><p>Do they have the knowledge and the tools to respond to the power of social media? No.</p><p>Do our regulators or our courts? No.</p><p>Digital technology is no longer just one industry among many others: it is a fundamental dynamic in almost every part of modern life and its power is only going to become greater.</p><p>The established ways of business, politics and Government can no longer deal with this adequately - as everything from the influence of fake social media in the US presidential election to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, to the epidemic of gang violence on London's streets shows.</p><p>So the big question we should all be asking is: what needs to change? And how do we make it happen?</p><p>The wrong response would be to fear technology or to try to contain its impact.</p><p>It is improving lives fundamentally but our governments, parliaments and courts need to make a systematic attempt to understand its consequences so they can better regulate it, support it and improve it.</p><p>As Congress has just found out, ignorance isn't bliss.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk\">https://www.standard.co.uk</url>/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ff589014f09a47fda135a78a4125f15a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S35-GGS1-DY9S-T4FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4247\"/><timeReceived>02:37 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Fred Guttenberg's act of rebellion came from the heart, a heart in pain, a heart irrevocably broken.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it seemed particularly heartless for him to be removed from the balcony gallery by security of after he shouted out in the name of his slain daughter when Trump failed to address any attempt on his part to confront gun violence in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Guttenberg's daughter Jaime was killed in the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland. Pelosi had invited him to attend the State of Union speech.</p><p>The pain of Jaime's death has turned Guttenberg into a well-known gun control activist. He keeps his daughter's name alive by reminding us how senselessly she died in our own backyard.</p><p>Who can blame him. He speaks for the millions of Americans who have been affected by gun violence.</p><p>Tuesday, as Trump finished saying, \"So long as I am president, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\" Republicans began to cheer. Guttenberg, sitting with the South Florida delegation, likely fumed at the president's total dismissal of America's gun-violence problem.</p><p>As the cheers quieted, Guttenberg could be briefly heard in the chamber saying: \"victims of gun violence like my daughter . . .\"</p><p>Security came and took Guttenberg away as the shocked South Florida delegation sitting around him watched him be led off.</p><p>As the commotion to remove Guttenberg played out, Pelosi can be seen looking in his direction.</p><p>By the end of Trump's address, Pelosi, who had apparently had enough, dramatically ripped up her copy of the speech, later telling reporters that it was \"the courteous thing to do given the alternatives.\"</p><p>Trump had refused to shake Pelosi's hand earlier, she who, after all, initiated impeachment proceedings against him.</p><p>Obviously, tensions were raging like a teenager's hormones all evening.</p><p>A contrite Guttenberg apologized on Twitter early Wednesday:</p><p>\"I disrupted the State Of the Union and was detained because I let my emotions get the best of me. I simply want to be able to deal with the reality of gun violence and not have to listen to the lies about the 2A as happened tonight.</p><p>\"I should not have yelled out. I am thankful for the overwhelming support that I am receiving. However, I do owe my family and friends an apology. I have tried to conduct myself with dignity throughout this process and I will do better as I pursue gun safety.\"</p><p>Guttenberg was immediately comforted by followers who assured him:</p><p>\"No apology needed.\"</p><p>Except maybe one from the White House.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.miamiherald.com\">https://www.miamiherald.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The Minnesota Star Tribune on Trump's State of the Union address:</p><p>Amid an impeachment effort meant to remove him from office and a re-election campaign meant to return him, President Donald Trump gave his third State of the Union Address Tuesday night.</p><p>The extraordinary circumstances were apparent in the setting. Over his left shoulder sat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who resisted impeachment until allegations demanded Congress do its constitutional duty. In front of him was his right flank: Republican lawmakers defending the president, including a House minority that voted unanimously not to impeach him, and a Senate majority expected to quickly acquit the president on Wednesday.</p><p>It was a night that laid bare the nation's deep partisan divide, with Trump not shaking Pelosi's hand and the speaker ending the evening by ripping up her copy of the address.</p><p>And it was hardly the combination of ingredients for the compromise, or even comity, that's needed for bipartisan action on key issues that are too pressing to await a presidential campaign, including work on lowering health care costs.</p><p>Like presidents preceding him, Trump appropriately declared the state of the union \"stronger than ever before\" - at least economically, if not politically. In particular, the record-low unemployment rate, especially for communities of color, is an accomplishment all should laud and look to build upon.</p><p>But in a speech touted by the White House as \"the great American comeback,\" the president overstated the strength of the ongoing recovery and ignored the cost of the country's relatively tepid economic growth. Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office reported that 2019 GDP growth was 2.3%, its slowest since 2016 in an era Trump described in his inaugural address as \"American carnage.\"</p><p>More troubling, the CBO reported that the annual budget deficit soared past $1 trillion, a figure that will increase to an average $1.3 trillion per year from 2021 to 2030. The Republican tax cut was a major contributor, and Trump is campaigning on a promise of even more cuts with no clear strategy for covering the lost revenue.</p><p>Alacrity over the deficit and other threats to America's security, like climate change, should create bipartisan consensus, not the gridlock gripping Washington. But the president, who has called global warming a \"hoax,\" ignored it in his address just as he has in his administration. And while Trump is correct that the country must not take a \"socialist\" turn, capitalism's enduring scourge of increasing inequality threatens the nation's social fabric.</p><p>Rather than offering a vision for immigration reform that could fuel future economic growth, Trump continued to paint those not born in this country as a threat. Instead of searching for common ground on the Second Amendment, the president ignored the scourge of gun violence.</p><p>Security threats from nation-states and stateless actors alike are omnipresent, too, and while the commander in chief correctly credited the unrivaled U.S. armed forces, the soft power of diplomacy and alliances are more important than ever - something the president should prioritize even if he gave the issue short shrift in his speech.</p><p>Even beyond the military and economic might and rich alliances, America's greatest advantage is its system of governance, which when done right is still an idea and ideal for the world - a truth Trump and Congress must ensure. Otherwise, the great American comeback is just a slogan, not a reality.</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The Wall Street Journal on the Iowa Democratic caucuses:</p><p>There's no shortage of mordant fun to be had at the expense of the Democratic National Committee and Iowa Democratic Party after the fiasco of the inaugural 2020 presidential contest, which has yet to yield definitive results apparently as a result of coding errors in a tabulation app created by party insiders. The college of cardinals at least lets the world know with white or black smoke how the vote for pope is going.</p><p>Here the party that waxes sanctimonious about election security couldn't secure its own election from itself. Here the party that has spent three years questioning the legitimacy of the 2016 election will see the legitimacy of its own custom-designed process questioned. Here the party that promises technocratic management of American health care, energy and finance proved less able to tally votes even than the ancient Athenians.</p><p>Yet the incompetence and hypocrisy will have real consequences. The first and most important could be a boost for Bernie Sanders, who may be able to claim the mantle of both victor and underdog at the same time. By all accounts the Vermont socialist performed well, with he and Pete Buttigieg leading based on partial results that the party finally released late Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Yet many of Mr. Sanders's supporters will believe the technological snafu denied their candidate a clear-cut victory. They believe the party establishment is trying to block their candidate, who until this campaign wasn't officially a member of the party that botched the caucuses. Even if results do finally vindicate Mr. Sanders, those who underperformed (most significantly, Joe Biden based on Tuesday's partial results) are already trying to dismiss their significance.</p><p>One irony is that while Mr. Sanders can capitalize on anger at the Democratic establishment, that very anger may have contributed to the mess. Mr. Sanders's supporters cried foul after Hillary Clinton beat their candidate in 2016 and demanded rules to make the caucuses more \"transparent.\"</p><p>Unlike in previous years, Iowa caucus sites this year had to report two counts-a \"first alignment,\" which reflects how many people had each candidate as a first choice, and a \"second alignment,\" reflecting the results after supporters of candidates below the 15% threshold moved to their second choice. This may have made tallying more difficult and would have added complexity and muddied the result even if it weren't for the technical failure.</p><p>This is a reminder that changing electoral systems to satisfy populist demands should be done with care, because the unintended consequences can further undermine their legitimacy. Democrats have been griping about how Iowa is insufficiently diverse to hold the first presidential contest, and this may be the last time the state goes first. But let's hope whatever comes next is geared toward producing strong candidates and reliable outcomes and not merely satisfying the demands of partisan opportunists.</p><p>On that front, we wonder if any of the Democrats who feel as if they wasted months and hundreds of millions of dollars in Iowa are having second thoughts about calls to eliminate the Electoral College. As journalist Dan McLaughlin notes, such state-level failures highlight the perils of a nationwide system for popular vote counting. At least here the failure is contained, and let's hope it can be rectified without calling the entire presidential nominating contest into question.</p><p>The delayed results in Iowa are a reminder of other potential features of the 2020 election that could create controversy and damage its legitimacy. Recall that in California in November 2018, several Republican Congressional candidates were well ahead based on the Election Day tallies, only to see the results reversed in the following days and in some cases more than a week later as absentee ballots trickled in.</p><p>We have argued that California's lax election rules that allow \"ballot harvesting\" by party activists will also lead to political mischief. But even if they don't, tallying delays discourage the swift acceptance of outcomes that well-functioning democracies need.</p><p>In 2018 the California rules seemed to hurt the GOP, but if the state's March primary is closely contested, then Democratic candidates could feel the sting. Meantime, if Mr. Biden's performance was as weak as partial results showed, then perhaps Michael Bloomberg, who sat out Iowa and is spending big elsewhere, becomes the party's best bulwark against a socialist takeover. That's unlikely to calm the passions of Mr. Sanders's supporters or make the 2020 contest any less heated. Buckle up.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The New York Times on the Trump administration adding six more countries to the travel restriction list:</p><p>On Friday, with Americans focused on President Trump's impeachment trial, the coronavirus and the upcoming Iowa caucuses, the Trump administration announced it was adding six more countries to the list of those whose citizens face travel restrictions to the United States. The given reason was that those nations were not sufficiently screening people who sought to come to America.</p><p>The six countries affected when the travel ban takes effect on Feb. 22 are Sudan, Tanzania, Eritrea, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria. All have sizable, if not majority, Muslim populations - in Myanmar's case, Muslims are a minority that is severely repressed. According to the acting secretary of homeland security, Chad Wolf, these countries fell short in new vetting criteria for \"terrorists and criminals attempting to enter the United States.\"</p><p>The restrictions differ - Sudan and Tanzania are barred from the \"diversity visa\" lottery, while the other countries face a suspension of entry for immigrants. Travel for tourism and reasons other than immigration remains open - a curious gap if the purpose of the restrictions is to keep out potential terrorists.</p><p>It may be that the countries do somehow fall short in vetting would-be emigrants. And since the conservative-controlled Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump's ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad (later removed from the list) - as well as Venezuela and North Korea in June 2018, the new ban would most likely survive legal challenge. But it doesn't take a lot of intuition to guess that security is not foremost on the president's mind.</p><p>Blocking the immigration of people of color, Muslims or non-English speakers has been among the most frequent of Mr. Trump's pitches to his base, and the timing for a new ban was propitious. It was the third anniversary of his first travel ban, the impeachment drama was sputtering to an end and the starting gun for the 2020 election season was about to go off in Iowa (or, as it happened, to pathetically misfire). With all the Democratic candidates opposed to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, what better time to remind his followers that Mr. Trump was still standing guard at the gates?</p><p>Yet the latest ban makes as little sense as the first one, and it stands to do far more harm than good. A 2018 study by the libertarian Cato Institute found that the Trump administration's \"extreme vetting\" of travelers and immigrants, of which the travel ban is a centerpiece, would not significantly reduce the already minuscule risk of imported terrorism achieved by visa reforms after 9/11, but would come at exponentially greater cost. The risk of any American being killed in the United States by a refugee or immigrant is negligible, Cato found.</p><p>Apart from the cruelty of barring thousands of family reunifications, the new restrictions could actually hurt the American economy. The ban is certain to strain relations with the newly listed countries. Five of them, including Nigeria, which has Africa's largest economy, are being avidly courted by China as part of its \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" and could well conclude that China is a more trustworthy and predictable partner than the United States.</p><p>Adding ignorance to insult, Mr. Trump has consistently misrepresented the diversity lottery program, from which he is now excluding Sudan and Tanzania, as a means for poor countries to dump people they don't want on the United States. In fact, the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program is administered by the State Department to increase immigration from countries with low rates of immigration, and candidates must have at least the equivalent of a high school diploma or two years of work experience to qualify.</p><p>The veneer of process and rationale over the latest travel ban cannot conceal its fundamental malice.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 2</p><p>The Valdosta Daily Times on the observation of Black History Month:</p><p>Black History Month has a history of its own.</p><p>The commemorative month was founded more than 100 years.</p><p>In 1915, 50 years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation which abolished slavery in America, Black History Month was created as a way to acknowledge black Americans.</p><p>Attempting to recognize all African Americans who achieved greatness in their field is impossible.</p><p>The contributions of black Americans is as broad, as vast and as diverse as the nation.</p><p>Some people still like to deride the need for a Black History Month. Why don't we have a White History Month, they ask?</p><p>History books and curriculum have largely been written by white people, and thus reflect a homogeneous perspective that has excluded the contributions of blacks, women and other minorities. Arguably, every month is White History Month.</p><p>Still, eventually, our country might reach the point we no longer need to call attention to the achievements of any specific race or ethnic group.</p><p>But we're not there yet.</p><p>For the fourth year, the newspaper's SunLight Project team interviewed several community leaders and residents to discuss the importance of the civil rights movement, current race relations and other aspects that could easily fit into the character of Black History Month.</p><p>And while the stories are shared during the month, readers will hopefully realize an overriding truth.</p><p>These are not black stories.</p><p>They are the stories of our neighbors and friends.</p><p>They are American stories.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valdostadailytimes.com\">https://www.valdostadailytimes.com</url></p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 1</p><p>The London Evening Standard on the United Kingdom leaving the European Union:</p><p>Today, as the 11th hour approaches, there will be no street parties or pealing of bells in celebration, nor are there angry demonstrations and defiant protests of outrage. The exhausted nation is hardly aware that, after all the acrimony, the moment of departure is upon us. Brexit is done.</p><p>The best the governing party can manage to mark the event that has consumed all its political energies, and dispatched two of its leaders, is a commemorative mug and tea towel. Why? Because whatever side you have taken in the debate that has cleaved our society in half, today represents a failure.</p><p>For the Remainers the defeat is absolute. We can lament the mistaken decision to call a referendum, and the lacklustre, unemotional campaign. We can rue the errors that followed, as overly-moderate Tory rebels pitched their fight on the method rather than the substance of our departure; while the extremist Labour leadership and naive Liberal Democrats proved unwitting handmaidens to our exit and their own destruction.</p><p>But the facts are these: after half a century of membership, appeals in the 2016 referendum to a common European identity fell on millions of deaf ears; and after three years of economic stagnation since, and transparent evidence that the promises of Brexit were false, the voters reaffirmed their decision in a second vote in the election last month. So the truth must be faced by all who wanted Britain to remain in the EU, including the Evening Standard: we did not convince our fellow citizens.</p><p>If the failure of pro-Europeans is obvious, why are the celebrations of Brexiteers so muted? In part, because they too know they have not convinced the nation.</p><p>Britain walks through the exit door with a feeling of melancholic resignation rather than excitement about the future. The nation knows it has chosen the poorer path - the estimates produced by the Bank of England yesterday show an economy barely growing, with a trend rate not seen since the Seventies.</p><p>The country also knows it has greatly diminished its voice in the world - already our views on everything from climate goals to the taxation of big tech matter far less.</p><p>The more thoughtful leaders of the Brexit campaign know too that they prevailed by harnessing a nativist opposition to change and a resentment at the success of others in parts of the country, outside the cities of the North and South, that felt left behind.</p><p>They talk of levelling up, but they won on the argument of levelling down: if you can't enjoy the fruits of globalisation, then nor should anyone else. No one beyond the offices of a few deluded hedge funds in Mayfair believes Brexit was a vote for less red tape and more free trade.</p><p>The party that now represents Sedgefield and Blyth Valley champions more government intervention, higher spending and extra regulation. Yesterday, the Conservatives were trumpeting their re-nationalisation of the Northern railways, the kind of state involvement in the economy that we joined the EU to get away from. \"Global Britain\" may be the slogan, but neither the globe nor Britain believe a word of it.</p><p>So what lies ahead?</p><p>Ignore those who say that Brexit isn't done. It is. Yes, there's a trade agreement to be negotiated - and the details matter a lot to businesses - but it's a much less important decision than the existential one we've just taken about whether we are members of the EU.</p><p>There will be an argument about \"divergence\" - but the truth is that, in most areas, global standard-setting and the European markets will force us to be a taker of the rules we have until today participated in making. That's why the hard Brexit on paper will feel much softer in practice.</p><p>Even the hour of our departure - midnight Central European Time - is set by others.</p><p>It will take time for this loss of control to become apparent - but when it does, the same questions that faced Britain 50 years ago will confront us now: how do we exert our influence in the world? How do we sustain support for the free markets and the open society?</p><p>US Secretary of State Dean Acheson famously said of post-war Britain that we had lost an empire but not yet found a role.</p><p>Back in 1972, we thought we had by joining the European community. In 2020, as we leave, it's time to come together - because we still haven't found what we're looking for.</p><p>Online: <url

Fred Guttenberg's act of rebellion came from the heart, a heart in pain, a heart irrevocably broken.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it seemed particularly heartless for him to be removed from the balcony gallery by security of after he shouted out in the name of his slain daughter when Trump failed to address any attempt on his part to confront gun violence in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Guttenberg's daughter Jaime was killed in the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland. Pelosi had invited him to attend the State of Union speech.</p><p>The pain of Jaime's death has turned Guttenberg into a well-known gun control activist. He keeps his daughter's name alive by reminding us how senselessly she died in our own backyard.</p><p>Who can blame him. He speaks for the millions of Americans who have been affected by gun violence.</p><p>Tuesday, as Trump finished saying, \"So long as I am president, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\" Republicans began to cheer. Guttenberg, sitting with the South Florida delegation, likely fumed at the president's total dismissal of America's gun-violence problem.</p><p>As the cheers quieted, Guttenberg could be briefly heard in the chamber saying: \"victims of gun violence like my daughter . . .\"</p><p>Security came and took Guttenberg away as the shocked South Florida delegation sitting around him watched him be led off.</p><p>As the commotion to remove Guttenberg played out, Pelosi can be seen looking in his direction.</p><p>By the end of Trump's address, Pelosi, who had apparently had enough, dramatically ripped up her copy of the speech, later telling reporters that it was \"the courteous thing to do given the alternatives.\"</p><p>Trump had refused to shake Pelosi's hand earlier, she who, after all, initiated impeachment proceedings against him.</p><p>Obviously, tensions were raging like a teenager's hormones all evening.</p><p>A contrite Guttenberg apologized on Twitter early Wednesday:</p><p>\"I disrupted the State Of the Union and was detained because I let my emotions get the best of me. I simply want to be able to deal with the reality of gun violence and not have to listen to the lies about the 2A as happened tonight.</p><p>\"I should not have yelled out. I am thankful for the overwhelming support that I am receiving. However, I do owe my family and friends an apology. I have tried to conduct myself with dignity throughout this process and I will do better as I pursue gun safety.\"</p><p>Guttenberg was immediately comforted by followers who assured him:</p><p>\"No apology needed.\"</p><p>Except maybe one from the White House.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.miamiherald.com\">https://www.miamiherald.com</url>/</p><p>---</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The Minnesota Star Tribune on Trump's State of the Union address:</p><p>Amid an impeachment effort meant to remove him from office and a re-election campaign meant to return him, President Donald Trump gave his third State of the Union Address Tuesday night.</p><p>The extraordinary circumstances were apparent in the setting. Over his left shoulder sat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who resisted impeachment until allegations demanded Congress do its constitutional duty. In front of him was his right flank: Republican lawmakers defending the president, including a House minority that voted unanimously not to impeach him, and a Senate majority expected to quickly acquit the president on Wednesday.</p><p>It was a night that laid bare the nation's deep partisan divide, with Trump not shaking Pelosi's hand and the speaker ending the evening by ripping up her copy of the address.</p><p>And it was hardly the combination of ingredients for the compromise, or even comity, that's needed for bipartisan action on key issues that are too pressing to await a presidential campaign, including work on lowering health care costs.</p><p>Like presidents preceding him, Trump appropriately declared the state of the union \"stronger than ever before\" - at least economically, if not politically. In particular, the record-low unemployment rate, especially for communities of color, is an accomplishment all should laud and look to build upon.</p><p>But in a speech touted by the White House as \"the great American comeback,\" the president overstated the strength of the ongoing recovery and ignored the cost of the country's relatively tepid economic growth. Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office reported that 2019 GDP growth was 2.3%, its slowest since 2016 in an era Trump described in his inaugural address as \"American carnage.\"</p><p>More troubling, the CBO reported that the annual budget deficit soared past $1 trillion, a figure that will increase to an average $1.3 trillion per year from 2021 to 2030. The Republican tax cut was a major contributor, and Trump is campaigning on a promise of even more cuts with no clear strategy for covering the lost revenue.</p><p>Alacrity over the deficit and other threats to America's security, like climate change, should create bipartisan consensus, not the gridlock gripping Washington. But the president, who has called global warming a \"hoax,\" ignored it in his address just as he has in his administration. And while Trump is correct that the country must not take a \"socialist\" turn, capitalism's enduring scourge of increasing inequality threatens the nation's social fabric.</p><p>Rather than offering a vision for immigration reform that could fuel future economic growth, Trump continued to paint those not born in this country as a threat. Instead of searching for common ground on the Second Amendment, the president ignored the scourge of gun violence.</p><p>Security threats from nation-states and stateless actors alike are omnipresent, too, and while the commander in chief correctly credited the unrivaled U.S. armed forces, the soft power of diplomacy and alliances are more important than ever - something the president should prioritize even if he gave the issue short shrift in his speech.</p><p>Even beyond the military and economic might and rich alliances, America's greatest advantage is its system of governance, which when done right is still an idea and ideal for the world - a truth Trump and Congress must ensure. Otherwise, the great American comeback is just a slogan, not a reality.</p><p>---</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The Wall Street Journal on the Iowa Democratic caucuses:</p><p>There's no shortage of mordant fun to be had at the expense of the Democratic National Committee and Iowa Democratic Party after the fiasco of the inaugural 2020 presidential contest, which has yet to yield definitive results apparently as a result of coding errors in a tabulation app created by party insiders. The college of cardinals at least lets the world know with white or black smoke how the vote for pope is going.</p><p>Here the party that waxes sanctimonious about election security couldn't secure its own election from itself. Here the party that has spent three years questioning the legitimacy of the 2016 election will see the legitimacy of its own custom-designed process questioned. Here the party that promises technocratic management of American health care, energy and finance proved less able to tally votes even than the ancient Athenians.</p><p>Yet the incompetence and hypocrisy will have real consequences. The first and most important could be a boost for Bernie Sanders, who may be able to claim the mantle of both victor and underdog at the same time. By all accounts the Vermont socialist performed well, with he and Pete Buttigieg leading based on partial results that the party finally released late Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Yet many of Mr. Sanders's supporters will believe the technological snafu denied their candidate a clear-cut victory. They believe the party establishment is trying to block their candidate, who until this campaign wasn't officially a member of the party that botched the caucuses. Even if results do finally vindicate Mr. Sanders, those who underperformed (most significantly, Joe Biden based on Tuesday's partial results) are already trying to dismiss their significance.</p><p>One irony is that while Mr. Sanders can capitalize on anger at the Democratic establishment, that very anger may have contributed to the mess. Mr. Sanders's supporters cried foul after Hillary Clinton beat their candidate in 2016 and demanded rules to make the caucuses more \"transparent.\"</p><p>Unlike in previous years, Iowa caucus sites this year had to report two counts-a \"first alignment,\" which reflects how many people had each candidate as a first choice, and a \"second alignment,\" reflecting the results after supporters of candidates below the 15% threshold moved to their second choice. This may have made tallying more difficult and would have added complexity and muddied the result even if it weren't for the technical failure.</p><p>This is a reminder that changing electoral systems to satisfy populist demands should be done with care, because the unintended consequences can further undermine their legitimacy. Democrats have been griping about how Iowa is insufficiently diverse to hold the first presidential contest, and this may be the last time the state goes first. But let's hope whatever comes next is geared toward producing strong candidates and reliable outcomes and not merely satisfying the demands of partisan opportunists.</p><p>On that front, we wonder if any of the Democrats who feel as if they wasted months and hundreds of millions of dollars in Iowa are having second thoughts about calls to eliminate the Electoral College. As journalist Dan McLaughlin notes, such state-level failures highlight the perils of a nationwide system for popular vote counting. At least here the failure is contained, and let's hope it can be rectified without calling the entire presidential nominating contest into question.</p><p>The delayed results in Iowa are a reminder of other potential features of the 2020 election that could create controversy and damage its legitimacy. Recall that in California in November 2018, several Republican Congressional candidates were well ahead based on the Election Day tallies, only to see the results reversed in the following days and in some cases more than a week later as absentee ballots trickled in.</p><p>We have argued that California's lax election rules that allow \"ballot harvesting\" by party activists will also lead to political mischief. But even if they don't, tallying delays discourage the swift acceptance of outcomes that well-functioning democracies need.</p><p>In 2018 the California rules seemed to hurt the GOP, but if the state's March primary is closely contested, then Democratic candidates could feel the sting. Meantime, if Mr. Biden's performance was as weak as partial results showed, then perhaps Michael Bloomberg, who sat out Iowa and is spending big elsewhere, becomes the party's best bulwark against a socialist takeover. That's unlikely to calm the passions of Mr. Sanders's supporters or make the 2020 contest any less heated. Buckle up.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url>/</p><p>---</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The New York Times on the Trump administration adding six more countries to the travel restriction list:</p><p>On Friday, with Americans focused on President Trump's impeachment trial, the coronavirus and the upcoming Iowa caucuses, the Trump administration announced it was adding six more countries to the list of those whose citizens face travel restrictions to the United States. The given reason was that those nations were not sufficiently screening people who sought to come to America.</p><p>The six countries affected when the travel ban takes effect on Feb. 22 are Sudan, Tanzania, Eritrea, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria. All have sizable, if not majority, Muslim populations - in Myanmar's case, Muslims are a minority that is severely repressed. According to the acting secretary of homeland security, Chad Wolf, these countries fell short in new vetting criteria for \"terrorists and criminals attempting to enter the United States.\"</p><p>The restrictions differ - Sudan and Tanzania are barred from the \"diversity visa\" lottery, while the other countries face a suspension of entry for immigrants. Travel for tourism and reasons other than immigration remains open - a curious gap if the purpose of the restrictions is to keep out potential terrorists.</p><p>It may be that the countries do somehow fall short in vetting would-be emigrants. And since the conservative-controlled Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump's ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad (later removed from the list) - as well as Venezuela and North Korea in June 2018, the new ban would most likely survive legal challenge. But it doesn't take a lot of intuition to guess that security is not foremost on the president's mind.</p><p>Blocking the immigration of people of color, Muslims or non-English speakers has been among the most frequent of Mr. Trump's pitches to his base, and the timing for a new ban was propitious. It was the third anniversary of his first travel ban, the impeachment drama was sputtering to an end and the starting gun for the 2020 election season was about to go off in Iowa (or, as it happened, to pathetically misfire). With all the Democratic candidates opposed to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, what better time to remind his followers that Mr. Trump was still standing guard at the gates?</p><p>Yet the latest ban makes as little sense as the first one, and it stands to do far more harm than good. A 2018 study by the libertarian Cato Institute found that the Trump administration's \"extreme vetting\" of travelers and immigrants, of which the travel ban is a centerpiece, would not significantly reduce the already minuscule risk of imported terrorism achieved by visa reforms after 9/11, but would come at exponentially greater cost. The risk of any American being killed in the United States by a refugee or immigrant is negligible, Cato found.</p><p>Apart from the cruelty of barring thousands of family reunifications, the new restrictions could actually hurt the American economy. The ban is certain to strain relations with the newly listed countries. Five of them, including Nigeria, which has Africa's largest economy, are being avidly courted by China as part of its \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" and could well conclude that China is a more trustworthy and predictable partner than the United States.</p><p>Adding ignorance to insult, Mr. Trump has consistently misrepresented the diversity lottery program, from which he is now excluding Sudan and Tanzania, as a means for poor countries to dump people they don't want on the United States. In fact, the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program is administered by the State Department to increase immigration from countries with low rates of immigration, and candidates must have at least the equivalent of a high school diploma or two years of work experience to qualify.</p><p>The veneer of process and rationale over the latest travel ban cannot conceal its fundamental malice.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>---</p><p>Feb. 2</p><p>The Valdosta Daily Times on the observation of Black History Month:</p><p>Black History Month has a history of its own.</p><p>The commemorative month was founded more than 100 years.</p><p>In 1915, 50 years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation which abolished slavery in America, Black History Month was created as a way to acknowledge black Americans.</p><p>Attempting to recognize all African Americans who achieved greatness in their field is impossible.</p><p>The contributions of black Americans is as broad, as vast and as diverse as the nation.</p><p>Some people still like to deride the need for a Black History Month. Why don't we have a White History Month, they ask?</p><p>History books and curriculum have largely been written by white people, and thus reflect a homogeneous perspective that has excluded the contributions of blacks, women and other minorities. Arguably, every month is White History Month.</p><p>Still, eventually, our country might reach the point we no longer need to call attention to the achievements of any specific race or ethnic group.</p><p>But we're not there yet.</p><p>For the fourth year, the newspaper's SunLight Project team interviewed several community leaders and residents to discuss the importance of the civil rights movement, current race relations and other aspects that could easily fit into the character of Black History Month.</p><p>And while the stories are shared during the month, readers will hopefully realize an overriding truth.</p><p>These are not black stories.</p><p>They are the stories of our neighbors and friends.</p><p>They are American stories.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valdostadailytimes.com\">https://www.valdostadailytimes.com</url></p><p>---</p><p>Feb. 1</p><p>The London Evening Standard on the United Kingdom leaving the European Union:</p><p>Today, as the 11th hour approaches, there will be no street parties or pealing of bells in celebration, nor are there angry demonstrations and defiant protests of outrage. The exhausted nation is hardly aware that, after all the acrimony, the moment of departure is upon us. Brexit is done.</p><p>The best the governing party can manage to mark the event that has consumed all its political energies, and dispatched two of its leaders, is a commemorative mug and tea towel. Why? Because whatever side you have taken in the debate that has cleaved our society in half, today represents a failure.</p><p>For the Remainers the defeat is absolute. We can lament the mistaken decision to call a referendum, and the lacklustre, unemotional campaign. We can rue the errors that followed, as overly-moderate Tory rebels pitched their fight on the method rather than the substance of our departure; while the extremist Labour leadership and naive Liberal Democrats proved unwitting handmaidens to our exit and their own destruction.</p><p>But the facts are these: after half a century of membership, appeals in the 2016 referendum to a common European identity fell on millions of deaf ears; and after three years of economic stagnation since, and transparent evidence that the promises of Brexit were false, the voters reaffirmed their decision in a second vote in the election last month. So the truth must be faced by all who wanted Britain to remain in the EU, including the Evening Standard: we did not convince our fellow citizens.</p><p>If the failure of pro-Europeans is obvious, why are the celebrations of Brexiteers so muted? In part, because they too know they have not convinced the nation.</p><p>Britain walks through the exit door with a feeling of melancholic resignation rather than excitement about the future. The nation knows it has chosen the poorer path - the estimates produced by the Bank of England yesterday show an economy barely growing, with a trend rate not seen since the Seventies.</p><p>The country also knows it has greatly diminished its voice in the world - already our views on everything from climate goals to the taxation of big tech matter far less.</p><p>The more thoughtful leaders of the Brexit campaign know too that they prevailed by harnessing a nativist opposition to change and a resentment at the success of others in parts of the country, outside the cities of the North and South, that felt left behind.</p><p>They talk of levelling up, but they won on the argument of levelling down: if you can't enjoy the fruits of globalisation, then nor should anyone else. No one beyond the offices of a few deluded hedge funds in Mayfair believes Brexit was a vote for less red tape and more free trade.</p><p>The party that now represents Sedgefield and Blyth Valley champions more government intervention, higher spending and extra regulation. Yesterday, the Conservatives were trumpeting their re-nationalisation of the Northern railways, the kind of state involvement in the economy that we joined the EU to get away from. \"Global Britain\" may be the slogan, but neither the globe nor Britain believe a word of it.</p><p>So what lies ahead?</p><p>Ignore those who say that Brexit isn't done. It is. Yes, there's a trade agreement to be negotiated - and the details matter a lot to businesses - but it's a much less important decision than the existential one we've just taken about whether we are members of the EU.</p><p>There will be an argument about \"divergence\" - but the truth is that, in most areas, global standard-setting and the European markets will force us to be a taker of the rules we have until today participated in making. That's why the hard Brexit on paper will feel much softer in practice.</p><p>Even the hour of our departure - midnight Central European Time - is set by others.</p><p>It will take time for this loss of control to become apparent - but when it does, the same questions that faced Britain 50 years ago will confront us now: how do we exert our influence in the world? How do we sustain support for the free markets and the open society?</p><p>US Secretary of State Dean Acheson famously said of post-war Britain that we had lost an empire but not yet found a role.</p><p>Back in 1972, we thought we had by joining the European community. In 2020, as we leave, it's time to come together - because we still haven't found what we're looking for.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk\">https://www.standard.co.uk</url>/</p><p>Submit a Letter to the Editor</p><p>If you're interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor, click here.</p><p>Submit<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Send Letter to the Editor</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Fred Guttenberg's act of rebellion came from the heart, a heart in pain, a heart irrevocably broken.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it seemed particularly heartless for him to be removed from the balcony gallery by security of after he shouted out in the name of his slain daughter when Trump failed to address any attempt on his part to confront gun violence in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Guttenberg's daughter Jaime was killed in the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland. Pelosi had invited him to attend the State of Union speech.</p><p>The pain of Jaime's death has turned Guttenberg into a well-known gun control activist. He keeps his daughter's name alive by reminding us how senselessly she died in our own backyard.</p><p>Who can blame him. He speaks for the millions of Americans who have been affected by gun violence.</p><p>Tuesday, as Trump finished saying, \"So long as I am president, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\" Republicans began to cheer. Guttenberg, sitting with the South Florida delegation, likely fumed at the president's total dismissal of America's gun-violence problem.</p><p>As the cheers quieted, Guttenberg could be briefly heard in the chamber saying: \"victims of gun violence like my daughter . . .\"</p><p>Security came and took Guttenberg away as the shocked South Florida delegation sitting around him watched him be led off.</p><p>As the commotion to remove Guttenberg played out, Pelosi can be seen looking in his direction.</p><p>By the end of Trump's address, Pelosi, who had apparently had enough, dramatically ripped up her copy of the speech, later telling reporters that it was \"the courteous thing to do given the alternatives.\"</p><p>Trump had refused to shake Pelosi's hand earlier, she who, after all, initiated impeachment proceedings against him.</p><p>Obviously, tensions were raging like a teenager's hormones all evening.</p><p>A contrite Guttenberg apologized on Twitter early Wednesday:</p><p>\"I disrupted the State Of the Union and was detained because I let my emotions get the best of me. I simply want to be able to deal with the reality of gun violence and not have to listen to the lies about the 2A as happened tonight.</p><p>\"I should not have yelled out. I am thankful for the overwhelming support that I am receiving. However, I do owe my family and friends an apology. I have tried to conduct myself with dignity throughout this process and I will do better as I pursue gun safety.\"</p><p>Guttenberg was immediately comforted by followers who assured him:</p><p>\"No apology needed.\"</p><p>Except maybe one from the White House.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.miamiherald.com\">https://www.miamiherald.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The Minnesota Star Tribune on Trump's State of the Union address:</p><p>Amid an impeachment effort meant to remove him from office and a re-election campaign meant to return him, President Donald Trump gave his third State of the Union Address Tuesday night.</p><p>The extraordinary circumstances were apparent in the setting. Over his left shoulder sat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who resisted impeachment until allegations demanded Congress do its constitutional duty. In front of him was his right flank: Republican lawmakers defending the president, including a House minority that voted unanimously not to impeach him, and a Senate majority expected to quickly acquit the president on Wednesday.</p><p>It was a night that laid bare the nation's deep partisan divide, with Trump not shaking Pelosi's hand and the speaker ending the evening by ripping up her copy of the address.</p><p>And it was hardly the combination of ingredients for the compromise, or even comity, that's needed for bipartisan action on key issues that are too pressing to await a presidential campaign, including work on lowering health care costs.</p><p>Like presidents preceding him, Trump appropriately declared the state of the union \"stronger than ever before\" - at least economically, if not politically. In particular, the record-low unemployment rate, especially for communities of color, is an accomplishment all should laud and look to build upon.</p><p>But in a speech touted by the White House as \"the great American comeback,\" the president overstated the strength of the ongoing recovery and ignored the cost of the country's relatively tepid economic growth. Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office reported that 2019 GDP growth was 2.3%, its slowest since 2016 in an era Trump described in his inaugural address as \"American carnage.\"</p><p>More troubling, the CBO reported that the annual budget deficit soared past $1 trillion, a figure that will increase to an average $1.3 trillion per year from 2021 to 2030. The Republican tax cut was a major contributor, and Trump is campaigning on a promise of even more cuts with no clear strategy for covering the lost revenue.</p><p>Alacrity over the deficit and other threats to America's security, like climate change, should create bipartisan consensus, not the gridlock gripping Washington. But the president, who has called global warming a \"hoax,\" ignored it in his address just as he has in his administration. And while Trump is correct that the country must not take a \"socialist\" turn, capitalism's enduring scourge of increasing inequality threatens the nation's social fabric.</p><p>Rather than offering a vision for immigration reform that could fuel future economic growth, Trump continued to paint those not born in this country as a threat. Instead of searching for common ground on the Second Amendment, the president ignored the scourge of gun violence.</p><p>Security threats from nation-states and stateless actors alike are omnipresent, too, and while the commander in chief correctly credited the unrivaled U.S. armed forces, the soft power of diplomacy and alliances are more important than ever - something the president should prioritize even if he gave the issue short shrift in his speech.</p><p>Even beyond the military and economic might and rich alliances, America's greatest advantage is its system of governance, which when done right is still an idea and ideal for the world - a truth Trump and Congress must ensure. Otherwise, the great American comeback is just a slogan, not a reality.</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The Wall Street Journal on the Iowa Democratic caucuses:</p><p>There's no shortage of mordant fun to be had at the expense of the Democratic National Committee and Iowa Democratic Party after the fiasco of the inaugural 2020 presidential contest, which has yet to yield definitive results apparently as a result of coding errors in a tabulation app created by party insiders. The college of cardinals at least lets the world know with white or black smoke how the vote for pope is going.</p><p>Here the party that waxes sanctimonious about election security couldn't secure its own election from itself. Here the party that has spent three years questioning the legitimacy of the 2016 election will see the legitimacy of its own custom-designed process questioned. Here the party that promises technocratic management of American health care, energy and finance proved less able to tally votes even than the ancient Athenians.</p><p>Yet the incompetence and hypocrisy will have real consequences. The first and most important could be a boost for Bernie Sanders, who may be able to claim the mantle of both victor and underdog at the same time. By all accounts the Vermont socialist performed well, with he and Pete Buttigieg leading based on partial results that the party finally released late Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Yet many of Mr. Sanders's supporters will believe the technological snafu denied their candidate a clear-cut victory. They believe the party establishment is trying to block their candidate, who until this campaign wasn't officially a member of the party that botched the caucuses. Even if results do finally vindicate Mr. Sanders, those who underperformed (most significantly, Joe Biden based on Tuesday's partial results) are already trying to dismiss their significance.</p><p>One irony is that while Mr. Sanders can capitalize on anger at the Democratic establishment, that very anger may have contributed to the mess. Mr. Sanders's supporters cried foul after Hillary Clinton beat their candidate in 2016 and demanded rules to make the caucuses more \"transparent.\"</p><p>Unlike in previous years, Iowa caucus sites this year had to report two counts-a \"first alignment,\" which reflects how many people had each candidate as a first choice, and a \"second alignment,\" reflecting the results after supporters of candidates below the 15% threshold moved to their second choice. This may have made tallying more difficult and would have added complexity and muddied the result even if it weren't for the technical failure.</p><p>This is a reminder that changing electoral systems to satisfy populist demands should be done with care, because the unintended consequences can further undermine their legitimacy. Democrats have been griping about how Iowa is insufficiently diverse to hold the first presidential contest, and this may be the last time the state goes first. But let's hope whatever comes next is geared toward producing strong candidates and reliable outcomes and not merely satisfying the demands of partisan opportunists.</p><p>On that front, we wonder if any of the Democrats who feel as if they wasted months and hundreds of millions of dollars in Iowa are having second thoughts about calls to eliminate the Electoral College. As journalist Dan McLaughlin notes, such state-level failures highlight the perils of a nationwide system for popular vote counting. At least here the failure is contained, and let's hope it can be rectified without calling the entire presidential nominating contest into question.</p><p>The delayed results in Iowa are a reminder of other potential features of the 2020 election that could create controversy and damage its legitimacy. Recall that in California in November 2018, several Republican Congressional candidates were well ahead based on the Election Day tallies, only to see the results reversed in the following days and in some cases more than a week later as absentee ballots trickled in.</p><p>We have argued that California's lax election rules that allow \"ballot harvesting\" by party activists will also lead to political mischief. But even if they don't, tallying delays discourage the swift acceptance of outcomes that well-functioning democracies need.</p><p>In 2018 the California rules seemed to hurt the GOP, but if the state's March primary is closely contested, then Democratic candidates could feel the sting. Meantime, if Mr. Biden's performance was as weak as partial results showed, then perhaps Michael Bloomberg, who sat out Iowa and is spending big elsewhere, becomes the party's best bulwark against a socialist takeover. That's unlikely to calm the passions of Mr. Sanders's supporters or make the 2020 contest any less heated. Buckle up.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The New York Times on the Trump administration adding six more countries to the travel restriction list:</p><p>On Friday, with Americans focused on President Trump's impeachment trial, the coronavirus and the upcoming Iowa caucuses, the Trump administration announced it was adding six more countries to the list of those whose citizens face travel restrictions to the United States. The given reason was that those nations were not sufficiently screening people who sought to come to America.</p><p>The six countries affected when the travel ban takes effect on Feb. 22 are Sudan, Tanzania, Eritrea, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria. All have sizable, if not majority, Muslim populations - in Myanmar's case, Muslims are a minority that is severely repressed. According to the acting secretary of homeland security, Chad Wolf, these countries fell short in new vetting criteria for \"terrorists and criminals attempting to enter the United States.\"</p><p>The restrictions differ - Sudan and Tanzania are barred from the \"diversity visa\" lottery, while the other countries face a suspension of entry for immigrants. Travel for tourism and reasons other than immigration remains open - a curious gap if the purpose of the restrictions is to keep out potential terrorists.</p><p>It may be that the countries do somehow fall short in vetting would-be emigrants. And since the conservative-controlled Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump's ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad (later removed from the list) - as well as Venezuela and North Korea in June 2018, the new ban would most likely survive legal challenge. But it doesn't take a lot of intuition to guess that security is not foremost on the president's mind.</p><p>Blocking the immigration of people of color, Muslims or non-English speakers has been among the most frequent of Mr. Trump's pitches to his base, and the timing for a new ban was propitious. It was the third anniversary of his first travel ban, the impeachment drama was sputtering to an end and the starting gun for the 2020 election season was about to go off in Iowa (or, as it happened, to pathetically misfire). With all the Democratic candidates opposed to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, what better time to remind his followers that Mr. Trump was still standing guard at the gates?</p><p>Yet the latest ban makes as little sense as the first one, and it stands to do far more harm than good. A 2018 study by the libertarian Cato Institute found that the Trump administration's \"extreme vetting\" of travelers and immigrants, of which the travel ban is a centerpiece, would not significantly reduce the already minuscule risk of imported terrorism achieved by visa reforms after 9/11, but would come at exponentially greater cost. The risk of any American being killed in the United States by a refugee or immigrant is negligible, Cato found.</p><p>Apart from the cruelty of barring thousands of family reunifications, the new restrictions could actually hurt the American economy. The ban is certain to strain relations with the newly listed countries. Five of them, including Nigeria, which has Africa's largest economy, are being avidly courted by China as part of its \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" and could well conclude that China is a more trustworthy and predictable partner than the United States.</p><p>Adding ignorance to insult, Mr. Trump has consistently misrepresented the diversity lottery program, from which he is now excluding Sudan and Tanzania, as a means for poor countries to dump people they don't want on the United States. In fact, the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program is administered by the State Department to increase immigration from countries with low rates of immigration, and candidates must have at least the equivalent of a high school diploma or two years of work experience to qualify.</p><p>The veneer of process and rationale over the latest travel ban cannot conceal its fundamental malice.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 2</p><p>The Valdosta Daily Times on the observation of Black History Month:</p><p>Black History Month has a history of its own.</p><p>The commemorative month was founded more than 100 years.</p><p>In 1915, 50 years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation which abolished slavery in America, Black History Month was created as a way to acknowledge black Americans.</p><p>Attempting to recognize all African Americans who achieved greatness in their field is impossible.</p><p>The contributions of black Americans is as broad, as vast and as diverse as the nation.</p><p>Some people still like to deride the need for a Black History Month. Why don't we have a White History Month, they ask?</p><p>History books and curriculum have largely been written by white people, and thus reflect a homogeneous perspective that has excluded the contributions of blacks, women and other minorities. Arguably, every month is White History Month.</p><p>Still, eventually, our country might reach the point we no longer need to call attention to the achievements of any specific race or ethnic group.</p><p>But we're not there yet.</p><p>For the fourth year, the newspaper's SunLight Project team interviewed several community leaders and residents to discuss the importance of the civil rights movement, current race relations and other aspects that could easily fit into the character of Black History Month.</p><p>And while the stories are shared during the month, readers will hopefully realize an overriding truth.</p><p>These are not black stories.</p><p>They are the stories of our neighbors and friends.</p><p>They are American stories.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valdostadailytimes.com\">https://www.valdostadailytimes.com</url></p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 1</p><p>The London Evening Standard on the United Kingdom leaving the European Union:</p><p>Today, as the 11th hour approaches, there will be no street parties or pealing of bells in celebration, nor are there angry demonstrations and defiant protests of outrage. The exhausted nation is hardly aware that, after all the acrimony, the moment of departure is upon us. Brexit is done.</p><p>The best the governing party can manage to mark the event that has consumed all its political energies, and dispatched two of its leaders, is a commemorative mug and tea towel. Why? Because whatever side you have taken in the debate that has cleaved our society in half, today represents a failure.</p><p>For the Remainers the defeat is absolute. We can lament the mistaken decision to call a referendum, and the lacklustre, unemotional campaign. We can rue the errors that followed, as overly-moderate Tory rebels pitched their fight on the method rather than the substance of our departure; while the extremist Labour leadership and naive Liberal Democrats proved unwitting handmaidens to our exit and their own destruction.</p><p>But the facts are these: after half a century of membership, appeals in the 2016 referendum to a common European identity fell on millions of deaf ears; and after three years of economic stagnation since, and transparent evidence that the promises of Brexit were false, the voters reaffirmed their decision in a second vote in the election last month. So the truth must be faced by all who wanted Britain to remain in the EU, including the Evening Standard: we did not convince our fellow citizens.</p><p>If the failure of pro-Europeans is obvious, why are the celebrations of Brexiteers so muted? In part, because they too know they have not convinced the nation.</p><p>Britain walks through the exit door with a feeling of melancholic resignation rather than excitement about the future. The nation knows it has chosen the poorer path - the estimates produced by the Bank of England yesterday show an economy barely growing, with a trend rate not seen since the Seventies.</p><p>The country also knows it has greatly diminished its voice in the world - already our views on everything from climate goals to the taxation of big tech matter far less.</p><p>The more thoughtful leaders of the Brexit campaign know too that they prevailed by harnessing a nativist opposition to change and a resentment at the success of others in parts of the country, outside the cities of the North and South, that felt left behind.</p><p>They talk of levelling up, but they won on the argument of levelling down: if you can't enjoy the fruits of globalisation, then nor should anyone else. No one beyond the offices of a few deluded hedge funds in Mayfair believes Brexit was a vote for less red tape and more free trade.</p><p>The party that now represents Sedgefield and Blyth Valley champions more government intervention, higher spending and extra regulation. Yesterday, the Conservatives were trumpeting their re-nationalisation of the Northern railways, the kind of state involvement in the economy that we joined the EU to get away from. \"Global Britain\" may be the slogan, but neither the globe nor Britain believe a word of it.</p><p>So what lies ahead?</p><p>Ignore those who say that Brexit isn't done. It is. Yes, there's a trade agreement to be negotiated - and the details matter a lot to businesses - but it's a much less important decision than the existential one we've just taken about whether we are members of the EU.</p><p>There will be an argument about \"divergence\" - but the truth is that, in most areas, global standard-setting and the European markets will force us to be a taker of the rules we have until today participated in making. That's why the hard Brexit on paper will feel much softer in practice.</p><p>Even the hour of our departure - midnight Central European Time - is set by others.</p><p>It will take time for this loss of control to become apparent - but when it does, the same questions that faced Britain 50 years ago will confront us now: how do we exert our influence in the world? How do we sustain support for the free markets and the open society?</p><p>US Secretary of State Dean Acheson famously said of post-war Britain that we had lost an empire but not yet found a role.</p><p>Back in 1972, we thought we had by joining the European community. In 2020, as we leave, it's time to come together - because we still haven't found what we're looking for.</p><p>Online: <url

Fred Guttenberg's act of rebellion came from the heart, a heart in pain, a heart irrevocably broken.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it seemed particularly heartless for him to be removed from the balcony gallery by security of after he shouted out in the name of his slain daughter when Trump failed to address any attempt on his part to confront gun violence in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Guttenberg's daughter Jaime was killed in the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland. Pelosi had invited him to attend the State of Union speech.</p><p>The pain of Jaime's death has turned Guttenberg into a well-known gun control activist. He keeps his daughter's name alive by reminding us how senselessly she died in our own backyard.</p><p>Who can blame him. He speaks for the millions of Americans who have been affected by gun violence.</p><p>Tuesday, as Trump finished saying, \"So long as I am president, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\" Republicans began to cheer. Guttenberg, sitting with the South Florida delegation, likely fumed at the president's total dismissal of America's gun-violence problem.</p><p>As the cheers quieted, Guttenberg could be briefly heard in the chamber saying: \"victims of gun violence like my daughter . . .\"</p><p>Security came and took Guttenberg away as the shocked South Florida delegation sitting around him watched him be led off.</p><p>As the commotion to remove Guttenberg played out, Pelosi can be seen looking in his direction.</p><p>By the end of Trump's address, Pelosi, who had apparently had enough, dramatically ripped up her copy of the speech, later telling reporters that it was \"the courteous thing to do given the alternatives.\"</p><p>Trump had refused to shake Pelosi's hand earlier, she who, after all, initiated impeachment proceedings against him.</p><p>Obviously, tensions were raging like a teenager's hormones all evening.</p><p>A contrite Guttenberg apologized on Twitter early Wednesday:</p><p>\"I disrupted the State Of the Union and was detained because I let my emotions get the best of me. I simply want to be able to deal with the reality of gun violence and not have to listen to the lies about the 2A as happened tonight.</p><p>\"I should not have yelled out. I am thankful for the overwhelming support that I am receiving. However, I do owe my family and friends an apology. I have tried to conduct myself with dignity throughout this process and I will do better as I pursue gun safety.\"</p><p>Guttenberg was immediately comforted by followers who assured him:</p><p>\"No apology needed.\"</p><p>Except maybe one from the White House.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.miamiherald.com\">https://www.miamiherald.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The Minnesota Star Tribune on Trump's State of the Union address:</p><p>Amid an impeachment effort meant to remove him from office and a re-election campaign meant to return him, President Donald Trump gave his third State of the Union Address Tuesday night.</p><p>The extraordinary circumstances were apparent in the setting. Over his left shoulder sat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who resisted impeachment until allegations demanded Congress do its constitutional duty. In front of him was his right flank: Republican lawmakers defending the president, including a House minority that voted unanimously not to impeach him, and a Senate majority expected to quickly acquit the president on Wednesday.</p><p>It was a night that laid bare the nation's deep partisan divide, with Trump not shaking Pelosi's hand and the speaker ending the evening by ripping up her copy of the address.</p><p>And it was hardly the combination of ingredients for the compromise, or even comity, that's needed for bipartisan action on key issues that are too pressing to await a presidential campaign, including work on lowering health care costs.</p><p>Like presidents preceding him, Trump appropriately declared the state of the union \"stronger than ever before\" - at least economically, if not politically. In particular, the record-low unemployment rate, especially for communities of colour, is an accomplishment all should laud and look to build upon.</p><p>But in a speech touted by the White House as \"the great American comeback,\" the president overstated the strength of the ongoing recovery and ignored the cost of the country's relatively tepid economic growth. Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office reported that 2019 GDP growth was 2.3%, its slowest since 2016 in an era Trump described in his inaugural address as \"American carnage.\"</p><p>More troubling, the CBO reported that the annual budget deficit soared past $1 trillion, a figure that will increase to an average $1.3 trillion per year from 2021 to 2030. The Republican tax cut was a major contributor, and Trump is campaigning on a promise of even more cuts with no clear strategy for covering the lost revenue.</p><p>Alacrity over the deficit and other threats to America's security, like climate change, should create bipartisan consensus, not the gridlock gripping Washington. But the president, who has called global warming a \"hoax,\" ignored it in his address just as he has in his administration. And while Trump is correct that the country must not take a \"socialist\" turn, capitalism's enduring scourge of increasing inequality threatens the nation's social fabric.</p><p>Rather than offering a vision for immigration reform that could fuel future economic growth, Trump continued to paint those not born in this country as a threat. Instead of searching for common ground on the Second Amendment, the president ignored the scourge of gun violence.</p><p>Security threats from nation-states and stateless actors alike are omnipresent, too, and while the commander in chief correctly credited the unrivaled U.S. armed forces, the soft power of diplomacy and alliances are more important than ever - something the president should prioritize even if he gave the issue short shrift in his speech.</p><p>Even beyond the military and economic might and rich alliances, America's greatest advantage is its system of governance, which when done right is still an idea and ideal for the world - a truth Trump and Congress must ensure. Otherwise, the great American comeback is just a slogan, not a reality.</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The Wall Street Journal on the Iowa Democratic caucuses:</p><p>There's no shortage of mordant fun to be had at the expense of the Democratic National Committee and Iowa Democratic Party after the fiasco of the inaugural 2020 presidential contest, which has yet to yield definitive results apparently as a result of coding errors in a tabulation app created by party insiders. The college of cardinals at least lets the world know with white or black smoke how the vote for pope is going.</p><p>Here the party that waxes sanctimonious about election security couldn't secure its own election from itself. Here the party that has spent three years questioning the legitimacy of the 2016 election will see the legitimacy of its own custom-designed process questioned. Here the party that promises technocratic management of American health care, energy and finance proved less able to tally votes even than the ancient Athenians.</p><p>Yet the incompetence and hypocrisy will have real consequences. The first and most important could be a boost for Bernie Sanders, who may be able to claim the mantle of both victor and underdog at the same time. By all accounts the Vermont socialist performed well, with he and Pete Buttigieg leading based on partial results that the party finally released late Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Yet many of Mr. Sanders's supporters will believe the technological snafu denied their candidate a clear-cut victory. They believe the party establishment is trying to block their candidate, who until this campaign wasn't officially a member of the party that botched the caucuses. Even if results do finally vindicate Mr. Sanders, those who underperformed (most significantly, Joe Biden based on Tuesday's partial results) are already trying to dismiss their significance.</p><p>One irony is that while Mr. Sanders can capitalize on anger at the Democratic establishment, that very anger may have contributed to the mess. Mr. Sanders's supporters cried foul after Hillary Clinton beat their candidate in 2016 and demanded rules to make the caucuses more \"transparent.\"</p><p>Unlike in previous years, Iowa caucus sites this year had to report two counts-a \"first alignment,\" which reflects how many people had each candidate as a first choice, and a \"second alignment,\" reflecting the results after supporters of candidates below the 15% threshold moved to their second choice. This may have made tallying more difficult and would have added complexity and muddied the result even if it weren't for the technical failure.</p><p>This is a reminder that changing electoral systems to satisfy populist demands should be done with care, because the unintended consequences can further undermine their legitimacy. Democrats have been griping about how Iowa is insufficiently diverse to hold the first presidential contest, and this may be the last time the state goes first. But let's hope whatever comes next is geared toward producing strong candidates and reliable outcomes and not merely satisfying the demands of partisan opportunists.</p><p>On that front, we wonder if any of the Democrats who feel as if they wasted months and hundreds of millions of dollars in Iowa are having second thoughts about calls to eliminate the Electoral College. As journalist Dan McLaughlin notes, such state-level failures highlight the perils of a nationwide system for popular vote counting. At least here the failure is contained, and let's hope it can be rectified without calling the entire presidential nominating contest into question.</p><p>The delayed results in Iowa are a reminder of other potential features of the 2020 election that could create controversy and damage its legitimacy. Recall that in California in November 2018, several Republican Congressional candidates were well ahead based on the Election Day tallies, only to see the results reversed in the following days and in some cases more than a week later as absentee ballots trickled in.</p><p>We have argued that California's lax election rules that allow \"ballot harvesting\" by party activists will also lead to political mischief. But even if they don't, tallying delays discourage the swift acceptance of outcomes that well-functioning democracies need.</p><p>In 2018 the California rules seemed to hurt the GOP, but if the state's March primary is closely contested, then Democratic candidates could feel the sting. Meantime, if Mr. Biden's performance was as weak as partial results showed, then perhaps Michael Bloomberg, who sat out Iowa and is spending big elsewhere, becomes the party's best bulwark against a socialist takeover. That's unlikely to calm the passions of Mr. Sanders's supporters or make the 2020 contest any less heated. Buckle up.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com\">https://www.wsj.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 4</p><p>The New York Times on the Trump administration adding six more countries to the travel restriction list:</p><p>On Friday, with Americans focused on President Trump's impeachment trial, the coronavirus and the upcoming Iowa caucuses, the Trump administration announced it was adding six more countries to the list of those whose citizens face travel restrictions to the United States. The given reason was that those nations were not sufficiently screening people who sought to come to America.</p><p>The six countries affected when the travel ban takes effect on Feb. 22 are Sudan, Tanzania, Eritrea, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria. All have sizable, if not majority, Muslim populations - in Myanmar's case, Muslims are a minority that is severely repressed. According to the acting secretary of homeland security, Chad Wolf, these countries fell short in new vetting criteria for \"terrorists and criminals attempting to enter the United States.\"</p><p>The restrictions differ - Sudan and Tanzania are barred from the \"diversity visa\" lottery, while the other countries face a suspension of entry for immigrants. Travel for tourism and reasons other than immigration remains open - a curious gap if the purpose of the restrictions is to keep out potential terrorists.</p><p>It may be that the countries do somehow fall short in vetting would-be emigrants. And since the conservative-controlled Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump's ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad (later removed from the list) - as well as Venezuela and North Korea in June 2018, the new ban would most likely survive legal challenge. But it doesn't take a lot of intuition to guess that security is not foremost on the president's mind.</p><p>Blocking the immigration of people of colour, Muslims or non-English speakers has been among the most frequent of Mr. Trump's pitches to his base, and the timing for a new ban was propitious. It was the third anniversary of his first travel ban, the impeachment drama was sputtering to an end and the starting gun for the 2020 election season was about to go off in Iowa (or, as it happened, to pathetically misfire). With all the Democratic candidates opposed to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, what better time to remind his followers that Mr. Trump was still standing guard at the gates?</p><p>Yet the latest ban makes as little sense as the first one, and it stands to do far more harm than good. A 2018 study by the libertarian Cato Institute found that the Trump administration's \"extreme vetting\" of travellers and immigrants, of which the travel ban is a centerpiece, would not significantly reduce the already minuscule risk of imported terrorism achieved by visa reforms after 9-11, but would come at exponentially greater cost. The risk of any American being killed in the United States by a refugee or immigrant is negligible, Cato found.</p><p>Apart from the cruelty of barring thousands of family reunifications, the new restrictions could actually hurt the American economy. The ban is certain to strain relations with the newly listed countries. Five of them, including Nigeria, which has Africa's largest economy, are being avidly courted by China as part of its \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" and could well conclude that China is a more trustworthy and predictable partner than the United States.</p><p>Adding ignorance to insult, Mr. Trump has consistently misrepresented the diversity lottery program, from which he is now excluding Sudan and Tanzania, as a means for poor countries to dump people they don't want on the United States. In fact, the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program is administered by the State Department to increase immigration from countries with low rates of immigration, and candidates must have at least the equivalent of a high school diploma or two years of work experience to qualify.</p><p>The veneer of process and rationale over the latest travel ban cannot conceal its fundamental malice.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com</url>/</p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 2</p><p>The Valdosta Daily Times on the observation of Black History Month:</p><p>Black History Month has a history of its own.</p><p>The commemorative month was founded more than 100 years.</p><p>In 1915, 50 years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation which abolished slavery in America, Black History Month was created as a way to acknowledge black Americans.</p><p>Attempting to recognize all African Americans who achieved greatness in their field is impossible.</p><p>The contributions of black Americans is as broad, as vast and as diverse as the nation.</p><p>Some people still like to deride the need for a Black History Month. Why don't we have a White History Month, they ask?</p><p>History books and curriculum have largely been written by white people, and thus reflect a homogeneous perspective that has excluded the contributions of blacks, women and other minorities. Arguably, every month is White History Month.</p><p>Still, eventually, our country might reach the point we no longer need to call attention to the achievements of any specific race or ethnic group.</p><p>But we're not there yet.</p><p>For the fourth year, the newspaper's SunLight Project team interviewed several community leaders and residents to discuss the importance of the civil rights movement, current race relations and other aspects that could easily fit into the character of Black History Month.</p><p>And while the stories are shared during the month, readers will hopefully realize an overriding truth.</p><p>These are not black stories.</p><p>They are the stories of our neighbours and friends.</p><p>They are American stories.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valdostadailytimes.com\">https://www.valdostadailytimes.com</url></p><p>___</p><p>Feb. 1</p><p>The London Evening Standard on the United Kingdom leaving the European Union:</p><p>Today, as the 11th hour approaches, there will be no street parties or pealing of bells in celebration, nor are there angry demonstrations and defiant protests of outrage. The exhausted nation is hardly aware that, after all the acrimony, the moment of departure is upon us. Brexit is done.</p><p>The best the governing party can manage to mark the event that has consumed all its political energies, and dispatched two of its leaders, is a commemorative mug and tea towel. Why? Because whatever side you have taken in the debate that has cleaved our society in half, today represents a failure.</p><p>For the Remainers the defeat is absolute. We can lament the mistaken decision to call a referendum, and the lacklustre, unemotional campaign. We can rue the errors that followed, as overly-moderate Tory rebels pitched their fight on the method rather than the substance of our departure; while the extremist Labour leadership and naive Liberal Democrats proved unwitting handmaidens to our exit and their own destruction.</p><p>But the facts are these: after half a century of membership, appeals in the 2016 referendum to a common European identity fell on millions of deaf ears; and after three years of economic stagnation since, and transparent evidence that the promises of Brexit were false, the voters reaffirmed their decision in a second vote in the election last month. So the truth must be faced by all who wanted Britain to remain in the EU, including the Evening Standard: we did not convince our fellow citizens.</p><p>If the failure of pro-Europeans is obvious, why are the celebrations of Brexiteers so muted? In part, because they too know they have not convinced the nation.</p><p>Britain walks through the exit door with a feeling of melancholic resignation rather than excitement about the future. The nation knows it has chosen the poorer path - the estimates produced by the Bank of England yesterday show an economy barely growing, with a trend rate not seen since the Seventies.</p><p>The country also knows it has greatly diminished its voice in the world - already our views on everything from climate goals to the taxation of big tech matter far less.</p><p>The more thoughtful leaders of the Brexit campaign know too that they prevailed by harnessing a nativist opposition to change and a resentment at the success of others in parts of the country, outside the cities of the North and South, that felt left behind.</p><p>They talk of levelling up, but they won on the argument of levelling down: if you can't enjoy the fruits of globalisation, then nor should anyone else. No one beyond the offices of a few deluded hedge funds in Mayfair believes Brexit was a vote for less red tape and more free trade.</p><p>The party that now represents Sedgefield and Blyth Valley champions more government intervention, higher spending and extra regulation. Yesterday, the Conservatives were trumpeting their re-nationalisation of the Northern railways, the kind of state involvement in the economy that we joined the EU to get away from. \"Global Britain\" may be the slogan, but neither the globe nor Britain believe a word of it.</p><p>So what lies ahead?</p><p>Ignore those who say that Brexit isn't done. It is. Yes, there's a trade agreement to be negotiated - and the details matter a lot to businesses - but it's a much less important decision than the existential one we've just taken about whether we are members of the EU.</p><p>There will be an argument about \"divergence\" - but the truth is that, in most areas, global standard-setting and the European markets will force us to be a taker of the rules we have until today participated in making. That's why the hard Brexit on paper will feel much softer in practice.</p><p>Even the hour of our departure - midnight Central European Time - is set by others.</p><p>It will take time for this loss of control to become apparent - but when it does, the same questions that faced Britain 50 years ago will confront us now: how do we exert our influence in the world? How do we sustain support for the free markets and the open society?</p><p>US Secretary of State Dean Acheson famously said of post-war Britain that we had lost an empire but not yet found a role.</p><p>Back in 1972, we thought we had by joining the European community. In 2020, as we leave, it's time to come together - because we still haven't found what we're looking for.</p><p>Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk\">https://www.standard.co.uk</url>/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a85722f359507abe91180fa2d8ed741a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y50-74W1-JBVR-351T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3527\"/><timeReceived>04:37 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>news</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>International</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001566</classCode><className>SHOOTINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000724</classCode><className>FIREARMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000820</classCode><className>GUN CONTROL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009WKA</classCode><className>NANCY PELOSI</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS125</classCode><className>FLORIDA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Even if that's the goal, it doesn't justify these truly Orwellian means. The fact that the existence of the project was only publicly acknowledged after The Wall Street Journal exposed it indicates that even Google understands how unacceptable this kind of intrusion is.</p><p>Yet the two companies are doing it anyway - and there's apparently no law to stop it. That should change.</p><p>As the Journal reported Monday, Google last year penned an agreement with Ascension, the nation's largest nonprofit health care provider, to gather medical information from facilities across 21 states, including Missouri and Illinois. The data-sharing endeavor, code named \"Project Nightingale,\" was started secretly. The data includes patient names, lab results, diagnoses and other information that, as the Journal puts it, \"amounts to a complete health history\" of patients.</p><p>Consider it: Even as you read this, your personal medical information could be getting crunched in a Google database designed to help the company get a foothold in the health care industry. You had no ability to opt out; you were never even told of it, and neither was your doctor.</p><p>The goal is to develop health care focused artificial intelligence tools to improve clinical effectiveness, Ascension said in a statement - one that came only after the Journal report exposed the secret project. The company stressed it is operating in accordance with federal medical privacy regulations, but that isn't the point. At least 150 Google employees had access to data on tens of millions of patients. Some Ascension employees have raised ethical concerns about the project.</p><p>Google and other tech giants like Facebook and Twitter operate in a Wild West atmosphere of few regulations, even as they gather information about individual Americans on a scale that has never been possible before. Whether it's hyper-targeted advertising, manipulation of politics or, now, deep mining of medical data, their ability to access and monetize every corner of Americans' personal lives is out of control.</p><p>Google and Ascension can cite all the legal justification they want, but the apparent legality of this project only makes it all the more disturbing. Congress should investigate whether any patient data was improperly handled. Just as importantly, it should get aggressive about setting some rules of the road for these tech companies on the gathering and use of personal data. Without them, tech companies will continue to careen out of control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLPD-1003426014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLPD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGX-2FV1-JBM5-C53T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Inc.
