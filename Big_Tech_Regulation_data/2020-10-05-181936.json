In September, International Business Machine Corps. (IBM) reported that 15 percent of top global banks rolled out at least one full scale, commercial blockchain product that year, with the figure expected to increase to 65 percent by 2019. Consequently, the adoption rate is expected to rise at an even quicker pace in 2018, as more traditional institution and FinTech giants continue to find ways to implement the innovative technology into their operating procedures. </p><p>Demand for the blockchain, best known for supporting bitcoin, is growing so much that it will be one of the largest users of capacity in 2018 at more than 60 data centers rented out by IBM to other companies around the globe, said the Pura panel. As one of the first big companies to recognize the technology's promise, IBM has contributed to an open source effort. IBM has even encouraged startups to try the blockchain on its cloud for free, creating opportunities for both small businesses and large corporations attempting to innovate. As a result the technology has garnered interest from big tech and financial multinationals alike. In early November, startup company R3 announced that it now has over 60 clients, including Microsoft and Intel, actively using its blockchain platform, also known as a distributed ledger technology, to store vast amounts of data across a network of computers around the world, rather than on one local server. In its announcement, R3 added that more than 100 banks, insurance firms, regulators and trade associations have signed on to collaborate as members, a further sign of growing acceptance. Essentially, the blockchain enables companies and individuals doing business with each other to record transactions securely. Its strength lies in its trustworthiness, explained the Pura Cryptocurrency[2] panel, as it is impossible to reverse or change what has been recorded. I can also hold infinitely more documents and data than traditional database storage, allowing businesses for more nuances insights and analysis. Almost six in 10 large corporations are considering using blockchain, according to a Juniper Research survey of 400 executives, managers and tech staff. The technology is increasingly being tested or used by companies including Wal Mart and Visa to streamline supply chain, speed up payments and store records. Within five years, digital distributed ledgers will be utilized by 55 percent of companies with more than 1,000 employees. Pura Cryptocurrency[3] is the world's first socially and environmentally conscious cryptocurrency. As an international digital currency, it liberates users to transact with anyone in the world directly, privately and instantly across a peer-to-peer network that is secured by the blockchain. As a conscious cash movement for the common good, ten percent of all PURA created is contributed to PURAPlanet, a treasury trust dedicated to fund and track sustainable, environmental, and social projects around the globe.

In September, International Business Machine Corps. (IBM) reported that 15 percent of top global banks rolled out at least one full scale, commercial blockchain product that year, with the figure expected to increase to 65 percent by 2019. Consequently, the adoption rate is expected to rise at an even quicker pace in 2018, as more traditional institution and FinTech giants continue to find ways to implement the innovative technology into their operating procedures. </p><p>Demand for the blockchain, best known for supporting bitcoin, is growing so much that it will be one of the largest users of capacity in 2018 at more than 60 data centers rented out by IBM to other companies around the globe, said the Pura panel. As one of the first big companies to recognize the technology's promise, IBM has contributed to an open source effort. IBM has even encouraged startups to try the blockchain on its cloud for free, creating opportunities for both small businesses and large corporations attempting to innovate. As a result the technology has garnered interest from big tech and financial multinationals alike. In early November, startup company R3 announced that it now has over 60 clients, including Microsoft and Intel, actively using its blockchain platform, also known as a distributed ledger technology, to store vast amounts of data across a network of computers around the world, rather than on one local server. In its announcement, R3 added that more than 100 banks, insurance firms, regulators and trade associations have signed on to collaborate as members, a further sign of growing acceptance. Essentially, the blockchain enables companies and individuals doing business with each other to record transactions securely. Its strength lies in its trustworthiness, explained the Pura Cryptocurrency[2] panel, as it is impossible to reverse or change what has been recorded. I can also hold infinitely more documents and data than traditional database storage, allowing businesses for more nuances insights and analysis. Almost six in 10 large corporations are considering using blockchain, according to a Juniper Research survey of 400 executives, managers and tech staff. The technology is increasingly being tested or used by companies including Wal Mart and Visa to streamline supply chain, speed up payments and store records. Within five years, digital distributed ledgers will be utilized by 55 percent of companies with more than 1,000 employees. Pura Cryptocurrency[3] is the world's first socially and environmentally conscious cryptocurrency. As an international digital currency, it liberates users to transact with anyone in the world directly, privately and instantly across a peer-to-peer network that is secured by the blockchain. As a conscious cash movement for the common good, ten percent of all PURA created is contributed to PURAPlanet, a treasury trust dedicated to fund and track sustainable, environmental, and social projects around the globe.

Here's some of the things we may be talking about today. Republicans have collapsed[1] into their fainting couches after hearing Nancy Pelosi wants to see Trump \"in prison.\" In an appearance on Laura Ingraham's white power hour,[2] Trump sobbed mean names about Pelosi against a backdrop of graves of soldiers who died on the beaches of Normandy. </p><p>Through a deluge of crocodile tears, conservative dickheads are bemoaning the death of democracy. Last night Hannity weeped[3] about the US becoming one of those \"Banana Republics\" where a \"political opponent\" is \"locked up in prison,\" as if Trump didn't spend all of 2016 leading chants of \"Lock Her Up.\" House Democrats are getting ready to give committee chairs super powers[4] in order to legally kick-punch the pants off the administration whenever they ignora subpoenas. The draft resolution would let committee chairs quickly respond to Trump World's attempt to stonewall investigations, and get outside legal counsel to help combat all their obstruction. Mike Flynn is not having a good week. First US District Judge Emmet Sullivan released a transcript of John Dowd saying sad and questionable stuff to Flynn's lawyers about talking to \"the government,\" then Sullivan released the actual audio. Flynn has now \"You're Fired\" his fancy lawyers[5] for (what we can only assume) not being complete idiots, and/or bumbling crooks like the rest of Trump World's TV lawyers. Looks like a job for Larry Klayman! [Audio[6]]The economy only added 75,000 jobs last month.[7] Economists were expecting 180,000. That's bad.States ravaged by global warming bad weather last year will FINALLY get help after Trump signed the $19.1 billion disaster aid bill[8] he spent months whining about. Upon signing the bill, Trump shitposted that Puerto Rico should love him.[9] In a tweet, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz fired back,[10] \"Trump's ridiculous statement is equal to someone beating you to the point of death, being shamed into taking you to the hospital, and then saying you should 'love him.'\"The Trump administration has declared another emergency and given the green light for Raytheon, a defense contractor, to start building smart bombs in Saudi Arabia.[11] What could possibly go wrong? Automakers are pissed the administration is trying to roll back the Obama-era emissions rules[12] they spent months lobbying against. They're worried Trump's rules go too far and will (shockingly) screw auto markets as states like California have stricter emissions rules than neighboring states. Number crunchers fear that Trump's rules may make America's fetish for truckasauruses go extinct as people begin adopting cheap electric vehicles, and that's not good for their profit margins. You might not remember the \"Opportunity Zones\" that were snuck into the Trump tax cuts (for the super rich). It was a scheme to boost low-income neighborhoods through general tax fuckery.[13] Bean counters are now worried that the super rich (*cough* Jared Kushner) will use the provision instead to rapidly gentrify places for pennies on the dollar. Guess we should act shocked.The FCC has has approved a new rule making it easier for big telecoms to block robocalls.[14] The move was universally approved by FCC commissioners, but Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel worries that telcos will instead charge customers a fee for using the service. Rosenworcel says, \"I think robocall solutions should be free to consumers. Full stop. I do not think that this agency should pat itself on the back for its efforts to reduce robocalls and then tell consumers to pay up.\" HUD Secretary Ben Carson says he's not A Idiot[15] (HE'S A BRAIN SURGEON!) in a new interview where he tries to brush off \"Oreogate.\" Carson mumbles that his grilling by California Democratic Rep. Katie Porter was \"Gotcha\" questions and \"your mama\" jokes.[16] In response, Porter tweeted, \"Next time you send something to my office, start by sending me answers for the American people, not cookies. This is not a joke for the families losing their homes.\" Democratic Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib has introduced a plan to spend trillions of Ameros on poor people.[17] In what's being considered a precursor to a universal basic income, Tlaib's plan would give $3,000 or $6,000 to people with no income. Tlaib tells WaPo that she was inspired by her time working with students, the elderly, and disabled, adding, \"These are my folks. These are our neighbors who need it most.\" Congress appears to have nuked a scheme by tax prep companies to screw taxpayers[18] out of free tax filing software. The new bill would continue the existing Free File system without cementing it into law, and is being sponsored by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and Democratic Rep. John Lewis. It's expected to drop as early as today, and comes following an April ProPublica story[19] exposing all types of fuckery by tax prep companies.Roll Call took a trip down Memory Lane to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's 2006 House race[20] after noticing some parallels to to her 2020 ambitions. Back then, Gillibrand was an underdog who used bare knuckle politics and a packed schedule to chip away at her opponent all the way to November.The DNC has tweaked the rules[21] for the first Democratic debate. Under the new rules, Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock and two other candidates are effectively eliminated[22] -- unless they can raise their poll numbers by June 12. The move has chapped asses from Democrats up and down the spectrum. Then again Bullock could also just run for the fucking Senate!The Koch brothers say they'll back any Democrat who is willing to roll around in shit[23] and support their agenda. The Koch's seem to have buyers remorse now that they've seen the culmination of their anti-government efforts realized in Trump. But don't cue the flying pigs until some Democrat accepts that deal.Despite calls to break up big tech, a number of 2020 Democratic candidates are making trips to Silicon Valley[24] in an effort to woo deep pocketed donors. Now they're in a bit of a purity pickle as the base sours on feckless and douchey tech bros who hesitate to use their banhammers on white supremacist shitlords.Michigan Republican John James is running for the Senate (again),[25] this time hoping to unseat Democratic Sen. Gary Peters. Republicans have been fawning over James for months because he's not a gross old white guy. In a related story, James will head to Chicago where the Trump loving billionaire Ricketts family will make it rain[26] on thirsty GOP candidates at Wrigley Field.The GOP and its late gerrymandering jerkoff, Thomas Hofeller, MIGHT have lied to a federal court[27] when they were ordered to redraw North Carolina district maps in 2016. At the time, state Republicans argued they didn't have enough time or data to follow through with a court order, but Hofeller's files seem to show that much of the work was already completed.In 2014 John Stewart coined the term \"#McConnelling\"[28] to describe the b-roll footage filmed by Sen. Mitch McConnell and distributed freely for use in PAC ads. The process falls into a legal grey area of campaign finance laws, and is now used by both Republicans and Democrats. [Video[29]][embedded content] What is McConnelling? How campaigns skirt coordination laws to help PACs make ads<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com\">www.youtube.com</url>[30]About a day after coming out in favor of the Hyde Amendment, Joe Biden has made a U-turn[31] and announced he's no longer in of the amendment. In a speech hosted by the DNC last night, Biden stated \"times have changed,\"[32] after hearing about all the Republican-led abortion bans in states like Georgia and Missouri. Biden said he viewed healthcare as a right, and that his goal to see \"universal coverage\" was in jeopardy adding, \"I no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's ZIP code.\" In the first of a two-part report, Rachel Maddow has a heartbreaking story about all the godawful, medically unnecessary things doctors are being forced to do[33] to Missouri women seeking abortions. Transvaginal ultrasounds were bad, but this is worse. [Morning Maddow[34]][embedded content] Missouri Forcing Invasive Pelvic Exam On Women Seeking Abortion | Rachel Maddow | MSNBC      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com\">www.youtube.com</url>[35]Tucker Carlson and Glenn Greenwald are defending the alt-right debate dildo[36] Steven Crowder over Vox journalist Carlos Maza, following the dildo's \"de-monetization\" on Youtube over homophobic rants, rhetoric, and t-shirts. GG says the dildo was being \"marginalized\"[37] and that Youtube and Maza were part of the blah blah blah Democratic liberal elite blah blah blah. In response, Maza tweeted,[38] \"I don't even know to install my air conditioning unit.\" [Video[39]] Vox Media employees walked off the job[40] Thursday in an effort to secure collective bargaining rights for their union. In a tweet, the Vox union says it's negotiating[41] for competitive wages, strong guaranteed raises, better severance, and subcontracting work. Early this morning Vox Media Union tweeted that it was still negotiating.[42] SOLIDARITY! Atlantic Editor Jeffrey Goldberg wants you to thank him for putting women in editorial positions, even if penile-challenged writers can't write 10,000 word stories.[43] NOTE: Editors at the Atlantic are choosy beggars who still ask freelancers to do things for exposure,[44] or shit pay. The Rev. William Barber was convicted of second degree trespass[45] in North Carolina yesterday for his role in a 2017 sit-in in the North Carolina state legislature. Barber was sentenced to 24 hours of community service and a $200 fine, but he has announced he will appeal the verdict. Following the sentencing, Barber told The Guardian this was \"a serious case for the country,\" adding, \"We cannot just put our hands between our legs and say: 'OK, sorry, you can regulate my nonviolent protest,' and just go away. The extremists in the south want to keep these statehouses under lock and key.\"NICE TIME: Dutee Chand is India's first openly gay athlete.[46] When she's not training for the 2020 Olympics, the 22-year-old millennial is studying law. It's hard to explain how big a deal this is in a country where arranged marriage is still common, and homosexuality was only recently decriminalized.Burning Man, the annual desert hippy festival now known for crotch rot, rich douchebags, goofballs, and eyebrow-raising bullshit, needs a lobbyist to help them navigate the labyrinthine bureaucracy.[47] There's no word on whether or not applicants will be drug tested. Serious inquiries only; applications must be submitted by June 19.Trevor Noah hopped into the wayback machine[48] to look at Elizabeth Warren, and found that before she had a plan for everything, Warren was telling Joe Biden how the wealthy are screwing the poor.[embedded content] Getting to Know Dem: Elizabeth Warren | The Daily Show      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com\">www.youtube.com</url>[49]And here's your morning Nice Time: BABY GIRAFFES![50][embedded content] Baby Giraffes Run and Play      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com\">www.youtube.com</url>[51]Follow Dominic on Twitter[52] and Instagram![53] We're 100% ad-free and reader supported, so consider buying us coffee, or get a subscription!

Some of the alleged Sony emails refer to \"Goliath\" as its primary opponent. It's reasonable to assume that Goliath is a pseudonym for Google, said Jonathan Band of the Policybandwidth law firm. Google was one of the key opponents of SOPA, which was tabled after massive public outcry in 2012.</p><p>One of the stolen documents, sent from Jenner &amp; Block attorneys Kenneth Doroshow and Luke Platzer to MPAA, suggests that certain functions of ISPs could be classified under different provisions of Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to create stronger notice and takedown compliance. A separate document purports to describe a meeting between MPAA and a Comcast official on \"site blocking.\" Another document, obtained by The New York Times, shows MPAA's involvement in a scathing letter Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood sent to Google last year.

Some of the alleged Sony emails refer to \"Goliath\" as its primary opponent. It's reasonable to assume that Goliath is a pseudonym for Google, said Jonathan Band of the Policybandwidth law firm. Google was one of the key opponents of SOPA, which was tabled after massive public outcry in 2012.</p><p>One of the stolen documents, sent from Jenner &amp; Block attorneys Kenneth Doroshow and Luke Platzer to MPAA, suggests that certain functions of ISPs could be classified under different provisions of Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to create stronger notice and takedown compliance. A separate document purports to describe a meeting between MPAA and a Comcast official on \"site blocking.\" Another document, obtained by The New York Times, shows MPAA's involvement in a scathing letter Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood sent to Google last year. Comcast, Google, Jenner &amp; Block and Hood didn't comment.</p><p>Sony isn't just a \"valued member of our association family, but they are friends and colleagues and we feel for them,\" said MPAA in statement referring to the data breach. \"We continue to be in constant touch with their leadership and will be of any assistance to them that we can,\" it said.

The pressure on Big Tech not to take liberty into users' private data should remain. COVID-19 cannot be allowed to ease that pressure. Image Credit: Gulf News Archive</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump's recent Executive Order, aimed at Twitter, has brought up the question of the power of Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For most of us, the COVID-19 crisis has been truly awful. But for Big Tech, it's actually been pretty good, if markets are anything to go by, with demand soaring and governments turning to tech to help. The Trump administration's focus seems to be narrowly focused on immunity from prosecution, aimed at social media in particular.</p><p>If we take the broader perspective, clouds of potential regulation seem to be dispersing for now. But is the newfound love for Big Tech misplaced?</p><p>Question of ownership</p><p>While data, IT, geolocation and AI will be key to recovery, serious questions arise - whatever happens with the social media pushback from the US administration. New services, digitally provided and ushered in by COVID-19, are becoming increasingly important.</p><p>Who should offer them? How should we set the rules of the game, in terms of who can control the data and access the insights? Some say \"leave it to the market\".</p><p>In China, insurer PingAn leveraged its superior customer knowledge to expand into healthcare, becoming the trusted provider for customers lost in a maze of options. Tencent and Alibaba have created similar webs covering a vast array of individual needs.</p><p>Given the sensitivity over privacy, Big Tech in the West has been more circumspect, despite well-funded healthcare subsidiaries. Yet Amazon can be a true force in healthcare; like Google's Verily, its goal is to revolutionize healthcare B2B and B2C.</p><p>Facebook is already active in preventive healthcare.</p><p>Tracking the dominance</p><p>We live in a world increasingly dominated by technology platforms and their associated business ecosystems. By making us even more dependent on virtual connections, COVID-19 is hastening this shift; Facebook just ventured into e-commerce to challenge Amazon.</p><p>Yet where does customer convenience end, and competitive dominance begin? Beyond privacy, how does data relate to competition?</p><p>To tackle dominance, we'll need to focus on the business models of the platforms that aspire to run every aspect of our lives. The economics of digital businesses, with easy scalability, lock-ins and \"winner-take-most\" dynamics, can lead to a minefield, as recent reports from the UK and the EU demonstrate.</p><p>To \"follow the money\", consider Big Tech M&amp;A. Microsoft paid $8.5 billion for Skype and $26 billion for LinkedIn, while Facebook spent $22 billion on WhatsApp.</p><p>These massive investments helped acquirers cement their hold over their respective ecosystems and snuff out the threat from a potentially competing platform. The problem is that today's antitrust playbook is ill-prepared to deal with the new rules of digital platforms and ecosystems.</p><p>From Alphabet's tally of 150+ acquisitions over the last decade, EU and US competition authorities opened a case for six and acted on none. Is Google really so pro-competition? Or are we working with outdated ideas of what competition and power really are? This is by no means an idle question.</p><p>Potent pile</p><p>Right now, Google, Apple and Facebook are sitting on combined cash reserves of $570 billion, or three times the GDP of my native Greece. They can buy anything they want, given the looming contraction. Should we really allow this, or should we try to foster more competition between ecosystems?</p><p>Recently, LBS, UCL and the WEF co-organized a workshop on the regulation of platforms and ecosystems, involving several heads of European competition authorities and Big Tech leaders. The event highlighted a systemic unease and growing calls for a rethink of intra-platform competition and how all-powerful orchestrators manage members of their ecosystems.</p><p>The current stock market valuations of Big Tech suggest their power will persist and raises questions about our entire regulatory apparatus. Whether we intervene or not, our choices today may set the stage for the competitive landscape for decades to come.</p><p>Keeping encroachment at bay</p><p>A number of initiatives are bubbling up that may sound rather technical, or even geeky, but could still shape the business landscape of the future. GAIA-X, started in Germany, proposes a neutral way to connect players in industry and public sector so that they do not have to become subjugated to any Big Tech giant. In the (hot) healthcare sector, firms such as Phillips are advocating a new template for sharing healthcare information.</p><p>Technology can bring us important new solutions, as long as we find the right way to connect players and leverage data. In healthcare, for instance, what role should healthcare providers and insurers play? And what about telcos, handset makers (which include Samsung and Huawei) or the providers of mobile OSs?</p><p>How do we feel about the service-ization of data, and the generation of advertising revenues? If we do turn our backs on Big Tech, how can we justify neglecting its prodigious, potentially life-saving power? If we don't, how can we ensure a level playing field?</p><p>The point of regulation is not to protect outdated incumbents, but to facilitate dynamism while addressing the real risk of excessively powerful firms- an agenda we're ill prepared to serve.</p><p>While President Trump's Executive Order may focus on the responsibility of social media firms in terms of content, and may lead us to revisit their responsibility in polarizing society. There is a broader agenda at play that can shape our economies for a long time.</p><p>The force majeure of coronavirus has granted us a brief d\u00e9tente with Big Tech. But as we will soon see very clearly, the big questions raised by the shift to a platform-based economy have not gone away.</p><p>Every technological choice we make has profound ramifications for strategy, competition, social welfare and the individual. If we want solutions that will meet all those needs, both during the crisis and long afterwards, it's time we updated our playbook.</p><p>- Michael G.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at this past week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement analyzed millions of motorists' photos using facial recognition without their knowledge outraged privacy advocates. And an outcry erupted in Detroit over the use of the technology on data from the city's prolific closed-circuit television system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Proponents of facial recognition by government and law enforcement argue that it's an important security tool. But critics keep getting louder and more numerous. They contend that facial recognition is a fundamental invasion of privacy and that it is inaccurate and often biased against minorities. They also argue that the longer it's used, the more entrenched it will become, making it harder to stop in the future.</p><p>  ''I think this has created a perfect storm for people to realize that substantive change is required,'' said Evan Selinger, a philosophy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Mr. Selinger, along with his colleague Woodrow Hartzog, last year called for an outright ban on the use of the technology by government and law enforcement. On Tuesday, the digital rights group Fight for the Future announced its own push for an outright ban.</p><p>  But how realistic are such proposals?</p><p>  There's some wind at their backs. Many lawmakers -- from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, to Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio -- think something must change.</p><p>  ''It's time for a timeout,'' Mr. Jordan said Tuesday on National Public Radio. ''Let's figure out how we can put in safeguards that protect our fundamental liberties.''</p><p>  But in a House hearing on Wednesday examining the Department of Homeland Security's use of facial recognition, some lawmakers rejected the idea of a ban. It would be ''an easy way to avoid hard questions,'' said Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Alabama.</p><p>  Judith Donath of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard said arguments about security were ''likely to override'' concerns about the technology. And ''Congress has historically been reticent to influence state and local policing,'' said Alvaro Bedoya, director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center.</p><p>  If no full ban, though, then what?</p><p>  Three routes stand out. First, a moratorium, like the one that civil rights advocates sought from the House Committee on Homeland Security on Tuesday, when they asked for the Department of Homeland Security to ''immediately suspend'' use of facial recognition.</p><p>  Then there's a growing trend for local governments to introduce bans: San Francisco was the first city to restrict use of facial recognition by city authorities, and then Somerville, Mass., did something similar. A quasi-national ban could bubble up if many more follow suit.</p><p>  Professor Donath argues that it may be easier to regulate through limits on how facial recognition data can be collected, stored and used by law enforcement and government.</p><p>  It looks increasingly as if Big Brother's gaze is destined to be limited. The questions now appear to be how, and by how much.</p><p>  Are we thinking about 5G all wrong?</p><p>  Stop me if you've heard this before: We're losing the 5G race to China, Huawei's dominance in the technology around the globe is a threat to national security, and we had better clamp down on it.</p><p>  But Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, explained that things were more nuanced. It's a wide-ranging (often technical) analysis of the broader 5G policy landscape, and it's worth a read if you have the time.</p><p>  I chatted with him about it, and here are a few of his points about the China situation that I thought were interesting:</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Coming first may not be important. President Trump has said that ''the race to 5G is a race that we must win,'' but it's not clear what that means. What might winning look like? ''The U.S. wasn't first in any of the G's, and yet it's the dominant force in the wireless ecosystems,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''I believe that winning is dominance over the things that use the network,'' he added, as opposed to simply having the network in place first.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Railing against Huawei could undermine the United States' dominance. The Trump administration has been trying to cut off Huawei from American tech, most recently by blocking American companies from selling to it. (That has softened a little, but the effect is unclear.) ''My concern is that these trade policies are forcing the Chinese to develop their own alternatives'' to United States technology, Mr. Wheeler said. The danger: that the resulting products and services are not just good but made widely available, and cheaply, too. ''That will have an impact on our ability to lead,'' Mr. Wheeler said.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 So, now what? ''There is a need for a policy strategy,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''We've got to define winning, and then do it!''</p><p>  Killing software is hard</p><p>  Imagine you wrote some software that you thought was kind of naughty but also interesting, and you then made it publicly available. Then people were like: Sure, interesting, but not naughty -- intrusive, distasteful and dangerous.</p><p>  So you decide to take it down!</p><p>  Only, people who had downloaded it then uploaded it, putting it on code-hosting websites like GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft. Policing what is on those code-hosting sites is nearly impossible. Once software is published online, there's no getting it back, really, because there are so many corners of the web to put it in.</p><p>  Anyway, The Verge wrote:</p><p>  GitHub is banning code from DeepNude, the app that used A.I. to create fake nude pictures of women. Motherboard, which first reported on DeepNude last month, confirmed that the Microsoft-owned software development platform won't allow DeepNude projects. GitHub told Motherboard that the code violated its rules against ''sexually obscene content,'' and it's removed multiple repositories.</p><p>  So, the horrors of nudifying A.I. are on the loose. Forever.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Twitter backed off a broad overhaul of its policies on speech, focusing on removing hate against religion instead of all ''dehumanizing'' content.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Mr. Trump hosted a social media summit. Facebook and Twitter weren't invited, but a long line of pro-Trump influencers were. How democratic!</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Huawei's state ties remain under scrutiny. A study of leaked r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9s said there was ''strong evidence'' of ''a deep and lasting relationship between Huawei, its employees and the Chinese state.''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The Pentagon's cloud contract was hit by more controversy. The Wall Street Journal reported on a 2017 meeting between Jim Mattis, who was the defense secretary, and an Amazon executive.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Zoom, a videoconferencing company, brushed off concerns about the security of its software for Macs, only to fix the issues after continued outcry.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 France's digital tax is in Mr. Trump's cross hairs. His administration will investigate whether it amounts to an unfair singling out of United States companies.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Instagram introduced new anti-bullying features, including A.I. that urges users to reconsider sending potentially offensive messages.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The House antitrust subcommittee is hauling in Big Tech. It asked executives from Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple to testify at a hearing on Tuesday.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Alexa is going to deliver health advice in Britain. What could go wrong?</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Oh, yeah: Google workers reportedly listen to its Assistant recordings, just as Amazon's listen to Alexa's.</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech?

The monopolistic behaviour of companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple? The threats to privacy and access and the erosion of trust. What about fake news?</p><p>The recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data-mining organisation harvested information from more than 50 million unsuspecting Facebook users in order to meddle in the US presidential election, confirmed the suspicions of many. The early promise of technology to better society, to make the world more open, honest and free, was an elaborate con job. The principled ideology was a sham.</p><p>American investigative reporter Corey Pein is the latest to join the so-called \"tech-lash\", the global pushback against the supremacy of tech, with his book Live Work Work Work Die: A Journey into the savage heart of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Technology has made Amazon's Jeff Bezos the richest man in the world, with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page of Google not far behind.</p><p>Less is heard about the wannabes who inhabit what Pein calls \"the US's hottest billionaire factory\". One Harvard study puts the proportion of tech entrepreneurs who crash and burn at 95 per cent.</p><p>Pein was suspicious of the benevolent image the tech titans projected and, determined to cut through the hype, decided to embed himself gonzo-style within the industry's proletariat ranks. In 2015, he took his Ivy League degree and his favourite hoodie and moved to Silicon Valley with twin motives: to get rich by selling a start-up and then write a book about it. He also packed a substantial measure of cynicism and contempt for the culture. Though his start-up almost predictably failed, his book is all the better for it.</p><p>Live Work Work Work Die opens with Pein moving into an illegal Airbnb in San Francisco's warehouse district. The building he dubs Hacker Condo has more techies than beds and they all share a single key. (Luxury compared to a later abode: a tent pitched in someone's yard in Mountain View, rented off Airbnb for $35 a day.) Start-up culture worships the \"fake it till you make it\" hustle. Its denizens, Pein writes, hoover up freebies, feeding themselves at start-up party buffets and endless networking events where they \"exchange boastful inanities\" about platforms and metrics and \"delivering eyeballs\" in the \"content space\". In reality, this vast army of drones and programmers and \"tech bros\" work insane hours in a virtual bubble in the hope their revolutionary algorithm or platform will become the Next Big Thing.</p><p>Occasionally they pay to attend a pitch event where they will try to win over venture capital investors.</p><p>\"I was beginning to become acquainted with the infinite solipsism of my new milieu,\" Pein writes. \"We were grown men who lived like captive gerbils, pressing one lever to make food appear and another for some fleeting entertainment - everything on demand. Airbnb and Foodpanda served the flesh, Netflix and Lifehacker nourished the soul.\"</p><p>Pein's start-up idea is called Laborize, a company that would hire itself out to unionise its client's competition, theoretically disrupting their operations and distracting management. Sample slogan: Their solidarity is your opportunity.</p><p>It doesn't work, largely because Pein doesn't really know what he's doing: he has no business plan and zero coding ability. But he can write, in a style that is snarky and often bitingly funny.</p><p>At least it's funny until it turns frightening. From deep within the culture, Pein identifies a world view based on what he calls \"cut-throat libertarianism\", which gives the tech industry an ability to blithely disregard any harm their disruptions might cause.</p><p>\"Most people in the industry were convinced that their work was moral because it increased consumer choice and therefore freedom,\" he writes. \"New technologies were evidence of progress and therefore innately good.\"</p><p>Consumers may only now be coming to grips with the dark side of Big Tech, but Pein argues it's been there from the beginning. \"[It's not] some unfortunate misstep in an otherwise heroic effort to 'change the world',\" he writes.</p><p>Just last month, Australian entrepreneur and rich-lister Tim Kentley-Klay encountered that cut-throat world view when he was unceremoniously dumped as CEO of self-driving car start-up Zoox just a month after it was valued at $US3.2 billion ($4.35 billion).</p><p>He seemed shocked and hurt. \"Today was Silicon Valley up to its worst tricks,\" he wrote in a Twitter post. \"This town sells the story that it backs founders to create real change [but] the board chose a path of fear, optimising for a little money in hand at the expense of profound progress for the universe.\"</p><p>Kentley-Klay shouldn't have been surprised. \"Profithunger, philistinism and misanthropy are and always have been at the core of the [Silicon Valley] enterprise,\" Pein writes.</p><p>Live Work Work Work Die saves its most disquieting observations until last. Pein identifies a growing \"tech fascist\" movement that embraces dubious philosophies and \"neo-reactionary\" ideas such as eugenics and the abolition of universities and government. There are those in Silicon Valley, he says, who see themselves as members of a superior race rising above and beyond the constraints of democracy. These \"pallid princelings of Silicon Valley\" rewrote the rules of the global economy in their favour and the rest of us fell into line.</p><p>Performing uncompensated labour by posting free content.

Late last\u00a0month, the News Media Alliance (n\u00e9e the Newspaper Association of America[2]) sent the incoming Trump administration a white paper[3] detailing its policy positions on a variety of laws and regulations that it says are hurting the newspaper industry \u2014 a first for the organization. The NMA has been newspapers' official trade association and mouthpiece since 1887, and it's been lobbying on behalf of the industry since the start. Back then, the organization was focused on changing postal rates and newspaper tariffs; these days, it's trying to get government to react to the rise of Google and Facebook. </p><p>'All the issues are different now, because the media landscape has changed so dramatically,' Paul Boyle[4], the NMA's senior vice president of public policy, told me. 'And most of it is a reflection of the reality that newspapers don't have the dominant position today that they had in the market eight to ten years ago.' Of the eight\u00a0policies the organization wants Trump's transition team to pay attention to, some\u00a0of the most significant are FCC rules about media cross-ownership, which generally prevent companies from owning both broadcast stations and daily newspapers in the same market. The Nixon-era rule, passed in 1975, was designed to ensure that big companies didn't have monopoly power over information distribution in a given market. The NMA's position (like the NAA before it) is that while the rule made sense when people only had a handful of news options in their local markets, it's out of date in the age of the web and the smartphone, where digital distribution gives people nearly infinite options for where to get their information \u2014 and where newspapers find themselves competing, without much success, with big tech companies for advertising revenue. Direct comparisons are difficult, of course, but these tech companies rarely face the same kind of regulatory oversight that has built around the\u00a0newspaper industry over the past few decades, which the industry maintains puts newspaper companies at a greater disadvantage. 'When you look at even the Department of Justice's definition of a media market, you see that they only look at newspapers competing with other newspapers in a market. They do not look at newspaper competition with broadcast, magazines, cable, and the Internet. So, yeah, things have changed,' Boyle said. 'Unfortunately, in government, once you have a rule that's in place, it's hard to get rid of that rule. There needs to be a level playing field and a recognition that markets do change and you need to adjust regulations in that way.' The NMA is also asking for what it would consider a strengthening of copyright protection and a more limited application of fair use. In its letter to Trump, it argues that 'news aggregation platforms such as Google News' take too much of the revenue that it believes should be flowing to content creators: Newspaper content makes up approximately two-thirds of the content on news aggregation platforms such as Google News, but many of these relatively new players in the digital ecosystem build audiences and generate revenue from newspaper content with little if any revenue coming back to those who have invested in creating the original content. Today, the news media industry invests roughly $5 billion each year in long-form investigative journalism. Our nation's copyright laws must be structured and implemented in a way that allows for a return on this massive investment. Today, outdated interpretations of copyright laws mean that the industry is currently forced to give away much of its product for free. The government needs to put in place copyright protections that allow news organizations and other content creators to fairly benefit from their critical efforts and investments. It also argues that fair use should be constrained in order 'to prevent courts from undermining the Constitution's encouragement of compensation to entities that generate creativity and productivity.' Needless to say, these changes would face strong opposition from both tech companies and those who argue that the broad ability to quote news articles across platforms has enabled robust democratic discussion. Trump's relationship with the media has been, shall we say, less than warm, but with its pushback against regulations, the NMA hopes to find a kindred spirit in the Oval Office. Trump has railed against regulations and called for both the repeal of old rules (particularly those that he believes slow job creation and hiring) and a temporarily ban on the creation of new regulations. 'We are cutting the regulation at a tremendous clip. I would say 70 percent of regulations can go,' Trump said at a town hall event in October[5] (though an advisor scaled that number down to 10 percent). 'It's just stopping businesses from growing.' The NMA is also seeking some tweaks to the tax code. Boyle pointed to Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code[6], which gives tax deductions to companies that manufacture products in the U.S. The rule is a big advantage for newspaper companies that still print physical papers, but it doesn't apply to the investments these companies are making to build up their digital operations, where the tax deductions don't apply. The industry wants the tax laws to be more agnostic to the platform in which content is delivered. 'We're in the business of manufacturing a digital product \u2014 the tax code needs to reflect that,' Boyle said. Beyond big regulatory changes, the newspaper industry is also looking for the administration to agree to its stances on media transparency and free speech. Even before taking office, Trump attracted the ire of reporters by ditching his press pool on multiple occasions. While there are no official rules against the practice, reporters say giving the press pool uninterrupted access is key to reporters being able to do their jobs and keep the American public informed. Likewise, the NMA wants the new administration to take seriously the importance of the Freedom of Information Act and give reporters regular access to the president and government officials. The George W. Bush administration, for example, was considered by some to be relatively hostile to FOIA, and even told federal agencies that\u00a0it would defend them if they were sued[7] over not complying with information requests. The Obama administration's initial promises of increased transparency have fallen short in the eyes of journalists concerned about leak investigations and other actions, though Obama did sign the FOIA Improvement Act[8], which codified a 'presumption of openness' for government records, earlier this year. It's unclear whether Trump, who has repeatedly railed against the press, will take any of these concerns to heart. But even these transparency concerns are, at their heart, really business concerns. 'The heart of our business model is the journalism that we do. Anything that is going to chill news gathering is a concern to us,' said Boyle.Photo of Trump front page by Marco Verch[9] used under a Creative Commons license.

While he wished Hawley well in Congress, and said he was glad they were friends, Lambert also noted that he would continue to speak out when he disagreed with the senator\u2019s policy positions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cAnd he said, \u2018I assume you mean on things like tech,\u2019 \u201d Lambert recalled recently. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, mainly.\u2019\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their interaction highlights a deepening divide in Washington and around the country. The rising movement in the United States to consider charging the country\u2019s biggest tech companies with violating antitrust laws is running headlong into powerful and well-funded conservatives and libertarians committed to pushing back on those efforts. They include academics like Lambert; lawmakers like Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah; and groups like the Koch political network and others that are connected to the tech companies themselves.</p><p>These conservatives have largely dominated antitrust law for decades, leading to few breakups of big companies or blocked mergers. Although their ranks have dwindled somewhat in the last year, as anti-tech arguments have become more bipartisan, they still occupy positions stretching from Capitol Hill to campuses around the country.</p><p>But their power and influence have never been tested like this. The House Judiciary Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and almost every state attorney general\u2019s office is investigating at least one of Silicon Valley\u2019s giants. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made breaking up the tech giants and other corporate behemoths a prominent part of her presidential campaign.</p><p>Hawley, a Republican who was on the faculty at the University of Missouri\u2019s law school with Lambert, has helped lead the efforts in Congress to rethink how the government handles the big tech companies. He recently told Facebook\u2019s chief executive that he should voluntarily spin off two of his company\u2019s most valuable services.</p><p>\u201cI firmly believe that antitrust scrutiny is warranted,\u201d Hawley said.</p><p>His actions have pushed Lambert to deliver on his earlier warning, which Hawley says he does not remember.</p><p>\u201cThis thinking is dangerous for conservatives,\u201d Lambert recently tweeted after Hawley brushed off his libertarian foes. He has also repeatedly pushed back on Big Tech\u2019s critics, recently denouncing their \u201csnobbery and know-betterism.\u201d</p><p>At the center of the debate is a legal standard used to decide antitrust cases for decades. Judges and regulators often ask whether a dominant company is harming consumers and usually hang their analysis on whether prices have gone up or down.</p><p>Some proponents of looking aggressively at the tech companies argue that existing laws are adequate and that the government just needs to enforce them correctly. At least one major regulator appears sympathetic to that argument.</p><p>\u201cI think the antitrust laws are flexible,\u201d Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department, said recently at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal. He added that it was important for the laws to be \u201cvigorously enforced.\u201d</p><p>Other proponents of tough action say Congress should modify existing laws to institute a new test for monopoly cases, like factoring in the effect that a company\u2019s dominance has on workers or competitors. Still others see a solution somewhere in between.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened is the spectrum has stretched a bit,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a group that favors strong enforcement of the traditional approach to antitrust. The organization has received funding from some tech companies.</p><p>Some of the conservatives resisting the push for antitrust action say many problems with large Silicon Valley companies have nothing to do with competition. They point, for example, to concerns about privacy and accuse Big Tech\u2019s critics of applying antitrust laws to solve a problem better suited to new data regulations.</p><p>Others say efforts to change how the government polices competition are moving too fast. Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, has written a draft paper arguing that the movement to change the law \u201chas emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise.\u201d Thibault Schrepel, a professor at the Utrecht University School of Law, has said human flourishing \u201cshould be enhanced by applying reason to antitrust law; not fears, not feelings, not sentiments, not intuitions.\u201d</p><p>The tech giants back many similar arguments. Both Facebook and Google have financed a slate of groups that support current antitrust law.</p><p>Lambert and Schrepel are both affiliated with the International Center for Law &amp; Economics, a research nonprofit that has received financing from Google, Amazon and Facebook, among other major companies. Geoffrey Manne, the center\u2019s leader, said that its affiliates were not paid but that some \u201chave received honoraria for conferences or travel assistance, or grants to support their work, as have some nonaffiliates.\u201d Lambert also sits on the organization\u2019s board \u2014 a position for which, he says, he is not paid.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, Lee has led the defense of existing antitrust law.</p><p>As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, Lee has held a series of hearings over the last two years at which he or his witnesses have questioned the calls to rethink antitrust law. He was also quick to question the purpose of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s inquiry into the market power of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, accusing the panel of trying to perform a role best left to law enforcement agencies.</p><p>Lee has been accused of letting money influence his views on the subject. The GoogleTransparency Project, a nonprofit that tracks the tech giant\u2019s connections to government, recently raised questions about whether he was influenced by donations from Google and its allies.</p><p>Lee dismissed those accusations as \u201cparanoid fantasy.\u201d (The GoogleTransparency Project has received funding from Oracle, a Google competitor.)</p><p>Recently, the antitrust holdouts have found a new ally in industrialist Charles Koch. The Koch-affiliated Americans for Prosperity ran digital ads this year urging senators and attorneys general to stick to the current approach to antitrust.</p><p>Still, many of those arguing to keep the legal status quo acknowledge that the debate has shifted, with their opponents\u2019 position becoming rapidly more mainstream.</p><p>Lee said last month that the pushback was \u201cnot necessarily going to get you a lot of favorable publicity.\u201d</p><p>The debate can take on a heated and personal tone. At a conference this spring, soft-spoken legal academic Tim Wu responded to doubts raised by Tyler Cowen, an economist, about whether America has dangerous levels of corporate concentration by saying it was like arguing with someone who believes the Earth is flat. Another speaker at the same event compared one critic of the antimonopoly position to a climate change denier.</p><p>The enmity goes both ways.

While he wished Hawley well in Congress, and said he was glad they were friends, Lambert also noted that he would continue to speak out when he disagreed with the senator's policy positions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"And he said, 'I assume you mean on things like tech,'\" Lambert recalled recently. \"And I said, 'Well, mainly.'\"</p><p> Their interaction highlights a deepening divide in Washington and around the country. The rising movement in the United States to consider charging the country's biggest tech companies with violating antitrust laws is running headlong into powerful and well-funded conservatives and libertarians committed to pushing back on those efforts. They include academics like Lambert; lawmakers like Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah; and groups like the Koch political network and others that are connected to the tech companies themselves.</p><p> These conservatives have largely dominated antitrust law for decades, leading to few breakups of big companies or blocked mergers. Although their ranks have dwindled somewhat in the past year, as anti-tech arguments have become more bipartisan, they still occupy positions stretching from Capitol Hill to campuses around the country.</p><p> But their power and influence have never been tested like this. The House Judiciary Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and almost every state attorney general's office is investigating at least one of Silicon Valley's giants. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made breaking up the tech giants and other corporate behemoths a prominent part of her presidential campaign.</p><p> Hawley, a Republican who was on the faculty at the University of Missouri's law school with Lambert, has helped lead the efforts in Congress to rethink how the government handles the big tech companies. He recently told Facebook's chief executive that he should voluntarily spin off two of his company's most valuable services.</p><p> \"I firmly believe that antitrust scrutiny is warranted,\" Hawley said.</p><p> His actions have pushed Lambert to deliver on his earlier warning, which Hawley says he does not remember.</p><p> \"This thinking is dangerous for conservatives,\" Lambert recently tweeted after Hawley brushed off his libertarian foes. He has also repeatedly pushed back on Big Tech's critics, recently denouncing their \"snobbery and know-betterism.\"</p><p> At the center of the debate is a legal standard used to decide antitrust cases for decades. Judges and regulators often ask whether a dominant company is harming consumers and usually hang their analysis on whether prices have gone up or down.</p><p> Some proponents of looking aggressively at the tech companies argue that existing laws are adequate and that the government just needs to enforce them correctly. At least one major regulator appears sympathetic to that argument.</p><p> \"I think the antitrust laws are flexible,\" Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department, said recently at a conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal. He added that it was important for the laws to be \"vigorously enforced.\"</p><p> Other proponents of tough action say Congress should modify existing laws to institute a new test for monopoly cases, like factoring in the effect that a company's dominance has on workers or competitors. Still others see a solution somewhere in between.</p><p> \"What has happened is the spectrum has stretched a bit,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a group that favors strong enforcement of the traditional approach to antitrust. The organization has received funding from some tech companies.</p><p> Some of the conservatives resisting the push for antitrust action say many problems with large Silicon Valley companies have nothing to do with competition. They point, for example, to concerns about privacy and accuse Big Tech's critics of applying antitrust laws to solve a problem better suited to new data regulations.</p><p> Others say efforts to change how the government polices competition are moving too fast. Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, has written a draft paper arguing that the movement to change the law \"has emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise.\" Thibault Schrepel, a professor at the Utrecht University School of Law, has said human flourishing \"should be enhanced by applying reason to antitrust law; not fears, not feelings, not sentiments, not intuitions.\"</p><p> The tech giants back many similar arguments. Both Facebook and Google have financed a slate of groups that support current antitrust law.</p><p> Lambert and Schrepel are both affiliated with the International Center for Law &amp; Economics, a research nonprofit that has received financing from Google, Amazon and Facebook, among other major companies. Geoffrey Manne, the center's leader, said that its affiliates were not paid but that some \"have received honoraria for conferences or travel assistance, or grants to support their work, as have some nonaffiliates.\" Lambert also sits on the organization's board \u2014 a position for which, he says, he is not paid.</p><p> On Capitol Hill, Lee has led the defense of existing antitrust law.</p><p> As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, Lee has held a series of hearings over the last two years at which he or his witnesses have questioned the calls to rethink antitrust law. He was also quick to question the purpose of the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry into the market power of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, accusing the panel of trying to perform a role best left to law enforcement agencies.</p><p> Lee has been accused of letting money influence his views on the subject. The GoogleTransparency Project, a nonprofit that tracks the tech giant's connections to government, recently raised questions about whether he was influenced by donations from Google and its allies.</p><p> Lee dismissed those accusations as \"paranoid fantasy.\" (The GoogleTransparency Project has received funding from Oracle, a Google competitor.)</p><p> The holdouts may have one long-term advantage: For now, they say, federal judges are likely to agree with them. Antitrust doctrine is largely settled in court, and judges largely support it. Crane, the Michigan professor, noted that those judges could take a long time to change their ways.</p><p> Lee is biding his time.</p><p> \"Over the last two or three years, there has been something of a shift,\" he said. \"Only time will tell whether it proves to be a momentary fad or something more significant.\"</p><p> David McCabe is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-4c6752710b5157826a1dea2582926a44f2e7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XG1-WNT1-JBCN-447M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1154\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

While he wished Mr. Hawley well in Congress, and said he was glad they were friends, Mr. Lambert also noted that he would continue to speak out when he disagreed with the senator's policy positions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''And he said, 'I assume you mean on things like tech,''' Mr. Lambert recalled recently. ''And I said, 'Well, mainly.'''</p><p>  Their interaction highlights a deepening divide in Washington and around the country. The rising movement in the United States to consider charging the country's biggest tech companies with violating antitrust laws is running headlong into powerful and well-funded conservatives and libertarians committed to pushing back on those efforts. They include academics like Mr. Lambert; lawmakers like Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah; and groups like the Koch political network and others that are connected to the tech companies themselves.</p><p>  These conservatives have largely dominated antitrust law for decades, leading to few breakups of big companies or blocked mergers. Although their ranks have dwindled somewhat in the last year, as anti-tech arguments have become more bipartisan, they still occupy positions stretching from Capitol Hill to campuses around the country. </p><p>  But their power and influence have never been tested like this. The House Judiciary Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and almost every state attorney general's office is investigating at least one of Silicon Valley's giants. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has made breaking up the tech giants and other corporate behemoths a prominent part of her presidential campaign. </p><p>  Mr. Hawley, a Republican who was on the faculty at the University of Missouri's law school with Mr. Lambert, has helped lead the efforts in Congress to rethink how the government handles the big tech companies. He recently told Facebook's chief executive that he should voluntarily spin off two of his company's most valuable services.</p><p>  ''I firmly believe that antitrust scrutiny is warranted,'' Mr. Hawley said.</p><p>  His actions have pushed Mr. Lambert to deliver on his earlier warning, which Mr. Hawley says he does not remember.</p><p>  ''This thinking is dangerous for conservatives,'' Mr. Lambert recently tweeted after Mr. Hawley brushed off his libertarian foes. He has also repeatedly pushed back on Big Tech's critics, recently denouncing their ''snobbery and know-betterism.''</p><p>  At the center of the debate is a legal standard used to decide antitrust cases for decades. Judges and regulators often ask whether a dominant company is harming consumers, and usually hang their analysis on whether prices have gone up or down.</p><p>  Some proponents of looking aggressively at the tech companies argue that existing laws are adequate, and that the government just needs to enforce them correctly. At least one major regulator appears sympathetic to that argument.</p><p>  ''I think the antitrust laws are flexible,'' Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department, said recently at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal. He added that it was important for the laws to be ''vigorously enforced.''</p><p>  Other proponents of tough action say Congress should modify existing laws to institute a new test for monopoly cases, like factoring in the effect that a company's dominance has on workers or competitors. Still others see a solution somewhere in between.</p><p>  ''What has happened is the spectrum has stretched a bit,'' said Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, a group that favors strong enforcement of the traditional approach to antitrust. The organization has received funding from some tech companies.</p><p>  Some of the conservatives resisting the push for antitrust action say many problems with large Silicon Valley companies have nothing to do with competition. They point, for example, to concerns about privacy and accuse Big Tech's critics of applying antitrust laws to solve a problem better suited to new data regulations. </p><p>  Others say efforts to change how the government polices competition are moving too fast. Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, has written a draft paper arguing that the movement to change the law ''has emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise.'' Thibault Schrepel, a professor at the Utrecht University School of Law, has said human flourishing ''should be enhanced by applying reason to antitrust law; not fears, not feelings, not sentiments, not intuitions.''</p><p>  The tech giants back many similar arguments. Both Facebook and Google have financed a slate of groups that support current antitrust law.</p><p>  Mr. Lambert and Mr. Schrepel are both affiliated with the International Center for Law &amp; Economics, a research nonprofit that has received financing from Google, Amazon and Facebook, among other major companies. Geoffrey Manne, the center's leader, said that its affiliates were not paid but that some ''have received honoraria for conferences or travel assistance, or grants to support their work, as have some nonaffiliates.'' Mr. Lambert also sits on the organization's board -- a position for which, he says, he is not paid.</p><p>  On Capitol Hill, Senator Lee has led the defense of existing antitrust law. </p><p>  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, Mr. Lee has held a series of hearings over the last two years where he or his witnesses have questioned the calls to rethink antitrust law. He was also quick to question the purpose of the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry into the market power of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, accusing the panel of trying to perform a role best left to law enforcement agencies.</p><p>  Mr. Lee has been accused of letting money influence his views on the subject. The GoogleTransparency Project, a nonprofit that tracks the tech giant's connections to government, recently raised questions about whether he was influenced by donations from Google and its allies. </p><p>  Mr. Lee dismissed those accusations as ''paranoid fantasy.'' (The GoogleTransparency Project has itself received funding from Oracle, a Google competitor.)</p><p>  Recently, the antitrust holdouts have found a new ally in the industrialist Charles Koch. The Koch-affiliated Americans for Prosperity ran digital ads this year urging senators and attorneys general to stick to the current approach to antitrust.</p><p>  Still, many of those arguing to keep the legal status quo acknowledge that the debate has shifted, with their opponents' position becoming rapidly more mainstream.</p><p>  Mr. Lee said last month that the pushback was ''not necessarily going to get you a lot of favorable publicity.''</p><p>  The debate can take on a heated and personal tone. At a conference this spring, the soft-spoken legal academic Tim Wu responded to doubts raised by Tyler Cowen, an economist, about whether America has dangerous levels of corporate concentration by saying it was like arguing with someone who believes the earth is flat. Another speaker at the same event compared one critic of the antimonopoly position to a climate change denier.</p><p>  The enmity goes both ways. Some conservatives have applied a dismissive nickname to the efforts to rethink the existing laws: hipster antitrust.</p><p>  The holdouts may have one long-term advantage: For now, they say, federal judges are likely to agree with them. Antitrust doctrine is largely settled in court, and judges largely support it. Mr. Crane, the Michigan professor, noted that those judges could take a long time to change their ways.</p><p>  Mr. Lee is biding his time.</p><p>  ''Over the last two or three years, there has been something of a shift,'' he said. ''Only time will tell whether it proves to be a momentary fad or something more significant.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Senator Mike Lee of Utah (PHOTOGRAPH BY ERIN SCHAFF FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri (PHOTOGRAPH BY CARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p> Makan Delrahim, an antitrust official (PHOTOGRAPH BY JEENAH MOON FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (B7)               </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-770680191108</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFR-Y761-DXY4-X3YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/technology/powerful-coalition-pushes-back-on-anti-tech-fervor.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/technology/powerful-coalition-pushes-back-on-anti-tech-fervor.html</url><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Whatever Facebook's faults, they hardly merit the comprehensive denunciations that are common these days -- and which often preface calls for breaking up the company or imposing muscular regulation in order to prevent it from sinning again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The \"catastrophe\" example occurred in a Wall Street Journal feature in which author Marie Brenner was tasked with identifying the five best \"memoirs of moral amnesia and self-justification.\" She chose three by individuals who'd fallen under the spell of the Nazis as well as a memoir by Roy Cohn, chief counsel to Sen. Joe McCarthy. And the fifth? The book \"Zucked,\" an anti-Facebook broadside by Robert McNamee, an early investor in Mark Zuckerberg's creation.</p><p> Naziism, McCarthyism, and Facebook, the new axis of evil. Seriously?</p><p> I turned to my Facebook account to see if I could make sense of this. There I soon learned that a friend's daughter had been published in The New England Journal of Medicine, another friend had set a record flying from the highest-altitude airport in the U.S. to the lowest, and a former band mate's son was graduating from middle school. One innocuous tidbit after another from friends and acquaintances sharing moments in their lives -- or issuing political declarations that I mostly skip.</p><p> Surely this mundane experience is the norm. And notice how unessential it is, too. Critics now routinely claim Facebook is the equivalent of a \"utility\" -- with other utilities of course subject to aggressive regulation -- because of its allegedly monopolistic nature. This premise is not only dubious on its face, since we can send photos and announcements instantaneously to friends without Facebook, but also because the nature of the service is different from most utilities. They tend to supply goods we cannot do without: light, water, heat, sewage treatment, and so on. By comparison, Facebook is a distinctly discretionary product.</p><p> We all know people without a Facebook account whose lives suffer not one whit for the deprivation. I myself did not open an account until two years ago and could drop it tomorrow without regret.  It's a useful way to stay in touch with friends and keep track of acquaintances who would otherwise recede into the mist. But it is not the gas company.</p><p> Peggy Noonan, the columnist and former speechwriter for George H.W. Bush, is so worked up about the \"imperious twerp\" at Facebook -- that would be Zuckerberg -- that she has no time for subtleties. \"Break them up,\" she thundered recently about the Big Tech companies. \"Break them in two, in three; regulate them. . . . Do it incompetently, but do something.\"</p><p> Do it incompetently? A new low for industrial policy. So we should break up some of the most successful U.S. corporations even if we can't do it well and leave the arena open to dominance by foreign rivals.</p><p> (Google may be more vulnerable to charges that it is a utility since web searches are now ubiquitous in daily life and it has a huge share of the search market worldwide. Some degree of regulation is no doubt in the cards even in the U.S. Color me skeptical, however, that trust busters -- if it comes to that -- would be able to dismantle the company in a way that actually helps consumers.)</p><p> Some of the offenses ascribed to Facebook -- and social media in general -- do have a basis in fact, but also merit context. Let's take a brief run at a few of them.</p><p> 1. Facebook played fast and loose with our personal data. Yes -- think Cambridge Analytica --  but the company doesn't sell your data, as some believe. For that matter, it has never compromised my credit card number or bank account or even asked for either.</p><p> 2: It has eroded democracy by providing a platform for fake news and advertising planted by the likes of Russia. This was obviously true in 2016, and Facebook executives were initially complacent before finally moving to clamp down. But let's not pretend such machinations are a novelty of social media or that traditional journalism has never been corrupted by propaganda.</p><p> As former Miami Herald foreign correspondent Glenn Garvin recently wrote in a Reason review of the book Bureau of Spies, not only have false stories been spread for decades \"by governments from Moscow to London (and, for that matter, Washington),\" but \"journalists have frequently served as those governments' partners in their propaganda and espionage efforts -- sometimes unwittingly and other times with full intent.\"</p><p> 3. Facebook provides a platform for domestic purveyors of hatred and dangerous falsehoods and should be rooting more of it out. Perhaps it should but I'm not so sure. The consensus on what is hate and what is dangerously false breaks down rapidly after the worst actors like Alex Jones and Louis Farrakhan are given the boot.</p><p> We live at a time when an increasingly aggressive minority strives to suppress views it disagrees with. To the extent Facebook tries to satisfy such demands, it risks opening itself to accusations of bias and inconsistent treatment of speech. A company can't win an escalating exercise of content control, however hard it tries. And Lord help us if we turn to the likes of Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump to establish censorship norms.</p><p> 5. The Facebook algorithm, by prioritizing stories that produce the most user engagement, has played into the hands of those fostering violence in places like the Ukraine and Myanmar. Of all the indictments of Facebook, this one is most troubling. Facebook itself admits that prior to 2018 in Myanmar, \"we weren't doing enough to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence.\"</p><p> Whether Facebook can head off similar abuse in the future remains to be seen. Meanwhile, it's worth remembering that social media have been used to resist tyranny and oppression, too -- including a few days ago in Hong Kong.</p><p> Yes, Zuckerberg's original vision turns out to have been naive: that Facebook could become a worldwide platform free of constraints with a live-and-let-live attitude relying on the goodwill of users everywhere. But despite the missteps that followed, more than 2 billion people still seem to think it has value. A Frankenstein monster it is not.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Email Vincent Carroll at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:vcfeedback@comcast.net\">vcfeedback@comcast.net</email></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPOST-50201564451630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABC8ABA7445D DPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF0-6MT1-DXVP-V1F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144565</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1072\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Denver Post</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 23, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine? Elizabeth Warren won the ideas primary, and on Thursday she claimed that victory. Ad Policy[3] 'A year ago, people weren't talking about a two-cent wealth tax, universal childcare, canceling student loan debt for 43 million Americans while reducing the racial wealth gap, breaking up big tech, or expanding Social Security. And now they are,' she told her supporters[4]. 'And because we did the work of building broad support for all of those ideas across this country, these changes could actually be implemented by the next president.' But Warren won't be the next president[5]; winning the ideas primary did not translate into winning the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses that will identify the party's 2020 nominee. It is a measure of the vital role Warren played in the race that her exit has opened up an intense discussion about what the senator from Massachusetts will do next. Vice president. Senate majority leader. Another presidential run\u2014which Warren said she would not rule out, in answer to a question posed Thursday by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. In the short term, this frenzy of forecasting focuses on how Warren will engage with the work of choosing and then electing Donald Trump's challenger. I'll leave the speculation about whom she might endorse to others. And I'll respect that, ultimately, she will make the best decision.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/authors/john-nichols/\">https://www.thenation.com/authors/john-nichols/</url> MORE FROM John Nichols[6] What I am worried about are the decisions that must be made by the Democrats who remain in the race, former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, and by the party leaders and strategists who will shape the fall campaign. To my view, the smartest move for them would be to ask Warren to chair the party's platform committee. No one could be more adept at consulting with people who know the issues\u2014from personal experience and from rigorous research. No one could do a better job of drafting the document. It should be Elizabeth Warren who presents the platform to the convention. And when the convention is done, it should be Elizabeth Warren who takes the agenda for fundamental and necessary change onto the fall campaign trail. There are plenty of folks who will argue that Warren should lead the issues charge as the vice presidential nominee. I've always liked that idea[7], and I know that Warren could reconcile easily enough with Sanders or Biden. Indeed, if Biden emerges as the nominee, adding Warren to the ticket could ease at least some concerns about his dismal record on many of the fights over the regulation of Wall Street and the big banks where he's been wrong and she's been right. But that's not what I am arguing for. Not today.  I am arguing that Democrats ought to do something in 2020 that they have often failed to do in the past. They should recognize that the ideas of the future and the governing plan for going forward have been outlined by a candidate who is no longer in the running. And they should admit that they cannot afford to let the ideas exit with the former contender. This is not to dismiss the quality of the plans[8] the Sanders campaign has put forward, which are substantial and impressive. Nor is this to suggest that the slurry of sloganeering that Biden has proposed is in any way comparable to the detailed agendas of his more credible and progressive rivals. This is to say that in a campaign where she made a few mistakes and got a lot of bad breaks, Warren always wore two hats. Yes, she was the candidate. But she was also the organizer, the framer, and the champion of an agenda that gave meaning to the promise of big, bold structural change. Warren was radical where she needed to be radical, as she was with the opening salvo of her 2020 campaign, a detailed plan to break up big tech[9]. Go back and read what she proposed more than a year ago when she reminded us that A century ago, in the Gilded Age, waves of mergers led to the creation of some of the biggest companies in American history\u2014from Standard Oil and JPMorgan to the railroads and AT...In response to the rise of these 'trusts,' Republican and Democratic reformers pushed for antitrust laws to break up these conglomerations of power to ensure competition. But where the value of the company came from its network, reformers recognized that ownership of a network and participating on the network caused a conflict of interest. Instead of nationalizing these industries\u2014as other countries did\u2014Americans in the Progressive Era decided to ensure that these networks would not abuse their power by charging higher prices, offering worse quality, reducing innovation, and favoring some over others. We required a structural separation between the network and other businesses, and also demanded that the network offer fair and non-discriminatory service.  'In this tradition, my administration would restore competition to the tech sector,' Warren promised. It will not be her administration. But, as anti-monopolist and Bernie Sanders endorser Zephyr Teachout explained on Thursday[10], 'One amazing way we could honor the power and importance of Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign for President is to break up Facebook, Amazon, and Google.' Yes. And one amazing way to move the Democratic Party and the country in that direction is to ask Warren to lead a supercharged and amplified platform process. Putting Warren at the helm, and giving her the resources and the authority to take these ideas out of the convention\u2014where the party's 2020 platform will be adopted\u2014and on to the fall campaign trail, is not a consolation prize. It is an acknowledgment that the party needs Warren's substantial ideas and policy proposals. It is, as well, a recognition that her approach to agenda setting is necessary for a party that must work more closely with activists and movements. Warren went to the heart of the matter, on issue after issue. This is a reason she attracted the support of so many serious advocates for economic, social, and racial justice. As Suzanna Danuta Walters[11], the director of the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program at Northeastern University, so wisely observed last month in the pages of The Nation, 'Elizabeth Warren Is Running an Unapologetically Intersectional Campaign[12].' Now that campaign is done. Now it's time to invite Warren to bring to the process of defining the party's positions the genius that Walters recognized when she wrote: On New Year's Eve, Warren gave a speech commemorating the anniversary of her campaign for the presidency. Speaking to a packed crowd at the historic Old South Meeting House in Boston, calling for the importance of imagination in dark times, Warren invoked Phillis Wheatley, an enslaved black woman who, in the 1770s, in a world in which her very being was called into question, became the first black woman to publish a book of poetry in the United States. This rhetorical move was no glib campaign trick. It's reflected in Warren's other speeches and manifest in her plans on everything from climate change to disability rights. It's not just that she persistently name-checks the marginalized, but that she speaks of and with them in all their complexity. In an earlier speech in New York, she remembered the workers who perished at the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire not only as victims of corruption and greed but also as poor immigrant women.  What if the Democratic platform followed Warren's lead? What if the party decided to mount a campaign that was about more than its nominees? What if the party presented a platform that heard America singing and distilled that singing into a new language of politics and governance? What if the Democratic Party recognized Elizabeth Warren's genius for identifying big bold proposals, and making them central to our discourse, and asked her to persist?

And now they are,\" she <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/the-fight-goes-on-8f5ca2b4b557\">told her supporters</url>. \"And because we did the work of building broad support for all of those ideas across this country, these changes could actually be implemented by the next president.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-03-05/elizabeth-warren-will-drop-out-of-presidential-race\">Warren won't be the next president</url>; winning the ideas primary did not translate into winning the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses that will identify the party's 2020 nominee. It is a measure of the vital role Warren played in the race that her exit has opened up an intense discussion about what the senator from Massachusetts will do next. Vice president. Senate majority leader. Another presidential run-which Warren said she would not rule out, in answer to a question posed Thursday by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.</p><p>In the short term, this frenzy of forecasting focuses on how Warren will engage with the work of choosing and then electing Donald Trump's challenger. I'll leave the speculation about whom she might endorse to others. And I'll respect that, ultimately, she will make the best decision.</p><p>What I am worried about are the decisions that must be made by the Democrats who remain in the race, former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, and by the party leaders and strategists who will shape the fall campaign.</p><p>To my view, the smartest move for them would be to ask Warren to chair the party's platform committee. No one could be more adept at consulting with people who know the issues-from personal experience and from rigorous research. No one could do a better job of drafting the document.</p><p>It should be Elizabeth Warren who presents the platform to the convention. And when the convention is done, it should be Elizabeth Warren who takes the agenda for fundamental and necessary change onto the fall campaign trail.</p><p>There are plenty of folks who will argue that Warren should lead the issues charge as the vice presidential nominee. <url normalizedValue=\"https://madison.com/ct/opinion/column/john_nichols/john-nichols-sanders-and-warren-yes-that-s-possible/article_553e891b-e3ab-580b-853b-4c8e40608c95.html\">I've always liked that idea</url>, and I know that Warren could reconcile easily enough with Sanders or Biden. Indeed, if Biden emerges as the nominee, adding Warren to the ticket could ease at least some concerns about his dismal record on many of the fights over the regulation of Wall Street and the big banks where he's been wrong and she's been right.</p><p>But that's not what I am arguing for. Not today.</p><p>I am arguing that Democrats ought to do something in 2020 that they have often failed to do in the past. They should recognize that the ideas of the future and the governing plan for going forward have been outlined by a candidate who is no longer in the running. And they should admit that they cannot afford to let the ideas exit with the former contender.</p><p>This is not to dismiss <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/bernie-sanders-progressive-estate-tax-teddy-roosevelt/\">the quality of the plans</url> the Sanders campaign has put forward, which are substantial and impressive. Nor is this to suggest that the slurry of sloganeering that Biden has proposed is in any way comparable to the detailed agendas of his more credible and progressive rivals.</p><p>This is to say that in a campaign where she made a few mistakes and got a lot of bad breaks, Warren always wore two hats. Yes, she was the candidate. But she was also the organizer, the framer, and the champion of an agenda that gave meaning to the promise of big, bold structural change. Warren was radical where she needed to be radical, as she was with the opening salvo of her 2020 campaign, <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">a detailed plan to break up big tech</url>. Go back and read what she proposed more than a year ago when she reminded us that</p><p>A century ago, in the Gilded Age, waves of mergers led to the creation of some of the biggest companies in American history-from Standard Oil and JPMorgan to the railroads and AT&amp;T. In response to the rise of these \"trusts,\" Republican and Democratic reformers pushed for antitrust laws to break up these conglomerations of power to ensure competition.</p><p>But where the value of the company came from its network, reformers recognized that ownership of a network and participating on the network caused a conflict of interest. Instead of nationalizing these industries-as other countries did-Americans in the Progressive Era decided to ensure that these networks would not abuse their power by charging higher prices, offering worse quality, reducing innovation, and favoring some over others. We required a structural separation between the network and other businesses, and also demanded that the network offer fair and non-discriminatory service.</p><p>\"In this tradition, my administration would restore competition to the tech sector,\" Warren promised. It will not be her administration. But, as anti-monopolist and Bernie Sanders endorser Zephyr Teachout <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ZephyrTeachout/status/1235595194046676994\">explained on Thursday</url>, \"One amazing way we could honor the power and importance of Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign for President is to break up Facebook, Amazon, and Google.\"</p><p>Yes. And one amazing way to move the Democratic Party and the country in that direction is to ask Warren to lead a supercharged and amplified platform process.</p><p>Putting Warren at the helm, and giving her the resources and the authority to take these ideas out of the convention-where the party's 2020 platform will be adopted-and on to the fall campaign trail, is not a consolation prize. It is an acknowledgment that the party needs Warren's substantial ideas and policy proposals. It is, as well, a recognition that her approach to agenda setting is necessary for a party that must work more closely with activists and movements.</p><p>Warren went to the heart of the matter, on issue after issue. This is a reason she attracted the support of so many serious advocates for economic, social, and racial justice. As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/elizabeth-warren-intersectional-campaign/\">Suzanna Danuta Walters</url>, the director of the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program at Northeastern University, so wisely observed last month in the pages of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Nation</emphasis>, \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/elizabeth-warren-intersectional-campaign/\">Elizabeth Warren Is Running an Unapologetically Intersectional Campaign</url>.\"</p><p>Now that campaign is done. Now it's time to invite Warren to bring to the process of defining the party's positions the genius that Walters recognized when she wrote:</p><p>On New Year's Eve, Warren gave a speech commemorating the anniversary of her campaign for the presidency. Speaking to a packed crowd at the historic Old South Meeting House in Boston, calling for the importance of imagination in dark times, Warren invoked Phillis Wheatley, an enslaved black woman who, in the 1770s, in a world in which her very being was called into question, became the first black woman to publish a book of poetry in the United States. This rhetorical move was no glib campaign trick. It's reflected in Warren's other speeches and manifest in her plans on everything from climate change to disability rights. It's not just that she persistently name-checks the marginalized, but that she speaks of and with them in all their complexity. In an earlier speech in New York, she remembered the workers who perished at the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire not only as victims of corruption and greed but also as poor immigrant <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">women</emphasis>.</p><p>What if the Democratic platform followed Warren's lead? What if the party decided to mount a campaign that was about more than its nominees? What if the party presented a platform that heard America singing and distilled that singing into a new language of politics and governance?</p><p>What if the Democratic Party recognized Elizabeth Warren's genius for identifying big bold proposals, and making them central to our discourse, and asked her to persist?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-341964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-24H1-DXR3-2008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1301\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001333</classCode><className>PLATFORMS &amp;

Today, we were off the highs of the day, that was over 360 points, but we are still showing a gain of more than 1 percent. Same for the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500. If you look at the Dow 30, there are only stocks that are down -- United Healthcare and McDonalds. Otherwise strong gains, including, for example, the Dow which is up more than 3 percent. The markets all looking good. And these are the reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The trade propaganda war, China and the United States, each accusing each other of reneging on promises. WhatsApp is hacked, the culprits, the victims and we'll tell you what you need to do. And calls for a big tech breakup. Scott Galloway tonight on how and why to break up Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet and at the same time, be happy yourself. We are alive in the world's financial capital, New York City on Tuesday, it's May the 14th. I am Richard Quest, I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, despite prevailing fears of further escalations in the U.S.- China trade war, investors today, taking a deep breath, and in some shape or form, attempting a climb out of yesterday's crater.</p><p>We are in the final hour of trading and the U.S. markets are rebounding after Monday's selloff. The Dow is having a really good day, its best day again in nearly three months. But the truth is, we are off the best of the day. That was 364 points. So the test will be, how far it manages to hold these gains for the remainder of this volatile session towards the close.</p><p>President Trump is on a tour of a natural gas export and LNG facility as his administration and China takes turns in the negotiation blame game. We're expecting the President to speak shortly.</p><p>Now as we look at the way and we work out what the markets have been doing, how they have been reacting. We need to look at the impact of what's happening. Krishna Memani is with me to tell me more about it. Good to have you, sir.</p><p>KRISHNA MEMANI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OPPENHEIMERFUNDS: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: The impact on the market? I mean, two very serious days down or last weekend yesterday down. And now we have a reserve just a very small bounce back. Is that just an overreaction?</p><p>MEMANI: Well, no. So I think the down leg is very much justified. You know, trade wars are not good and there will be an impact on overall growth, growth in the U.S., growth on a global basis and profitability as well. So market should be down. The real question is, after they do a bit of a D rating, where do we go from here?</p><p>And I think on that front, overall global growth still looks quite decent and the direction for the market is probably higher rather than lower, recognizing that whatever our growth targets or whatever our market targets were earlier in the year, it probably ends up being somewhat lower than that now.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but the dislocation as a result of the trade, the U.S.-China trade, if it is not settled, the dispute, do the markets tumble further? How much of failure is priced in if any?</p><p>MEMANI: Well, so I think in the core, the markets are still expecting some sort of a deal at some point, in not too distant future. If at some point, it becomes quite clear that that is not going to happen and that is not going to happen in the short timeframe, I think the likelihood of markets going down is quite real.</p><p>Again, the point is the markets may go down, but from there on, they probably come back as economic growth ends up being okay, rather than catastrophic.</p><p>QUEST: I was interested to read your notes and to read your views that you quantify what you believe is the GDP or economic hardship under this and you have the U.S. in about a half of a percent of GDP, but you have China at one percent of GDP admittedly from a higher level of six to seven percent. So net-net as I've been trying to understand, who suffers most from this?</p><p>MEMANI: Well, you know, there are no winners in this. The U.S. economy is a large economy, it's a diversified economy. Imports have a lower role to play. So net effect on the U.S. is less, but let me not misguide your viewers, you know, both sides lose on this thing. The best outcome for everyone is for this to be settled and for this to be settled expeditiously.</p><p>QUEST: Is this buy on the dips? I mean, I don't mean today, but I mean, you know the market of five to seven percent. Some stocks like Boeing down 21 percent, is this buy on the dips?</p><p>[15:05:10] MEMANI: I think buying on the dip is still a good thesis. Over the last 10 years, the two things that have driven the markets are the Fed policy of low interest rates and Chinese stimulus, both of those pillars still stand today.</p><p>So our outlook is markets go up from here, but perhaps not as much as we had anticipated earlier, but the trend is still higher, rather than stay here or go lower.</p><p>QUEST: Right, final question. Donald Trump, in a tweet today urged the Fed to cut rates, join the analogy with what the people of Central Bank of China would probably do in difficult times, is he right to ask for that?</p><p>MEMANI: Well, so I think Trump has been asking for the Fed to cut rates even when we didn't have trade wars, and the economic numbers came out at three and a half. So from his perspective, it's always rate cuts. But I think in this case, he does have a point.</p><p>If the economy slows down meaningfully, given how low inflation is, the markets are actually expecting the Fed to cut rates at some point. I don't think that happens in 2019. But I think in 2020, it is a real possibility if things continue for that long.</p><p>QUEST: Excellent to have you with us, Krishna. Thank you.</p><p>MEMANI: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: The trade war has turned into a propaganda war. Each government not surprisingly, is spinning hard. President Trump started his day with a tweet storm, suggesting everything from calling on companies to move production back to the U.S., buying non-Chinese products to expressing the hope China will buy more from American farmers and call on other leaders to increase pressure on Beijing. Mr. Trump called the trade war a little squabble.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We had a deal that was very close, and then they broke it. They really did. I mean, more than just -- more than renegotiated, they really broken. So we can't have that happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: China is putting its spin on the negotiations, too. The U.S. shouldn't underestimate Beijing's willingness to stick to its position. In a press conference, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry said it was the U.S. not China, which reneged on its promises.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENG SHUANG, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN (Through translator): Last May, China and the U.S. reached an agreement in economic and trade issues and made a joint statement in Washington. But then the U.S. backed out of it a few days later. Then last December, the two also reached an agreement on Chinese purchases from the U.S., but then the U.S. raised their terms. So you absolutely can't put the hat on China of reversing positions and going back on one's promises.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: CNN's Matt Egan believes the China trade war won't last. Matt is with me. Why do you say that?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Richard, I think it's just that it really can't last because these two economies are just so intertwined and they're so important. We're talking about the two biggest economies in the world. They're each other's biggest trading partners and you know, China is sitting on $1.1 trillion of U.S. Treasuries making it America's largest foreign creditor.</p><p>And so what happens here just matters so much and it simply doesn't make any economic sense for it to continue any longer than it has to.</p><p>QUEST: But if you listen to the President today, the U.S. President, he was quite clear. He is happy with the increased money that's coming in to the Treasury. He believes the U.S. can, should and will continue if necessary, ad naseum.</p><p>EGAN: That's right. But President Trump also kind of seemed to soften his stance just a little bit. He said that he thinks that a deal can absolutely get done. As you mentioned, he went from calling it something tougher. He called it just a little squabble. He also expressed a lot of respect and appreciation for the Chinese leadership.</p><p>And China, on the other hand, has seemed to take a little bit more of a tougher stance. You know, they've had all these editorials in state media and in newspapers in recent days, and they are taking a pretty tough stance.</p><p>QUEST: In a variety of issues, there's apparel, farmers. I mean, even today, the President was talking about more help to the farmers. Well, he did this once already. It was $12 billion to $15 billion was put aside for soybean farmers. He says that they will be the farm -- the U.S. government will be the farmers' best customer if the Chinese stop buying.</p><p>EGAN: That's right. So President Trump is trying to backstop you know, the U.S. farmers. He is trying to ease some of these real serious economic concerns that farmers and other people are feeling right now because of the retaliation from China.</p><p>You know, what I think really matters here is what happens with the stock market because we know that President Trump, he checks on the market all the time. He checks on it several times a day. And so if he sees the market taking a real dive, not what's happened vote so far. So far, it was less than 5 percent. But if it was a bigger decline that would probably raise the pressure on President Trump to shift his position and maybe be more willing to reach a deal with China.</p><p>QUEST: We're nearly at the highs of the day. Were up 320 odd points on the Dow. Is this just a bounce from some serious losses? I mean, the fragility of these gains is high.</p><p>EGAN: Right. I think that what you said with your last guest was great in the sense that the market is not pricing in any sort of disaster here at all. The market apparently was pricing in a trade deal was coming. And so Bank of America put out three scenarios how this could play out.</p><p>[15:10:43] EGAN: They said, one, we could reach a deal very quickly and that would obviously be a big positive for the market. Two, there could be an intensification of the trade war and then an eventual deal. And in that scenario, we could see the market drop five to 10 percent, because earnings would hate to take a modest hit, but the negative outcome would be a full blown trade war/recession. And in that scenario, Bank of America sees a 20 percent to 30 percent decline in the stock market.</p><p>QUEST: Matt, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Matt Egan with us. Nick Valencia has been exploring the impact of the tariffs are having on small U.S. businesses. This is his dispatch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Is it panic mode yet?</p><p>VANESSA JESWANI, CO-FOUNDER, NOMAD LANE: Basically.</p><p>KISHORE VASNANI, CO-FOUNDER, NOMAD LANE: Yes. I mean --</p><p>JESWANI: We're almost there.</p><p>VASNANI: Yes. We're -- we're like tethering on the edge of panic.</p><p>VALENCIA (voice over): Kishore Vasnani, and his wife Vanessa Jeswani, own the successful travel bag company, Nomad Lane.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Each side has a zip around divider.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALENCIA: It's been around for about two years. But right now, with the current China trade war, their U.S.-based small business is taking a big hit. Vasnani, a registered Republican, blames President Trump and his new tariffs policy. He calls it a gut punch to the American public.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VASNANI: It makes us wonder what, you know, the justification is, what the reasoning is behind it and, you know, we're, you know, trying to find our way at the moment.</p><p>JESWANI: Yes, and I think it's tough because he's supposed to be, you know, pro-business, but this was not a pro-business move, especially for small businesses like us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALENCIA (voice over): The company is based in New York, but their bag is manufactured here in Wenzhou, China. After getting the news on Friday that the bags will be hit with huge tariffs when they come back into the U.S., the couple are now on their way back to Asia to find a new supplier outside of China. With an upcoming production order they have to figure it all out in less than two weeks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VASNANI: It's going to have a downstream effect on not just us, but on a wide swath of industries, accessories, products, et cetera.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALENCIA (voice over): The couple is now debating between absorbing the new costs or leaving that to the consumer. They've already been severely impacted and as a new business, aren't sure how much more costs they can take on.</p><p>Before President Trump, the tariffs for bags was 17.6 percent. Then it increased to 27.6 percent in the summer of 2018. As of last Friday, it's 15 percent more, bringing the total tariffs now to a whopping 42.6 percent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VASNANI: I think Americans love, you know, being able to find high quality products at a reasonable price. And so I think the new reasonable, you know, now has a 25 percent markup on it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALENCIA (voice over): Which, in the end, may leave the couple holding the bag. Nick Valencia, CNN, Jonesboro, Georgia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: And that puts it into context these disputes that we often talk of in grand terms actually have real people at the bottom of it or at least that are most affected.</p><p>Bayer says it will appeal against the court decisions to award worth more than $2 billion in damages to a couple who claimed Roundup weed killer caused their cancer. Bayer bought Roundup maker, Monsanto only last year. The award underscores the massive costs they could owe in the U.S. where the company is facing lawsuits from more than 13,000 plaintiffs.</p><p>Anna Stewart is in London. This latest one is not -- it's not the first and it's not going to be the last award against them. What's going on?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: This is now three out of three jury verdicts that have gone against Bayer and as you said, there are over 13,000 -- actually, 13,400 other lawsuits in the U.S. queuing up all relating to this weed killer Roundup that has his key ingredient glyphosate.</p><p>Now the current -- the one we're talking about today, the latest trial that is awarded $2 billion to the couple. That absolutely dwarfs the other two trials and obviously has investors very, very concerned. Share price down 2 percent today, Richard, but down nearly 40 percent or actually, I think just a bit over 40 percent since that made that Monsanto acquisition, which is where it gets this weed conundrum last June and they knew when they bought Monsanto that they had these pending lawsuits.</p><p>QUEST: Okay. I mean, obviously a certain amount of this will be paid by insurance companies that Bayer has, but clearly no company can continue to withstand these sorts of lawsuit awards and for very long, even if they are slashed back on appeal. How can Bayer afford this?</p><p>[15:15:07] STEWART: Well, Bayer certainly couldn't afford 13,400 at $2 billion even if that gets reduced. Obviously it couldn't, but Bayer after a while has said that it is absolutely confident, Richard, that it will overturn these decisions on appeal, but it goes to a judge they will appeal. And so far, it's been three juries all in California. The next one will be in Missouri in August. It is very confident. I have to say it has set aside costs, you know, money for legal costs, but it hasn't set aside any money for compensation. That is how confident it is. But the shareholders, the AGM just two weeks ago, it had a massive backlash, unprecedented backlash from shareholders. They're clearly not nearly as confident, I guess, as the company's Board.</p><p>QUEST: And you remind me again, where the next case takes place?</p><p>STEWART: So the next one is Missouri. This is going to come in August. It's going to be another jury verdict. But what we're really waiting for here, Richard, I don't have a date for you here is the appeal of the first one because what happens after the first appeal will be absolutely crucial as to what happens next in the other ones and the 13,400 other lawsuits.</p><p>QUEST: Anna Stewart in London, thank you. The European markets -- we will stay in Europe, they closed higher. There were major gains in Paris, following a selloff. It was the U.S.-China trade talks that led to the selloff. Donald Trump is calling it a little squabble, but the markets certainly rallied considerably, even the FTSE di rather well.</p><p>WhatsApp built a business it claimed end-to-end encryption, the safest way of sending messages. Billions of users have their messages and hoped they would stay private. But there's a security flaw that gives hackers access to your entire phone. It happens without even knowing about it. There is a fix. But let's see the damage.</p><p>Apple pushes back against allegations of a price monopoly. I'll be discussing with the entrepreneur and marketing guru, Scott Galloway, exactly who needs to be broken up and who not. It is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from New York.</p><p>QUEST: Simple, reliable, secure. That's WhatsApp tagline. And today it's somewhat ironic after it was discovered that a flaw allows spyware to be injected through its app onto your device, which can then steal all your details and allow you to be monitored willy-nilly. Apparently, all it requires is a simple WhatsApp phone call.</p><p>[15:20:07] QUEST: When the WhatsApp phone call happens, then hackers can then implant malicious code. It gives them access to your entire phone. The target so far look to be human rights activists. You haven't been assuming, it just happens.</p><p>A source tells CNN, a software from Israel's NSO group is behind the attacks. NSO obviously denies involvement, and says their technology is only used to fight crime and terrorism by legitimate law enforcement organizations.</p><p>But that's the same line that the company used when it was linked to the merger of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia. Donie O'Sullivan is in New York with me. And let's take this to the fact, first of all, WhatsApp discovered it, but apparently has already patched it, correct?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: That's correct it seems, Richard, that it was patched sometime over this past weekend. Now, what WhatsApp did when they learned about this was they started actually reaching out to human rights groups. They seemed to know that whoever was behind this attack was targeting human rights groups.</p><p>And in fact, one human rights lawyer who does not want to be identified who is based in London, who was the target of these attacks that I spoke to today, began to notice strange calls at unusual times very early in the morning coming through WhatsApp in March, and those attackers tried to hit him again on Sunday.</p><p>But by that point, he and his colleagues and WhatsApp were aware that this was happening, and they were able to stop that attack.</p><p>QUEST: I mean, what did this do? It took all the information of your phone? It allowed people to listen to your call? What did it do?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: We're not precisely sure what it could do. We do know that software from this company can basically get total access to your phone. So similar software, it's sort of a free rein into your phone once it gets on it and what's astonishing about this particular hack, as you mentioned, is that you didn't even need to answer the call. For this it to be installed on your phone, the phone just had to ring. So it is extremely troubling. WhatsApp say they have patched it, but you've just got to wonder how many more vulnerabilities out there are like this.</p><p>QUEST: NSO says, \"Look, we didn't do it. And only legitimate law enforcement people get hold of all, all software.\" I mean, that's a valid excuse or argument, if it's true, of course. But that is a valid say -- I mean, \"Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating, identifying of targets with its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\" It's not their fault.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: So here's the thing, the human rights lawyer in London, who we spoke to is involved in a case against NSO group. He is working with individuals who say they were spied on using NSO technology. So this is what sort of arose suspicion in NSO. They have very, as you say, stridently denied that they are involved in this that they have tried to hack into this individual's phone.</p><p>But that is sort of the great mystery of this, who is behind it? NSO sells this code to governments across the world and we do know that U.S. law enforcement, according to WhatsApp are now trying to look into and get to the bottom of who is behind this.</p><p>QUEST: Donie, thank you. Keep watching this all for us. Thank you very much indeed. Staying with technology, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese tech firm to sell its majority stake in Grindr of all things.</p><p>The U.S. doesn't trust Beijing's Kunlun Tech to own the gay dating app. It appears Grindr is the latest victim of U.S.-China tensions. Our tech correspondent Samuel Burke joins me now.</p><p>Exactly -- I mean, this is an unusual one, A, because of the nature of Grindr and B, because it was a deal that was already done and it's the U.S. regulator. Why?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: It was a deal that was done some years ago, actually. But at the heart of this is very similar to the Huawei allegations, the U.S. fears that information data that could be collected by Grindr and is in fact collected by Grindr could be used, stored on Chinese servers, and then the government could come in and get that data and somehow use it, the Chinese government against American citizens.</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen in case people aren't familiar with Grindr, which is of course very popular in the GBT community -- just men so we won't use the L there. It has information like sexual orientation, fetishes, HIV status even and so they're worried that this information could be used against government employees potentially and used to blackmail them.</p><p>[15:25:07] BURKE: And so they have reached a deal now so that this Chinese company will sell the app back to the United States and they agree that there's no way to monitor this, to not give over any data by the time they sell it back in 2020.</p><p>QUEST: All right, but the U.S. -- what's the game here? What is the U.S. trying to do? I mean, does the U.S. really care that much about the sexual proclivities that may be revealed on Grindr? Or is this a bigger issue in terms of China and the U.S. trade?</p><p>BURKE: Well, you could say that the proof is in the pudding. The fact that this is a relatively small app, yes, there were plans to make it go public. But it's not collecting the huge amounts of data that let's say, 5G will with Huawei. So in a sense, you can say it doesn't appear that it is about economics, and that really is perhaps about sexual proclivities, that they're very much worried that this data could be used, particularly against government workers.</p><p>So I would say that this situation would back up some of the bigger fears that the United States says they legitimately have about data use and that it doesn't appear to be part of the financial back and forth between the United States and China.</p><p>QUEST: Samuel Burke, with Grindr. Thank you. The U.S. Supreme Court says iPhone users can sue Apple for running a price monopoly. Now of course, the tech titans, should they be broken up? Scott Galloway is an author and professor, tells me, yes. And he is going to tell me how it should be done. He's also written an extremely good thought, \"The Algebra of Happiness.\" You're not breaking up, Scott Galloway, I'll tell you what you do need to be doing in a moment.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. Presidential candidates want to break up the big tech companies, Scott Galloway will tell us how to do it and more importantly, whether it's even necessary. He thinks, it appropriately, it is. And streaming wars take a turn as Disney takes full control of Hulu.</p><p>[15:30:00] Before we get to any of that, this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>The Dow is having its best day in nearly three months as the U.S. markets rebound following Monday's heavy sell-off. Investors are setting aside worries over a further escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. All the major indices are higher, but off the best of today.</p><p>The Russian President Vladimir Putin says he wants to fully restore ties with Washington. He's just finished meetings and talks with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Sochi. Mr. Putin denied interfering in U.S. elections and praised the Mueller report which found that Russia did indeed interfere in a quote, \"sweeping and systemic fashion.\"</p><p>Donald Trump's efforts to stop Congress from seeing his tax returns may be in trouble. A Washington judge had some very pointed questions for Mr. Trump's lawyers at the hearing. The judge must decide whether to allow Congress to subpoena tax records from the president's accountants.</p><p>Saudi Arabia says it has stopped pumping oil at a major pipeline after two pumping stations were attacked by armed drones. The Energy -- the Saudi Energy Minister says the drones caused minor damage. It follows Riyadh saying two of its oil tankers had also been damaged near the Strait of Hormuz.</p><p>Tens of thousands more protestors are expected to reinforce a mass sit-in in Sudan after a night of deadly -- after a night of deadly violence. Soldiers used bulldozers to clear pro-democracy protestors in Khartoum on the front lines of the sit-in. Unknown gunmen also opened fire, at least six people were killed.</p><p>A rebound is taking place in Apple's shares after Monday's drop of nearly 6 percent. So it's put on the best part of two today. Apple is on track to close with a gain as you see for the day overall. The company says it will prevail against a lawsuit that accuses Apple and the app store of using monopolistic pricing policies.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the anti-trust case can proceed, but note, that is just a procedural issue, it's still got to go ahead the claimants and actually win the case. So from -- so from Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes to all U.S. presidential hopefuls, there are repeated calls to break up all the major tech companies.</p><p>And by that, you're talking about obviously Apple with its music and its app store. You've got Google, which have got all those, of course. Facebook has an infrastructure and an architecture of WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger and the like. And Amazon, with its three vast divisions.</p><p>Now, Scott Galloway has advocated to break up and explains how to turn the four into their component parts. So Amazon becomes three fulfillment, AWS and cloud services and the media group. Apple could be broken up or regulated with devices, iTunes and app store, and Facebook goes into social brands such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger and the like.</p><p>You put it all together, and you see with Google, you also break them up as well. Now, we want you to join in this conversation on your digital device, should big tech be broken up? It really is as simple as that. Should it be broken up, yes or no?</p><p>Scott Galloway is with me, the professor of marketing at NYU. Scott, before we -- so we know where you stand --</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Should it be broken up?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Oh, 100 percent. We want to oxygenate the economy, we want those numbers on the screens to be -- continue to be green. If you were to break this company up, distinct of the weaponization of platforms, distinct of the power, distinct of their inability to prohibit bad actors from weaponizing their platforms, let's make the shareholder argument.</p><p>If you look at almost every major break up, whether it was Telcos, the old companies, several years post-the break up, the combined companies were worth a great deal more than the original companies.</p><p>QUEST: But you take, for example --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Facebook --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: I mean it only put WhatsApp in there a few years ago, and Instagram came along a bit late after that.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: You're breaking things up, I mean, normally you know, think of IBM, Standard Oil, AT&amp;T, companies that have been around decades.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: He's been around minos --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, but look at the power. I mean, and they're so here close to home, but when the DOJ filed the suit against AT&amp;T's acquisition of \"Time Warner\", they were worried about bringing together 130 million people.</p><p>[15:35:00] In terms of AT&amp;T contracts and \"DirecTV\", yes, we're going to let WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger encrypt a back-end communications platform that reaches 2.7 billion people.</p><p>QUEST: But there are -- the argument Facebook makes, and I'd like to hear you, so tell me why you think it's wrong, is that there's plenty of choice. There are loads of alternatives for example to a Messenger service.</p><p>There are alternatives to an Instagram, maybe they're not as successful, but there are --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Right --</p><p>QUEST: All these alternatives available, and it's not Facebook's problem or Google's problem that they've been successful.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, it's not their problem. It's not -- and they haven't -- I would argue they haven't done anything wrong. But I don't agree with the fact that there's alternatives. There hasn't been a major social media network of any real substance founded since 2011. I mean, where do you go?</p><p>If you -- if you shut off Facebook and you want to reach your sisters and your mom back in Britain, where do you go? What messaging platforms or social media networks are out there? This company literally controls 80 percent, 90 percent of social media traffic.</p><p>So this kind of defines monopoly. I mean, if you look at the fastest growing parts of our economy, social, search devices, there's typically one or two companies that control almost all of it.</p><p>QUEST: So which of them would you break up?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Sure.</p><p>QUEST: So, I mean, because, you know, you -- Facebook, you've done, yes?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, but let's talk about criteria, first --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>GALLOWAY: You want to restore competition, and secondly, you also don't want to kneecap these companies. You want their shareholders to benefit. You want sort of a Goldilocks strategy. So the most obvious one or I think the easiest one is Amazon spinning AWS.</p><p>Because on the spin, AWS is one of the ten most valuable companies in the world, and Amazon can no longer subsidize their retail platform with the profits from AWS. When the Chinese came in and priced steel below price, of course in the '80s, we call that dumping.</p><p>When Amazon subsidizes the retail platform with AWS, we call it innovation. On the spin, the shareholders benefit. AWS has a bigger market as an independent company, Richard, because Wal-Mart won't use AWS right now because it's owned by a competitor. So AWS thrives, more competition, better for the economy, better for the planet.</p><p>QUEST: And to the argument -- well, yes, but we'll pay more for Amazon because there won't be that subsidy --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Sure --</p><p>QUEST: That exists.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, so that's a correct question because right now all anti- trust law is based on consumer harm. But it used to be in the Brandiesian days based on competition. Where it said if competition is suppressed for long enough, ultimately a company can charge monopoly-like profits.</p><p>Look at the marketplace, the marketplace is valuing Amazon at a multiple valuation of any other retailer, and the market is telling us that at some point, this company is going to be able to charge monopoly-like prices because it's putting other retailer --</p><p>QUEST: Is there evidence, because the --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Sure --</p><p>QUEST: Problem with Facebook is -- so we break up Facebook, you break up Amazon, who else would you break, Google?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Oh, Google, spin YouTube and probably Google Cloud.</p><p>QUEST: Right, anybody else? Apple --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, Facebook -- Apple is a tougher one because Apple --</p><p>QUEST: There's competition everywhere for Apple.</p><p>GALLOWAY: True and also with Apple, the key asset there is the brand. So who gets -- who gets stewardship of the core asset of the brand? So that's a difficult one. I think when the case of the app store, that might require regulation, not anti-trust if you will.</p><p>QUEST: Why -- and the Supreme Court obviously --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Sure --</p><p>QUEST: Is looking at, why would regulation not work in the case of these other companies? But I can see maybe Amazon web services is more difficult to do a regulatory issue because they're very different.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: The components are very different. But in the case of Facebook --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: There's a commonality that could be regulated between the three.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, I would argue the anti-trust is sort of a gift that keeps on giving. That if you look at almost every anti-trust action, there's very few government interventions that kind of always work. And it would be difficult to find an instance where anti-trust in breaking up companies didn't work.</p><p>So I think that's sort of a go to, is break them up and let them flourish. Most tech spins have resulted in -- have been a creed of the shareholder values. So I actually think anti-trust and breaking them up is the more capitalist thing to do before you go to regulation.</p><p>QUEST: Funny, when we started the discussion, we had about 75 percent of people saying that, no, they shouldn't be broken up. Your argument is obviously persuasive because --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Not persuasive enough --</p><p>QUEST: Well, you know, 67 percent --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Oh, they said yes or no, is --</p><p>QUEST: While you've been arguing --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: While you've been discussing, 67 percent now say --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, it's working.</p><p>QUEST: They should be -- they should be broken up. Do you hold out any realistic possibility --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: That action will be taken. Regard -- I mean, at the moment, every democratic presidential candidate --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Wants to break up everything.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, I do think for the first time, I actually believe the worm has turned and we're moving towards anti-trust. However, where it might happen or where it might -- you might see the seeds of it is abroad. And that is in Europe, they register all of the downside of big tech, the job disruption, monopoly behavior, the abuse of the platforms.</p><p>But they recognize a fraction of the upside. So I think they will make it so difficult for these companies that ultimately they start to maybe even prophylactically decide to do this. My big prediction, Richard, is that Jeff Bezos; the smartest man in business prophylactically spins AWS so he can stave off regulation and anti-trust.</p><p>[15:40:00] QUEST: Stay where you are.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thank you --</p><p>QUEST: We're going to talk about your new book --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thanks, Richard --</p><p>QUEST: In just a moment. All three, first though, WhatsApp is under fierce scrutiny for becoming a hotbed of false information during India's general election. Now, as deja vu for the messaging services, parent company Facebook, no stranger to electoral propaganda. Nikhil Kumar filed this dispatch from the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIKHIL KUMAR, CNN NEW DELHI BUREAU CHIEF (voice-over): As India votes, a typical village scene in northern Uttar Pradesh state. A post-lunch huddle about who might win. These men are discussing the latest political news. Their main source, messages and posts on Facebook and WhatsApp.</p><p>PRAVEEN TYAGI, INDIAN VOTER (through translator): We only use WhatsApp and Facebook, that's the internet for us. And with the election, my phone is flooded with political messages.</p><p>KUMAR (on camera): Almost everyone we've spoken to in this village has a phone and they're often relying on the messages they see there, the politically-themed videos and memes to decide who gets their vote. It's their main source of news. The electoral battleground, it's in their hands.</p><p>(voice-over): But the terrain is murky, littered with fake news that can sometimes prove fatal. Authorities here say fake rumors spread on WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook triggered mob attacks that claimed more than a dozen lives in 2018.</p><p>Experts in Indian politics are worried that during the elections, social media could be used to divide communities or worse, trigger political violence. Facebook already under scrutiny after the 2016 U.S. presidential election has set up this election war room in California. Sitting in Silicon Valley, these Facebook staffers are keeping a close eye on posts being seen by hundreds of millions of Indian voters.</p><p>KATIE HARBATH, PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR FOR GLOBAL ELECTIONS, FACEBOOK: We're starting to see a wide variety of different tactics that people might be using to interfere with the elections. One of those that we've been investing a lot in our capabilities around is video or audio that might be altered to not be truthful.</p><p>KUMAR: Indian police are also worried, this is just one of the many special units set up to monitor social media around the clock. And WhatsApp has launched a massive campaign to warn Indians about the threat of fake news. With more than 200 million users, this is app's single biggest market.</p><p>Back in Uttar Pradesh, the problem is clear, voters say it's often hard to figure out which political message on social media is real and which is fake.</p><p>TYAGI: We can't trust every message. We've got a lot of fake messages. We just don't know what's true. Social media has become more than just a tool for mobilizing support. It's become a weapon for peddlers of misinformation. And voters like these often don't know what to believe. Mikhil Kumar, CNN, Uttar Pradesh, India.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Now, we turn from business strategy to life strategy after the break. Scott Galloway's book is called \"The Algebra of Happiness\", this is the pursuit of success, love and meaning. Which is somewhat extraordinary from a professor of marketing and branding. We'll talk about it in a moment after --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thanks, Richard --</p><p>QUEST: The break.</p><p>[15:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: The curve of happiness over a lifetime is the shape of a smile. That's one of the key themes in Scott Galloway's new book \"The Algebra of Happiness\". It explores both our needs for professional success and personal fulfillment. The book is out today, Scott is still with us. This is a compendium of the sort of advice or suggestions that you have given your students over the years. What's its purpose?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So I think -- well, if it's a purpose of personal self discovery, I look to stock my blessings and I took stock of my mood and one didn't foot the other. So I started looking at all of the wonderful research out there on happiness. And also the way I write books is I take my most popular course, I turn it into a video, and if the video does well, I turn it into a book.</p><p>And the last session of my course, 4,000 students is trying to distill all of this research and observations and personal experiences down to a set of equations around best practices for not only creating happiness, because happiness is a sensation.</p><p>You can get happiness from Chipotle, Netflix and Cialis. What I'm really talking about is the investments and relationships and the decisions we make through our life to create an art of satisfaction. Such at the highs and the lows that we all experience happen on a higher plain. And it's my most popular class.</p><p>QUEST: Can anybody do it? I don't mean anybody in the class --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Is it one of these things that is -- it's deceptively simple to read --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: And unbelievably difficult to achieve.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, and to be clear, you know, it's misleading, because I don't think there is any one equation. I think people have to chart their own course. But there are best practices, Richard --</p><p>QUEST: Such as --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, let me cut to the -- if there's a secret source, the larger study of happiness of its kind, the Harvey Grant(ph) study tracked 400 men through their life tracked literally everything they did, their food, their relationships or exercise and query them on their happiness and satisfaction, and they found the one factor most common across the cohort that was happiest was simple, the depth and number of meaningful relationships.</p><p>At work, do you feel respected and admired, and do you respect and admire other people. Amongst your friends, do they feel a sense of joy and camaraderie from you? And do you feel joy and camaraderie from them and then most importantly at home with your family? Do you feel an intense level of love and support?</p><p>And most importantly, do you know they feel that intense level of support and love from you. The greatest academic study in history has the best opening line of an academic study, and the line is the following: \"Happiness is love\", full stop.</p><p>QUEST: Right, and if you haven't got it --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: I mean, it might be a bit late. But if you come -- if you suddenly realize --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: One is wanting --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: What do you do then?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we talk about compound interest, making small investments over time result in something huge at the end of life. A $100 a month can turn into a million dollars, start making the small investments in relationship, reaching out to people, texts, notices of appreciation. These things add up to something meaningful.</p><p>QUEST: Right, and on that, we've just shown it on the -- on the screen.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: You got work-life balance --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Balance, yes --</p><p>QUEST: That I'll admit, I have successfully got wrong for the best part of three decades.</p><p>GALLOWAY: And now you have it. And this is what I tell my young kids, and it's a bit -- it's a bit counter to what we're talking about before. If you expect to be in an economic weight class in the top 10 that slips -- in the top 1 percent which most young people aspire to, then realistically, myth of balance or balance is a myth.</p><p>And that is we all know somebody who's great at what they do, donates time at the ASPA and has a food block, assuming you're not that person. If you want to be very successful, pretty much plan on working and doing not a lot else in your 20s and 30s.</p><p>QUEST: In the last 10 seconds, the one thing you would have changed?</p><p>GALLOWAY: The one thing?</p><p>QUEST: I know you've been asked this a million times.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Sure --</p><p>QUEST: But what is the one thing you would change?</p><p>GALLOWAY: The universe wants to prosper. The happiest people get the incentive of the following, and that is if they love someone else completely and they don't keep score, they just decide to go all in and focus irrationally on their well-being, they resolve -- they are rewarded with tremendous happiness.</p><p>I wish I had started making those investments earlier in my life.</p><p>QUEST: I'm glad you came along today to talk about it --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thanks, Richard --</p><p>[15:50:00] QUEST: Thank you very much. Disney, talking of happiness, going for the streaming wars. Full control of Hulu, we need to understand why after the break.</p><p>QUEST: The streaming wars are taking a turn. Disney now getting full control of Hulu. At one point, Hulu had four owners, Disney, \"21st Century Fox\" Comcast and our own parent company \"Warner Media\". Now, of course, things have moved on. Comcast is the latest to sell out, 33 percent stake gone. It leaves Disney the last one standing, takes full control.</p><p>Brian Stelter, why are they doing it? I mean, Disney is already starting its own streaming service. What do they get -- I mean, besides 20-odd million people. But it's a different service, Hulu.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR, RELIABLE SOURCES: It is a different service, but it does give them a base for further expansion, further growth of the subscription marketplace. We know Disney is going to be launching this Disney-plus service aimed at families and everybody later this year.</p><p>Hulu is more of an adult-themed service. A lot of programs at the hand- made sale and other shows, the kids aren't going to be interested in it, but adults will. This gives Disney yet another arrow in its quiver in the streaming wars.</p><p>Big picture, of course, Richard, is we're moving from an all you can eat buffet of streaming, something like Netflix into a world of a food court where you've got to go to a lot of different places if you want a lot of different content or a lot of different parts of your meal.</p><p>There's going to be Disney and \"Warner Media\" and Comcast and all the rest. And we're seeing this play out --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>STELTER: Step by step, and today was a big step in that direction.</p><p>QUEST: And \"Warner Media\" itself has been rumors and leaks about whether or not \"Warner Media\" content will -- \"HBO\" content, tell me, what's the word on the street?</p><p>STELTER: Yes, \"AT&amp;T\" CEO Randall Stephenson, of course, our ultimate boss, CEO at CNN spoke today at an investor conference and went further than he ever gone before in revealing \"AT&amp;T's\" plans about this. He says, \"increasingly, the Warner Brothers films and TV shows that are right now available on services like Netflix and elsewhere will increasingly be coming home so to speak.</p><p>Coming into the \"Warner Media\" library for the \"Warner Media\" streaming service. That's going to be soft-launched later this year and have a bigger launch in early 2020. That's another example of what Comcast is doing as well. What they say bringing shows home, \"The Office\" for example is a big hit on Netflix, \"NBC\" is going to have it within its own library as well in a couple of years, so we can sell ads against episodes of \"The Office\" --</p><p>QUEST: Right, but --</p><p>STELTER: The big question is whether these will be exclusive or non- exclusive deal.</p><p>QUEST: And at the end of the day, how much --</p><p>STELTER: Right --</p><p>[15:55:00] QUEST: Good stuff do you have on the shelf? Because you know, fine, so you've got \"The Office\", but if you've got nothing else, then you know, you're not going to -- people are not going to spend a streaming service for limited gains. So where do we think the break point is for streaming services?</p><p>STELTER: Right, is it going to be $30 a month or $40 a month or $50 a month? I don't think we know yet. I think this market is being tested every day as more and more people sign up for the first time for these various services. These are incredibly complex deals that are being re- done, renegotiated.</p><p>All of that is on the business end. On the consumer front-facing end of this, the question is exactly what you said. How many services are people willing to pay for? It's probably more than two or three, it might be less than ten. This is a giant experiment to unwind the cable bundle and then start to rebuild a new --</p><p>QUEST: Wow --</p><p>STELTER: Form of streaming bundle. It's going to go on for a year.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, Brian, as always --</p><p>STELTER: You too --</p><p>QUEST: I appreciate it, thank you. I'm going to show you a quick look at the final look at the markets. Your Dow is still the strongest in the markets, recovering and you see we're all off of the top of the day, well off the top. But still it's going to end with a gain of about 1 percent. We will have our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment. It is only with the setting of the sun that one judges how well the day went. I can't remember which philosopher said that, but it's basically the thesis behind \"The Algebra of Happiness\", Scott Galloway's book. It is so temptingly easy to get wrapped up in the rat race in one's 20s, 30s and through one's 40s, as you battle on, forgetting all the good lessons of basically the golden rule.</p><p>\"Do unto others as you'd have them do unto yourself and be kind and nice to people and they might do it back to you at the same time.\" Which is why I find this book fascinating, and Scott Galloway writes beautifully on the subject. It's easy to win in the rat race of the corporate ladder.</p><p>But to actually win in the life-long race is much more difficult and requires many more lessons. It's worth having a read of this, it's useful. And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>The Dow is up, the bell is ringing, the day is done.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019051401cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W41-XJG1-JB20-G1NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8065\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 14, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC000A4E9</classCode><className>OPPENHEIMERFUNDS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS523991 TRUST, FIDUCIARY &amp;

Big tech companies have opposed the legislation and petitioned the Kremlin against it, Eurasia Diary reports citing Russia Today.</p><p>The idea of having Russian applications pre-installed on any smartphone, computer or smart TV sold in Russia to make them more attractive for the locals and give customers a broader choice was welcomed by several Russian internet giants. However, the legislation provoked quite a stir from a number of foreign companies, some of which even came together to send Putin a letter, outright asking him to veto the controversial bill.</p><p>It appears that Putin was not persuaded by the plea, made by a major association that includes such giants as Google, Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Dell, IBM, LG and others, though it warned that making Russian software mandatory might lead to a 'decrease in business activity in the consumer electronics and software markets' and eventually to their 'monopolization.'</p><p>Media speculated that some foreign companies could leave the Russian market altogether if confronted with strict new regulations. One such company is rumored to be Apple - the tech giant known to be uncompromising when it comes to their own preinstalled software.

When asked if company directors should face criminal prosecution for such breaches, 76 per cent of Scots agreed.</p><p>Last week, the UK Government released a White Paper on 'online harms' which proposed introducing an independent regulator to enforce a legal duty of care on tech companies.</p><p>NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: 'These latest figures show there is overwhelming support for both corporate and individual criminal liability in cases where tech companies significantly fail to protect children from harm.</p><p>'We urge the Government to take this crucial opportunity and decide on legislation that will make tech firms feel the full weight of the law if they fail in their duty of care to children.' Consultations are under way at Westminster on proposals such as making senior managers liable for gross breaches and whether this should be criminal rather than civil liability.</p><p>The NSPCC argues it must be classed as criminal and that a new corporate offence should be created so that technology firms can be prosecuted for failures in their duty of care to children.</p><p>However, critics warn that curbs on the internet would undermine civil liberties and entrench big tech firms.</p><p>There are growing fears about the impact that social media usage is having on adolescents. This week's Scottish Government report highlighted analysis indicating a reduction in the mental health of 13 and 15-year-old girls between 2010 and 2015.</p><p>It pointed out that use of online technologies has increased at an unprecedented rate over the past decade, with those now reaching adolescence being the first generation to have grown up in a world dominated by mobile technology.</p><p>Research indicates girls in the UK aged between ten and 15 are twice as likely as boys to spend more than three hours on social networking sites on a normal school day.</p><p>This month, Prince Harry became the latest public figure to speak out about the dangers of online platforms, arguing that 'social media is more addictive than alcohol and drugs'.</p><p>Last year, then Westminster culture secretary Matt Hancock suggested children could be limited to two hours of social media a day under UK Government online safety plans.</p><p>He said a cap on usage for under-18s could also cover popular online games such as Fortnite. Imposing it would be fraught with difficulty, but ministers believe technology firms have the ability to limit access.</p><p>Mr Hancock said: 'My instinct is that parental controls don't work unless they have a strong backstop behind them.'

Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, and Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, requires commercial data operators with more than 100 million monthly active users to disclose the types of data they collect and regularly provide users with assessments on the value of the data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bill would also require these large data collectors to file annual reports detailing the total value of user data they have collected and disclosing their contracts with third parties involving data collection.</p><p>The sponsors said the bill is necessary to inform consumers about the value of the data they\u2019re giving up in exchange for using free online services.</p><p>\u201cFor years, social media companies have told consumers that their products are free to the user,\u201d Warner said in statement. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true \u2014 you are paying with your data instead of your wallet.\u201d</p><p>A lack of transparency in online data collection \u201cmade it impossible\u201d for consumers to understand what they\u2019re giving up to use free online services and know what other companies their data is being shared with, Warner added. The bill will encourage competition and allow antitrust enforcers to identify anti-competitive data collection practices, the sponsors said.</p><p>For years, some privacy advocates have been calling for more transparency in the online data collection market. Some praised the DASHBOARD Act for giving consumers more information about their data.</p><p>\u201cWhen consumers fully understand how much their personal data is worth, they are likely to begin more closely examining the services they use and understanding that the services they believe they use for free are actually being paid for with their personal information,\u201d said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy advocate at ProPrivacy.com.</p><p>Still, the bill doesn\u2019t actually stop websites from collecting personal information, Walsh added. </p><p>The bill would help people better understand the internet economy because data is its currency, added Stafford Palmieri, president of Palmieri Partners, a boutique growth consulting firm with a privacy by design practice that focuses on implementing privacy and data security compliance programs. \u201cThe problem is that we don\u2019t know how much that currency is worth because there is no market clearing price,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas I can decide whether I think a $70 pair of shoes is worth not spending that $70 on something else, I don\u2019t have a mechanism to value, let\u2019s say, Google Maps.\u201d</p><p>However, one recent study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology put the annual value of a search engine at $17,530, of email at $8,414, and of online maps at $3,614. \u201cIf Google slapped that price tag on any or all of their currently free services, would people really pay, or even be able to pay, $17,530 per year to use Google Search?\u201d Palmieri asked.</p><p>In addition to the data value disclosures, the DASHBOARD Act would allow users of online services to ask that their personal data be deleted in many circumstances, potentially leading to changes in online services. Palmieri said that if consumers are more easily able to opt out of data collection, some formerly free services may end up behind paywalls, and smaller services may fail.</p><p>\u201cRegulating data means a fundamental shift in the monetization strategy of the internet,\u201d she added. \u201cIf app developers who were previously monetizing through ads now have to charge because consumers are opting out of sharing their data, a lot of consumers may decide that that free app is no longer worth paying for. This could entrench the large incumbents as well as create an access barrier for those least able to pay.\u201d</p><p>The new bill seems based on the assumption that consumers are getting a \u201crotten deal\u201d by trading their personal data for free online services, said Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank focused on tech policy.</p><p>The sponsors \u201care arguing that consumers are giving up too much data in exchange for free services, and if consumers only knew the value of their data, they would have sticker shock and stop sharing so much personal information,\u201d he added.</p><p>But paying for a service with personal data is not the same as paying with money, he added. \u201cUnlike money, consumers do not have less data after sharing personal information, and they can share that same data with other services as well,\u201d Castro said. \u201cOn the contrary, for most commercial services, consumers always come out ahead by sharing data in exchange for a free service.\u201dStory URL</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2256419472</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPV-2TH1-JBHT-D4YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

At this point, only a major rewrite of the industrial era antitrust statutes can bring the tech titans to heel.</p><p>The outlines of such a revision are contained in a number of written submissions made to the House antitrust subcommittee, including one by a dozen of the country's top antitrust economists and lawyers who conclude that \"current antitrust doctrines are too limited to adequately protect competition . . .  or stop anticompetitive conduct.\" They lay out several changes in the law to reverse a series of court rulings that have opened the door to over-consolidation in virtually every sector of the economy, nowhere more so than in tech, where there is a natural tendency of customers to want use the same software, communicate on the same network or transact business on the same platform as everyone else.</p><p>While this \"network effect\" explains much of the winner-take-all competition in the tech sector, mergers and acquisitions have also played a role. The four companies represented at Wednesday's hearings, along with Microsoft, have collectively bought 720 companies over the past 30 years, according to testimony from the American Antitrust Institute. </p><p>Google's purchase of YouTube and Waze, Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's purchase of Zappos and Ring - all of these were given the green light by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Hundreds of other deals were too small even to be reviewed. In only one of those 720 did the government move to block the deal - Google's purchase of travel software firm ITA - only to be rebuffed in court.</p><p>\"We went from an antitrust culture [in the 1970s] where \"the government always wins\" to one where enforcers almost always lost, or where fear of losing caused the government not to act at all,\" wrote Bill Baer, who headed the Justice Department's antitrust division during the Obama administration, in his submission to the House subcommittee.</p><p>The economic premise behind the decades-long retreat from antitrust enforcement - much of it originating at the economics departments of the University of Chicago and the law school at George Mason University - is that three firms are sufficient to provide competition in any market, monopolies are only temporary and that mergers create efficiencies that are reliably passed on to consumers in lower prices. Business practices restricting customers or disadvantaging competitors - bundling products, exclusive contracts, pricing restraints and withholding services from rivals - once considered anti-competitive, are now assumed to be pro-consumer. And in deciding whether to block a merger or outlaw business practices, judges no longer take a broad look at the competitive landscape, but rely on technical economic analyses of how much prices will go up or down.</p><p>A reformed and modernized antitrust law would reject all of these presumptions, reverse those rulings and make clear that under-enforcement of the antitrust laws is a greater risk to the vibrancy of the American economy than over-enforcement.</p><p>For starters, there should once again be some bright lines  that should rarely, if ever, be crossed. Companies with more than 40 or 50 percent market share should be prevented from buying any direct competitor, no matter how small, to protect current and potential competition. </p><p>Dominant firms in highly concentrated markets should also be barred from buying any company in an adjacent market, particularly ones that are also high concentrated. Such a provision would have prevented pharmacist CVS from buying health insurer Aetna, the AT&amp;T phone company from buying the cable company Time Warner and Ticketmaster buying concert promoter Live Nation.</p><p>In highly concentrated markets, the legal burden should be with the companies to demonstrate that a merger or business practice would not reduce competition, rather than on the government to prove that it would - a huge difference in the world of antitrust litigation. In arguing its case, the government would be required to show only that a merger or business practice poses a credible risk of reducing competition, well short of the current burden to prove that competitive harm is likely or probable, or all but certain.</p><p>A 21st century antitrust law would also make clear to judges that the purpose of antitrust law is to protect and enhance competition not only because it lowers prices, increases choice and improves quality for consumers, but also because it stimulates innovation, reduces income inequality and reduces the concentration of economic and political power.</p><p>Recent court decisions, more narrowly, have declared that competition is enhanced by anything that benefits consumers, and what benefits consumers is lower prices. But in an economy in which some companies give away their services free (think Facebook and Google), a merger or business practice can reduce competition without raising prices. And in markets where companies serve multiple sets of customers (think credit card companies and their cardholders and merchants), what benefits some customers might harm others. Judges need to be reminded that economic efficiency is not the holy grail.</p><p>\"In the search for quantification and scientific precision, economists have taken to defining too narrowly what competition means and how it should be measured,\" said John Kwoka, an economist at Northeastern University.</p><p>A broader analysis of competition would require judges and regulators to consider how U.S. prices compare to foreign prices and how profit margins company valuations compare to those similar industries. It would also look at the pace of innovation in the industry, the degree of competition among suppliers and distributors, the frequency with which companies enter the market, the power companies have over workers and suppliers and the prevalence of restrictive business practices.</p><p>In a more aggressive antitrust environment, firms justifying acquisitions on the basis of operating efficiencies and lower prices would be required to provide annual updates on whether those efficiencies and price declines were realized. That would allow judges and regulators to assess the reliability of such claims, which in most cases are grossly exaggerated. And judges should be given the authority to appoint independent economists to evaluate the economic analyses submitted by companies and regulators.</p><p>This would not be the first time that Congress has been needed to step in to revive and update the antitrust law - it happened in 1914, 1936, 1950 and 1976. Given our polarized political environment, it will take a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress to do it again.</p><p>There is urgency to this project. As we dither, European regulators have already taken the lead in trying to rein in the business practices of the tech giants, imposing billion-dollar fines and prompting complaints that their aim is to hamstring their transatlantic rivals. As we are discovering with other policy issues, the dysfunction of our public sector has begun to seriously erode the capacity of our private sector to adapt and innovate. The rest of the world is not about to wait while we get our act together.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:stevepearlstein@gmail.com\">stevepearlstein@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-3aca75ded28d11ea9038af089b63ac21</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GX-TG01-JBFW-C01J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1354\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

At this point, only a major rewrite of the industrial era antitrust statutes can bring the tech titans to heel.</p><p>The outlines of such a revision are contained in a number of written submissions made to the House antitrust subcommittee, including one by a dozen of the country's top antitrust economists and lawyers who conclude that \"current antitrust doctrines are too limited to adequately protect competition . . .  or stop anticompetitive conduct.\" They lay out several changes in the law to reverse a series of court rulings that have opened the door to over-consolidation in virtually every sector of the economy, nowhere more so than in tech, where there is a natural tendency of customers to want use the same software, communicate on the same network or transact business on the same platform as everyone else.</p><p>While this \"network effect\" explains much of the winner-take-all competition in the tech sector, mergers and acquisitions have also played a role. The four companies represented at Wednesday's hearings, along with Microsoft, have collectively bought 720 companies over the past 30 years, according to testimony from the American Antitrust Institute. </p><p>Google's purchase of YouTube and Waze, Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's purchase of Zappos and Ring - all of these were given the green light by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Hundreds of other deals were too small even to be reviewed. In only one of those 720 did the government move to block the deal - Google's purchase of travel software firm ITA - only to be rebuffed in court.</p><p>\"We went from an antitrust culture [in the 1970s] where \"the government always wins\" to one where enforcers almost always lost, or where fear of losing caused the government not to act at all,\" wrote Bill Baer, who headed the Justice Department's antitrust division during the Obama administration, in his submission to the House subcommittee.</p><p>The economic premise behind the decades-long retreat from antitrust enforcement - much of it originating at the economics departments of the University of Chicago and the law school at George Mason University - is that three firms are sufficient to provide competition in any market, monopolies are only temporary and that mergers create efficiencies that are reliably passed on to consumers in lower prices. Business practices restricting customers or disadvantaging competitors - bundling products, exclusive contracts, pricing restraints and withholding services from rivals - once considered anti-competitive, are now assumed to be pro-consumer. And in deciding whether to block a merger or outlaw business practices, judges no longer take a broad look at the competitive landscape, but rely on technical economic analyses of how much prices will go up or down.</p><p>A reformed and modernized antitrust law would reject all of these presumptions, reverse those rulings and make clear that under-enforcement of the antitrust laws is a greater risk to the vibrancy of the American economy than over-enforcement.</p><p>For starters, there should once again be some bright lines  that should rarely, if ever, be crossed. Companies with more than 40 or 50 percent market share should be prevented from buying any direct competitor, no matter how small, to protect current and potential competition. </p><p>Dominant firms in highly concentrated markets should also be barred from buying any company in an adjacent market, particularly ones that are also high concentrated. Such a provision would have prevented pharmacist CVS from buying health insurer Aetna, the AT&amp;T phone company from buying the cable company Time Warner and Ticketmaster buying concert promoter Live Nation.</p><p>In highly concentrated markets, the legal burden should be with the companies to demonstrate that a merger or business practice would not reduce competition, rather than on the government to prove that it would - a huge difference in the world of antitrust litigation. In arguing its case, the government would be required to show only that a merger or business practice poses a credible risk of reducing competition, well short of the current burden to prove that competitive harm is likely or probable, or all but certain.</p><p>A 21st century antitrust law would also make clear to judges that the purpose of antitrust law is to protect and enhance competition not only because it lowers prices, increases choice and improves quality for consumers, but also because it stimulates innovation, reduces income inequality and reduces the concentration of economic and political power.</p><p>Recent court decisions, more narrowly, have declared that competition is enhanced by anything that benefits consumers, and what benefits consumers is lower prices. But in an economy in which some companies give away their services free (think Facebook and Google), a merger or business practice can reduce competition without raising prices. And in markets where companies serve multiple sets of customers (think credit card companies and their cardholders and merchants), what benefits some customers might harm others. Judges need to be reminded that economic efficiency is not the holy grail.</p><p>\"In the search for quantification and scientific precision, economists have taken to defining too narrowly what competition means and how it should be measured,\" said John Kwoka, an economist at Northeastern University.</p><p>A broader analysis of competition would require judges and regulators to consider how U.S. prices compare to foreign prices and how profit margins company valuations compare to those similar industries. It would also look at the pace of innovation in the industry, the degree of competition among suppliers and distributors, the frequency with which companies enter the market, the power companies have over workers and suppliers and the prevalence of restrictive business practices.</p><p>In a more aggressive antitrust environment, firms justifying acquisitions on the basis of operating efficiencies and lower prices would be required to provide annual updates on whether those efficiencies and price declines were realized. That would allow judges and regulators to assess the reliability of such claims, which in most cases are grossly exaggerated. And judges should be given the authority to appoint independent economists to evaluate the economic analyses submitted by companies and regulators.</p><p>This would not be the first time that Congress has been needed to step in to revive and update the antitrust law - it happened in 1914, 1936, 1950 and 1976. Given our polarized political environment, it will take a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress to do it again.</p><p>There is urgency to this project. As we dither, European regulators have already taken the lead in trying to rein in the business practices of the tech giants, imposing billion-dollar fines and prompting complaints that their aim is to hamstring their transatlantic rivals. As we are discovering with other policy issues, the dysfunction of our public sector has begun to seriously erode the capacity of our private sector to adapt and innovate. The rest of the world is not about to wait while we get our act together.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:stevepearlstein@gmail.com\">stevepearlstein@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-3aca75ded28d11ea9038af089b63ac21</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GW-PYC1-JCDY-T198-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1359\"/><timeReceived>10:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump is breaking new ground in his resistance to the special counsel investigation of alleged collusion with the Russians. The President referred to Robert Mueller by name for the first time over the weekend. And he is repeating his claim that the entire affair is a witch hunt.</p><p>This comes while the smoke is still clearing from the termination of the former FBI number two, Andrew McCabe.</p><p>We have Fox team coverage tonight. Brit Hume is here with analysis on what all this means; what it may mean for the President; Kevin Corke on the growing bitterness from President Trump toward Mueller; but we begin with chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge and where McCabe took notes during his meetings with the President and has turned them over to Mueller -- Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: That's right -- Bret. Thank you and good evening.</p><p>Tonight special counsel Robert Mueller already has memos from the fired FBI director James Comey and now his fired deputy director, Andrew McCabe, as the political fallout grows.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE: A source close to the fired FBI deputy director confirms he documented his conversations with President Trump where he often raised McCabe's wife and her unsuccessful 2015 Virginia Senate race. Jill McCabe received more than $600,000 from Democrats including then governor, Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton ally.</p><p>The FBI said the campaign contributions were not a conflict because it was before McCabe took the helm of the Clinton e-mail case. But critics say the contributions showed bad judgment and McCabe's termination for cause undercuts his credibility.</p><p>REP. PETE KING (R-NY), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: I don't think there's any big deal. I'm sure that President Trump never said anything to Andrew McCabe that was illegal or implied any type of illegality. You can give all the memos you want, turn them over.</p><p>HERRIDGE: President Trump, who praised McCabe's firing is a great day for the FBI, emphasized that he spent very little time with the FBI's former number two, insinuating that McCabe drafted the memos to help his own agenda.</p><p>One senior Republican called for public hearings to show whether McCabe's termination was suspect, coming two days before his government pension kicked in.</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: When it comes to this issue, we need as much transparency as possible to make sure it wasn't politically motivated.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Fox News has learned the FBI branch that investigates misconduct allegations began looking at McCabe as early as last summer. The grounds for termination go beyond media leaks. The inspector general concluded McCabe lacked candor on multiple occasions.</p><p>FBI veterans who want the inspector general to make the evidence public as soon as possible say bureau rules on lying are strict.</p><p>RONALD HOSKO, FORMER FBI AGENT: \"Lack of candor\" potentially gets you fired. That expectation applies to the brand new FBI agent and it should apply to the deputy director.</p><p>HERRIDGE: A senior House Democrat indicated McCabe's firing maybe justified. But he remains concerned about a broader pattern. A half-dozen of Director Comey's closest associates, including former general counsel James Baker, chief of staff James Rybicki, senior agent Peter Strzok, lawyer Lisa Page, media chief Mike Gordon have retired, been fired, reassigned, or demoted.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Is this because they corroborate James Comey? That's a question we also have to answer.</p><p>HERRIDGE: In his statement, McCabe said Director Comey knew about his contact with the media, which observers said appears to conflict with the former director's testimony days before he got fired.</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IO), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: No.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE: The inspector general's report could come at any time but in recent weeks, two sources tell Fox News new leads were pursued and new interviews conducted -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Catherine -- thank you.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>BAIER: The President has just returned to the White House after a trip to New Hampshire to talk about his opioid strategy. We'll have more on that in just a minute.</p><p>But first, correspondent Kevin Corke on the President's increasing hostility toward the Russia investigation and what could be next from the President's attorneys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It was an unfiltered, unabashed, and unrestrained tweet storm. President Trump using Twitter over the weekend to assail special counsel Robert Mueller and the Russia probe saying \"There was no collusion and no crime,\" accusing the FBI, Justice, and State Departments of \"leaking, lying, and corruption\", adding defiantly, \"a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest\".</p><p>The Mueller probe, which has netted five guilty pleas from Trump associates so far is awash in controversy. In part because of its sprawling nature and as yet still no evidence of collusion.</p><p>Even as Mr. Trump becomes increasingly bombastic, leaders on Capitol Hill including members of the President's very own party are warning him and his attorneys to back off.</p><p>GRAHAM: When it comes to Mr. Mueller, he is following the evidence where it takes him. And I think it is very important he be allowed to do his job without interference and there are many Republicans who share my view.</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: If you have an innocent client Mr. Dowd, act like it. Russia attacked our country. Let special counsel Mueller figure that out.</p><p>CORKE: The White House is also rejecting suggestions that the President has become so frustrated by the investigation, which has expanded to include documents from the Trump Organization that he plans to get rid of the man in charge. White House attorney Ty Cobb said the President is not considering or discussing the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>The President's complaint that the widening investigation is a witch hunt is not new, nor novel. In fact, it's reminiscent of what Clinton White House officials said about the probe led by independent counsel Ken Starr back in 1998. Starr was called corrupt. His office, the source of too many leaks, and then-President Clinton, the object of, you guessed it, a political witch hunt.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is the first place I came for the primaries.</p><p>CORKE: In New Hampshire today, the President looked to get back on message, promoting his administration's effort to combat opioid abuse, calling for stiffer sanctions against drug dealers including the death penalty.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE: Bret -- the President today also expanded his legal team, hiring former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova. He previously actually argued that the President may have been framed by the DOJ and FBI, adding a bulldog attorney to his team -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Kevin Corke, live on the north lawn. Kevin -- thank you.</p><p>Let's get some perspective on all of this. Senior political analyst Brit Hume is here with us tonight. Good evening -- Brit.</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hi -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: So first, let's start with the McCabe situation, the fallout from the firing and what has transpired over the past couple of days.</p><p>HUME: Bret -- I see very little basis based on what we know now to think that this firing was anything but on the up and up. This inquiry that grew out of the inspector general's investigation has been going on I guess back to before Trump was president. And it came across things about McCabe, leaks that he was involved in, and then the lack of candor as it was put to investigators about it.</p><p>That is a very big deal inside the FBI. The matter was -- that piece of it -- was passed then to the FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility, which looked at it, and recommended that McCabe be fired.</p><p>There's been a lot of criticism at the firing was rushed but McCabe was on the verge of retirement, after which he could not be fired. So the firing came at the very, very last minute. It seems to me that far from being rushed, it may have been -- it may have been held off until, you know, they were facing a deadline after which he couldn't be fired.</p><p>BAIER: Yes.</p><p>HUME: So it looks to me it's on the up and up. But we won't know everything until the inspector general's report comes out. We will know more about the facts upon which it was based. But it looks -- looks -- looks ok to me.</p><p>BAIER: Yes. Talking to Senators Grassley and Graham last week, the list of questions they had in calling for a special counsel seems like they know much more about what is a met IG's report that is upcoming.</p><p>To Mueller now, the talk around town is, you know, the question is the President going to fire Mueller or somehow set the stage for that? Your thoughts?</p><p>HUME: Well, he certainly did step up his criticism of Mueller, and as we've noted earlier, he mentioned him by name. And that has provoked all the speculation that he's about to drop the hammer on him.</p><p>I have my doubts though -- Bret. I noticed that Ty Cobb, who speaks for the President, said just in the last 24 hours that he had no plans or isn't even discussing doing it. And of course the President must be aware that the last time that was tried was by Richard Nixon dealing with a special prosecutor and the consequences of that was he got another special prosecutor and the investigation went on and led ultimately to where he was up on the verge of being impeached.</p><p>So I suspect he's aware that getting rid of this special prosecutor would only -- or this special counsel would only generate another one and he would be right back where he started from.</p><p>BAIER: This is not unprecedented --</p><p>HUME: But on the other hand he's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAIER: -- because it is public --</p><p>HUME: -- no, it's not unprecedented. This didn't turn out very well for the person who did the firing.</p><p>BAIER: Right. But as far as the public talk of a special counsel, you covered a White House which did that, as well.</p><p>HUME: Well, we certainly are -- the stuff we are hearing said, witch hunt, as Kevin Corke pointed out in his report, this, you know, appears to be right out of the Clinton playbook, where you don't fire the special prosecutor, special counsel. What you do is you try to either soften him up by criticizing him or you try to discredit him so that if he comes out something that's adverse to you, it won't be believed.</p><p>My own guess is that that probably won't work if that is what he is trying to do. And I don't think that the President's comments over the weekend about the McCabe firing were helpful at all in the sense that his gloating over it only added to the suspicion that he was somehow behind it although it's very difficult to figure out how that would have worked.</p><p>BAIER: Brit -- as always. Thank you.</p><p>HUME: Thank you -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: President Trump's personal attorney says he has never threatened adult film actor Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with President Trump in 2006. Michael Cohen tells \"Vanity Fair\" he has never met, spoken to, e-mailed, or texted Daniels. Last week, Daniels' attorney said she had been physically threatened.</p><p>Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. President Trump's attorneys filed paperwork claiming Stormy Daniels actually owes them $20 million for violating her confidentiality agreement.</p><p>A long day on Wall Street -- the Dow was down almost 500 points before finishing off 336. The S&amp;P 500 fell 39. The Nasdaq nosedived 138.</p><p>Facebook was one of the big reasons for the drop. We'll have a full report on what happened with that in just a few minutes.</p><p>As we mentioned a moment ago, the President and the first lady were in New Hampshire this afternoon to lay out more details of the administration plan to deal with the opioid crisis.</p><p>Senior correspondent Rick Leventhal shows us tonight from Manchester.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you.</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: President Trump getting a firsthand look at one of the front lines of the opioid crisis. The Manchester Fire Department says 70 percent of the incoming calls aren't for smoke or flames. They're for medical issues, primarily drug overdoses -- 2,600 in the past three years with at least 255 deaths in this one town.</p><p>Firefighters were responding to so many OD calls they decided to invite the addicts here instead. Every firehouse became a safe station where users can walk in for a medical checkup and get fast tracked into a treatment program.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: New Hampshire was one of the first states to enter this opioid crisis but we will be one of the first states to come out of it because of programs like safe station.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: We first profiled safe station on SPECIAL REPORT just before the 2016 presidential election and got an update from Chief Dan Goonan just last week.</p><p>DAN GOONAN, MANCHESTER FIRE CHIEF: I don't see an end right now. All I know is that we are providing a service to the community and a place for people to come when they are at that point. When they've reached that point, we try to capture that moment that they either have a moment of clarity or they are so deep down that they just need help.</p><p>So that is what we are here to do is capture that and get them a shot at treatment.</p><p>TRUMP: Defeating this epidemic will require the commitment of every state, local, and federal agency. Failure is not an option. Addiction is not our future.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: The President came to the Granite State to unveil a new plan to combat the opioid epidemic, including legislation to reduce the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers, developing non-addictive painkillers, expanding access to treatment and recovery programs, and calling for tighter enforcement of federal death penalty statutes already on the books, targeting drug kingpins and major dealers whose product could be killing thousands.</p><p>TRUMP: If we are not going to get tough on the drug dealers who kill thousands of people and destroy so many people's lives, we are just doing the wrong thing. We have got to get tough. This isn't about nice anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: The President says he's spoken with leaders of other countries who say they don't have a drug problem because they have the death penalty for dealers. He says building that border wall will help stop the flow of heroin and other illegal drugs from Mexico and that shutting down sanctuary cities is critical because those cities are sheltering dangerous traffickers from justice -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Rick Leventhal, live in Manchester. Rick -- thank you.</p><p>Uber has suspended all of its self-driving testing after what is believed to be the first fatal pedestrian accident involving the self-driving vehicles. Police in Tempe, Arizona say an Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel when a woman outside of a crosswalk was hit. Uber has been testing the self-driving vehicles in several cities for months. The company says it is fully cooperating with this investigation.</p><p>Officials in Austin, Texas are trying to determine whether another package bombing last night is connected to three previous explosions in that city. There are significant differences, but also some similarities in this latest case. And officials now may be looking for a serial bomber there.</p><p>Correspondent Casey Stegall is in the Texas capital tonight where that investigation is ongoing. Good evening -- Casey.</p><p>CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening to you.</p><p>And this is a city on high alert tonight because you just mentioned the police chief's own words at a news conference today saying he fears this could be the work of a serial bomber.</p><p>The only thing they will say is that there are similarities between the explosive device that was used last night and the other three that have also rocked the capital city in recent weeks. Only this time police say the device was more advanced and it had a trip wire attached.</p><p>Then just after 8:30 last night, two men came through with bicycles and may have inadvertently hit the line, triggering the blast. They were seriously hurt and rushed to an area hospital, expected to survive. But at one point in the investigation, police had considered whether these attacks were possibly racially-motivated because the first victims were either black or Hispanic. But that is no longer the thinking after last night's crime.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN MANLEY, AUSTIN POLICE CHIEF: And what we have seen now is a significant change from what appeared to be three very targeted attacks to what was last night an attack that would have hit a random victim that happened to walk by. So we've definitely seen a change in the method that this suspect or suspects is using.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEGALL: And that change has them on alert. March 2nd is when this all began. The first explosion killed a man when he opened an unidentified package containing a bomb that had been left on his front doorstep.</p><p>Ten days later across town, similar parcels showed up at two other homes and exploded. A second victim died in one of those blasts and two others were critically hurt.</p><p>Today Texas Governor Greg Abbott releasing $265,000 of the states emergency funds to help the Austin police department and other law enforcement agencies purchase seven portable x-ray machines commonly used in bomb and explosives detection -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Casey Stegall, live in Austin, Texas. Casey -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, congressional lawmakers want to talk to Facebook's CEO over the misuse of data on tens of millions of users. The big story today -- we'll bring it to you next.</p><p>First, here's what some our affiliates around the country are covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 2 in St. Louis as lawyers for Republican Governor Eric Greitens want his invasion of privacy trial to start in as little as two weeks. Greitens was indicted, you may remember, last month accused of taking a nonconsensual photo of a woman with whom he was having an affair. The governor says he is not guilty. He is expected to ask for a bench trial instead of having a jury.</p><p>WDRB in Louisville as four people are injured after two trains collided and derailed in Georgetown, Kentucky. Norfolk Southern says the four train crew members taken to the hospital after the crash were taken there as a precaution. They have been released with no injuries though one employee is still being evaluated.</p><p>And this is a live look from Miami, our affiliate down there WSVN. The big story there tonight, Florida International University students return to class following Thursday's deadly bridge collapsed. One of the six who died was an FIU student. A vigil for the victims is scheduled for Wednesday.</p><p>That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: Late this afternoon Mississippi Republican Governor Phil Bryant signed the nation's toughest abortion restrictions into law. The state's only abortion clinic is preparing an immediate legal challenge. House Bill 1510 bans most abortions after 15 weeks gestation. Pregnancies from rape and incest are not exempted.</p><p>City leaders in the Los Angeles suburb of Los Alamitos are considering an ordinance to exempt the town from California's sanctuary state law. The proposed measure says city council members have taken an oath to uphold the constitution and the state's policy against cooperating with federal immigration agents may conflict with that.</p><p>California-based Facebook is taking considerable fire tonight over reports the company let a data mining firm affiliated with the Trump campaign have access to information about tens of millions of users, maybe you.</p><p>National correspondent William La Jeunesse lays it out for us tonight from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Facebook today playing defense after this whistleblower claims the company failed to protect the personal data of up to 50 million people later used by an outside firm to target voters in 2016.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Facebook, at least in a technical sense, facilitated the project.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: The breach began when Facebook allowed a Cambridge University professor to create an app called \"This is Your Digital Life\". When users signed up, it asked about their education, work history, relationship, and political affiliation. That professor, according to Facebook, then illegally sold the information to an analytics firm to influence voter opinion.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WYLE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: What Cambridge Analytica does is work on creating a web of disinformation online so that people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, web sites, et cetera that make them think that certain things are happening that may not be.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, a firm backed by a former campaign manager Steve Bannon and wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer. Although the company and the Trump campaign say none of the Facebook information was used in the election, critics are not convinced.</p><p>SENATOR JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA: Who knew it? When did they know it? How long did this go on? And what happens to that data now?</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be called to Capitol Hill to explain.</p><p>SCHIFF: We need to find out what we can about the misappropriation of the private information of tens of millions of Americans.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: The company faces two critical questions. One, did it fail to report the unauthorized access to the federal government as required? And did it obtain user permission before sharing personal information?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The key issue is not so much whether the methodology that Cambridge Analytica touted, the psychographic stuff mattered. The key issue is that the data were available to the Trump campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: This is a legal and political fight. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly wants e-mails between the company and the Trump team as part of his Russia investigation. Late today, Facebook called for a complete audit of what happened -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: More on this with the panel. William -- thank you.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin says he does not want an arms race with the West. Putin is coming off a landslide win to secure his fourth term -- not a surprise there. But many are crediting his current battle with Great Britain for giving him a boost.</p><p>Senior foreign affairs correspondent Amy Kellogg is in Moscow again tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMY KELLOGG, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: He cleaned up. Russian president Vladimir Putin got 77 percent of the vote. His campaign chairman said that was thanks to Great Britain amidst accusations that Moscow is to blame for the poison attack on British soil.</p><p>The pressure on Putin these days and his resistance surely added another eight to ten percent to his numbers, according to Putin's aide. Victory secured, he finally addressed the attack on Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter for the first time claiming he actually learned about the quote, \"tragedy\" from the media.</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: Of course, we think any sensible person understands that this is complete fantasy -- rubbish and nonsense. That someone in Russia might do something like this on the eve of a presidential election and the world cup. It is simply unthinkable.</p><p>KELLOGG: The U.K. foreign secretary who was meeting in Brussels to discuss the incident with European partners said Putin's reaction was straight out of Moscow's playbook.</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER: I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russian strategy of trying to conceal the needle of proof in a haystack of lies and obfuscation.</p><p>KELLOGG: This, as reports emerged the poison may have come out through the ventilation system of Skripal's car.</p><p>Notable that Putin's first appearance election night was at a Crimea annexation anniversary party next to Red Square. If the spy poisoning saga boosted his numbers, some say Crimea secured his future four years ago.</p><p>MIKHAIL FISHMAN, RUSSIAN JOURNALIST: The annexation of Crimea sent the message to the nation that there is no alternative, here at home to what Russia is now and where Russia is going, and who is heading Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLOGG: Putin was asked if he might consider changing the constitution again so that he could run for yet another term in 2024. He sort of laugh that off saying what did people think, that he really wanted to keep running the country until he is 100 years old? But the question still hangs in the air -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Maybe so. Amy Kellogg in Moscow. Amy -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, Congress is once again facing a deadline to keep the federal government funded. We'll bring you that.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Hillary Clinton is backtracking a bit on last week's statement that women were pressured by men into voting for Donald Trump. Clinton says on Facebook that as much as she hates the possibility, quote \"It's not that crazy when you think about our ongoing struggle to reach gender balance even within the same household.\" Clinton says she did not realize how hard her comments would hit many who heard them.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court is refusing to get involved in the ongoing dispute over Pennsylvania's Congressional boundaries. The justices are letting stand a state court imposed a map could benefit Democrats by denying an emergency stay of enforcement filed by GOP state lawmakers. The high court's action came just hours after a separate federal court in the state also allowed the redrawn boundaries to take effect.</p><p>These two court decisions make it much more likely Pennsylvania will use the new maps this election year. Candidates for Congress now have one day to circulate petitions to get on the May 15th primary ballot.</p><p>We are just a few days away from yet another funding deadline for the federal government. Right now some in Congress are going over a plan to avoid talk of another shutdown. As chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports from the capital, this time lawmakers are thinking more long-term.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Tonight, House lawmakers are getting their first look at a massive $1.3 trillion government spending package facing a Friday night deadline to get it done. Republican leaders say it will the strongest investment in the military in 15 years and will help with readiness. A Georgia Republican who serves in the Air Force reserve says that investment is critical.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS, (R) GEORGIA: When you have seen the military emaciated like it was under sequestration, also under the Obama administration, what I feel is a very poor military division, we are seeing that coming to pay back now.</p><p>EMANUEL: The funding bill also includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel.</p><p>The White House and Democrats traded offers over the weekend on addressing the so-called Dreamers. That included a White House request for $25 billion for the border wall in exchange for extending DACA until fall of 2020. Democrats said no.</p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN, (R) TENNESSEE: They want the issue, not the solution, so they are rejecting it. We are trying to get to a funding bill that will carry us through the rest of the fiscal year.</p><p>EMANUEL: Democrats demanded a path the citizenship in exchange for fully funding the wall, and talks hit a dead end. But one of the top Senate Democrats signaled his numbers are not trying a redline on the surgery.</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN, (R) ILLINOIS: We are not going to have a shutdown. But I'm urging the leaders to basically come together and understand there is an emergency at hand here -- 780,000 young people have their lives hanging in the balance because President Trump killed the DACA program.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EMANUEL: Most sources sound very optimistic they will get it done but all acknowledge the possibility there could be very well be drama before the deadline. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Mike Emanuel live on the Hill. Mike, thanks.</p><p>You and your family and all of your fellow Americans are now more than $21 trillion in debt. The U.S. passed that threshold last week as we reported. Deirdre Bolton of the FOX Business Network tells us what all this means.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: The U.S. government just hit a record, but not one with bragging rights. We are in debt, a lot of debt. The U.S. government spends much more than it takes in. During President Obama's tenure, the national debt nearly doubled. Democrats and Republicans agreed to government bailouts of numerous industries after the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>This past year there were a dozen large-scale storms. Combined, the cost of responding and rebuilding was about $200 billion. While few citizens find fault with the reasoning, the money is still spent. Recently President Trump asked for more money for defense, supporting the fight against ISIS and funding the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies. Some politicians say there is a limit to what the country can afford.</p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER, (R) TENNESSEE: The greatest threat to our nation is we ourselves. It's our inability to deal with the fiscal issues that we as a nation have.</p><p>BOLTON: The director of national intelligence Dan Coats has said that Washington's lack of fiscal discipline undermines national security. President Trump is not worried about the national debt. Sources say he believes the American economy will grow and compensate for increased spending. In February, President Trump signed a law that suspends the debt ceiling, allowing the U.S. government to borrow as much as it needs to fund the activities approved by Congress until March of next year.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOLTON: Some economists say that the U.S. can increase its debt indefinitely, but then we would be an unchartered territory. Bret, back to you.</p><p>BAIER: Deirdre, thank you.</p><p>Next up, President Trump calls out the special counsel by name in his latest tweets on the Russian investigation. So what is next? We'll get reaction from the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL, (R) KENTUCKY: They basically have said that McCabe leaked classified documents. That's illegal. But then he also lied about leaking classified documents. And so the FBI are sticklers on this, and they don't tolerate lying from their agents. And so if all of that is true, I see no way that he could continue in his office and that punishment is appropriate.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF, (D) RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: His firing may be justified. There is no way for us to know at this point. But even though it may have been justified, it can also be tainted.</p><p>ANGUS KING, (I-ME) SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: He had 21 years of exceptional service and the FBI. So it was clearly rushed. And I think there are questions about that and whether the administration was putting pressure on the Justice Department to take this action.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: There are many questions, and we are expecting to get the inspector general's report any day now, and that could have many of the answers that are some of these lawmakers are looking for.</p><p>In the meantime, the president first tweeting about Andrew McCabe, the number two man, fired before his retirement. \"Andrew McCabe fired, a great day for the hardworking men and women of the FBI, a great day for democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI.\"</p><p>In the meantime, on the Mueller probe, the president tweeting over the weekend, \"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" he wrote It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\" \"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added. Does anyone think this is fair? And yet there is no collusion.\"</p><p>So it was a busy weekend on Twitter and elsewhere. Let's bring our panel. Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" Mollie, fallout from McCabe and then the comments about the Mueller probe.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Look, it is never a good thing when your number two at the FBI is fired for bad behavior. What he has suggested is that this is related to him leaking and lacking candor about it. It actually might be much bigger than that and there would be reason to think it is much bigger than that. He's had a series of problems related to leaking and manipulation of processes and investigations.</p><p>So it was a huge hit for this larger narrative. What we were told a year ago was that our intelligence chiefs and the highest people at our intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies were apolitical, nonpartisan boy scouts who had a very legitimate reason to be worried about Donald Trump. And a year later, we've had all these firings, removals, reassignments, and you have on Twitter you can see people tweeting in a crazy fashion against this president. That narrative looks patently absurd now. It looks like a much different story than we were told a year ago.</p><p>BAIER: Mara?</p><p>MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think what's really interesting is the president's reaction to this. We are going to find out the reasons why McCabe was fired when, as you said, the I.G. report comes out. But he was doing a victory dance in the end zone, then he started attacking Mueller for the first time by name, and then one of his personal lawyers issued a statement saying the Mueller investigation should end. That has never happened before. Up until now, the White House has said they were cooperating.</p><p>So then became an uproar, is the president getting ready to fire Mueller? I don't think so. I think what's happening is he is intent on discrediting the Mueller investigation so that whatever Mueller comes up with, he can dismiss it.</p><p>BAIER: As you speak about John Dowd who said what he said, Trey Gowdy, congressman, was asked about that this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: I think the president's attorney frankly does him a disservice when he does that and when he frames the investigation that way. Chris, if you look at the jurisdiction for Robert Mueller, first and foremost, what did Russia do to this country in 2016? That is supremely important and it that has nothing to do with collusion. So to suggest that Mueller should shut down and that all he is looking at is collusion, if you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Guy?</p><p>GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Yes, I think that is a fair point for Gowdy to make. What's strange is this conflation that we're seeing of Mueller and the McCabe firing. These are in my view separate issues, although the president is connecting them and a lot of his fiercest critics, ironically, are also connecting them.</p><p>But when you look at the McCabe firing, I think you can make a very strong case based on the facts that he would have been fired regardless of who was president, and regardless of the whole Mueller investigation even if it didn't exist at all, because the malfeasance that is alleged apparently against Mr. McCabe occurred in the 2016 election. And that investigation, the I.G. probe, was launched before Donald Trump became president. And it was an Obama appointed inspector general who came to conclusions about what McCabe did.</p><p>And last but not least, the person who made the decision or the office had made the decision to recommend firing him was this ethics office at the FBI that was completely nonpartisan and the woman who runs it was appointed by Bob Mueller. On the merits, it looks like this was misconduct that McCabe is responsible for back in 2016. It should have nothing to do with Mueller.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: But also I think what Gowdy said was also kind of weird. It is possible for federal investigations to go off the rails, and it has happened before. You can talk to Richard Jewell's family about that. He was the guy targeted by the FBI. They leaked his name and basically ruined his life before finding out that he wasn't responsible for the bombing in Atlanta.</p><p>Robert Mueller and James Comey themselves were involved in the worst botching of an FBI investigation ever, which was going after the innocent man Steven Hatfill in the anthrax killing, and they oversaw that and were quite confident about it. And Ted Stevens, the senator from Alaska, who had his vacated due to gross conduct by the FBI, I think Mueller was also head of the FBI at that time. So sometimes investigations can go off the rails, and it's incumbent upon an attorney to actually say that and to defend his client if an investigation --</p><p>LIASSON: The president has involved himself in a way that no other president has, urging the Department of Justice to make sure that McCabe was fired before he qualified for a pension, which happened about 26 hours before he would've qualified. And then connecting the McCabe firing with the Russia investigation. McCabe would be potentially a witness in an obstruction of justice case.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Is also true that the president has complied with the Mueller probe for over a year.</p><p>LIASSON: No, he hasn't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HEMINGWAY: But if you know there is no collusion and you've been working with them for over a year and it is still going on and this narrative is still being pushed to undermine the legitimacy of a president, I can imagine someone getting pretty frustrated.</p><p>BAIER: There is all this uproar about the president speaking out about Mueller for the first time and speaking out about the investigation. There was another president who did that, Bill Clinton. \"New York Times\",\" February 9th, 1998, the white has broadened its attack today on Ken Starr, independent counsel investigating accusations involving President Clinton and a former intern, calling Mr. Starr corrupt and demanding an independent investigation of suspected links to his office. Paul Begala, senior White House political advisor, accused Mr. Starr of using the sweeping powers and unlimited budget of his office to conduct a politically motivated witch hunt of the president and to intimidate witnesses into testifying against Mr. Clinton.</p><p>LIASSON: I remember that very well. And don't forget the best rightwing conspiracy. This is a tried a tried-and-true playbook. You are being investigated, you want to discredit the investigator. I think it is really similar to Clinton with one difference, which is Bill Clinton didn't go after the FBI. And the president has gone after the FBI. In his tweets this weekend he talked about corruption and lying at State Department, Department of Justice, and the FBI. He really has gone after institutions here in a way that's different.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I would say the big difference is the media treatment, because in March, a month after that \"New York Times\" headline that you just read, \"The New York Times\" headline was \"White House is all out attack on Starr is paying off.\" So the media was much more friendly to the Bill Clinton approach than they are this one.</p><p>BAIER: Last word, quickly.</p><p>BENSON: The other point I would make is people are saying there was pressure from the president to fire McCabe before he got his retirement benefits or has pension. I think it is a fair thing to point out. But if it is determined by the nonpartisan I.G. and the Office a Professional Responsibility that this man leaked in an unauthorized way to the media and then lied about it, should that person get a taxpayer-funded pension? That is a completely reasonable question to ask.</p><p>BAIER: When we return, Facebook under fire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WYLIE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WHISTLEBLOWER: What's really important for people to understand is that this company misappropriated data of upwards of 50 million people from Facebook. This data was used to create profiling algorithms that would allow us to explore mental vulnerabilities of people.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF, (D) RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We need to find out what we can about the misappropriation of the privacy, the private information of tens of millions of Americans.</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA: This is a big deal when you have that amount of data, and the privacy violations there are significant.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Facebook under fire. Whistleblowers, you heard there, claiming that the company failed to protect the personal data of up to 50 million people in connection with Cambridge Analytica. This is this group that worked with the Trump campaign. What about the story, where it's going? Obviously it hit Facebook today, Guy, and the stock dropped significantly. But the implications here?</p><p>BENSON: Sure. So I think it's not unusual or necessarily newsworthy that a campaign or some appendage of a campaign was using a lot of data to micro-target people. That has been going on for a very long time. Online data, shopping data, that's sort of standard at this point in our politics.</p><p>To me this is more a question of consent and if the data was properly obtained. And there is a new \"New York Times\" follow-up story this afternoon to the original blockbuster, and this is what I think it is concerning. Short quotes. \"Only about 270,000 users of the 50 million had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told it was being used for academic use,\" which was not true obviously. So to me, that is the red flag that needs to be investigated.</p><p>BAIER: We have seen this in previous campaigns. We have an Obama person out on Twitter saying that they did it, too, and Facebook kind of said, yes, go ahead.</p><p>LIASSON: I think that one of the big questions is how do members of Congress view Facebook now? Do they look at them as a giant publisher, the biggest publisher on the planet that is completely unregulated and needs some regulation? Do they view them as a pipeline for Russian propaganda? I mean, this is getting to the point where I think you will have Mark Zuckerberg testifying in Congress and you're going to have calls or regulation.</p><p>BAIER: Already calls for him to testify. The Grassley -- or Kennedy, Klobuchar asking Grassley to take it up.</p><p>LIASSON: When the Obama did all this micro-targeting in 2012, it was celebrating. And there stores written about how Facebook responded to it. They said they broke through their normal safeguards but they were OK with it, telling the Obama campaign just make sure you knock it off after November. So it's kind of not a huge story that this is happening.</p><p>But I am worried about the free-speech implications of this which is that on the right, you have a lot of people who feel that Facebook and Google and all these new media giants are in bed with Democrats, and on the left you've seen a deterioration of support for free speech. So I do think there is this opening to go after some of these companies that might be bad in going against our founding principles.</p><p>BAIER: So they're like the black hats now. But is there a First Amendment issue?</p><p>LIASSON: Yes, and what does that mean in this case? What control do you have over your data? Most people figure the minute they are on the Internet they have no privacy at all. But I am not on Facebook, I'm probably the only person on the planet who is not on it. But it doesn't sound like you have much privacy.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I actually think that might be part of the problem is that people don't think through how they are the product on Facebook, they are the thing that's being bought and sold. So people do need to think about that much more carefully.</p><p>But also I think that a lot of our publishing platforms in all of these companies need to think a lot more about how fair they are being given this responsibility they have. And when you are shutting down speech and when you are shutting down conservatives, and mostly exclusively conservatives, that is going to cause a problem for civil discord.</p><p>LIASSON: They don't think of themselves as publishers.</p><p>BENSON: But politically, it's interesting because you have these big tech companies that are culturally much more on the left and taking sides in the culture wars ticking up a lot of Republicans in Washington, D.C. Then you have the regulatory happy Democrats in Washington, D.C., who are concerned about Russia and other things, and you might find these big tech companies all of a sudden with very few friends on Capitol Hill, pushing back against the notion of let's regulate. But I'm concerned about more regulation. I don't know that that's necessarily the direction we ought to be headed. But they have set themselves up for this situation.</p><p>BAIER: I want to clean up one thing from the last panel about the McCabe pension. It's not going away.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: He still get the vast majority of his pension. It will be affected just slightly. But he won't gain access to it at the age of 50 but it will be a little bit of a delay. And so what people were thinking that he would lose his pension. He doesn't actually lose and it's not that significant.</p><p>BENSON: What is the justification for that? I'm sorry, and I'm sure he has had a wonderful career, he's done a lot of great things for the country. But if he did something illegal and then lied about it to investigators, why should he keep his pension?</p><p>BAIER: OK, wanted to clean it up. When we come back, a different kind of military reunion.</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, a reunion for an Afghanistan veteran and man's best friend. Sean Marsicane first met Apollo when the dog showed up on the campground where he was working with Afghan soldiers. This dog was thin and in danger of being put down, so Marsicane started feeding him. When it was time to leave Afghanistan, Marsicane wanted to the take Apollo with him. An organization called Puppy Rescue Mission helped make that happen and raised $5,000 to bring the dog all the way from Afghanistan to Arizona.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LCPL SEAN MARSICANE, U.S. MARINES CORPS (RET): He had a flight from Afghanistan all the way to Turkey, then from Turkey to D.C., and then from D.C. to here. So he had a long travel period. It's amazing to have him back home.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: That's a great story. Thanks for your service.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. \"The Story\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.

(Fraudsters install a device to copy the card information found on the ATMs, and make purchases or make withdrawals off those stolen card numbers.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When we got skimmed, the regulator came to us and said, 'hey who turned the jitter off, and you should hold the person accountable and punish him',\" says Mr Gupta.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the decision to remove the jitter was a judgement call by one staff who wanted to solve the bigger problem of snaking queues at the ATMs. There's also this tiny detail: most people seem to pull the cards out in haste, perhaps half impatient already at having had to stand in line to get cash. Or they're just in a hurry. In any case, yanking the card out simply renders the jitter quite useless.</p><p>\"In our case, our queues were so long. This guy took the view that by keeping the jitter on, we were adding another 8 to 10 people to every queue,\" Mr Gupta recalls.</p><p>\"We took the view that whoever put the jitter off actually applied his mind to it. It wasn't a stupid decision. So we told the regulator we're not going to punish the person. In fact, we gave the person an award for applying judgement, and doing stuff which we thought made sense for the customer.\"</p><p>What moves an organisation once wrapped in tight bureaucracy to dance to an up-tempo beat? A decade in, Mr Gupta has breathed new life into DBS. His unflinching bet on exploiting technology is by now well known to most. To him, it was the only way that Singapore's largest bank - or any bank - would be able to withstand the Big Tech wave that has washed out the advantages that banks once easily flaunted.</p><p>But the tech talk is a part of a bigger strategy. For DBS, the top performer among Temasek-linked companies over the last few years, the laser-focus was on the customer. The rubric for staff was this: if it makes sense for the customer, it's okay to do it.</p><p>\"That was a really liberating thought for people,\" says the veteran banker.</p><p>Customer experience is not a feel-good marketing tag these days. Big Tech has figured out how to make each customer count, and milk you for your last shopping dollar. Amazon aggregates the customer's buying preferences, and makes recommendations. Alibaba does the same. Google knows where you live, what advertising entices you most, and what you're curious about.</p><p>Taken all together, today's data flood - all of 1,200 petabytes stored by just Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook alone - has dramatically changed the competitive landscape for banks. Big Tech could eat their lunch.</p><p>And they already have. As a simple example, Mr Gupta points out that in just 18 months, Google Pay has captured more than half of the domestic payments in India, a market with 1.34 billion people.</p><p>\"If you look at the nature of our industry and you play logic, it's a bits and bytes industry. We don't make anything. It's about information, it's about data, and it's about accounting,\" says Mr Gupta.</p><p>\"Our biggest negative vulnerability right now is the fact that many of the Big Techs have a source of capital which is much cheaper, and a lot more patient than our source of capital. So they can continue burning money for long periods of time, and most public companies can't do that.\"</p><p>To be clear, some backlash about tech companies has come to the surface. Over in China, there is greater regulatory scrutiny on how large tech companies are hollowing out the industry, and posing new forms of threats on financial stability.</p><p>Chinese tech giants have also done less damage in DBS's core markets than Mr Gupta anticipated, because their joint ventures with partners here haven't taken off.</p><p>That being said, while the Chinese have been somewhat slower, other players such as Google and Facebook, are perking up. And if that uncertainty wasn't enough, Mr Gupta also downplays the cherished trust factor for banks.</p><p>\"We're regulated, we have deposit insurance, and therefore people say it's safe to leave money with us. But today, a lot more private sector corporations have ratings as good as, or better than, the banks. So tomorrow you go and ask people, 'are you willing to trust Amazon, Google, Apple'? There are lots of people willing to buy the equity, who will also be willing to trust them with money. So the trust element is replicable at scale by Big Tech,\" he says.</p><p>\"Then the second big thing that banks do is, we understand credit better and we can allocate this capital better. The reality is that our skillset of qualitative risk assessment is rapidly being, if not supplanted, then supplemented, with a skillset of data business assessment. And the minute you say that data counts, then you start figuring out that other people can do this too.\"</p><p>In the face of looming threats, there is fight or flight. For Mr Gupta, the foggy landscape has meant taking along 26,000 people on a do-or-die mission in battling the bigger giants of today. That meant balancing that sense of urgency - mixed with the paranoia about the unknown - with what he calls \"a sense of the possible\".</p><p>\"In our case, the fact that we saw the Chinese tech giants being so aggressive was a big catalyst. It really drove us to thinking very hard about what could happen as these guys expanded the business, changed the model. They could destroy us,\" says Mr Gupta.</p><p>\"But the sense of the possible and optimism is equally important, because it's very easy, once you're fearful, to get paralysed; then you can become a deer in the headlights and so now we're dead, can't do anything. You've got to be able to create that (optimism) and that comes from, in my experience, low-hanging fruit. And once people start seeing the results of small things, they get more and more motivated and energised to keep addressing the big things.\"</p><p>That means backing the staff who chose to turn off the ATMs' jitter to do right by the customers. (And then DBS dramatically changed the ATM monitoring system so their notorious queues are now a distant memory.)</p><p>That means forcing staff to work on six-month projects that were driven by the digital agenda, with Mr Gupta personally looking at these ideas, \"to kick the tyres\", as he put it. Some say the CEO has sat in meetings to deliberately play devil's advocate to keep staff on their toes.</p><p>To drive his bench strength, it is said he also gets his senior leaders into intimate sharing sessions, where they would confront their own strengths and weaknesses, a tack similar to that taken by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella with his lieutenants. A bit like group therapy, quips a senior DBS staffer.</p><p>\"Banking is a business of execution. Strategies are a dime a dozen, how do you actually transform the strategy, to get people to do. And that comes from laying a roadmap, being able to put the resources behind it, and then actually monitoring and getting hands on,\" says Mr Gupta.</p><p>\"I'm quite strategic, but I do detailed reviews on the things which I think are important. I go two levels down, I ask the tough questions, and push and prod, to make sure we get to the right place,\" adds the CEO who monitored the queues himself at ATMs in his early days to assess the underperforming retail unit then.</p><p>That also means raising the bank's technology spending, as DBS began to embrace the use of open-source code, cloud computing, and application programming interfaces (APIs), to ramp up its service performance. In 2014, Mr Gupta announced winning the board's blessing for S$200 million to invest in technology, without the pressure of a swift return on investment.</p><p>Few would be convinced there was no pressure to deliver down the line. The thing is, though, technology eventually starts paying for itself, says Mr Gupta. The bank's data centres boast a high server compression ratio, which means less spending on storage, and higher processing speed as data can be more efficiently compressed, and that should spell savings over time.</p><p>And there are clear digital dividends today. DBS has captured Top-Three market share across key market segments in retail, including in mortgages, bancassurance, and cards. Over in the small-and-medium enterprise space, DBS used to be Number Three among the banks. Today, depending on the segmentation, it's no longer the last of the Singapore trio, he says.</p><p>\"If you look at our history, from 2009 to 2014, we stemmed our decline. Our market shares were eroding two percentage points a year. With phase two of the digital transformation, we've seen market share lift,\" says Mr Gupta, referring to the last five years.</p><p>\"Singapore is a mature market, so it doesn't grow exponentially. Yet our market shares are up, materially and meaningfully. I can only assume that it's not that the customers suddenly started spending twice as much on banking, but that they are spending twice as much with me. It's more likely that we got the business from some other bank.\"</p><p>DBS has also found traction among multinational corporations that offer the Asia-based bank \"large-ticket\" mandates for supply chain management and cash management for the Asian part of their global business. Today, roughly a quarter of the bank's APIs are developed for corporate banking. And its cash management business has cracked its 2020 target a year ahead of schedule.</p><p>It may be why the bank - which holds the lion's share of local consumers' savings today - seemsless worried about financial liberalisation on the retail front in Singapore. On the cards is a platform offering consumers a consolidated view of their financial assets and liabilities across different banks, making it easy to switch into more compelling products.</p><p>\"Banks that are not prepared will lose. If I can offer the same service as any other third-party, why will somebody move,\" Mr Gupta says, pointing to DBS's recent rollout of low-fee exchange-traded funds as an example.</p><p>To keep up with all that competition, however, DBS must invest, he acknowledges, and he reckons the early \"downpayment\" on technology gives the bank room to divert spending to fend against the competition, and bulk up further.</p><p>Why we exist</p><p>Ask him what defines a leader today, and Mr Gupta turns slightly philosophical, and sees two profound challenges. One is having society question more intensely the role of companies.</p><p>\"The reality is that we are going to come on to increasing scrutiny from the man on the street, given income inequality, to justify why we exist. And I think leaders are going to have to be really conscious of that.\"</p><p>The other issue is the ability to confront and construct new rules for morality, ranging from data privacy to the role of robotics in the workplace. \"People underestimate the importance of philosophy, psychology, social sciences, and anthropology, in the jobs of the future. I think the big questions we will face are questions on morals.\"</p><p>He wonders out loud if he made the right call when asked about the bank's decision to end the financing of coal-power plants, once it closes off its previously committed projects through to 2021.</p><p>Mr Gupta is troubled by statistics showing that renewable energy contributes to just about a quarter of global electricity produced. Stripping out hydropower, that leaves wind and solar contributing less than 10 per cent to global electricity generation.\"One of the hardest decisions was the coal decision,\" he says. \"For the next 50 years, renewable energy won't get to 50 per cent of global energy. So it's just reality that if you want to give electricity to people in Vietnam, Myanmar and Indonesia, you have to use fossil fuel and you have to use them, because otherwise for the next 20 years, people won't have electricity in their homes.\"</p><p>The International Energy Association report says Southeast Asia's overall energy demand is set to grow by 60 per cent between now and 2040. Coal demand will rise in tandem; renewable sources of power generation would account for only around one-third of the increase in the region's electricity demand from now to 2040. Germany will cut its reliance on coal, but only by 2038, Mr Gupta notes.</p><p>\"On the other hand...you figure that if we don't start doing something, I mean the planet is just doomed. So we will see whether we can make a difference, but it's not a straightforward choice.\"</p><p>These leadership questions weigh on his mind, alongside the estimated 150 emails he gets from employees every quarter on internal issues, including policies that they think are wrong. He spends three months replying to them all. He has also replied directly to customers' complaints.</p><p>\"We genuinely learn things which I would never have known about, and the issues which we need to resolve and fix. So if I don't address them and reply to them myself, people will stop writing.\"</p><p>Mr Gupta dismisses the notion that he would leave behind big shoes to fill. His A-team now includes head of institutional banking group Tan Su Shan, Singapore country head Shee Tse Koon, and group head of strategy and planning, Han Kwee Juan. Asked if having these individuals earmarked so openly as potential CEOs would create rivalry, he insists otherwise. \"You should go ask them,\" he quips.</p><p>As it turns out, Ms Tan meets with BT for an unrelated interview a few days after. And when asked, she is unequivocal: \"I will set the record straight. Piyush is not going anywhere.\"</p><p>Talk of retirement and potential successors? Throughout the interview hour, Mr Gupta - who will turn 60 next year - barely sinks into the armchair. He seems comfortable pivoting at the literal edge of his seat, even as the sun calls it a day. \"I'm waiting for them to change the retirement age to 70.\"</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA</p><p>Chief Executive Officer DBS Group</p><p>Born in 1960</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>BA (Honours) in Economics, St Stephen's College, Delhi University, India</p><p>Postgraduate Diploma in Management, IIM, Ahmedabad</p><p>CAREER HIGHLIGHTS</p><p>1982 to 2009: Citigroup (where his last position was Chief Executive Officer for South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand)</p><p>Since 2009: Chief Executive Officer and Director of DBS Group</p><p>2013: Accorded the CEO Leadership Achievement Award for Singapore and Asia Pacific by The Asian Banker</p><p>2014: Named Singapore Business Leader of the Year by CNBC</p><p>2016: Won Singapore Business Awards' Outstanding Chief Executive of the Year</p><p>2019: Recognised as one of the world's top chief executives in Harvard Business Review's 2019 edition of \"The CEO 100\"</p><p>READ MORE: DBS aims for moderate M&amp;A diet to avoid indigestion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"Banking is a business of execution.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''The facial recognition genie, so to speak, is just emerging from the bottle,'' Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, wrote in December, when he called for regulation of the technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  San Francisco just put it back in.</p><p>  On Tuesday, the city's Board of Supervisors banned the use of facial recognition software by the police and other city agencies in an 8-to-1 vote. Supporters said its use by government was an invasion of privacy incompatible with healthy democracy. Departments will now need to first submit proposals and post public notices to use the technology. Private-sector and federal use isn't affected.</p><p>  That the ban was introduced by San Francisco, a city pivotal to the development of the technology, was viewed by some as a siren call. ''This is like Detroit banning a certain model of vehicle because it's too dangerous,'' said Alvaro Bedoya, a visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. ''You may not live in Detroit, but, boy, you'd think twice before getting in that car.''</p><p>  Expect more cities to follow: Somerville, Mass., outside Boston, is considering something similar, and Brian Hofer, a paralegal who drafted the San Francisco ordinance, is pushing for other anti-surveillance measures across California.</p><p>  Like it or not, it's a rare sign that technologies viewed as threats to citizens' well-being can be blocked. ''The decision refutes a defeatist and widespread opinion that once a technology is established, you can't stop it in its tracks,'' said Evan Selinger, a philosophy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p><p>  More than an app fight</p><p>  On Monday, the Supreme Court allowed an antitrust class action lawsuit against Apple, giving consumers an opportunity to try to prove that the iPhone maker used monopoly power to raise prices of iPhone apps.</p><p>  As my colleagues Adam Liptak and Jack Nicas reported, the lawsuit focuses on the fact that Apple charges developers a commission of up to 30 percent for selling products through its App Store, bars them from selling the apps elsewhere and plays a role in setting prices.</p><p>Apple claims that it is a middleman: that customers buy software from the app developers. But the court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, said iPhone owners had a ''direct purchaser'' relationship with Apple, so they had the right to sue.</p><p>  It's interesting that the decision went against Apple at all. Liberal jurists often favor antitrust action, and conservatives avoid it. So you'd have expected the verdict to be 5-to-4 in the other direction, along the conservative-liberal line of the Supreme Court.</p><p>  But the new justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, tipped the other way.</p><p>  You could read Justice Kavanaugh's decision as an indicator that, as people of all political stripes begin to find Big Tech troublesome, conservatives may accept that antitrust could be a useful tool in curbing its power. If that's accurate, Big Tech should be very concerned.</p><p>  Breaking up Facebook? Godspeed</p><p>  In 2019 there's little more fashionable than calling for Facebook's dismantlement.</p><p>  This past week, Senator Kamala Harris and Joseph R. Biden Jr., two of the Democrats running for president, said it should be considered, joining another, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has called for wider Big Tech breakups. And don't forget that Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, wrote this month that he wanted its split up, too.</p><p>  We could argue (at length) about the validity of the idea. But how plausible is it?</p><p>  The weapon of choice behind most of these calls is antitrust law. Fine. There's plenty of potentially anticompetitive behavior to go after. But in terms of end results, a breakup is possible, but by no means certain, from such legal action, according to antitrust experts I spoke with.</p><p>  Einer Elhauge, a Harvard law professor who was chairman of the antitrust advisory committee to the Obama campaign in 2008, told me that splitting WhatsApp and Instagram from Facebook -- the most popular proposal -- was plausible but might depend on how deeply integrated they had become.</p><p>  ''It's hard to unscramble eggs,'' he said. And Facebook's push to intertwine the platforms more closely may make such unscrambling only harder.</p><p>  Harry First, a law professor at New York University who specializes in antitrust, said breaking up what then remained of Facebook would be ''problematic and expensive,'' making it unlikely.</p><p>  More skeptical was Diana L. Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, who said that for any antitrust action, ''the remedy has to be applied specifically to the harm; it cannot be a broad remedy.'' That means that ''it may not even include breaking up the company,'' but would instead involve something less severe, like conduct requirements.</p><p>  Mr. First agreed that injunctions and the formal monitoring of conduct were ''much more likely'' outcomes than a breakup.</p><p>  So if an antitrust argument is used to break up the social network, it's not guaranteed to have the desired outcome. But, as Mr. First told me, for those who want it, ''it's good to have a goal.''</p><p>  Trump's social media priorities</p><p>  On Wednesday, more than a dozen countries, including Britain, France and Germany, signed a nine-point plan with big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter to address extremist and violent content. A notable absence: the United States.</p><p>  The Trump administration cited free-speech protections for not signing, saying that ''the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech.''</p><p>  The same day, the White House unveiled a bias reporting tool that enables people to report, to the government, censorship that they believe is a result of political bias on social networks. That thrusts into the public domain a widely held view among Republicans that platforms like Facebook and Twitter censor conservative viewpoints.</p><p>  As my colleague Kevin Roose pointed out, that looks like a savvy collection tool for voter data. But it's also an interesting, if not particularly surprising, demonstration of the priorities of the Trump administration.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Uber bombed its I.P.O. Its fall from a potential $120 billion blockbuster to a much-smaller debut that fell even further was a tale of mismanaged expectations and slumping confidence in the company's prospects.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Nothing is truly secure. Intel's computer chips, Microsoft's operating systems and WhatsApp's encrypted messaging were all shown to contain big security flaws this past week.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The United States is hitting out at Huawei.

Citi retains its Best Global Private Bank award, while also picking up accolades for customer service and work with global families. Its CEO of global private banking, Peter Charrington, is also named Best Leader. JPMorgan triumphs in the newer, 'softer skills' of philanthropy, diversity and training. The likes of Northern Trust, BNY Mellon and Bank of America are also on the list of winners and highly commended private banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PUTTING THE CLIENT FIRST While strong balance sheets and the health of the US economy has underpinned these banks' successes, there is also a more fundamental factor at play, that of becoming more attuned to develop a client-centric business, according to our judges.</p><p>\"This requires a different management mindset and a commitment to rethink customer engagement,\" says Seb Dovey, independent consultant and adviser to banks, who set up the Scorpio wealth think-tank. \"Those that get this early - like some of the American firms - will reap much longer term benefits. They will adjust their commercial model, they will increase their curation of data to make better commercial outcomes and they will embed a scalable model.\"</p><p>It is this combination of technological innovation, customer service and business acumen that is finally clicking for the US banks, many of whom have learned the hard way, paying for defections after clients were dismayed at their product-pushing ways post-financial crisis.</p><p>Not only is the 'can-do attitude' of the Americans beginning to take off, but their willingness to try out new ideas through measured risk taking is beginning to outshine European rivals, who are becoming more risk averse and thereby opening the door to US competition, according to Kim Cornwall, a former Merrill Lynch veteran of 25 years, now involved in training relationship managers, especially in Europe and the Middle East.</p><p>\"The US banks do not have some of the hang-ups that the old-school European banks have,\" says Mr Cornwall. \"They are happy to reach out to the younger generation and have launched many educational programmes that are well received by clients both old and young. They have good training programmes for their bankers and stress the importance of inter-generational wealth transfers. JPMorgan leads the pack, though some of the big Swiss banks are also strongly focused on this.\"</p><p>DIVERSITY AND SUSTAINABILITY UBS, Credit Suisse and Pictet, for example, continue to have a strong presence among our winners and pick up awards for quality, with their services spanning several continents. While the European banks, particularly the Swiss, are making significant progress in their work to woo the next generation of clients, focusing on entrepreneurship, education and socially responsible sectors, among others, it is the US firms that have been the most vocal around these subject areas.</p><p>This is particularly true with diversity, where the Americans have committed resources and adjusted their approach to business, whereas there appears to be little change to the attitudes of an older, traditionally white, male workforces of some players in Europe.</p><p>Not only that, but some continental firms still take home country workforces with them when setting up foreign outposts, leading to an atmosphere closer to the colonisation of yesteryear rather than the modern-day inclusivity they often preach. JPMorgan's aims and practices, for instance, include advancing black, Hispanic and Asian talent within the firm, commitments to hiring thousands of black students in apprenticeships over five years and empowering women. The bank's setting up of 10 different business resource groups representing constituencies including disabled workers, those from a military background, those from the next generation, LGBT employees and racial minorities is a stark reminder to many European players of their own challenges. Some European banks have fallen well behind the diversity trend and will begin to suffer as younger clients and relationship managers begin to seek firms which better represent their beliefs and mindsets.</p><p>A LEADERSHIP VISION When it comes to transforming these practices, more and more commentators talk about not just changing the organisational structures within the banks, but to make sure there is a strong leadership and vision at the helm.</p><p>US banks appear to have hit a richer vein of opportunity, due to their combination of management culture and quality of relationship managers, according to Gerard Aquilina, an adviser to family offices and former boss of international and domestic private banking at HSBC. \"US domestic private bankers have a far more substantive knowledge of credit and other banking skills than international private bankers,\" he says.</p><p>This organisational culture is further enhanced by influence from the top of the pyramid. \"American middle and senior management is generally qualitatively better than the others. They have had to regroup since 2008, but are on the roll again,\" he adds.</p><p>This appears particularly important when it comes to technological innovation, but also in the areas of socially responsible investments, training, diversity and philanthropy, which are of interest to all clients, but particularly light the fire of younger generations.</p><p>Leadership, and its role in transformation, is key to success. Global players such as Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered and HSBC have all faced major compliance and operational issues over recent years, after a period of strong, cross-border successes.</p><p>The question is whether they can return once more to winning ways through guidance from their upper echelons. \"HSBC has an amazing global franchise and the size to succeed, it has just lacked the commitment,\" says Mr Cornwall. \"There is now a good opportunity for HSBC, and with vision and a change in attitude, it could go places.\"</p><p>THE RESTRUCTURING TRAP But the future is less certain for others caught in the revolving door of regularly changing management, leading to an almost permanent spot in the purgatory of constant restructuring.</p><p>Mr Cornwall has \"seen the movie\" of sporadic hiring without strategic vision many times before, and warns banks not to pick up expensive staff willy-nilly without a strong central plan. \"You cannot go out and buy assets under management and relationship managers,\" he says. \"The best growth is always organic.\"</p><p>A \"fresh type of leadership\" could eventually emerge at Asian players such as DBS and Standard Chartered, which embrace a globalisation mindset that leads to a greater ambition outside their Asia-Pacific perimeter fence.</p><p>At least one Chinese bank (though most from the country are still concentrating on business opportunities in their thriving home market) is expected to burst onto the cross-border private banking stage within the next 10 years.</p><p>\"There is space for a global entity, or perhaps several entities, with strong, Asiabased roots and an Asian business platform,\" says Mr Dovey. \"So perhaps it is really a challenge for a fresh type of leadership that is open minded enough to look beyond traditional borders.\"</p><p>THE JUDGES Gerard Aquilina, independent family officer adviser.</p><p>d fficer in-Yuri Bender, editor-inchief, Professional Wealth Management magazine.</p><p>Kim and CE Cornwall, founder CEO, Cornwall and Co Consulting.</p><p>b Dovey, independent management consultant.</p><p>Seb wealth Shelby du Pasquier, partner, head of banking and finance group, Lenz &amp; Staehelin.</p><p>CEO, Simeon Fowler, Fowler Fox &amp; Co group of ompanies.</p><p>companies.</p><p>Julia Leong, partner, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Singapore.</p><p>Sing Silvia Pavoni, economi economics editor, The Banker.</p><p>Alois Pirker, research director wealth management, Aite Group.</p><p>Amin Rajan, CEO, Create-Research.</p><p>Ray Soudah, founder, MilleniumAssociates.</p><p>William Sullivan, president at Family Office Exchange.</p><p>Kai Upadek, partner, head of welath management, Oliver Wyman.</p><p>Helen Westropp, managing partner, Coley Porter Bell.</p><p>Cara Williams, global head of wealth management, Mercer.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST GLOBAL PRIVATE BANK \u00a6 BEST GLOBAL PRIVATE BANK FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR GLOBAL FAMILIES AND FAMILY OFFICES WINNER: CITI PRIVATE BANK everyThinG is finally clickinG for ciTi PrivaTe bank, which is achieving success in its ambition to deliver private banking services to the highest echelon of what it calls \"global citizens\".</p><p>These are small numbers of clients which the bank serves, probably less than 12,000 families with investments in excess of $25m around the world. But Citi's aim to give these families a global service, where they receive the same attention from 1000 frontline private bankers in 48 offices, wherever they find themselves in a particular week, seems to be ringing true.</p><p>This means that if a global client opens an account outside their home region, a 'host banker' will contact them to advise upon and execute transactions, in the same fashion as would have occurred in their home city. This host banker will also keep the primary relationship manager informed of all local transactions, so that when the client or family returns once more to their home stomping ground, their usual bankers are aware of their global asset exposures and business interests abroad.</p><p>One of the key improvements in the Citi offering has been a focus on the investments platform, with the establishment of a dedicated Citi Investment Management internal investment firm to serve the bank's private clients. This is an unusual move among private banks, but a sensible one in a world where the distinction between asset and wealth managers is becoming more vague, leaving clients with access to a greater number of potential competitors.</p><p>This proprietary asset management business is involved in all key markets, including Asia, where the group can cater to clients who make transaction orders in Mandarin, Cantonese and other regional languages.</p><p>The Asian investment operation under Roger Bacon is currently recruiting more Chinese nationals into its expanding, research-based operation.</p><p>\"We are focused on identifying native Chinese people to move into the business,\" says Mr Bacon. \"Clients on the mainland want to speak to people from their part of China.\"</p><p>In addition to proposing research-based thematic equity portfolios and alternative offerings in sectors such as biotechnology, investment staff are able to have deeper conversations with clients around specific objectives and opportunities. This is a far cry from 10 years ago, when internal investment staff complained about a bureaucratic internal structure which allowed them no flexibility in their investment practices.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN EUROPE \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN SWITZERLAND WINNER: PICTET headquarTered in Geneva, aT The hearT of euroPe, Pictet considers the continent as a natural strategic market, together with Switzerland, its historical market, and Asia.</p><p>Founded more than 200 years ago, the bank opened its first European office in London in 1980, and now has 27 offices across the world.</p><p>Pictet has been a pioneer in socially responsible investment, having launched strategies in that space more than 20 years ago. Today, Pictet's thematic franchise, which invests in companies addressing environmental and societal challenges, stands at $41bn.</p><p>\"We are seeing a trend among ultrahigh-net-worth individuals to embed responsibility or environmental, social and governance [ESG] more holistically throughout the management of their wealth,\" explains Heinrich Adami, head of private banking in London at Pictet Wealth Management.</p><p>In response to this demand, Pictet Wealth Management has launched a dedicated multi-assets responsible investing offer ing which combines differen t approaches currently available in the market, spanning ESG integration and active ownership, sustainability themes and impact investing. \"More products and solutions will emerge as the space becomes increasingly sophisticated to meet the expectations of a new generations of clients,\" adds Mr Adami.</p><p>Operating as a partnership since the foundation of the group in 1805, Pictet's seven partners share many common features with entrepreneurs and families. As such, they have a personal understanding of the needs and challenges that entrepreneurs and wealthy families face, as they have to deal with the same worries such as succession, education and the role of money.</p><p>\"That experience, together with Pictet's exclusive focus on wealth and asset management, with no investment banking activity and thus no conflicts of interest, has allowed us to offer independent advice to entrepreneurs throughout the lifecycle of their business,\" says Mr Adami. \"It is also Pictet's partnership ethos that allows the group to concentrate on creating value for the long term, a game-changer for wealthy families that often span several generations.\"</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN AUSTRIA \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN CROATIA WINNER: ERSTE PRIVATE BANKING celebraTinG iTs 200Th anniversary in 2019, Erste Group knows the importance of its traditions, but also of having a forwardthinking mindset.</p><p>Its 'George' online platform now handles the banking needs of more than 5 million customers in Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania, with Croatia and Hungary next in line.</p><p>\"Private banking clients in Austria have access to state-of-the art asset reporting through George,\" says Thomas Schaufler, the Erste BankOesterreich board member responsible for private banking. \"This interactive reporting allows clients to view their entire portfolio of assets online at any time. Its comprehensive functions makes it possible for clients to, among other things, choose the period of the report, find all securities positions easily, and retrieve detailed evaluations.\" Erste's private banking operations now cover 19,000 clients across Austria and the central and eastern Europe region, with assets under management standing at (EURO)22.6bn.</p><p>Alternative investments are of increasing interest to these clients, reports Andr\u00e1s K\u00e1llay, head of the Erste Group Private Banking CEE Competence Centre, with real estate funds proving particularly popular. \"Private equity is starting to be perceived as an interesting vehicle for enhancing the portfolio return,\" he adds. \"However, this type of investment is still at an early stage for most of our clients.\"</p><p>Environmental, social and governance investments are also a growing part of client portfolios, especially in Austria, where responsible investing has a long history, says Mr K\u00e1llay.</p><p>To enhance efficiency and profitability, Erste has initiated the process of downgrading some clients below the official private banking threshold.</p><p>\"Those downgrades that we did undertake - mainly to the top affluent segment - went really smoothly because we have a very broad product and service offering and due to the fact that the impacted clients still have a well-qualified personal adviser, quite possibly a mid-level adviser,\" says Mr K\u00e1llay.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN THE MIDDLE EAST \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN QATAR \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN RUSSIA \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR ENTREPRENEURS WINNER: CREDIT SUISSEcrediT suisse's disTincTive TraiT is iTs abiliTy To deliver iTs services ThrouGh an inTeGraTed franchise, across private, investment and corporate banking. Founded 163 years ago by Alfred Escher, the Swiss business leader, politician and railway pioneer, the bank keeps entrepreneurial thinking as one of its core principles, and prides itself in being able to support entrepreneurs through every stage of their business cycle.</p><p>In Russia, where private wealth and corporate activities are much more intertwined than in western Europe or the US, many clients are entrepreneurs and have major stakes in Russian companies. \"Our clients are looking to us beyond wealth management and we can provide them access to our other capabilities, including project finance, export finance, structured lending and investment banking,\" says Robert Cielen, head of international wealth management for emerging Europe at Credit Suisse.</p><p>Many of the bank's relationship managers have backgrounds in corporate and investment banking, which enables them to better understand client needs and deliver across a broad range of corporate and investment banking opportunities.</p><p>In Russia, increasing numbers of ultrahigh-net-worth clients have their own family offices, employing seasoned investment professionals and the bank is investing in a dedicated ultra-high-net-worth investment delivery function for the Russian market. This includes continuing to hire investment professionals that are \"true investment partners\" to the most sophisticated clients and their family offices, as well as providing clients access to Credit Suisse's Global Markets trading platforms and institutional-type services.</p><p>In the Middle East, the ultra-high-networth client segment provides the biggest source of wealth but entrepreneurial wealth is rising too. \"Although still relatively nascent, entrepreneurship is beginning to flourish in the Middle East, as the region's economic growth prospects diversify from traditional industries and move towards new sectors,\" says Bruno Daher, head of international wealth management for the Middle East and Turkey at Credit Suisse. Moreover, as part of a drive to build a self-sustaining non-oil sector, Gulf Co-operation Council countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are building a framework that is more supportive for start-up enterprises and allows for greater competition.</p><p>Middle Eastern investors, including Qatari nationals, are looking for global and local solutions that address both their business and personal needs. When compared with other emerging market investors, such as from Asia-Pacific, the Middle Eastern investor has less developed capital markets and local solutions in their own region. \"Credit Suisse is well positioned to partner with these clients and support the region's appetite for a unique, complex and crossregional offering, utilising our private bank, investment bank and asset management franchise,\" explains Mr Daher.</p><p>A further client benefit of this approach is risk diversification. Many clients hold a large portion of their assets in a single country or region, but the bank's offering of lending against local shares allows the firm to provide clients with the required liquidity, offering diversification and yield enhancement through reinvestment in well-diversified investment solutions. \"We can help our clients to diversify internationally without having to sell their assets,\" he says.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN ASIA \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR UHNW CLIENTS \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR SUSTAINABLE INVESTING WINNER: UBS The raPid GrowTh of ubs's discreTionary manaGed susTainable invesTinG PorTfolios, which have swollen to SFr7bn ($7bn) from at the beginning of 2018, is testament to growing client demand.</p><p>\"Many clients, not just younger generations, have strong sustainability affinities,\" says James Purcell, global head of sustainable and impact investing at UBS Global Wealth Management. \"We seek to respond to that demand by offering investment products and services that are highly credible, impactful and, where possible, give the client the opportunity to express their individual personal values.\"</p><p>Partnerships are critical to innovating in this space. UBS partnered with the World Bank to co-design the world's first financial benchmarks for publicly traded development bank debt, and then built a financial product with exclusive liquidity terms. In its discretionary managed sustainable investing portfolios, it has tapped the expertise of many investors, including BlackRock and Amundi.</p><p>Clients have also responded positively to the bank's private market partnerships. It has raised almost SFr500m for its Oncology Impact Fund in partnership with MPM, and has also worked with firms such as KKR and Generation on impact fund launches.</p><p>Most recently, UBS partnered with Hermes and Federated Investors to launch the first fixed-income fund in high-yield credit, where environmental, social and governance engagement is at the core of the investment strategy. \"While engagement has long been associated with equity investors and their voting power, we feel strongly that the regular contact and refinancing provided by bond investors makes them a key stakeholder for corporates and thus a highly effective engagement partner,\" says Mr Purcell. UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, sources more than $411bn in client assets from Asia, equivalent to 16% of its $2500bn total assets under management. Asia hosts the highest number of billionaires in the world, more than 800, representing almost 40% of the global billionaire population, according to the UBS PwC Billionaire 2018 report. \"The region remains one of the most important sources of new business opportunities for UBS,\" says August Hatecke, co-head of UBS Global Wealth Management for Asia.</p><p>The bank has had a presence in the region for more than 50 years and has 12 wealth management offices in 10 locations, with Singapore and Hong Kong its key booking centres. In China, it is also one of the few foreign banks with both onshore branch banking and full securities licences. Its three trading outlets in China offer wealth management services through UBS Securities. UBS's joint venture with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, announced in June, represents the Japanese market's \"first ever\" wealth management partnership with an international financial group and a Japanese trust bank, according to UBS.</p><p>Domestic businesses are expected to become increasingly important for the bank, going forward.</p><p>\"Many of the bank's Asian wealth management clients are entrepreneurs, who require a global bank offering wealth management services but also capabilities to advise on and execute complex corporate transactions,\" says Mr Hatecke. These include as large asset sales, mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings, and other large capital raising activities, and UBS client advisers undergo \"specialised additional training modules\" to be able to help clients explore these opportunities.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN LATIN AMERICA WINNER: SANTANDER PRIVATE BANKING sanTander PrivaTe bankinG's Presence sTreTches across 10 differenT markeTs, serving more than 210,000 clients in Europe and the Americas.</p><p>The bank has recently directed efforts towards the integration of its different private banking business in separate countries.

And on the other, it involves a team of experts who advise the client on how to organise their portfolio and investment decisions,\" says Mr Cornella.</p><p>He adds that part of the bank's added value is the ability to offer global services while maintaining proximity to its customers. \"We have also built strategic alliances with third parties that enable our customers to benefit from a wider and independent range of options,\" says Mr Cornella.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN AUSTRALIA WINNER: PRIVATE WEALTH - WESTPAC GROUP PrivaTe wealTh is ParT of The wesTPac GrouP, ausTralia's oldesT comPany and bank, founded in 1817.

Ahli United Bank (AUB) believes itself to be uniquely positioned to cater to this growing demand within the region.</p><p>The bank prides itself on having a deep understanding of the changing needs of the GCC and Middle Eastern high-net-worth clients. Its main focus in 2018 was to implement its strategy of creating value through segmentation and products, which led to growth in the client base and helped acquire new money.</p><p>During 2018, customer deposits increased by 9% and, despite a difficult economic backdrop and negative movements across asset classes, total assets under management were largely maintained at the same levels as the previous year. AUB has continued to strengthen its private banking business by providing additional human resources to enhance its teams in various locations, and at multiple levels.</p><p>The bank's open architecture model gives clients' access to both conventional and sharia-compliant investment solutions. Recent product launches have included a capital-protected structured deposits vehicle, a life settlement fund, and a private equity fund focusing on the US retail sector.</p><p>Although the bank considers all client segments equally important, it has a special focus on ultra-high-net-worth individuals and is currently developing a platform to attract new money, specifically targeting younger investors, with the view to establishing strategic and long-lasting partnerships with clients.</p><p>November 2019 | THE BANKER | 15 \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN BELGIUM WINNER: BNP PARIBASFORTISbnP ParibasforTis, The larGesT PrivaTe bank in belGium with more than (EURO)62bn in assets under management at the end of 2018, has a key mission, namely to invest 100% of client assets in sustainable investments by 2025.</p><p>Since this goal was set in 2015, the bank has succeeded in growing the proportion from 5% to 30%. \"There are enough products and providers today that enable us to increase our socially responsible investing [SRI] penetration.

Sustainable solutions are positioned as the bank's first and preferred offering, proactively proposed to every client, as opposed to being just one option of its investment range. As such, they are the 'new norm' at BNP ParibasFortis and have become a key competitive differentiator.</p><p>Another key pillar of the bank's business strategy is to maximise digitalisation and efficiency. \"Being customer focused allows you to be more pioneering,\" says Mr Vermeire, quoting Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos. In that same spirit, he says, BNP ParibasFortis has developed PaxFamilia, a \"digital family office\", in partnership with fintech firm GuiSquare.</p><p>The digital tool enables clients to plan and manage their personal and family wealth.

During 2018, assets under management grew by 18% to reach $110.2bn, while the number of clients increased by 18.3% to 8667.</p><p>Much of this growth was due to the bank's efforts to personalise offerings with products and services that fit clients' individual needs and preferences, says Luiz Severiano Ribeiro, CEO of Ita\u00fa Private Bank. \"Returns also play an important role, of course: our portfolios have generated consistent results in the past few years, so clients feel that they can rely on us.\"</p><p>In a recent client satisfaction survey, the bank received a net promoter score of 71%, in line with leading companies across all industries.</p><p>The bank has used big data techniques to better anticipate clients' needs. Implementing the technology, and getting the best out of it, has been \"quite a challenge\", says Mr Ribeiro.</p><p>\"There is no room for error with a sensitive public as ours. But the large amount of data we do have is helping us learn more about our clients' habits, education, hobbies and spending patterns, making it possible for us to offer even more personalised products, reports, events and means of communication,\" he adds.</p><p>While Brazil undergoes political and economic upheaval, Ita\u00fa Private Bank's model includes three practices to \"protect clients from economic headwinds\". These are careful product curation, tailored and diversified product portfolios for each client, and offering access to alternatives in the global marketplace.</p><p>\"Our experienced investment team has a global approach; we generally recommend that our clients allocate 20% to 30% of their portfolios to international assets,\" says Mr Ribeiro.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN CANADA WINNER: RBC WEALTH MANAGEMENT rbc wealTh manaGemenT (rbc wm) describes iTself as a \"diGiTally enabled relaTionshiP bank\" and data is at the forefront of this.

Data science algorithms and big data technologies help the bank to better understand and anticipate customers' needs. \"There is more data available and more demands being put on this data - what insights we can find, and how it can help clients and our businesses,\" says Ms Do. \"Using data in new ways while ensuring client privacy is mission critical in our innovation approach.</p><p>\"Collaborating with RBC business and functional partners created an opportunity to take a new approach to sharing data across RBC - with client consent - that ensured we met our commitment to a secure and more personalised experience for our clients.\"</p><p>The bank plans to expand and further leverage its strategic data assets to enable employees to provide a customised advice experience and more effective and seamless relationship management, regardless of how they choose to interact with RBC.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN CHILE WINNER: LARRAINVIAL one of The larGesT invesTmenT banks in chile, LarrainVial has more than $28bn in assets under management. During 2018, it increased the number of new private clients by 7.1%, bringing the total to 1765. A number of strategies were deployed to attract new clients, including improving the investment offering, financial education, engaging more closely with existing clients and targeting new client groups such as women and millennials.</p><p>Underpinning these efforts has been the bank's open-architecture approach. Gonzalo C\u00f3rdova, head of wealth management at LarrainVial, says: \"We believe that our openarchitecture structure is a key advantage for our clients. It allows us to access funds that are best in class. Our financial advisory area is able to review and monitor funds from all over the world and recommend the portfolio it believes is the best option for clients.\"</p><p>An open-architecture approach not only proves the bank's independence but also means that its advisory services \"are of greater value\" and the bank can charge for them, claims Mr C\u00f3rdova.</p><p>The bank segments clients along traditional lines of size and risk but has begun to incorporate goals and lifestyles. For example, young professionals with growing incomes and savings capacity are offered the Voluntary Pension Saving product, which has tax and regulatory benefits to incentivise investment. This enables the bank to offer these clients the same product range that is available to high-net-worth clients.</p><p>\"We attempt to understand and incorporate clients' goals when we build a portfolio - the needs of someone looking to save to buy a house are very different from paying for children's education or retirement,\" says Mr C\u00f3rdova. \"This goal-orientated approach is very popular with our younger investors.\"</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN CHINA WINNER: ICBC PRIVATE BANKING esTablished more Than a decade aGo, the private banking division of the Industrial Bank of China (ICBC) targets high-networth clients with assets of more than Rmb8m ($1.1m).

It has also strengthened co-operation with other business lines across the group, including investment banking and personal finance divisions, to enhance the services offered to private banking clients.</p><p>The range of investment products on offer include a wide range of assets from equity to fixed-income investments, private equity and alternatives, to respond to clients' requirements in terms of returns, liquidity and safety.</p><p>Recognising the importance that the use of technology has on the quality and efficiency of the interactions between relationship managers and clients, ICBC has established a new platform, e-service, specifically built to enhance the efficiency of its relationship managers. In addition, the use of big data analytics has allowed the bank to explore clients' needs and behaviours in a deeper and more precise way.</p><p>In addition to serving high-net-worth clients, ICBC pays great attention to their children, believing them to be potential future clients. Programmes targeting younger generations include an annual summer camp and the Elite Youth Training Camp in Beijing, which focuses on young people who have already shown good management skills and performance in their family businesses.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN COLOMBIA WINNER: BTG PACTUAL bTG PacTual Provides wealTh manaGemenT services across The main wealTh hubs in laTin america, with offices in Brazil, Colombia and Chile.</p><p>In addition, the bank has been taking steps towards growing its presence in the US. In 2016, it opened an office in Miami with the aim of serving clients in this growing financial hub, their investors and the expanding Latin American community in south Florida.</p><p>In Colombia, BTG Pactual's wealth management business is focused on the provision of investment and advisory services to high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients. According to the bank, its one-stopshop approach is underpinned by a consistent track record, strong cross-selling between business units, a team of experienced professionals and a broad offering of products and services.</p><p>In 2018, the business attracted a record high volume of new assets, helping to consolidate its presence in the Colombian market. Cross-selling with merger and acquisition deals led by the bank's investment banking unit served as an opportunity to capture net new money from clients.</p><p>In addition, the consolidation of the bank's alternative investment strategy with a broad selection of investment solutions means clients can now access a wide range of investment solutions to diversify their portfolios, with strong return potential, low volatility and controlled risk.</p><p>\"We are constantly improving the advice process, understanding clients' financial needs in an integrated manner,\" says Juan Rafael P\u00e9rez, CEO at BTG Pactual in Colombia. Its recommendations, he adds, are tailor-made and based on a deep analysis of each individual client.</p><p>\"This allows us to design a specific investment strategy, the objective of which is to combine tax optimisation vehicles and investment products in local and offshore markets, oriented to maximise the portfolio results.\"</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC WINNER: CSOB PRIVATE BANKING in 2018, csob PrivaTe bankinG made a siGnificanT chanGe To iTs business sTraTeGy, by starting to offer private banking services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a first in the country for a private bank. The move was driven by increased demand for investment advice from business owners, already clients of the group's investment bank.</p><p>While the new form of co-operation within the bank was tepidly received by commercial bankers, the synergy between the two divisions is expected to bring significant advantages.</p><p>In the long run, business owners will benefit from the professional management of their earnings, which would otherwise be placed in deposits, savings or term accounts, and will also be able to access post-sale services, explains Pavel Tich\u00fd, private banking segment management and wealth office director at CSOB Private Banking.</p><p>The new set-up enables the private bank to gain greater specialisation by growing and developing tailor-made solutions for large client portfolios.</p><p>While the growth potential from SMEs is considerable, the largest part of new inflows at CSOB in 2018 derived from the cooperation with the bank's retail and premium segments. An incentive scheme encouraging affluent bankers to introduce eligible clients to CSOB Private Banking contributed to drive 10% growth in the number of new clients in 2018.</p><p>When it comes to portfolio management, \"the most important skill is our longterm experience in ser ving clients throughout uncertain or shaky periods\", says Mr Tich\u00fd. Clients need to understand that success comes in the long run and that sticking to a selected strategy and discipline eventually pays off, he adds.</p><p>Looking forward, in volatile and unpredictable markets where conservative fixedincome solutions offer little value, a key goal for the private bank is to improve its offering of investment advisory solutions, as well as enhancing automation of processes and digitalisation. The bank also aims to grow its lending penetration rate, which is in line with the 2% country average, but lags behind the 10% of western European banks. \"Central and eastern European clients tend to be more conservative, but their needs should not differ so much,\" says Mr Tich\u00fd.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN DENMARK WINNER: NYKREDIT PRIVATE BANKING for nykrediT PrivaTe bankinG, PersonalisaTion is an imPorTanT elemenT in iTs business model; private bankers at the institution have smaller client portfolios than the average for the Danish market, serving between 50 and 100 clients.

The bank launched a Next Generation project, which targeted high-net-worthindividuals in the 18 to 35 age bracket with more than DKr20m. Clients are offered learning experiences, social events, exclusive memberships and discounts on hotel stays, clothes and more. Communications between clients and their private banker are based on the media they use, such as text and instant chat apps.</p><p>\"The results of our Next Generation programme have exceeded our expectations,\" says Ms M\u00e5nsson. \"We have seen huge interest from our families, who see value in our offering. We have experienced the highest customer satisfaction score among this group of above 90 out of 100, just as we have seen an increase in parents' satisfaction.\"</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN FRANCE WINNER: BNP PARIBAS BANQUE PRIV\u00c9E FRANCE wiTh commandinG PosiTions in The french and belGian markeTs, and strong ambitions in Germany, Luxembourg and Asia, BNP Paribas remains a force to be reckoned with in cross-border wealth management, although the bank's nerve centre remains in Paris.</p><p>Its wealth business now employs 7000 staff, 1300 of them in Asia, where growth in Greater China is seen as the bank's number one priority. BNP Paribas boasts relationships with 60% of Hong Kong's tycoons and crucially, these are not local relationships but global ones, which include objectives across Europe, where Chinese investors have been picking up real estate bargains, and the US. Crucial to many of the deals is the close link between wealth management and the corporate and investment banking arm of the bank. The cross-border nature of the high-networth society means French clients are also increasingly booking assets into other centres. \"Families often prefer to structure a holding company in Luxembourg,\" where staff offer strong family governance services and have expertise in multiple assets, says Vincent Lecomte, co-CEO of BNP Paribas Wealth Management.</p><p>\"For families with members who live in France, Belgium and Italy, it is easier to use Luxembourg to structure their wealth. We have dedicated executives there in wealth planning and credit, who work together with domestic market teams.\"</p><p>BNP Paribas has been making significant progress in sustainability and impact investing, now offering digital solutions to clients interested in these areas in most key target markets.</p><p>But it is important to keep an eye on innovations on French home soil, as the successful ones are likely to receive broader rollouts in satellite territories.</p><p>Recent launches include MyMand@te, a digitalised discretionary portfolio management service allowing clients the choice of hundreds of pre-programmed asset allocations.</p><p>One of the most notable innovations is the launch of MyImpact, an app allowing clients to invest according to parameters set in the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals, as well as to become more involved in philanthropic work.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN GEORGIA WINNER: TBC BANK sTronG brand recoGniTion and a focus on diGiTal TechnoloGy helPed GeorGia's Tbc bank to increase its private client base by 55.9% in 2018 to reach a total of 50,756.

The bank recently acquired a 65% stake in My Group, a leading e-commerce player in Georgia. It operates four online marketplaces: automotive, automotive spare parts, consumer to consumer and housing.</p><p>\"The acquisition of My Group is a big leap in the development of our ecosystem strategy, as it will broaden our relationship with customers and create strong synergies for the core banking business, including the lending, payments and insurance businesses,\" says Mr Butskhrikidze.</p><p>ATE \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN GERMANY TH WINNER: DEUTSCHE BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT MAN GEMENT afTe ears r oing lar investm afTer several years of resTrucTurinG, which is still ongoing mainly within its investment banking arm, the largest private bank in Germany has at last won the coveted award for its home turf. \"What differentiates us in Germany is our German roots and global reach,\" says Fabrizio Campelli, global head of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. \"We are able to work with clients both domestically and internationally, supporting them in managing their private wealth and corporate needs.\"</p><p>erman root ampelli, g th Manag German ach,\" Fa B e wo internamanaging Ww pri , cor p age mar e ed e Ge visio In late 2018, the private bank revised its global coverage structure, bringing Europe and Germany into one market region.

Clients from outside of London have access to the full range of private banking products and services.</p><p>\"In 2019, we have run a series of client events in the regions aimed at entrepreneurs who are looking to transition the ownership of their business,\" says Charles Boulton, CEO at HSBC Private Bank UK. \"Our quarterly investment outlook programme has been delivered locally to clients across Scotland, the north and the Midlands. We are proud of our regional teams and are fully committed to expanding our presence outside of London.\"</p><p>The UK market is experiencing significant challenges at the moment, he says, but he believes these present opportunities for global banks to broaden and deepen private client relationships. \"We offer our clients increased stability and confidence that comes with being a global financial institution, with a strong balance sheet,\" says Mr Boulton.</p><p>In Asia, HSBC services private banking clients throughout the region through key onshore hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, mainland China and Taiwan and continues to expand. In September 2018, it announced plans to hire 700 new client team roles in Asia by the end of 2022, most of them in Hong Kong and Singapore. It is also investing heavily in its digital capabilities in the region, including the implementation of a new core banking platform, Avaloq, along with digital initiatives to improve the client experience.</p><p>A key opportunity for the bank is the transition of wealth to the next generation, with about $4000bn expected to be passed down to the next generation over the coming 10 years. \"Recognising this opportunity we have developed a Next Generation programme to engage with the future business leaders around the world, to better equip them with understanding how to manage and protect their family's wealth,\" says Mr Boulton.</p><p>One example of this is the bank's scheme whereby it takes 15 Next Generation clients for a week-long immersive experience in the jungles of Borneo, with the plan being for them to witness first-hand the impact of climate change and learn how they can build sustainability into their family business models.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN HUNGARY \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN UKRAINE WINNER: OTP PRIVATE BANKING oTP GrouP is one of The mosT acTive consolidaTors in The cenTral and easTern euroPe (cee)/commonwealTh of inde-PendenT sTaTes reGion, having recently completed or announced acquisitions in Croatia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, Moldova and Montenegro.

It also uses international standards to assess service quality and undertakes yearly audits to monitor performance. Also during 2018, the bank launched KWealth, an SMS service with dedicated staff that ensures clients are called back within 30 minutes.</p><p>Other forms of client engagement include programmes such as NexGen Connect, a two-day annual programme for millennial clients that is designed to help them make informed investment decisions. The bank also conducts tutorials on investment for the spouses of existing clients.</p><p>New exclusive product offerings and a greater emphasis on non-investment products such as credit and banking have been used by the bank to expand relationships beyond investments.

Only Japan has more elderly people than Italy, with 20% of its population aged 65 and over. \"Today, the wealth gap between the young and the old has stretched to the widest on record, and this is why succession planning services are among the most sought after by our clients,\" says Gian Maria Mossa, CEO at Banca Generali. Wealth planning services are also highly in demand because 99% of Italian firms are small and medium-sized enterprises, and mostly family run. Inheritance tax is low, compared with other countries, but there is uncertainty about how long this will last, given the Italy's high public debt.</p><p>Banca Generali's proprietary advisory platform allows private bankers to monitor a client's entire wealth across financial and real estate assets, while enabling clients to define their inheritors, the statutory portion of their inheritance and the impact of taxation.</p><p>To meet client demand, Banca Generali has recently introduced a new range of advisory services dedicated to entrepreneurs, allowing them to compare their firm's performance and sustainability against competitors in their sector and better plan for the future. The bank's partnership with PwC and law firms offers entrepreneurs access to a range of related services. Through the platform provided by Danish fintech Saxo Bank, the Italian bank offers corporates with international exposure dynamic hedging of foreign currency exposure.</p><p>The bank has also expanded its range of products and service tools in the advisory space. Bespoke technology developed in partnership with UBS in 2018 scans client portfolios daily and assesses them against risk profiles, quality criteria and investment goals, helping private bankers better manage portfolio risk and provide investment recommendations.</p><p>The alliance with Saxo Bank has led to the creation of a new entity, BG-Saxo, providing clients with the opportunity to trade online instruments such as equities, bonds and exchange-traded funds. The partnership also allows the Italian bank to develop a fast client onboarding process.</p><p>While Italian private wealth is still largely linked to real estate, representing (EURO)5200bn of the (EURO)9000bn total wealth in the country, it is important clients diversify from this traditional asset class, where prices are at historical lows, according to Mr Mossa.</p><p>In addition to insurance-based solutions, thematic funds and absolute return strategies, in 2018 the bank launched a new Luxembourg Sicav of alternative and illiquid funds, in partnership with more than 20 third-party managers. The range is focused on long-term themes such as sustainability, technological innovation and demographics. Working with London-based adviser Mainstreet Partners, Banca Generali has also introduced a new advisory sustainable investment platform, where investment portfolios are aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. The technology allows private bankers to build portfolios focused on specific sustainable goals, those most important to each individual client, and also measure the impact of each investment along environmental, social and governance themes. In 2018, Banca Generali acquired Valeur Fiduciaria, a wealth management boutique based in Switzerland, which signalled the start of a targeted international expansion, expected to take shape in 2020. The move was driven by the need to meet increasing client demand for diversifying the custody of assets across different booking centres.</p><p>\"In addition to securing a banking licence, we are considering adding new services to build a proper Italian wealth management hub in Switzerland,\" says Mr Mossa.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN KENYA \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN NIGERIA \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN AFRICA WINNER: STANDARD BANK WEALTH AND INVESTMENT The mission sTaTemenT aT sTandard bankwealTh and invesTmenT is simPle: to be the leading high-net-worth wealth business for sub-Saharan clients and those who are interested in Africa.</p><p>In light of changing client expectations, the bank has focused on transitioning from a product-led proposition to one that is insight-led, with the aim being to increase client confidence and loyalty. Its 'Challenger' model personalises sales messages, provides insight into unique client needs and challenges and tries to enable more informed decision making.</p><p>In a bid to better understand its clients, Standard Bank commissioned a study to gain insight into Africa's wealthy population. Key themes to emerging from the report include: that Africa's wealthy accumulate and spend their wealth in unique ways, and enjoy personalised, bespoke wealth management experiences; a host of factors concern Africa's wealthy and safeguarding their wealth is paramount; while philanthropy is viewed in the context of 'giving back'.</p><p>Innovations in 2018 included its Elite model portfolio range, managed by Stanlib Multi-Manager under a discretionary fund management mandate which allows wealth managers to focus on offering holistic wealth management advice, and its first third-party retail investor hedge fund solution. Meanwhile, its limited endowment product was the first sharia-compliant tax-efficient endowment policy in South Africa.</p><p>On the digital front, the My360 app officially launched in April 2019.

In 2018, it launched a Global Opportunities certificate, an equity-based vehicle that invests globally in equities, exchange-traded funds and options. This vehicle offers clients access \"to BAPBs equity team's best trading strategies through a pooled vehicle structure\", claims a spokesperson. In response to client demand, BAPB introduced a new discretionary mandate investing according to sustainable and responsible investment criteria. A spokesperson for the bank says: \"We have found that such an approach no longer penalises investors for caring about the environment and social progress. On the contrary, responsible investing is now in a position to meet or beat traditional approaches. This creates the attractive option for socially motivated investors to invest their wealth profitably in a manner that is aligned with their values.\"</p><p>The needs of private clients across the Middle East and north Africa region have been evolving quickly, and BAPB relies heavily on its local presence to adapt and react to these changes. \"On the other hand, markets are becoming increasingly complex as the political/geopolitical aspects have been added to the equation, making predictions more difficult and the outlook more opaque,\" says the spokesperson. \"This complexity has called for more frequent communication with clients, as well as more innovative investment solutions.\"</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN LUXEMBOURG \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK IN THE NETHERLANDS \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN EUROPE WINNER: ING clienTs are demandinG more from PrivaTe banks and They wanT iT fasTer.

For example, the global CX Hackathon sees ING staff from across the globe collaborate on highly focused efforts aimed at improving the customer experience. Meanwhile, the bank's structured innovation process, known as PACE, encourages the rapid launch of new products and services developed by small, autonomous, cross-disciplinary teams.

The investment approach starts by identifying multi-decade mega-trends and key structural themes expected to shape the world.</p><p>The current environment provides good hunting ground for thematic funds, as investors today are challenged by slow economic growth in a rapidly changing world. \"A thematically led investment process enables us to identify the global companies that can thrive in this era of disruption,\" explains Jeremy Thomas, head of thematic equities at Sarasin &amp; Partners, the J Safra Sarasin Group's London-based asset manager. \"Where there is disruption there is opportunity, as investors typically underappreciate the duration or magnitude of change,\" he adds.</p><p>Thematic investing appeals to private clients. Mega-themes such as digitalisation, automation, ageing or climate change are intentionally ubiquitous, and therefore easy for investors to appreciate and understand.</p><p>Sarasin's core equity strategies draw from these themes to find individual companies best placed to exploit growth opportunities, each stock having its own idiosyncratic investment case. This investment process allows the firm to build high-conviction, concentrated portfolios, highly differentiated from broad indices. This is also the key risk around thematic investing, according to Mr Thomas, as investors have to accept the inevitable volatility that comes with equity securities and understand that returns may differ markedly from market indices in the shorter term. Environmental, social and governance as well as sustainability considerations are embedded in every stage of Sarasin's thematic investment process.</p><p>The Swiss bank started operating in Monaco in 2006, and furthered its commitment with the acquisition of Credit Suisse Monaco, completed in 2017.

Coupled with the expertise of the bank's wealth and investment advisers, technology allows for any aspect of a client's plan to be changed in real time to accommodate real life, he adds.</p><p>The global family and private investment offices group is Northern Trust's fastest growing segment within wealth management. \"We keep clients at the centre of everything we do, act as a consultative partner, and tailor holistic, customised solutions,\" says Mr Fradkin.</p><p>The bank also regularly challenges conventional thinking regarding asset allocation and manager selection to provide investment solutions for clients that they would not typically receive at competitor firms, he adds. These innovative solutions have included real asset strategies, Chinafocused venture capital and private equity and fixed-income enhancement strategies.</p><p>To meet the more complex reporting needs of family offices, Northern Trust introduced an advanced business analytics solution, Anchor Analytics, which enables clients to visualise data, offering intuitive report authoring tools and, more recently, holistic data modelling, allowing clients to easily incorporate outside data sources.</p><p>With more than 130 years of experience working with business owners, Northern Trust provides advice throughout the lifecycle of a family-owned business. Advanced succession planning is essential to assuring the greatest chance for success, even for established and profitable businesses, says Mr Fradkin. For entrepreneurial ventures, it often requires even greater advanced focus and attention to deliver successful results.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN ASIA WINNER: TAISHIN BANK In iTs aim To become a reliable and rePu-Table PrivaTe bank in GreaTer china and The asia-Pacific reGion, Taishin Bank has a two-pronged strategy, based on understanding clients by their behaviour and using this information to customise products and services to suit individual clients.</p><p>To understand their behaviour, the bank collects information on clients including their age, transaction habits, channel preference and lifestyle. This strategy, claims Samuel Lin, deputy chief executive of the Taipei-based bank, has enabled it to increase client satisfaction. For example, the bank chooses the channel through which it communicates with clients based on their preferences. \"This is the reason that our clients are so willing to keep in touch with us,\" he says.</p><p>The bank combines digital services with traditional services; in-branch teller banking services are supplemented with video conference-based financial consulting services, for example. \"The video conference service provides customers with access to the latest market trends and financial advice from our professional team,\" says Mr Lin. \"Outside business hours, our customers can use our video teller machine service to consult with tellers face to face.\"</p><p>The most important factors in ensuring client satisfaction in private banking include professional financial advice, a 24-hour service, a fast and convenient digital platform and multiple offers and exclusive experience activities, says Mr Lin. \"Our configuration of services combines online and offline elements to provide full access and convenient, intelligent wealth management.\"</p><p>This customer-centric strategy helped Taishin record an 8% growth in wealth management fee income during 2018 and a compound annual growth rate of 10% from 2011 to 2018, claims Mr Lin.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE US WINNER: BNY MELLON WEALTH MANAGEMENT bny mellon wealTh manaGemenT sTronGly believes in a team-based customer approach, where each client is serviced by a wealth management team and has their wealth manager as their primary point of contact. When the need arises, wealth managers can tap into skilled specialists. These include wealth strategists, such as wealth planners and estate professionals, who also help clients define their philanthropic goals and inform them about critical matters, such as changing regulations and laws that could have an impact on their tax plans. Through appropriate planning, the typical wealthy family can boost its growth by 2% annually, according to the bank.</p><p>Private bankers are integral members of each client's wealth management team. They focus on both sides of a client's balance sheet and develop tailored solutions that reflect each client's unique tax, financial and personal circumstances. Family wealth investment advisers assist ultra-high-net-worth and family office clients in developing sophisticated and bespoke investment solutions to meet their more complex needs. Fiduciary specialists are focused on developing trusts for families across jurisdictions, understanding that familial wealth goes beyond traditional financial assets, and therefore assets such as real estate or an art collection need to be incorporated into estate plans.</p><p>A core tenet of BNY Mellon's 'Active Wealth' approach is that a wealth plan must integrate goals-based investing, dynamic spending, opportunistic borrowing, tax management, and family governance and estate planning techniques to empower clients to make smart decisions and navigate the unpredictable and unexpected with confidence. Getting to know clients and understanding their goals, concerns and needs is key to being able to deliver results across market cycles and spanning multiple generations. The bank has a client-relationship tenure that averages 10 years.</p><p>\"Our long history as an institution, and the depth of our relationships with our clients, has given us a unique insight into what drives market cycles, what clients are most concerned about and what must be done to create lasting wealth,\" says Ben McGloin, managing director and head of advice, planning and fiduciary services, at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR BRAND STRATEGY WINNER: LOMBARD ODIER lombard odier's brand values are rooTed in iTs 'reThink everyThinG' PhilosoPhy.</p><p>\"When we started to define and articulate our brand purpose and positioning, we reached deep into our history to understand the drivers of our differentiation and success,\" says Fabio Mancone, chief branding officer at Lombard Odier. \"We realised that for more than two centuries, our bank had thrived on innovation, adopting fresh perspectives and constantly rethinking the world around itself.\"</p><p>This underlying philosophy has helped the bank weather more than two centuries and 40 financial crises, and enables it to continue to pursue its core mission, which is preserving and growing the wealth of clients, he adds.</p><p>In 2018, the bank made a public commitment to the 'sustainability revolution' via a branding campaign. This year, it illustrated its approach by identifying farsighted, decisive companies, called 'the Eagles', and those with \"their heads in the sand, blind to the transformations taking place in every sector of the economy\", which it labels 'the Ostriches'.</p><p>\"Few banks have sustainability so close to their heart. We have long been both a responsible business and a sustainable investor,\" says Mr Mancone, who adds that this strong commitment has also allowed greater engagement with clients, prospects and employees.</p><p>In the 19th century, Alexandre Lombard, a second-generation partner, was a driving force in abolishing Sunday labour in Switzerland, and was among the first to actively support Henri Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross. In 1841, he advised clients against investing in US companies reliant on slave labour, whose business models he judged unsustainable.</p><p>Today, Lombard Odier embeds proprietary sustainability analysis and environmental, social and governance metrics into all its investment processes and was the first global wealth and asset manager to achieve B Corp certification, the corporate sustainability rating, earlier in 2019.</p><p>\"This focus on sustainability is the direct result of our forward-looking vision, and our commitment to thinking and investing for the long term. We believe that sustainability will be the biggest investment opportunity in modern history,\" says Mr Mancone.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANKING BOUTIQUE WINNER: BANQUE SYZ wiTh more Than $29bn in clienT asseTs aT The end of 2018, privately-owned Banque SYZ claims to combine \"the best\" of Swiss private banking tradition, in terms of independence, quality of service and expertise in global investment management, with the \"human dimension\".</p><p>Founded in 1996 in Geneva, the bank is free from shareholder pressure to deliver short-term results and is able to focus on its long-term aspirations. This allows prioritising quality of service and personal relationship with customers, says Nicolas Syz, head of private banking at Banque SYZ and son of Eric Syz, one of the founders. \"Our focus as an independent and family-owned company is to provide tailor-made investment solutions to families, entrepreneurs and family offices at every stage of their wealth,\" he adds.</p><p>Discretionary mandate strategies, managed through a \"rigorous\" risk-based investment process, use performance-linked remuneration fees, allowing the alignment of interests with clients' investment objectives, he states.</p><p>In 2018, the Swiss Group, which also serves institutions and independent managers, launched SYZ Capital, to offer clients access to select niche opportunities across private markets and direct investments. Led by Marc Syz, the eldest son of Eric Syz, the business's mission is to 'democratise' access to high-conviction alternative investments, by lowering minimum entry thresholds. It also provides qualified investors with a \"flexible, diversified portfolio of niche and curated opportunities\", often overlooked by bigger players.</p><p>Demand for alternatives is growing, as clients look to generate performance in a low-yield environment by diversifying exposure away from traditional asset classes, and are increasingly comfortable with including illiquid strategies in their portfolio.</p><p>\"Illiquidity can be a risk and an opportunity, as long as the illiquid nature of strategies fits into the investment mandate and risk profile, and is well understood by the client,\" says Nicolas Syz. The risk lies where some illiquid strategies are packaged into supposedly more liquid structures or products, offering a false sense of liquidity to investors, he explains. This was the main issue faced by hedge funds during the financial crisis.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR ALTERNATIVES WINNER: LGT in The currenT markeT environmenT, characterised by low interest rates and continued high stock market valuations and volatility, investors are looking to alternatives to reduce the risks in their portfolios and tap new sources of revenue. \"Both institutional clients and private clients are increasingly using alternative investments, and in particular private equity investments, which significantly improve the risk/return ratio of their portfolio, while at the same time providing diversification,\" says Thomas Piske, CEO at LGT Private Banking.</p><p>However, because of growing demand, more capital will flow into the private equity market, and private equity managers with little experience may proliferate. \"Particularly for private equity investments, longterm experience and managers with a good network are key to success,\" warns Mr Piske. This is the only way they can gain access to attractive transactions, be in a position to identify the best offerings and have the strategic and business know-how to take advantage of the potential of a company and increase its value, he says. Private equity is the asset class with the highest dispersion of returns between good and not so good asset managers, cautions Mr Piske.</p><p>LGT, which is fully owned and controlled by the Princely House of Liechtenstein, has invested in alternatives for more than 20 years, and can rely on a \"global network of high-quality managers\", according to Mr Piske, with whom it has strong relationships.</p><p>For most investors, direct investments in single private equity deals are complicated or impractical, because of very difficult access, high transactional and legal costs, high illiquidity and high minimum sizes of investment, which make portfolio diversification hard to achieve. To manage concentration risk, investors should diversify within the asset class and select different investment styles, such as primary programmes or coinvestments. They should work with different private equity managers, and invest across a number of sectors, regions and duration.</p><p>Investors concerned about the increased risk of market turmoil are attracted to hedge funds as additional sources of diversification. \"Low beta, discretionary strategies and innovative quantitative strategies all have a truly uncorrelated character and are thus well positioned to deliver tangible diversification benefits,\" says Mr Piske.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR DIVERSITY \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR PHILANTHROPY SERVICES \u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF PRIVATE BANKERS WINNER: JPMORGAN PRIVATE BANK wiTh more Than 160 years of eXPerience advising and managing investments for charitable institutions and philanthropists, philanthropy is part of JPMorgan's DNA. A number of trends are shaping the way clients approach their giving, explains Diane Whitty, global head of the Philanthropy Centre at the bank. With the next generation expecting to inherit an estimated $59,000bn over the next 40 years, which represents the greatest wealth transfer in history, philanthropy has become a much larger discipline. Also, donors are choosing to give much earlier, as wealth is being made at a much younger age and on a much larger scale than ever before. Donors are also much more willing to take risks and increasingly drawn to support efforts to address the underlying systems that perpetuate and promote inequality. Accordingly, donors are seeking assistance in their philanthropy and often turn to trusted advisers, according to Ms Whitty.</p><p>\"The sector is often intimidating for donors and their families to navigate. It is our mission to help our clients chart their philanthropic journey from beginning to end and feel confident that they have a trusted partner in the Philanthropy Centre at JPMorgan,\" she says.</p><p>The discussion with the client starts around motivations and values, as it is important for donors and their families to identify why they feel compelled to give and what they want to see as a result of their efforts. \"Subsequently, we promote a robust learning experience for our clients on the issues or geographies they seek to support. We believe that if giving is rooted in learning it is far more likely to be sustainable over time,\" says Ms Whitty.</p><p>The bank partners with clients to help them identify, assess and partner with nonprofit organisations.</p><p>Philanthropy is a bond that can tie a family together. \"Our clients often leverage giving as a way to commune the family, promote ongoing dialogue, and reflect on shared values,\" says Ms Whitty. Although giving is often initiated by elder generations, philanthropy is important to members of the rising generation as well.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR MILLENNIALS WINNER: UOB PRIVATE BANK wiTh The larGesT wealTh Transfer in his-Tory loominG, it is crucial for private banks to engage with younger generations. UOB Private Bank has launched several initiatives aimed at building long-term relationships and providing clients with advice \"to safeguard and grow\" their wealth across generations.</p><p>\"As most of our clients are business owners, we do focus on helping them to prepare their next generation for future responsibilities and leadership roles,\" says Ong Yeng Fang, head of UOB Private Bank. \"This involves regular engagement with the next generation to better understand their ambitions and to equip them with the right skills to succeed when they take over the reins of their family businesses.\"</p><p>The Singapore-based bank developed its Next Generation Programme to enable younger clients to exchange ideas with peers, professionals and entrepreneurs, while also allowing the bank to deepen its relationship with its client's children. As part of the programme, the bank offers local and international internships with selected start-ups, tech companies and venture capital firms, partnering with global tech players such as Google and OurCrowd, a global equity crowdfunding platform.</p><p>\"Through such collaborations, we hope to inspire and to encourage our Next Generation Programme leaders to gain insights on emerging business and technology trends, in order to overcome their family business challenges from a fresh perspective,\" says Ms Fang.</p><p>The programme received \"very positive\" feedback from both participants and parents, which has translated into bigger share of wallet and new clients. Some 40% of parents invested more assets with the bank in the year after their children's participation, while 60% of the Next Generation participants have become UOB clients. Looking forward to 2020, the institution plans to launch its Next Gen 2.0 and Alumni programme alongside more activities. \"We are confident such initiatives will continue to attract more talented individuals to join our programme and to deepen their skill sets,\" says Ms Fang.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR GROWTH STRATEGY WINNER: UNION BANCAIRE PRIV\u00c9E The achievemenTs of union bancaire Priv\u00c9e (ubP), one of Europe's fastest growing private banks, are all the more remarkable when recalling how close the bank appeared to come to a near collapse.</p><p>This was after clients pulled their funds en masse following the twin effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 and exposure to fraudulent products associated with nowjailed fraudster Bernie Madoff.</p><p>xposure nowto ff, lly Managed assets have since surged to SFr134bn ($135bn), overseen by 1700 staff, meaning the 50-year-old bank is now finally starting to nip at the heels of older, established Geneva rivals such as Lombard Odier. Under the stewardship of CEO Guy de Picciotto, UBP has made a series of strategic acquisitions, is in the market for more buyups, and is refocusing its efforts on both traditional portfolio management and private equity investments, rather than the hedge funds of old.</p><p>\"Acquisitions are not something you plan ahead for, but yes, in spite of a slowdown in market consolidation, we remain open to acquisitions in our priority markets,\" says Mr de Picciotto.</p><p>The integration of ACPI in London has given the bank private debt expertise for the critical UK market, while buying Carnegie in Luxembourg has allowed UBP to concentrate on turning the Grand Duchy into its new European hub, offering access to all EU markets, now that Brexit threatens London and negotiations with Switzerland have stalled.</p><p>The bank says acquisitions have not only added critical mass in Europe, but also enabled a fast-growing footprint in Asia, which UBP has identified as a priority market for bulk recruitment of relationship managers. Working with external asset managers is seen as an 'integral part' of the private bank's strategy for business growth. UBP has developed an e-platform designed specifically for external asset managers, as well as dedicated investment products and support teams. Asia is seen as the key hunting ground for further expansion in this sector, where it is considered to be \"a relatively new but already well-structured segment\", according to Mr de Picciotto.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST PERFORMING PRIVATE BANK ANK WINNER: INDUSTRIAL BANK indu Th vate Ban quant k P , sis per ga privat se m g nts relalow tounder income manag indusTrial bank PrivaTe bank emerGed as The winner of the Best Performing Private Bank category, based on our inaugural quantitative analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs), which were gathered from all private banking groups that have entered this year's awards. The Chinese private bank, established in 2011, experienced strong growth rates across several critical KPIs, including assets under management and number of clients per relationship manager, while keeping a low cost-toincome ratio. In 2018, its assets under management grew by more than 30% to Rmb426bn ($60bn), achieving similar growth rates in the private banking client numbers. \"With the rapid growth of the wealth scale of China's high-net-worth people, the private banking business is expected to become the strategic 'blue sea' of retail business,\" says Xuxian Dai, general manager, private banking department, at Industrial Bank. As they become richer, clients bank with a higher number of institutions, and this has offered new business opportunities to private banks, he adds. Also, thanks to regulation, clients prefer banks as their professional wealth <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.managers.Ch\">www.managers.Ch</url> 11, experien veral gement an tionship 2 ement achie ate apid people expec e bu al pri-Ch te bankin stra ts ng depar riche ins oppor prothe In recent years, Industrial Bank has improved its customer service, investing in personnel training, IT systems and digitalisation, while enhancing its product capabilities, leveraging the group's investment and asset management expertise. Products are customised to a client's individual investment objectives, while their complex needs are met through integrated solutions. These include both financial and non-financial solutions, with a focus on health management and children's education. \"High-quality medical, beauty, education and study advice and other resources provide highquality services for clients,\" says Mr Dai. \"This has become an important way to obtain and keep clients.\"</p><p>A 'client-centric' brand, high-quality products, value-added services and a service experience, together with enhanced targeted marketing, have contributed to attract new private banking clients, largely sourced from the upper segment of retail clients.</p><p>But the Chinese private banking industry is still nascent and faces key challenges. The development of qualified personnel needs to be strengthened, says Mr Dai, as most Chinese private banks are still based around their traditional retail wealth management business.</p><p>\u00a6 BEST LEADER IN PRIVATE BANKING PRIVAT CHARRINGTON WINNER: PETER CHARRINGTON, GLOBAL HEAD, CITI PRIVATE BANK GLOB mes firs meetin headqua rgy CE The firsT ThinG ThaT becomes obvious when meeting Peter Charrington in his New York headquarters is the extraordinary energy of the CEO of Citi's global private banking operation.</p><p>n Even early in the morning, he spins effortlessly from reception staff to private bankers to clients, remembering everyone's names and with a friendly and meaningful word to all.</p><p>ents, eve mance Lon-don, Charri repl zo He replicates this performance in London, Hong Kong and other Citi hubs.

These have included significantly improving the bank's investment proposition, developing a high-quality digital offering through key staff appointments and his own personal vision in this area, and putting an end to the productpushing culture that pervaded many US investment banking-led firms.</p><p>But there are two key challenges he still faces, warn consultants. The first, he acknowledges, is the transition between the old guard of 40-year-old and 50-year-old relationship managers who still hold significant sway in terms of client loyalty, to a younger, more innovative and digitally savvy workforce. This includes an overhaul of recruitment and continued improvement of in-house training.</p><p>The second is maintaining and improving profitability in a world where highly skilled investment and digital staff are at a premium, maintenance of physical city centre locations can bite into the balance sheet and outsourcing to eastern European processing centres is no longer as cost efficient as it once was.</p><p>The US bankS do noT have Some of The hang-UpS ThaT The old-School eUropean bankS have.

All forward-looking statements included in this conference call are based on information available at the time of the call and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.</p><p>Thank you. Now Mr. Matson with the quarter's financial review.</p><p>DAVID MATSON, UNIONBANCAL CORPORATION, EVP AND CFO: Thank you Jack and thank you all for joining us this morning. The company earned 89 cents per share in the first quarter, 22 cents higher than the prior year.</p><p>Total revenue increased 6.7 percent and the provision for credit loss declined $25 million or 45 percent. Strengths in our deposit businesses continued to enhance net interest revenue and the deposit fee on a year over year basis. First quarter net interest income was up three percent compared to last year, despite a 27 basis point decrease in net interest margins.</p><p>Average earning assets increased nine percent and non interest bearing deposits grew a strong 24 percent. Non interest bearing core deposits continue to represent an industry leading 45 percent of total deposits. Our DDA strengths is in an important source of profitability. However, there is a net interest margin impact and a falling rate environment. Since this is a part of our funding base and does not reprice as loan yields decline.</p><p>On a linked quarter basis, net interest income declined 3.3 percent or $13.2 million. Two less days in the quarter caused $5 million of the decrease and the remaining $8 million decrease was primarily driven by ac accelerated fee payment partially offset in - by a small amount in average earning assets, and in the fourth quarter a breakage fee on a large fixed rate loan.</p><p>Despite these factors, our net interest margin was still a solid 4.53 percent for the quarter. The remix of our loan portfolio continued. In the first quarter, average loans increased 6.4 percent versus the prior year with residential mortgages growing 1.5 billion or 29 percent. Commercial mortgages increased $522 million partially offsetting a decrease in average commercial loans of $902 million.</p><p>For the quarter, non interest income was up $26 million or 16 percent due largely to an increase in service charges on deposit accounts and insurance commissions and decreases in auto lease residual write downs and private equity portfolio losses. First quarter non interest expense was up 10 percent year over year. Approximately four percentage points of the increase is attributable to acquisitions to Novus and reconfiguration of our Pacific Northwest branch system network.</p><p>On the remaining six percent merit increases and healthcare expenses accounted for four percent. The efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 59.4 percent versus 57.6 percent a year earlier. The efficiency ratio increased primarily due to pressure on net interest incomes stemming from the lower rate environment. The higher efficiency ratio also reflected our recent emphasis on growth in the retail banking and insurance agency businesses.</p><p>I'll now address our expectations for the second quarter and full year of 2003. First, we believe that rates will remain relatively stable until the fourth quarter of 2003. Our guidance assumes steepening yield curve in the fourth quarter of the year.</p><p>Our current expectation for the second quarter earnings is 87 to 92 cents per share. This guidance is based on the following assumptions in comparison to the first quarter.</p><p>First, a modest increase in earning asset with flat loan growth. Second, a five to 10-basis point decline in net interest margin. Third, an approximate five percent increase in non-interest income. Fourth, a one to two percent increase in non-interest expense. Fifth, a provision for credit losses of approximately $30 million. And, finally, an effective tax rate of approximately 34 percent.</p><p>We currently expect full-year 2003 earnings per share to be the same as previously stated, in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. Our full year loan loss provision guidance continues to be approximately $120 to $160 million. This results in expected growth in earnings per share between eight percent and 14 percent versus 2002.</p><p>This completes our financial overview and guidance. Now on to Phil Flynn, Chief Credit Officer - Phil.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN, UNIONBANCAL CORPORATION, EVP AND CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER: Thanks, David.</p><p>Credit results for the first quarter were generally in line with our expectations, with a provision of $30 million and net charge-offs of $53 million. Non-performing assets increased $50 million to $387 million at March 31, driven by the addition of $67 million of aircraft leases to the non-accrual category.</p><p>Our reserve for loan losses now totals $586 million, down $23 million from the previous quarter. Within the reserve, the allocation portion is $421 million, while the unallocated is $165 million. Our allowance for credit losses is now 2.21 percent of total loans, and the coverage of non-accrual loans by the allowance is 152 percent.</p><p>Let's turn to some specific assets of the portfolio, beginning with the non-performing assets. During the quarter we saw in-flows of non-performing assets of $179 million, up substantially from the previous quarter. The previously-mentioned $67 million of aircraft lease exposures, as well as a $30 million exposure to a Korean trading company, dominated new non-accruals.</p><p>We charged off $53 million and were paid down $77 million in the non-performing category. Approximately 75 percent of our non-performers by dollar volume were current at quarter end. As of March 31, we hold $140 million in reserves against the non-performers and have written them down by $165 million from their original balance.</p><p>We sold $64 million of non-performing loan commitments during the first quarter. Overall, during the first quarter, the bank sold approximately $98 million of loan commitments in the secondary market at an average of about 82 cents.</p><p>As usual, I would like to comment on a few industry-specific portions of our portfolio, beginning with aircraft leasing. We believe that we have acted prudently in moving $67 million of leases to non-accrual. These exposures represent our leases with two companies, one a domestic passenger airline and the other a large cargo company. Our leases with both of these companies are current, and neither company has filed for bankruptcy protection. Nonetheless, we deem it likely that some point this year we will need to renegotiate the terms of our leases with these companies, either inside or outside of bankruptcy and that our value in these leases will likely be impaired.</p><p>Thus, we decided to recognize these problems now by moving them to non-accrual and creating large specific reserves against our exposure. Our remaining portfolio of aircraft leases totals less than $50 million and we expect that it will remain relatively healthy in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Our commitments to the tower and utilities industry are similar to year-end, with some movement in the sub segments. Total commitments are approximately 3.2 billion. Investment grade is up about 100 million to 1.9 billion. Project financing is about the same at 800 million and non-investment grade is down 100 million to about 500 million.</p><p>Over the past two quarters, we have become increasingly comfortable with our power portfolio. The most significant refinancing that affect our portfolio are complete and with those refinancing, we've improved our positions as to both collateral and pricing. Bids in the secondary loan market have firmed dramatically allowing us to reduce some of our exposures at little or not cost.</p><p>At this point we have one project financing of less than $20 million on non-accrual, and looking forward, believe that, in the event of further deterioration we may need to move two other loans totaling about 25 million to non-accrual over the next two quarters.</p><p>We expect that losses in this portfolio will be limited to between 10 to 20 million this year, in other words, not a meaningful amount. Given our positive view of this portfolio, we have reduced the attribution in our unallocated allowance by 40 percent to approximately $30 million.</p><p>Our real estate industry's group portfolio continues to perform very well with commitments of about five billion and vary office exposure down slightly to about 425 million.</p><p>Looking forward as David said, we continue to estimate that our loan loss provision for 2003 will be in the range of 120 to 160 million. And we expect the second quarter provision to be approximately 30 million.</p><p>Again, it is likely that for the next several quarters, charge-offs will exceed the provision in particular as we recognize additional losses from our aircraft portfolio. However, other than this particularly difficult industry sector, the rest of the portfolio continues to show improve.</p><p>With that I'd like to turn the call back to Rick Hartnack.</p><p>RICK HARTNACK, UNIONCAL CORPORATION, VICE-CHAIRMAN: Good morning everyone. In my comments this morning I will address some highlights of the first quarter, update you on our acquisition activity, address the marketing and competitive environment, and close with some comments on the California economy.</p><p>Obviously, we're pleased with the 22 percent increase in EPS over the first quarter a year ago. We believe this performance continues to reflect solid execution of our strategic business plan.</p><p>Let me take a couple minutes to recap some highlights from the first quarter performance. We achieved average non-interest bearing deposits equal to 45 percent of total deposits, up from 41.1 percent a year ago. Our all-in cost of funds fell to 67 basis points. Non-interest income continues to be a source of strength, up 16.3 percent from a year ago and up 11 percent on an annualized basis from last quarter.</p><p>Our acquisition efforts continue. First, we completed the integration of Valencia Bank in February and have been doing well. Consumer households and small business clients are all up nicely.</p><p>We also continued to enjoy household and business client growth at our First Western acquisition completed last year. The Monterey Bay Bank acquisition was announced last week. Our Denoble (ph) branch expansion continues on pace. We opened one branch and one business banking center in the first quarter. The net result of all of this is net new accounts pace running comfortably ahead of a year ago at the same time.</p><p>On the insurance front, we completed the acquisition of Tanner Insurance, giving us the foundation agency we needed in northern California. We now have three significant agencies in major California markets, and we are now pursuing integration strategies, while pushing ahead on franchise growth. In our California middle market segment, new business, new commitments and sales pipelines were all strong, but economy-influenced caution on the part of our borrowers has had our corporate clients at some of the lowest utilization levels we've seen in recent history.</p><p>Turning to our capital management strategies, our ability to continue to generate strong earnings has allowed us to both invest for the future and return a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders. We're investing in our core businesses with distribution, technology and marketing expenditures, while undertaking a series of strategic acquisitions. At the same time, we've offered a competitive dividend and maintain a moderate level of share repurchases.</p><p>Our capital levels remain among the strongest in the industry, providing a meaningful cushion against the unexpected, while enabling us to take advantage of opportunities to increase shareholder value when opportunities arise.</p><p>Finally, let me take just a quick look at California. Like the nation, we're seeing very modest growth in our economy. And the bulk of the growth is centered in southern California.</p><p>So far, this has been growth without much good news in the labor market. And what we see right now is the following: continued strength in the housing sector; reluctance by business to make commitments to expansion; some improvements in prices at the pump, returning disposable income to consumers; no significant negative effects from the state budget deficit yet, but these are expected down the road; and continued recovery in the tech sector. While we're not heavily involved in that sector, its recovery is important to our state.</p><p>At this time, we'd be more than happy to take your questions.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and Gentlemen, if you do wish to ask a question, please depress one on your touch-tone phone. You will hear a tone indicating you're then placed in queue, and you may remove yourself from queue at any time by depressing the pound key. If you have pressed one prior to this announcement, we ask that you do so again at this time.</p><p>If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up a handset before pressing a number. Again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, please press one at this time.</p><p>We do have a question from the line of Mark Lynch with Wellington Management. Please go ahead.</p><p>MARK LYNCH, WELLINGTON MANAGEMENT: Good morning. I noticed you've been growing (ph) the loans in the foreign branches fairly rapidly, and I'm wondering what that represents.</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Well, Mark, they're up about $200 million. It's the typical trade-related acceptances and that sort of thing. I don't think there's any particular strategy change or anything like that driving it.</p><p>MARK LYNCH: But I would have thought that - this is mostly in Asia, I assume?</p><p>DAVID MATSON: I would guess. I don't know for sure, but given where most of our activity is, yes.</p><p>MARK LYNCH: I would have thought trade relation would be down, so that would represent - if you're getting that much growth, you must be taking it from somebody else.</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Maybe. I'm sorry. I just don't know. It's not a big number. (inaudible) it's big.</p><p>MARK LYNCH: And the Korean loan, was that a trade finance or a type of loan that you're still making?</p><p>DAVID MATSON: No. That Korean loan - we have, as I think I've mentioned before, the international business is almost entirely a correspondent banking trade related business with the exception of some small corporate lending in Korea and Taiwan to the tune of about $100 million.</p><p>That $30 million problem comes out of that small piece. It also comes from a customer who's been here since 1988. So it's somewhat surprising.</p><p>MARK LYNCH: OK. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We do have a question from the line of Christopher Shenard (ph) with Morgan Stanley. I do apologize for the mispronunciation. Please go ahead.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER SHENARD (ph), MORGAN STANLEY: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Christopher Shenard (ph). I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about interest rate sensitivity and what your position is, you know, as of the end of the quarter? And if you took any actions during the quarter to change your interest rate sensitivity? And then I have a follow up.</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Chris (ph), this is David Matson and we have basically not restructured our balance sheet in any major way. We have ongoing alcove activities, which reflects our philosophy of having stable net interest income in that we continue to reposition our derivatives and other protection that we buy as well as change our securities position, but no material change.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER SHENARD (ph): OK. And to follow up, I was wondering if you could refresh our memory in terms of what your escrow deposits were last quarter and a year ago and what they were this quarter?</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Certain, Chris (ph). At the bank wide level, title escrow of deposits - and by the way, the ones I'm quoting are demand deposits. What we call non-interest bearing deposits and that's where we make the majority of our money.</p><p>And at the end of the first quarter we're at about 2.6 billion. A year ago it was about 1.8 and at last quarter it was 2.9. And it's at the end of the fourth quarter it was about 2.9. And it is a seasonal business comparing it first quarter to fourth quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: Again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question please press one at this time. We do have a question from the line of Robert Lacoursiere with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p><p>ROBERT LACOURSIERE, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Yes. I wonder given the fact that insurance commission line is becoming more important and looks like it will continue to become more important, if you could refresh our memories on the seasonality of it and your expectation of the underlying organic growth rates.</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Yes. Let me make a couple of comments and we may have to provide some additional color for you later. But it's not a terribly seasonal business in terms of the revenue, but it's seasonal in terms of the business activity. </p><p>There are couple of periods in the year where there's more renewal activity going on. Having said that, I think that the organic growth in the near term is going to continue to follow the industry pricing inflation which is diminishing from its high point last year. We were in, you know, kind of strong - I think all of us were seeing strong double digit inflation in insurance premiums. That's certainly going to abate, and, you know, our business model is based on being able to deal with that diminution in growth in the individual premiums over time.</p><p>ROBERT LACOURSIERE: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We do have a question from the line of Campbell Chaney with Sanders Morris Harris. Please go ahead.</p><p>CAMPBELL CHANEY, SANDERS MORRIS HARRIS GROUP: Thanks, and good morning.</p><p>Phil, I got distracted. I think you mentioned in one of the industry segments of the portfolio two loans of $25 million that could go non-performing. What category was that from?</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: No, it was -- I was talking about -- I was trying to size the potential problem in Power and Utilities, and, first of all, the overall point I was making is it's not much of a problem, in our opinion.</p><p>CAMPBELL CHANEY: OK.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: Looking forward, as we sit today -- in fact, going back to the fourth quarter -- we had one project financing of less than 20 million on non-accrual. And our best guess is, given further deterioration, there could be two more projects that total 25 between the two of them that could go to non-accrual.</p><p>CAMPBELL CHANEY: OK. Now, that clarifies it. And then, something else -- I think you mentioned the write-downs -- again, this is for clarification -- you've written down your non-performing loans 165 million. So, of the 386 and a half million, that's net of the 165, I take it?</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: Right. Yeah, you add the 165 back to the 387 we have today; those were the original amounts.</p><p>CAMPBELL CHANEY: OK. Now, that's significant write-downs.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: Yes.</p><p>CAMPBELL CHANEY: That's all I had; those are my only clarifications. Thanks a lot.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: Thank you, Campbell.</p><p>OPERATOR: We do have a question from the line of Gary Townsend with Friedman Billings Ramsey. Please go ahead.</p><p>GARY TOWNSEND, FRIEDMAN BILLINGS RAMSEY &amp; CO.: Good morning.</p><p>David, could you give -- or are you giving any guidance with respect to where you see margin in coming quarters?</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Gary, we provided guidance for the second quarter, and it's been our policy not to provide guidance past that.</p><p>GARY TOWNSEND: I'm sorry, could I ask you to repeat, I guess, what that guidance is for the NIM (ph)?</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Sure. Let me get for you here in a second. We have -- for the second quarter, we're expecting net interest -- excuse me -- margin to drop between five to 10 basis points.</p><p>GARY TOWNSEND: Thank you, again.</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Certainly.</p><p>OPERATOR: We do have a question from the line of Jim Arverell (ph) with Wellington Management. Please go ahead.</p><p>JIM ARVERELL (ph), WELLINGTON MANAGEMENT: Hi. I was wondering if you could flesh out your thinking on the Monterey Bank acquisition.</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Because this transaction is in registration, we are not able to comment about it at this time.</p><p>OPERATOR: Again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, please press one at this time.</p><p>We do have a question from the line of Joe Morford with RBC. Please go ahead.</p><p>JOSEPH MORFORD, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks. Good morning.</p><p>I guess, David, could you comment on your expectations for deposit growth through yearend, and any plans you have to increase the investment portfolio? Thanks.</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Well, we continue -- we expect that -- hold on for one second, Joe.</p><p>JOSEPH MORFORD: Sure.</p><p>DAVID MATSON: I've got a slide here -- well, not a slide, but a -- let me take a quick shot at the deposit growth. Just the underlying piece of deposit is continuing to build the franchise. And between the acquisition plans that we've discussed in the past and that are, that have been announced and our core organic growth in households and business units, we think we set the foundation for solid deposit growth that, you know, as you look forward, I think the blistering pace that we had a year ago is probably not in the cards for this year.</p><p>JOSEPH MORFORD: Right. OK.</p><p>DAVID MATSON: And kind of put a little bit of color on that in terms of high-level numbers. We've not provided guidance on this issue, but we think that that is, that in the wholesale side, it'll be a mixture. We think that business DDA will continue to grow and title escrow will be pretty flat through the year we believe.</p><p>And Rick did the retail side of it. We've not put numbers against it Joe (ph).</p><p>JOSEPH MORFORD: OK. And what about investment portfolios? Should we expect that to grow if loans are, if loan growth is slowing</p><p>DAVID MATSON: That's where we're going to end up putting them. We'd love to get more loans that we like, but on a risk-adjusted basis, we're being cautious right now.</p><p>JOSEPH MORFORD: OK, thanks very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: We do have a question from the line of Roz Looby with First Boston. Please go ahead.</p><p>ROZ LOOBY, FIRST BOSTON: Thanks. Good morning. Phil I have a question for you on the in-flows and the NPAs (ph). I believe you said they were $179 million. You know, of that, you mentioned that 67 raises in the 39 to the Korean Company. That leaves about $80 million, which is more than I think you had in in-flows all last quarter. Can you talk about what that $80 million? Is it more middle market? Is there some geographic characterization you can give to it? And then I have a follow-up question. Thanks.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: Sure. You know, between the leases and the Korean company, that's 100 of it.</p><p>ROZ LOOBY: Yes.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: I forget what we're last quarter. It was pretty close to that. There was nothing real significant. We had one addition new non-accrual of more than 20 million, which was for a timber company. After that it gets pretty small and pretty scattered. So you know, really absent the aircraft leases and this Korean thing, it really was a pretty moderate amount of in-flows I believe.</p><p>ROZ LOOBY: Could they be characterized more as middle market versus large corporate or do you not have a sense?</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: No, I have it here, hang on, let me just eyeball the list. You know, I wouldn't really, there's, just looking at it, there's a few small middle market companies. There's media company for maybe 10 million, cable company for five. It looks like most of it did not come out of the California middle market. It was odds and ends from some of the old specialty groups or national banking.</p><p>ROZ LOOBY: Thanks. I have a similar question, you mentioned you filled, I think it was 65 million our of non-performing during the quarter?</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: Yes.</p><p>ROZ LOOBY: Is that correct? And was that largely power lines, you mentioned that pricing has gone back there.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: Well no, because I didn't have very much in non-performers.</p><p>ROZ LOOBY: Oh, OK.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: As far as, most of that, we sold some telecom exposure about 40 of that was telecom.</p><p>ROZ LOOBY: OK.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: The secondary market has firmed up pretty well and you would notice overall we sold almost $100 million, which is more than we sold I think in any quarter last year. We're continuing that pace right now as well. I just believe that with the market firming, we should take advantage of that to exit some of these segments and names that we don't.</p><p>ROZ LOOBY: Sure. Thanks very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: We do have a question from the line of Brian Harvey with Fox-Pitt Kelton. Please go ahead.</p><p>BRIAN HARVEY, FOX-PITT KELTON, INC.: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First, on the insurance recovery, is that $3.3 million net of expenses? And the second question, just following up on the last one, is, Phil, can you just give a little better characterization of the middle market credit out there, what you're seeing today in California and if there's been any change over the last six months?</p><p>JACK RICE: Why don't I answer that one first. Our middle market portfolio - and I think I've mentioned this before - is very seasoned. It's not a particularly leveraged portfolio. And most of our companies I would characterize as having hunkered down to get through this economic cycle. So I haven't really seen a lot of movement there. Not just the last six months, but even, you know, going back a year or two.</p><p>We just haven't had a lot of problems out of that portfolio. We also haven't had a lot of new borrowing out of the portfolio, which is unfortunate. But from a credit quality point of view, it hasn't been an issue.</p><p>BRIAN HARVEY: Has there been any difference between northern and southern California?</p><p>JACK RICE: You know, maybe anecdotally a little bit. But the fact is that so much more of our portfolio is in southern California it's hard to draw that distinction. And we're not a big tech player, so we really didn't get caught up in that.</p><p>PHILIP FLYNN: Brian, to answer the first question, the insurance was a business interruption and there were no costs against it.</p><p>BRIAN HARVEY: OK. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We do have a question from the line of David Stumpf with A.G. Edwards. Please go ahead.</p><p>DAVID STUMPF, A.G. EDWARDS &amp; SONS: Good morning. Guys, can you all comment at all on the - any potential impact that this Wal-Mart visa litigation might have on your card processing on merchant banking fees? I know it's a big unknown as to what the outcome may be, and I know these are big line items. But could that have any impact on your numbers there?</p><p>DAVID MATSON: I think it would be premature for us to guess. And your characterization of it not being a hugely significant issue at our bank is probably accurate. I think those cases have got a long way to go as they win their way through the court system. But I think anything else would be improper on our part.</p><p>DAVID STUMPF: OK - thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, please press one at this time. We do have a question from the line of Christopher Shenard (ph) with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER SHENARD (ph): Hi, guys. I was just wondering if you could add a little more detail around your comment on commercial loan utilization being near historic lows. You know where is it today, and kind of where has it been historically? And, you now, just how big is the range? And, also, if you could talk about, you know, what you think it would take for utilization to start to rise again?</p><p>JACK RICE: Sure. You know it's hard to give a lot of historical information. It's not something that we've tracked over time.</p><p>But just as an example, today, in the commercial loan book, we have about $10.5 billion of loan outstanding throughout the whole bank. And we have commitments of about just over $20 billion. So utilization is around 50 percent.</p><p>That strikes us, as we think back over the last few years, as fairly low. I'm guessing that utilization might have averaged more like 60 percent or so historically. But you know I don't have exact numbers going back.</p><p>And you know, clearly, in the sweet spot of our commercial lending, which is the middle market and corporate bank here in California, I think companies need to feel more comfortable about their outlook for the economy before they start making investments require them to borrow money.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER SHENARD (ph): Do you also think that, you know, the budget situation has to be resolved before these smaller businesses get more confidence?</p><p>DAVID MATSON: Yes. I think that the budget situation at the state level and indeed all the economic discussion around the circumstances at the national level are just one additional brick in the pack of lack of confidence for the business guy. And it seems like we just move from one story of uncertainty to another and that's a part of it.</p><p>You know, when we did our small business survey earlier in the year, the condition of the state government came up as a major concern. You know, it manifests itself in a lot of different ways for individual businesses but, you know, it's an uncertainty factor. Unfortunately one of many and until confidence builds, it's going to be a hard go for loan demand.</p><p>I think not only here in California, but all across the country. I think you're hearing that from a lot of banks like ours.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER SHENARD (ph): Great. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Gentlemen, there are no further questions. Please continue.</p><p>JACK RICE: Well if there are no further questions, thank you very much for joining us on this call and any follow up can be directed to me in the investor relations department.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 12 p.m. noon today Pacific time through Thursday, April 24 at 12 midnight. You may access the AT&amp;T executive teleconference service at any time by dialing 1-800-475-6701 and entering the access code of 678808.</p><p>International participants may dial 320-365-3844.

My name is Caroline and I will be your operator today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions).</p><p>I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at NYSE Euronext. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>STEPHEN DAVIDSON, VP OF IR, NYSE EURONEXT: Thanks, Caroline. Good morning and welcome to the NYSE Euronextfirst-quarter 2013 earnings conference call.</p><p>Before I introduce today's speakers let me remind you that comments on the call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These statements are based on NYSE Euronextcurrent expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NYSE Euronextactual results to differ materially from those in the statements.

Michael Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer, will then review the financial results for the quarter. We will then open the line for your questions. Also in the room for the Q&amp;A session is a Larry Leibowitz, Chief Operating Officer.</p><p>We are incorporating slides for the call today which are available for viewing on our website and Duncan and Mike will refer to the slides during their remarks.</p><p>With that let me turn the call over to Duncan.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, </nameText></person>CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining today's call. I will begin my prepared remarks on slide four.</p><p>In the first quarter, we benefited from the actions that we have taken over the past several quarters to improve the fundamental earnings power of the Company. We saw improved trading volumes in our European derivatives franchise and launched new products. We are on track to transition our UK clearing to ICE Clear Europe by the end of June and we are focused on realizing the value of our continental derivatives clearing after the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>We are continuing to see strong momentum in our listings business achieving a 75% market share of tech IPOs in the first quarter on the heels of last year's similarly excellent results.</p><p>We are beginning to generate incremental revenue from our new market data agreements. We have continued to reduce our expenses and are on track to exceed our full-year 2013 guidance. And lastly, the reduction in our share count and other capital management actions we have taken are beginning to have a meaningful impact on earnings.</p><p>The macro backdrop as I noted on our last call continues to show encouraging signs for the global economy so I'm optimistic that we are on a slow trend up punctuated by event-driven volatility along the way.</p><p>In the meantime we are continuing to execute against our Project 14 commitments to our shareholders and also preparing for our combination with ICE which I will go into in more detail on later slides.</p><p>The net result of all of this is that we reported $0.57 a share on $600 million in revenue this quarter which represents a 21% increase in earnings year over year and a 33% increase quarter over quarter. So in summary we are pleased with our results and we are looking to build momentum as we move through 2013 and into our proposed combinations with ICE.</p><p>Please turn to slide five. Slide five is familiar to all of you and illustrates the strong progress we have made in executing against our strategy. As you can see from this slide, we are not taking our foot off the gas. I will highlight a couple of initiatives on the growth side first.</p><p>We are launching new derivatives products. In our Liffe Business, we continue to move out on the yield curve. Remember our Liffe business in the UK has historically been almost entirely focused on the short end of the curve so we have continued to expand with the mid curve options that we launched last year and the Swapnote products that we are now offering which move us further out onto the yield curve. Once we are in the ICE clearing house in the second half of this year, expect to see us launch even more new products.</p><p>Next, we continue to be very focused on maintaining the position we enjoy in the capital formation and listings business. We were number one in 2011, we were number one in 2012, and we are off to a terrific start this year. The success we had last year winning 80% of the big tech deals has continued into 2013 and given the pipeline we can see and the deals we know we have already won some of which have not been made public yet, we believe that this will continue.</p><p>Lastly, we are about to see the result of having revamped all of our global market data agreements and launching some new products in that business. All of these growth initiatives are complemented by our accomplishments on the efficiency and capital management fronts which positively impacted our results this quarter.</p><p>Please turn to slide six. Slide six provides an update of our FICC businesses. We saw a nice rebound in NYSELiffe volumes in the first quarter which were up 36% year-over-year with FICC product volume in Europe up 53% when compared with the same period last year.</p><p>In the upper left quadrant, our flagship Euribor futures contracts registered an all-time high in trading volumes and ADV for the first quarter of 2013 was 1.2 million contracts, an 82% increase from the last quarter.</p><p>The surge in volume was driven by a number of key events in the Eurozone including early LTR repayments by banks to the ECB in February, uncertainty surrounding the Italian elections and the Cypress bailout as well as heightened expectations of a potential rate cut.</p><p>Euribor options also showed even stronger growth this quarter driven by the continued success of our innovative mid-curve option products which reached an ADV of 680,000 contracts, a 143% increase from the fourth quarter.</p><p>The aforementioned euro Swapnote product which has been a focus for growth has had a solid start to the year. Year-to-date Swapnote volume has traded $27 billion of notional and by way of reference the CME swap future has traded $19 billion of notional year to date.</p><p>Among other products, Gilts in the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide continue to benefit from quantitative easing by the Bank of England. In the lower left-hand quadrant, you can see that in our LiffeUS business we have seen positive volume growth and open interest trends for the first quarter in the MSCI product suite with ADV up 89% year-over-year and open interest up 119% year-over-year.</p><p>Momentum also continues to build for futures on the DTCC GCF Repo Index as shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the slide. We experienced record volume days in January and average daily volume is up 56% sequentially.</p><p>Before moving away from the FICC business, I wanted to reiterate our stance on clearing for our UK derivatives business. We are on track as discussed previously to transition to ICE Clear Europe at the end of the second quarter. All of our regulatory filings have been submitted. The technology build has been completed and in May we expect to step up our technology integration and member testing.</p><p>Please turn to slide seven. Slide seven provides you with selected updates in our equity derivatives businesses. First on the left hand side of the slide, let's talk about US options. In January 2013, the NYSE AMEX options and NYSE ARCA options complex reached their highest monthly combined equity options market share to date of 29.4%. We were also the first options exchange to receive SEC approval to begin trading many options a product designed for the retail investor which we launched on March 18.</p><p>Product innovation and development continue to be a focus and in the first quarter we were able to secure a semi-exclusive licensing agreement with the Russell Index Group. These products began trading this month.</p><p>On the right-hand side of the slide, we talk about our FTSE equity derivatives franchise. This franchise provided a strong start to the first quarter with volumes up 29% year-over-year. The increase in volumes saw a return to trading in our core FTSE derivatives franchise. The FTSE 100 Index options were up 86% versus the same period last year and the combined open interest for the FTSE franchise stood 13% above 2012 levels.</p><p>Please turn to slide eight. Slide eight provides you with a snapshot of our cash equities business taking a particular look at trading volumes and net trading revenue. Over the past few years our objective in the cash trading businesses has been to focus on profitability and stabilizing market share. In Europe we have maintained our share at around 65% and pricing has been relatively stable.</p><p>In the US, we have opportunistically looked for ways to increase pricing which has helped to soften the impact of declines in trading volumes and the growth in off exchange trading which has impacted our market share.</p><p>Before moving on to the next slide, I want to address two important issues impacting these businesses. The financial transaction tax in Europe and off exchange trading in the US. First, let's talk about the state of play with regard to the FTP.</p><p>As many of you may recall the Commission issued a proposal on February 14 for a broad-based tax on equities, equity like products, derivatives, bonds and others which only applies to those member states but could have extraterritorial impact.</p><p>In terms of the Enhanced Cooperation Group, there is no agreement between the 11 countries as to how the tax will be collected, on what products it should be collected or how the proceeds would be used. In fact several heads of national debt management agencies including France and Italy have publicly warned that the FTT could push up yield spreads and increase borrowing costs. Given all of these, issues, the Commission's implementation date of January 1, 2014 seems optimistic.</p><p>It continues to be our view that this tax as currently outlined would likely destabilize the European financial markets, negatively impact returns and increase fees for average investors and mutual fund owners, exactly the wrong policy at the wrong time.</p><p>Any policy measure that has the direct effect of draining liquidity from the capital markets is a measure that will hurt European entrepreneurs especially the SMEs that so desperately need to access the markets to finance their growth. But given that this dialogue continues, it bears watching.</p><p>Shifting to the US with regard to off exchange trading, off exchange trading reached a record level of 36% in the first quarter of 2013, up from 34% in the fourth quarter. To be clear we think that this is not just about dark pools. Dark pools are only a third of off exchange trading, the other two-thirds is internalization.</p><p>While we think there is a place for alternative execution venues, we worry about the aggregate effect of off exchange activity on market quality and question whether the pendulum has swung too far. As such we plan to continue raising awareness with regard to our market quality concerns and we will also continue our level the playing field advocacy efforts here in the US.</p><p>We are looking forward to working closely with Mary Jo White, the new Chair of the SEC. Mary Jo has a stellar reputation. She understands the issues that we face with the fragmentation of our markets and I am confident that we will be able to work together as an industry with the regulators to improve market quality.</p><p>Please turn to slide nine. On slide nine, we show the continued momentum in our listings franchise. We rank number one in IPOs year to date 2013 and follow on proceeds globally raising $12.1 billion in total global proceeds from 26 IPOs and $48.3 billion in total global proceeds from 140 follow-on offerings in the first quarter of 2013.</p><p>In the US, we led the market with 17 IPOs excluding closed-end funds and continued to capture the majority of technology-based IPOs. We saw larger deal sizes from larger companies coming to the market. Private equity backed companies which made up about 35% of the market year to date, carveouts and yield oriented deals drove the volume in the first quarter. We listed six of the eight private equity backed IPOs in the first quarter which raised a total of $1.8 billion or 68% of all proceeds from private equity backed IPOs.</p><p>In Europe, we welcomed six companies to our markets including Infosys which was the first company to be admitted to trading on our markets in London, Paris and New York.</p><p>Please turn to slide 10. Slide 10 outlines the new strategic paradigm for the technology business that we introduced last quarter. While the market continues to be challenging for technology sales as you saw in our first quarter results, the market demand for disruptive technology is increasing and we have also increased our dialogue with global trading organizations regarding game changing service offerings, the hosting of matching engines, and open connectivity to global markets.</p><p>The trading community is becoming even more focused on cost optimization and is looking to us as a trusted partner to provide innovative ways to improve their trading infrastructure models.</p><p>Regulatory obligations continue to increase resulting in additional assets required to be traded on exchange. NYSE Technologies is working closely with customers to address these needs throughout our product and solutions suite. NYSE Technologies has the datacenter and solution set to be well positioned to take advantage of this industry shift.</p><p>So how was this shift in paradigm translating into results? Our client, the Warsaw Stock Exchange, successfully completed its migration of its cash and derivatives markets to UTP and connected to our safety network which will extend their reach across NYSE Euronextglobal market data and trading infrastructure.</p><p>In terms of our large scale infrastructure hosting capabilities, we are working with several global trading organizations to provide comprehensive trading infrastructure managed services. These are large recurring revenue transactions.</p><p>We launched the best trades and quotes market data product which provides substantial cost savings to retail brokerage firms and wealth management organizations who require access to level one data products. And lastly, we are beginning to generate incremental market data revenue that will build through the second half of 2013 and we have significant plans for our super feed business that will begin to generate additional revenue in the second half as well.</p><p>Before I move onto the next slide, I wanted to address the recent media coverage of our NYXP business. John Robson and the leader of that business has strengthened his leadership team which is focused on executing against the strategic vision I just outlined. At the same time, we are working with ICE to explore how we will leverage this important business capability in the new organization post merger.</p><p>As we look to expand our capabilities for clients we regularly have discussions with potential partners, clients and industry participants to explore new opportunities to deliver best-in-class solutions for our trading community. We have always conducted these partnership discussions and we will continue to have discussions with partners now and in the future, both traditional and nontraditional. We have an exciting business with significant potential that we will continue to drive forward.</p><p>Please turn to slide 11. The next two slides focus on the transaction with ICE. Slide 11 is a quick review of the compelling nature of the combination. When you look at the combined business you see a company with a completely different complexion than the one we have today. The cash trading segment which is arguably the most competitive and commoditized part of our business generated 7% of our revenues in the US and 9% in Europe in 2012. This combined 16% will decline to around 10% of the combined company and even less after the envisioned IPO of Euronext.</p><p>The more lucrative and competitively stronger derivatives business which is 26% of our revenues in 2012 would increase to 44% of the revenue base for the new company. Most importantly, almost 50% of our pro forma net revenue will be generated from our derivatives businesses. This is a critical aspect of the transaction because of the relatively high margin and its impact on our overall valuation.</p><p>We are excited about the potential and remain confident that our companies can unlock significant value and growth, a confidence the market seems to share. We believe the change will be a constant in our industry for some time to come and our combination brings the experience, assets and leadership together that is necessary to drive sustainable growth for our investors and our clients.</p><p>Please turn to slide 12 which will be my last slide before I turn it over to Mike.</p><p>We put this slide in the deck because we have gotten a lot of questions about next steps in the transaction timeline and we thought we would lay it out for everybody on this slide. We are currently working on two parallel tracks, one focused on the competition approval process and the other on general transaction requirements that are needed to close the deal.</p><p>On the competition side, we have completed the US process with the DOJ under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and we are now focusing on the European requirements. Last week we received the official referral of the competition review for the European commission from the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain so we are now working towards the completion of our notification of the Commission known as Form CO which will serve as the basis for the competition review.</p><p>Upon the receipt of our notification, the European Commission will begin Phase 1 which is a 25 business day review process. If an in depth investigation of the transaction is required, so-called Phase 2, that would start a 90-day clock after that.</p><p>As we've learned in the past the timelines for these review processes are not guaranteed and are just guiding principles and are subject to further extensions based on circumstances but we've already made good progress. Our Form S-4 has been filed with the SEC and has been deemed effective by the SEC as of today and on the back of that, both companies, both we and ICE have set the date for the shareholder vote on June 3.</p><p>We still believe that this transaction will be finalized in the second half of this year.</p><p>Our conversations are also ongoing with all stakeholders involved with the IPO of Euronext which we expect will follow soon after the closing of the primary transaction. We will continue to be transparent about the process and keep you updated on key milestones and developments.</p><p>With that, I would now like to pass the call over to Mike for a review of the first quarter's financial results.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER, EVP AND CFO, NYSE EURONEXT: Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 13 provides comparative GAAP results for the first quarter of 2013. Our GAAP EPS was $0.52 per share which compares favorably to the $0.34 per share we reported in Q1 2012. Our non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 per share reflects two primary adjustments this quarter as reconciled in the schedule.</p><p>In the quarter we reported an $8 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs primarily related to the ICE transaction. The other item was a $10 million pretax charge to fair value outstanding restricted stock awards resulting from the increase in our stock price. Following recent shareholder approval of our amended plan, outstanding restricted stock awards will again be fixed in value under equity settled accounting worlds.</p><p>As a result, equity compensation costs in the second quarter of 2013 will decline by $10 million, hence the adjustment. After adjusting for these items, we derived non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 per share.</p><p>My review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses, exit costs, the stock-based compensation charge I discussed and discrete tax items.</p><p>Slide 14 provides our non-GAAP financial results for the quarter. Net revenues of $600 million on a reported basis were in line with the first quarter of 2012 but up 7% versus the fourth quarter. The increase quarter over quarter was driven by higher volumes in our global derivatives businesses.</p><p>Reported costs were lower by $25 million or 6% driving a 12% growth in operating income. Diluted share count declined by 15 million shares year-over-year from our 2012 share repurchase plan which helped drive EPS growth to 21% for the quarter.</p><p>Slides 15 and 16 detail the financial performance for our derivatives segment. Derivatives revenue in the first quarter was $201 million, higher by 14% year-over-year and up 26% sequentially attributable to a strong pickup in trading volume.</p><p>Euribor future volumes in particular increased 82% while both ARCA and MX Options reported growth in both market share and ADD. The revenue growth on flat costs helped boost EBITDA margins to 56%.</p><p>Derivatives accounted for 34% of our consolidated net revenues and 43% of our operating income. Revenue capture for NYSELiffe was lower year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter attributed primarily to clients hitting volume tiers with the increase in volumes. Capture for the US options business was higher year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter driven by positive mix.</p><p>Similarly, slides 17 and 18 show the financial performance for our cash trading and listing segment. Cash trading and listings accounted for 48% of our consolidated net revenues and 47% of our operating income in the first quarter. Cash trading and listings net revenue was $287 million in the first quarter of 2013, down 6% versus the prior year period but up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.</p><p>European cash market share across our four primary markets which excludes off exchange trading volume was 65% in the first quarter up from 64% in the prior year.</p><p>In US cash equities, our market share across all tapes declined 120 basis points both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Off exchange traded share increased to 36% of the US equities markets, up from 34% in the prior year.</p><p>[Global] listings revenues including governance services which we report in other revenues is up 9% in the first quarter. Revenue capture for US cash increased to $0.043 per 100 shares handled for Q1 above the $0.042 recorded in the first quarter of 2012 and the $0.040 in Q4. The incremental increase in capture is due to volume mix and minor pricing adjustments on NYSE ARCO.</p><p>Revenue capture for European cash on a per transaction basis increased to $0.62 in Q1 2013 from $0.57 in Q1 2012 and $0.58 in Q4 2012. The increase year-over-year was driven by an increase in trade size and a decision to reduce listing fees for European warrants and increase trading fees.</p><p>Slide 19 details the financial performance for our information services and technology solutions segment. Information services and technology solutions accounted for 19% of our net revenue and 10% of our operating income in the first quarter of 2013. Segment revenue was $112 million, a decrease of $9 million from Q1 prior year and a decrease of $8 million sequentially.</p><p>As Duncan mentioned earlier, the sales shortfalls were attributed to the absence of any significant new managed services sales whereas the prior quarter had large sales with Russell and ATG in Q4 and Warsaw in Q1 prior year.</p><p>The environment continues to be challenging so we believe this business is well positioned to leverage the industry's focus on cost optimization and changing infrastructure models.</p><p>With the new global market data agreements in place, we expect to see technology services revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of 2013. These incremental revenues will begin in Q2 and are expected to grow as the year progresses.</p><p>Slide 20 provides you with the progress we have made with our Project 14 cost efficiency program. Over the past 12 months, we have reported total operating expenses of [$1,553 million which is $113 million] (corrected by company after the call) below the 2011 base level of $1,666 million. Adjusting for currency rates and portfolio changes and discreet investments of $49 million, we arrive at an annualized expense base of [$1,519 million] (corrected by company after the call) through the first quarter of 2013 which is [$147 million] (corrected by company after the call) below our 2011 starting point or [59% of the total $250 million] (corrected by company after the call) to be saved by the end of 2014.</p><p>You'll recall that our commitment for P14 savings was originally 65% of the $250 million by the end 2013 so we are well on our way to exceed this target.</p><p>Based on the positive development of expenses in the first quarter and a series of savings initiatives planned for this year including the $15 million we expect to save in the second half of 2013 with our move to ICE Clear Europe, we now expect our full-year 2013 reported expenses to be less than $1,525 million.</p><p>Slide 21 details our cash and debt position as of the end of March. Gross debt at March 29 was $2.5 billion. This is basically the same level of debt we had at year end as we did not have any variable debt that we could pay down with our excess cash from the quarter. Our cash balances grew by $147 million in the quarter. In June we plan to retire the remaining $414 million of 4.8% US notes.</p><p>Our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio decreased to 2.3 times on stronger EBITDA generation. Had we been able to use our excess cash to retire debt, leverage would have been reduced to 2.2 times for the quarter.</p><p>Capital expenditures were $27 million in the quarter, well within our guidance of less than $150 million for the full year and last week the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2013 which is payable on June 28.</p><p>Now I would like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Thanks, Mike. So in closing, the first quarter was a very strong start for us in 2013. We saw a rebound in trading volumes in our European derivatives franchise and we launched some new products. We are on track to transition our UK derivatives business clearing to ICE Clear in Europe by the end of Q2. Our listings franchise continued to build momentum by maintaining a number one global leadership position and achieving a dominant market share of technology IPOs.</p><p>We expect to begin seeing the positive revenue impact of our new market data agreements in the current quarter. And lastly, our costs are on track to exceed our full-year 2013 cost guidance.</p><p>While we are executing against our Project 14 commitments, we are also well into the integration planning and regulatory approval processes of our combination with ICE and the next milestone for that combination will be the shareholder meetings on June 3.</p><p>With that we will take a few questions from all of you. Thanks for listening.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Richard Repetto, Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>RICHARD REPETTO, ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL &amp; PARTNERS: Good morning, guys. I guess the first question, Duncan, comes from your remarks on market quality. We know or at least it was reported in the media you have met with the SEC with some of the other exchange heads. I think I am aware of you meeting with even some companies as well. But when you talked about what are the remedies if one-third of the TRF volume is -- it looks like you are pointing towards the wholesalers, the other two thirds. What are the remedies besides a trade out rule that you see could bring back the market quality you're talking about?</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: I will start, Rich, and then I will let Leibo add to it as well. So we realize it is a complicated question. This didn't happen overnight. Our point that we keep trying to focus on is that it isn't just about dark pools. If we are talking about dark pools and those are block crossing networks that provide us significantly better customer experience that the public market may not be able to provide, I think there has to be a place for those in market structure in the US.</p><p>I think our bigger concern and to be clear we think it is going to have to be a combination of things that would get done. I don't think there is one single thing that would necessarily enhance the market quality but we feel like there is a degradation in market quality, the darker individual stocks seem to get the wider the spread seems to get. We don't think that is a -- we don't think that is a healthy trend and whether it is talking about some kind of a trade out rule that simply requires an internalizer to improve the customer experience in either size or price, the way they have done in Canada and are talking about doing it in Australia or thinking about a rethink of the access fees, there is a whole host of things that could be done.</p><p>We realize it took us a long time to get here, it is going to take us a while to kind of reverse the trend if it is even possible but I am encouraged by the fact that a lot of people are at least willing to come to the table to talk about it.</p><p>We are meeting with investors, we are meeting with a number of sell-side firms. We are all meeting together and having roundtables to talk about is there a better solution that would be better for the end clients and I am cautiously optimistic. Leibo, what would you add to that?</p><p>LARRY LEIBOWITZ, COO, NYSE EURONEXT: I think it is a pretty good summary. I just think that if you add up all the regulatory changes made over the last 10 years they have sort of caused just a natural competitive force that will drive more and more volume off exchange as other parties get more and more sophisticated about segmenting customer flow or recirculating flow before it gets to an exchange so that what gets to the exchange is lower and lower quality. And I think what we are really concerned about is it is not our market share. It is about what is the quality of the flow that comes to the exchange, how wide do the spreads get? Those sorts of things.</p><p>That is our main concern and we understand that this is going to be a balancing act where exchanges are going to have to give something and we are going to have to put this together in a piece that it makes natural sense for competition to find the right level.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Right, and look, we expect everyone to defend their business model and people should expect us to defend the same (inaudible). Right? Everyone is doing what they should do. So I think we are going to remaining engaged in this dialogue and we are happy to sit down with everybody and put other things on the table too if that is what it takes to strike the right compromise. Okay. Thanks.</p><p>RICHARD REPETTO: Got it. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Howard Chen, Credit Suisse.</p><p>HOWARD CHEN, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Good morning, everyone. Just with respect to the new global market data agreements coming into place, is your expectation still that the incremental revenue opportunity is about 10% additive on a full run rate? And if use and terminal count continue to trend a bit lower, how much does that eat into the potential upside?</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: I will take the first part of that. In terms of the run rate, we have previously said that we expect the series of changes, the new products that we are launching, the price increases and the restructuring of the global data agreements including addressing the non-display access to generate a double-digit growth. Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: I think it is hard to predict where that trend is going to go. Remember that that is an overall industry issue. It impacts the size of the entire CPA pie not just specifically us but we are sort of dealing with that by being more aggressive, or balanced I would say in how we charge for non-display and the proprietary products we sell ourselves because we are developing a lot more of these proprietary products. So we expect that that would offset those things.</p><p>HOWARD CHEN: Understood. Thanks, Larry. Thanks, Mike.</p><p>OPERATOR: Chris Allen, Evercore.</p><p>CHRIS ALLEN, ANALYST, EVERCORE: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask on the information technology segment, just given the upcoming deal with ICE and some of the recent articles in the press about the potential looking at other partners which you guys acknowledge maybe some discussions there. Is it realistic to expect any large signing of agreements in that business until kind of the dust settles on that front, people can figure out who they are going to be dealing with longer-term?</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Sure. I think it is a really good question, Chris. I think what you are seeing here is an industry that is in transition. Our clients are going from buying products to trying to figure out how to rationalize large chunks of infrastructure. And the technology itself is in transition with more and more emphasis on cloud and virtualized computing and managed services, software as a service, things like that.</p><p>So to some extent, some of the hesitation you are seeing is that the things they are demanding are changing and the organizations themselves are trying to figure out the new solution. At the same time, our portfolio of solutions is changing to match that. Transitioning from the more traditional product-based to more of a solutions-based thing.</p><p>The backdrop of that, of course, is this ICE deal. So yes, I think that we are certainly going to get those questions and we would expect to get those questions. On the other hand, we are always looking to figure out what is the best combination of our portfolio with partners. That has been our way of doing things anyway, and you have a new management team in there led by Jon Robson that is really thinking about how do they provide the best solution set.</p><p>So I would expect that the industry is in transition but that we will start to see, and we are actually seeing, contracts signed. The results kind of hide some of the more traditional products are decreasing, while some of the new products are actually increasing. And we probably have to do a better job with you guys at showing the pipeline and showing that transition so you see how that transition is going, but we are signing new deals. It hasn't ground to a halt. And some of the new deals are actually larger deals and longer deals, and I would expect that that will continue.</p><p>CHRIS ALLEN: Thanks, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: Alex Kramm.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM, ANALYST, UBS: Good morning. Maybe just to stay on the topic of what Chris just talked about on the technology business, can you maybe try to give a little bit more color on how you would break this business down or how this business breaks down in terms of what are the pieces that are actually really essential to an exchange like market data, how much do they account for?</p><p>And then on the other side when you talk to some of your customers, it seems like a lot of the pieces are not very well integrated and they don't really talk to each other as much. So do you actually think that there are some smaller components that are very easy to, I don't know, maybe throw into an auction and see some private equity holders would like to buy more? Do you think this business is actually more of a -- this has to go as a whole or stay together as a whole? Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: I can help you a little bit. As Larry mentioned, where we have discussed in the past, we restructured this business into three primary -- as the chart shows you -- three primary revenue segments, content, infrastructure, and liquidity and the two largest being content and infrastructure.</p><p>So in the content area is the proprietary market data, the data fee handlers, some of the software sales. In the infrastructure we have the connectivity, the safety services and the hosting and the [NYSX] business. In the liquidity we have the co-location services some of the market solutions we are doing for other exchanges and businesses like our (inaudible) operation in Japan.</p><p>So it is a pretty diverse segment. Clearly the larger area of growth for this year we are looking at is in content because that is where the market data initiatives are coming in but we have initiatives across hosting is where a lot of these managed services deals come in.</p><p>I think Larry was talking a little bit about the co-location and the connectivity that have both news sales and also some lower renewals at times but that is really how we break the business down into those three businesses.</p><p>LARRY LEIBOWITZ: Right. I think your observation that says that we haven't integrated some of these offerings is dead on and it is actually consistent with what I was saying about moving from a product based sale to an integrated solutions based sale. Some of that reflects the industry's attitude changing and some of it reflects that we need to do a better job of that and that is exactly what John and his team are working on.</p><p>I think speculatively we are going to sell various pieces off to private equity. The honest truth is it is in our competitors' interest to sort of fan those flames so that everybody thinks that these are weak assets. The truth is that most of our competitors are in a reasonable amount of transition themselves in this arena and I think that actually creates a lot of opportunity for natural providers of these solutions like we are because we have the market, we have the connectivity, we have the market data, we have a lot of the pieces that actually naturally sort of go into that and people would like to portray this as a weak position whereas I actually view it as a strong hand.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: I am going to add one more thing to that not to belabor the point. We think we have a pretty good idea of the origin of the leak last week. We actually think it was one of our competitors doing exactly what Larry just said like fanning the flame of uncertainty given the deal that is out there and then coming in behind and saying it is really hard to do something with those guys. I mean they are in a state of flux over there. It is like -- we are not in a state of flux just because a competitor says we are in a state of flux because it suits their marketing pitch.</p><p>So I am at a lot of these meetings, Larry is at a lot of these meetings. These are much more complicated discussions than a product sale. A product sale you show someone an a la carte menu they want one item or two. This is a much more comprehensive discussion about sharing infrastructure and things like that. So we are going to remain optimistic and we will remain focused and as we get closer to combining with ICE, we will be able to get the benefit of their input as well.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: That is very helpful. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Niamh Alexander, KBW.</p><p>NIAMH ALEXANDER, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: Thanks for taking my questions. If I could switch over to the clearing, so you are ahead of the deal -- even you are moving at the end of May as you previously guided. But can you walk me through how to think about the risk of clients, how easy can it be -- should it be for clients? There already is some technology overlap.</p><p>And then from the modeling perspective financially, doesn't this accelerate some of the cost savings? Does it accelerate maybe some impairments and some write-downs on some of the investment so far as well?</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: I will try to give you -- it is Duncan -- I will try to give you the outline on sort of what we are doing on the timeline and then Mike can talk a little bit about how that will translate to the results beginning in Q2 and what that means for what we have already spent on what we used to call Project Gemini, etc.</p><p>So as I said in my remarks, the project to move the UK derivatives piece from Liffe Clear to ICE Clear is on track to happen at the end of Q2 so it will be the end of June, not the end of May. We will be using May to sort of do member testing. We are collecting all of the Novation certificates now; that is all going very smoothly.</p><p>The nice thing about this transition is given that more than 90% of the clients who were connected to Liffe Clear were also connected to ICE Clear, there was very little migration risk. There were only a handful of clients that actually had to do a meaningful technology lift to get this done. The majority of clients were already connected and we are actually relieved that there was less work to do for them than there would have been had we proceeded down the Project Gemini route.</p><p>So we are highly confident that will happen by the end of June so we will be clearing at ICE Clear in the second half of the year and then Mike can talk to you about what that means for the kind of results going forward and what we are doing with the expenses that we had already put to work on Gemini last year and before.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: So the financial benefit of this transaction really twofold. Firstly, when we go live in the beginning of the second half, we will no longer be outsourcing the treasury and risk management with LCH and in turn we will be using ICE Clear and as we have indicated on the call, we will save annualized $30 million from that, $15 million in the second half.</p><p>The investment that we made in Gemini in our internal build last year prior to signing the ICE Clear agreement was all written off in the fourth quarter last year so there is nothing else on the balance sheet right now as it relates to that.</p><p>Secondarily we have the continental derivatives which we've talked about in the past that we today don't get any revenues or costs and we expect in the first quarter -- end of the first quarter 2014 to realize the revenues on that business and a healthy margin as we also bring that business -- execute that plan.</p><p>So two strong financial benefits second half of this year in 2014 coming from clearing.</p><p>NIAMH ALEXANDER: Okay, thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: We are going to wrap it there so Stephen, any -- we are going to give you the last word -- anything you want to do to wrap it up?</p><p>STEPHEN DAVIDSON: Thanks everyone for joining us and see you later.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: As always, the bit team will be available for any one on ones that people need throughout the day. Thanks a lot, everybody. Have a good day.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Thanks, Julie. Joining me today is Charles Horn, our always exuberant CFO, and Bryan Pearson visiting us from Canada, and leader of LoyaltyOne. Charles will discuss the operating results for the first quarter, and then Bryan will walk you through LoyaltyOne, and in particular its new business BrandLoyalty. I'll wrap it up with a discussion about our guidance, and I'll look for 2014.</p><p>Charles?</p><p>CHARLES HORN, CFO, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORP: Thanks, Ed.</p><p>The year started off pretty much as we expected, with strong revenue growth up 17% from last year, and dampened core EPS growth of 9% from last year due to incremental personnel costs needed to support growth expected in the back half of 2014. Even so, we dropped through some additional earnings to beating core EPS guidance of $2.70 for the quarter. Organic revenue growth was strong at 8%, driven by high single-digit organic growth at Epsilon, and low double-digit growth at Private Label.</p><p>For LoyaltyOne, organic revenue growth was essentially flat on a constant currency basis, as their amounts redeemed dropped 4% compared to the first quarter of 2013. BrandLoyalty, which closed on January 2, 2014, added approximately $112 million in revenue to the first quarter.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA net, meaning reduced for funding costs and the portion attributable to the minority shareholders of BrandLoyalty, increased 3% compared to the first quarter of 2013, burdened by higher payroll expense. We estimate that approximately $20 million was development to payroll, signifying it did not drive current period revenue but is needed to support future revenue. BrandLoyalty added about $14 million of EBITDA, $9 million net of non-controlling interest to the first quarter, which we believe will be the seasonally lowest quarter.</p><p>Diluted share count was 66.1 million, consistent with our guidance. With the maturity of the next and final tranche of convertible debt in May, we expect our diluted share count to drop to approximately 63.1 million for the second quarter of 2014.</p><p>Let's turn to the next slide, and Bryan Pearson will talk about LoyaltyOne.</p><p>BRYAN PEARSON, EVP &amp; PRESIDENT - LOYALTYONE, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORP: Thanks, Charles.</p><p>LoyaltyOne's revenue increased 37% to $329 million, due to the acquisition of BrandLoyalty, which, as Charles said, added $112 million. During the first quarter, we fought through a couple of headwinds in our core AIR MILES business, as revenue declined 10% from the first quarter of 2013.</p><p>The first and primary driver was the Canadian dollar being down by about 8% from a year ago. This lower translation rate dropped AIR MILES revenue by about $19 million. And then the second factor was that AIR MILES redeemed declined 4% from a year ago, creating a revenue drag of about $6 million. We'll likely face these kinds of headwinds throughout 2014.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $65 million for the first quarter, again, due to BrandLoyalty, which added $14 million gross or $9 million net to LoyaltyOne. Adjusted EBITDA for the AIR MILES business was down 10% from the first quarter, but was essentially flat on a constant currency basis.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA margin for AIR MILES remained consistent between quarters at 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin for BrandLoyalty was 13%, but we believe that it will definitely expand as the year progresses.</p><p>AIR MILES reward miles issued actually decreased 4% compared to the first quarter of 2013, due to weakness in consumer spending. Some of which relates to the timing of the Easter holiday, which landed in Q1 in 2013, and doesn't actually land until Q2 in 2014. And some of this relates also to regulatory changes, which are eliminating reward mile issuance from prescription purchases in some regions. We still expect full-year issuance growth to be in the low single-digit rate for 2014, mostly due to increased promotional spend and the addition of new sponsors in the back half of the year.</p><p>For the first quarter, AIR MILES redeemed decreased 4%, due to reduced demand, primarily for our travel related rewards. AIR MILES Cash, on the other hand, our instant reward program, continues to gain momentum with the rollout of 300 plus IGA stores in Quebec during the quarter. And we expect the expansion of the AIR MILES Cash offering to increase overall miles redeemed by approximately 3% compared to 2013.</p><p>Now before turning to a discussion on BrandLoyalty, let me just give you a brief update on dotz. Our priority for dotz in 2014 is really pretty simple. It is all about growth.</p><p>We had an excellent start to the year, as dotz added 1.2 million collectors during the first quarter, bringing its total collector count to 12 million. In addition, we plan to continue our market expansion strategy in 2014, with a target of four new markets by the end of the year, which would bring the total market count to 13.</p><p>Why don't we turn to the next slide now. During the quarter, LoyaltyOne acquired a 60% stake in BrandLoyalty, which is a leader in transactional and emotional loyalty programs. BrandLoyalty is based in the Netherlands, and employs over 400 associates in 14 offices around the globe.</p><p>The primary product offering they have are short-term loyalty campaigns that are run for grocery retailers in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the programs, shoppers earn points using either digital or paper stamps for achieving spend thresholds during each shopping trip. The points are then redeemed in-store for high-quality merchandise that BrandLoyalty sources and distributes to the retailer.</p><p>Through its subsidiary, IceMobile, shoppers can also download custom mobile apps that add the digital capability for earning and redeeming points, as well as increasing customer engagement by a targeted mobile messaging. BrandLoyalty's programs are short-term in nature, but they offer a full-service no risk approach for the retailer to grow their sales.</p><p>Starting with the program design and the actual selection of the products, they use their unique data and analytical approach to support the procurement, distribution, and in-store merchandising of products that create the kind of aspirational short-term program that changes consumer behavior. These turnkey programs are proven to drive increased visits to the store, and to increase basket size, which results in measurable sales results and a positive return on investment for their clients.</p><p>LoyaltyOne is excited about this acquisition, as it offers the following strategic benefits: first, BrandLoyalty is really one of two leading players in the these type of short-term grocery promotions, and they have an excellent track record of double-digit organic growth, which clearly is an excellent fit with Alliance Data's growth model; second, grocery retail is a [cre] vertical for both LoyaltyOne and BrandLoyalty, and we believe that we can leverage existing relationships to grow the BrandLoyalty platform in North America; and third, LoyaltyOne's advanced analytics capability and advisory services presents a new product offering for BrandLoyalty customers, which will lead to future revenue synergies between our organizations.</p><p>We are pleased with the results that we've had to date, and we're working diligently as a team towards new opportunities. Now let me turn it back to Charles to discuss Epsilon.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: Thanks, Bryan.</p><p>If we turn to the next page, Epsilion's revenue increased a healthy 9%, all organic, to $348 million for the first quarter of 2014. Technology led the way, with 11% growth, supported by a 15% increase in database revenues, fueled by expansion both in new and existing client base.</p><p>Email, which is part of technology, continues to be soft, but we believe the next release of Harmony scheduled for the second quarter of 2014 will remedy that. Harmony, which is our new digital messaging platform, was recently ranked number one by Red Pill Email for its features and functions, and received a perfect score of five in the categories of vendor security, queries and segmentation ease-of-use. The preview of this next release, which adds segmenting and multi-channel capabilities, has resulted in several new customer wins.</p><p>Moving on, Agency also delivered a solid performance, increasing 9% compared to the first quarter of 2013, driven by continued strength in the auto vertical. We are currently in the process of onboarding two new Agency clients, which should contribute revenue as 2014 progresses. Our outlook for 2014 remains high single digit organic revenue growth, supported by a backlog, which is up double digits compared to the same time last year.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA net increased 1% to $55 million compared to the first quarter of 2013, as higher healthcare costs attributable to a higher associate participation rate, severance expense associated with the integration of HMI, and upfront expenses incurred to ramp-up two potentially large new clients dampened the revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>In summary, it was a good start to the year for Epsilon. We remain positive about the product cross-selling opportunities generated from Agency, as well as the continued rollout of the Harmony platform. We could have done a little bit better with expense control in the first quarter, more labor inefficiencies than we would like to have seen, but some of the expense cannot be avoided given our strong backlog and the need to staff in advance. Overall, a strong start to the year with expected continued momentum.</p><p>Let's turn to the next slide and talk about Private Label. This quarter represents the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for Private Label, as revenue increased 13% to $562 million, driven by a 15% increase in the average card receivables.</p><p>Organic revenue growth was a robust 12%. Adjusted EBITDA net increased 7% to $244 million, as the revenue flow through was dampened by a 26% increase in operating expenses compared to the first quarter of 2013. As we talked about on the last earnings call, this increase was expected, as we added about 1,000 new associates, mainly in our call centers, in order to increase support capacity and prepare for future growth. We expect the leveraging of operating expenses as the year progresses and we ramp up new clients.</p><p>Moving on to the P&amp;L. The provision for loan losses increased 6% from the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in credit card receivables, while funding costs remained stable between years, despite the growth in receivables as we continued to replace maturing debt with cheaper new debt.</p><p>Now let's turn to the next page and talk about some of the key metrics for Private Label. The total gross yields decreased 60 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2013, due to the impact of new programs. Moving into the second quarter, we expect to see a slight uptick in gross yields as this influence moderates. Importantly, we continued to pick up tender share during the quarter, as our credit sales at core plan, meaning pre 2012 [integers] increased 7%, while overall client sales were about flat compared to the first quarter of 2013.</p><p>Normalized principal loss rates increased 20 basis points to 4.9%, while delinquency rates increased 10 basis points, both compared to the first quarter of 2013. Based upon the trends we are seeing, we expect stable to slightly improving principal loss rates for the remainder of 2014. From a loan loss reserve standpoint, we ended the first quarter with a 6% reserve rate, which represents approximately 16 months of forward coverage.</p><p>The last thing I will discuss is the new metric added this quarter, return on average assets. As you can see from the chart, we generated a very strong return, 6.4% this quarter compared to 6.5% last year. It is just another metric that reflects the difference in Private Label's business model compared to just a card issuer.</p><p>Let's move on and talk about liquidity. Liquidity at the corporate level remained strong at $1.1 billion at March 31, 2014, after deploying over $300 million on their BrandLoyalty acquisition and the share buyback program in the first quarter. Debt levels remained modest with excellent debt service coverage ratios.</p><p>As noted on the slide, we have $345 million of convertible notes coming due in the second quarter, which we plan to cash settle. This has created a little confusion in the markets, given that the current settlement value of the convertible notes would be about $1.9 billion. The way it works is we pay $345 million, the face value of the convertible notes, our hedge counterparties pay $1.55 billion, and the note holders receive a total of $1.9 billion in cash.</p><p>Several months after the debt maturity, we have to settle the other side of the hedge arrangement with our counterparties, meaning the warrants. At ADS's current price, we would issue approximately 5.1 million shares to settle our obligation under the warrants. Importantly, these shares are already included in our diluted share count, and are separate and apart from the phantom shares you have heard us talk about so much in the past.</p><p>In a nutshell, we paid $345 million in cash, and issued 5.1 million shares to settle the convertible notes. Our guidance reflects all of this.</p><p>Lastly, Ed and I have always talked about our capital allocation priorities for 2014. And as we've indicated in the past, they will flip around based upon which gives us the best accretion. M&amp;A will continue to be our first priority, but as you can see, the buyback program is still important to us. Year-to-date, we have spent $115 million of our $400 million Board-authorized program.</p><p>With that, I will turn it over to Ed.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Thanks, guys. Now, we're going to step back a little bit and look at the bigger picture and the overall view of how the year is trending and other things that we're seeing out there and how they might impact the Company.</p><p>I would say overall, obviously Q1's got a lot of puts and takes, and a lot of moving pieces. But in general, I think we could probably sum it up by saying that we were very, very pleased with the organic growth rate of our top line. I know that's a big item out there in the marketplace these days. And what we're finding is that once again we're feeling very comfortable that this year we're going to run organically at 9%, maybe 10%, and that will be at least 3X GDP, which is our goal.</p><p>So I think from a revenue perspective, you're talking 9%, 10% organic, you're talking 20% plus when you layer in BrandLoyalty. The top line looks very strong this year, and we're bumping up guidance accordingly on our top line.</p><p>And from an expense perspective, obviously getting dinged with the Canadian dollar is going to cost us $50 million or $60 million on top, and probably about $0.15 to $0.17 on EPS. But again, I think we can play through that without a problem. So it very strong organic top, overall top at 20% plus.</p><p>And what we're looking at is, we're seeing stronger revenue growth coming out of BrandLoyalty. We initially were looking at about $0.5 billion of top line, it looks like it will already be more like $550 million. Epsilon is running a little bit stronger than we had thought, as is Private Label. You take those three, offset a little bit of it with the Canadian dollar, and that's where we get an upward bias in our guidance for top line. So very pleased there.</p><p>On the balancing act that we're trying to accomplish this year, which is bringing on a huge book of new business at both Epsilon and at Private Label. We had alluded to, last quarter, the fact that we're going to have to ramp-up a significant amount of folks, and Charles mentioned, we added another 1,000 people just in the Private Label group to handle the book of business that we signed last year and we're signing now.</p><p>That will, obviously, it bodes extremely well for the back half of this year and going into 2015 as well. Unfortunately, we need to absorb it now without the top line against it. So, that's a little bit of the drag that you're seeing in the first part of the year. We do feel very comfortable, however, that it's the right bet to make, and that the back half and in 2015 we're going to be glad we did so.</p><p>Based on where the revenue is going, we think that we're right on track with where we want to be, actually I think we're actually trending a little bit better as we said on top line. And as a result, we're going to go ahead and bump up guidance from $12.20 to $12.25, which would give us earnings growth of 22% for this year. I do think that's probably a conservative raise at this point. And as the year plays out, I certainly would hope that we can continue to drift that number upwards as the year progresses.</p><p>Turning to the page on the specific businesses, 2014 outlook. Bryan walked through what's going on in his businesses. I just wanted to hit the high points again.</p><p>With the AIR MILES program, we expect, on a constant currency basis, revenue to be up in the low single digits, and adjusted EBITDA to be up somewhere in the mid-single digits. I think, overall, those are good numbers for the year.</p><p>I will call your attention to, as we've seen over the past 18 years, the key metric there AIR MILES issued, we've cautioned people from trying to look at it on a quarterly basis. If you looked at it last year, our issuance by quarter was minus 3%, minus 5%, then plus 11%, plus 12%, and we ended the year at plus 4%.</p><p>That's pretty much what you're going to be seeing this year. You're going to see this thing jump all over the place, because a lot of it is driven by promotional spend.</p><p>We don't have visibility on a quarterly basis, as much as we do on an annual basis. So whether it's growing double digits or down single digits, I would caution anyone into reading too much into either movement, and focus more on the full-year basis.</p><p>Bryan also alluded to the fact that while we have our full-year goal of around plus 4%, plus 5% as we usually do, there is probably a point or so of risk due to some legislation up in a couple of the provinces regarding our ability to issue for -- when someone buys prescription drugs. So that could dampen growth in that metric a little bit. So more to come on that. But overall, LoyaltyOne should have a solid year once again.</p><p>BrandLoyalty, right out of the gate they are trending quite a bit stronger than we had anticipated, which is always a great thing to see as the first quarter out of a new business. And their revenues are running stronger, and we're bumping them up 10%. We would expect their organic revenue growth to grow over 20% this year.</p><p>And when we're talking about our 9% to 10% organic growth, that excludes the organic growth at BrandLoyalty, because it was an acquisition. So overall, organic growth for the Company would be even higher than that.</p><p>Brazil, as Bryan mentioned also, it's all about scale. And if you look back at 2011, we were under 2 million collectors, 2012, 6 million. Last year, we ended just under 11 million, and already we're up to 12 million this year, and so I expect to have a very, very strong year this year in Brazil. We are looking to expand into four new regions as well, and we'll keep you posted on that.</p><p>I always get the question of how do I -- how can I value the Brazilian piece of the business. And a good rule of thumb is that we would need about 2.5 dotz collectors to be equivalent to about 1 AIR MILES collector. So essentially in Canada, we've got about 10 million folks, and that generates the $0.25 billion or so of EBITDA. So, someone can do the math and come up to about 25 million is what we'll need down in Brazil. Hopefully, we're about halfway there at this point, and it's cooking right along.</p><p>At Epsilon, again, very strong story from an organic growth perspective, and it was nicely balanced too, which is what we like. The database part or the technology part was quite strong, up double digit during the quarter, and should continue that. That's based on the large number of builds that are going on now.</p><p>We brought on a lot of folks for the record number of databases that were signed last year. A lot of this is, again, a continuing trend with folks wanting their own loyalty program, their own loyalty platform, their ability to collect that data on the consumer that can then be used for data-driven marketing. So we're seeing very strong demand for that.</p><p>It looks like if we typically sign about 15 of these type platform builds a year, last year we did 23 plus, this year we're currently running at that rate as well. So, again, I'd say we're scrambling pretty hard right now to make sure we've got the folks on board to make that happen.</p><p>Charles mentioned the new Harmony platform, which is getting very good reviews out there. And I think it's so far so good. We will know probably by the end of second quarter we'll be hopefully comfortable saying that this thing is off to the races. Right now, we're just in the process of converting some clients over as we speak, and we want to make sure everything is smooth there as well. So, that's the scoop at Epsilon.</p><p>In Private Label, once again, it gets the gold star that I think they will be able to share with BrandLoyalty for the quarter. Again, new client growth continues to surprise. Historically, we tend to sign about five new clients per year, which is a bit under $400 million of new portfolio growth or a vintage.</p><p>And again, when we talk about vintage and we talk about signing clients, most of our clients start from scratch. And so it takes three years for them to fully mature, and that's why when we talk about a $400 million vintage that means three years after signing. And that essentially gives us tremendous visibility into the next couple of years.</p><p>Well as we talked about over the past couple of years in 2012, there just seemed to be a massive shift of interest from a number of retailers as well as new verticals in retail for our particular product offering. Which again, allows a closed loop network to pull out, not just who the person is, but also the information down to the category or SKU level, which is really the gold standard in data these days.</p><p>In 2013, the shift continued to accelerate, and we signed our first $2 billion vintage and in 2014 we're absolutely tracking to another $2 billion vintage. We have announced Virgin, Venus, DSW and IDD, and just those four should be about the first $0.5 billion when they fully spool up.</p><p>We have a number of signings that we'll be releasing over the next six months, and it looks like it's going to be another huge year. And the importance of that is that it allows us to look into 2015, 2016, and 2017 as these vintages spool up and be very comfortable with the type of growth rates that we want.</p><p>Probably the -- I would say the most important item to note here is a continuation in tender share growth. So for example, if on a typical client, 30% of their sales flow through our card, that's probably a pretty decent level for us. And then you look at, well once the client matures, once the program matures, at the client, we tend to grow or should grow at the growth rate of the client.</p><p>Well what we found during the holiday season in Q4 and what we're continuing to see in Q1, is that this Private Label product is really beginning to take off in terms of probably the best type of loyalty tool that the retailer has. And so we saw that in terms of comparing the growth rate in card sales against the growth rate in our client sales overall.</p><p>And as many people know from the weather or whatever is being said out there, the first three months of this year you probably saw relatively flat sales growth in the retail space. Against that, our core sales growth is more like 7%. So something is working out there, and I think that's part of what's attracting more and more clients.</p><p>Overall, the results, the credit card portfolio, I think you saw we did about 15% in Q1. That is going to accelerate, and we'll be running around 20% as the year rolls out. Principal loss rates and funding rates are pretty stable, and we're not seeing any blips here or there in terms of anything on the credit quality side. It looks good.</p><p>Obviously, we have brought on a ton of new folks, which is great. 1,000 plus people onshore, which will of course hit the expenses pretty hard until we have those programs ramped up and the revenue flowing through. But I think it's certainly the right thing to do.</p><p>So the overall outlook, mid to high teens growth in revenue, double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA for 2014. So another good year overall.</p><p>Finishing up on the last item, and then we'll open up, there is no question that the ongoing shift of spend in marketing dollars from general brand spending into data-driven marketing and loyalty programs continues. I don't think it's news to anyone. Fortunately, we're on that side of the bet, and in all three of our businesses, we're continuing to see a very high level of interest in every vertical out there trying to get a better bead on who their customer is, and how he or she behaves, and how we can entice them to be a more loyal customer and to frequent the retailer more often.</p><p>For us, we essentially have four objectives for the year, and they're pretty straightforward. We are primarily an organic growth shop. Our goal is to grow our top line at 3X GDP, so we would say roughly 9% for the year.</p><p>We expect overall revenue growth rate of 22%, as we're seeing a bit stronger results on top line from BrandLoyalty, Epsilon and Private Label. And then we've got a little bit of offset with the Canadian dollar. That will flow through the core EPS growth of 22%.</p><p>And in the middle there, of course our expenses and there is a lot of frontloading right now going on both in Private Label and at Epsilon. And it's just the nature of those businesses that you've got to pay for it now, and it starts flowing in a little bit later. But I think that means that it bodes extremely well for the future, and we're building the foundation for the future while onboarding a record amount of new businesses.</p><p>So if I were to finally sum it up, I would say the year is tracking a little bit better out of the gate than we had anticipated. It's a little bit choppy in the first half, but it's because we're building for the second half and into 2015, 2016, and 2017, which is for me where a lot of my attention is being spent these days.</p><p>And then finally, I'll sum up obviously in the market there's been a fair amount of volatility to start out the year. And there's not much we can do about that, but we can say that with volatility comes opportunity. And from our perspective, things are looking a bit more intriguing now if this volatility continues.</p><p>So that being said, I think we'll cut it off here, and we'll move to Q&amp;A. Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for your questions.</p><p>(Operator Instructions)</p><p>Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: Just starting with Epsilon, the two new Agency deals that you guys spoke about, could you maybe just talk about when you on board the revenues are they're going to be significant incremental costs that you incur, or are most of those costs being incurred now and then the revenues come after? And maybe if you could give us a little bit more qualitative color on the nature of these two relationships, because they seem pretty sizable.</p><p>And then maybe just one on Private Label, could you just also talk about the M&amp;A pipeline? You have a player that's going public, and obviously Wells came into the market a little bit. So maybe you could just talk about how that M&amp;A pipeline is materializing. Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure, let me start with the second and finish with the first. The M&amp;A pipeline, per se in Private Label, if you looked at the clients that we've signed, probably 90% plus of the clients that we're signing, they're are starting a program from scratch. So we're not really in the takeaway game from an M&amp;A perspective.</p><p>They will be one or two files probably per year that we will on board, and I would expect that to be the case this year as well. But for the most part, Sanjay, this stuff is coming from clients who either have had a program in the past and it's dead now and they're going to start cranking it up again, or folks that have never had one.</p><p>So I think in terms of running into the other folks, for the most, unless it's a really large file, I think we're comfortable in our sandbox. Our biggest challenge is trying to convince the prospect that the Private Label platform is the better loyalty option than other options. Of course, one of the other options is Epsilon, so it's a delicate balance there.</p><p>Speaking of Epsilon itself on the agency deals, we're beginning to see some traction in terms of selling through the stacks, so to speak. Which would be not only the creative and Agency side of it, but also allowing Epsilon to be the provider of things such as the demographic and psycho graphic data, the database build, as well as the analytics and distribution side of the business as well.</p><p>So, I'm not going to get into the specific clients themselves. But we are seeing some traction on that side. On the expense side, whenever you're in a strong -- when you're assigning a strong book of business, you're always going to have expenses that are running in front of the revenue, and that should even out as the year progresses.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay. And just one more on the Epsilon question, just is the opportunity to move some of those new relationships into the other lines as well? So will they materialize as revenue in database and technology as well?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, that's the game plan, or they could be a big tech client today, and we would try to sell in the Agency side.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay. All right, Great. Perfect. And then I just had one last one for Brian. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more of a refined window into Brazil. I guess, Ed, you mentioned the $25 million collector target to get to roughly the size of Canada. How do you guys get there from where you are right now? Because it seems like a lot of the you got thus far came from Banco do Brasil.</p><p>BRYAN PEARSON: Yes, I think they did come from Banco do Brasil, but they also came very much from the retail partners that we have in each of the regions that we've launched, Sanjay. So I would suggest the following. Is that, we've been doing a market by market rollout. We've been trying to get and look for a national sized grocery player, which would help us penetrate the two largest markets which are basically Rio and Sao Paulo.</p><p>So remember that we're now at 12 million customers in that marketplace, and we're not in the two largest cities in Brazil. There's still a number of markets there are left. So you can think about it three ways.</p><p>One is, we continue growing into new markets, as we've been doing, and that would take us on the pace and the cadence the we're on today. The second piece would be by adding additional partners to the mix. So whether that's a big grocer or a new fuel player or a bigger electronics player, whatever it may be, those will make the program more attractive and add even more customers from the existing markets we're in, but also lend us the opportunity to do the third thing which is really grow that national presence which would bring Rio and Sao Paulo into the mix.</p><p>That's the path to daylight. I think we're quite comfortable that we can continue at the pace of growth that we've been on in the last little while, and the focus for us right now is to build a very viable program in all the markets that we're in. Which, today, the collector activation, which would be the measure of how many points they're earning, are they redeeming, how many partners are they using. Those metrics are tracking quite nicely with what the early days were in Canada, and so we feel quite confident that we're on the right track in terms of the value proposition we have for the marketplace.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Darrin Peller with Barclays.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: If you could help us understand what may have surprised you with regard to your top line growth during the quarter versus your initial I think $1.25 billion guidance, maybe beyond currency? And then maybe you could just rank the key drivers enabling you to raise revenue guidance for the year, despite this quarter. And is it maybe just conservatism in the Private Label business that was going into the year, or is it that you had better than expected results in BrandLoyalty? And what other key variables should we focus on? Thanks.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: Darrin, in terms of the revenue, I'd say really came from two areas. One, FX of was a little bit worse than we anticipated, so you had a little bit more pressure coming through on LoyaltyOne. The second was, we just acquired BrandLoyalty, and initially probably were a little optimistic on terms of the revenue. But really, it's a sequencing issue, which is they're still going to hit there, as Ed talked about, we're actually going to have a very good year for BrandLoyalty revenue.</p><p>Where probably initially, we thought the revenue would be a little bit stronger in the first quarter than what it ended up shaking out. So I think it's just more of a timing issue for us, nothing more. The currency was a little more pronounced, BrandLoyalty timing issue on the revenue was still very strong for the year.</p><p>And then if you go through and look at why we feel better about the revenue stream, obviously Ed has already talked about BrandLoyalty going from $500 million to $550 million. Ed also talked about Private Label. We started the year with 15% growth on average receivables, now we're talking about 20%. So that's the upside you're seeing.</p><p>The third of it is, we did start off a little bit stronger with Epsilon, good high single-digit organic growth. Looking for some new clients to come through on Harmony, which could give a little upside to the back half of the year. And then, going back to Sanjay's point, as we do have these two to big clients ramping, if we get to a point of revenue growth where we can recognize it Q3, Q4 that gives upside to the year as well.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: All right, that's helpful. So if we were to rank it, it sounds like it is basically the BrandLoyalty upside. Although it sounds like the first quarter was a little bit weaker, but you're still expecting that ramp up enough and see the evidence that it will ramp up enough to actually do better than you initially planned latter part of the year. Okay.</p><p>And then, Private Label, obviously you're looking at 20% versus 15%, and then those big deal still ramping in. All right, that's helpful.</p><p>Just on the credit quality side, one question. It seems like provisions were about $20 million or $25 million below your charge-off level in the quarter, which to the way we see you guys more in line or a little higher. Although, you also seem like, at least by our calculation, you're still over 100 basis points higher in terms of your allowance level than your charge-offs, which is still a really conservative cushion. Are we thinking about this correctly in the sense of how you want to keep that level going forward, or can give us a little guidance in terms of how we should think about your allowance levels for the rest of the year?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I think you're right Darren. In terms of the spread between the reserve rates and trailing charge-off rate, 100 to 110 bips is reasonable. Like we talked about, we're still looking at about 16 months forward coverage in terms of the reserve we currently carry. So that's obviously very robust when most card companies would carry more like 9 to 12 months worth of coverage. So I think we'll continue to be very conservative, or what I'll say, appropriate in that regard. Good forward coverage, good spread, think of it being in the 100, 110 points range.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: Okay, very helpful. All right, thanks, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.</p><p>BRETT HUFF, ANALYST, STEPHENS INC.: Hello, can you guys hear me okay? Sorry about that. One quick -- just to put a little finer point on the guidance, Charles, I wanted to make sure I understood this. What was your expectation for the Canadian headwind in the prior guided range versus the I think it's $55 million now? And I'm just trying to balance that with it seems like the benefit of an extra $50 million or so we're going to get from BrandLoyalty.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: So, when we came out with our guidance last quarter, were assuming the Canadian dollar would be about CAD0.94. Now we think the Canadian dollar will be more like CAD0.91 for the year. Now, the headwinds we face will be throughout the full year, but it's worse in the first quarter and lightest in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So what we saw was a little bit more of a negative impact in Q1 than we had anticipated. We have taken it down a little bit for the year, which is obviously included in our $12.25 core EPS guidance. But again, as the year goes on, it abates in terms of the amount of the headwinds.</p><p>BRETT HUFF: That's helpful. And can you talk about -- a little bit more on the Epsilon front-end loading? I think you called out in the press release $2 million, but it sounds like it might be a bigger project than that. And somebody already asked that question, but I just want to know a little bit more on is it $2 million, or is there more ancillary stuff in there that's harder to quantify? We thought the profitability would be better at Epsilon, and I'm trying to understand what's going on there.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I guess I'd considered it more direct costs we're incurring to roll out the platform with these clients. Again, if it's a large client and it's technology platform in this case software we're rolling out, it takes number of months to get rolled out. During that timeframe, we're incurring the expense, the direct expense, to do the rollouts but we're deferring the revenue stream until it really gets up and ramped.</p><p>So what you're seeing now is deferrment on the expense, expense we have to incur to get the technology platform rolled out. But then when we get to the point of recognizing the revenue stream in Q3, Q4, then you can see the leveraging coming through and a little bit obviously the EBITDA margin contribution.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, I think one of the things that we're beginning to see now given the size of Epsilon with north of 5,000 people, is that when you're signing 23 new deals a year on platforms and stuff, you've got to bring in a lot of folks. And these are what we call, folks who have the hot skills where were competing with the other folks out there, the Googles and Facebooks and stuff like that for the same talent.</p><p>And so getting those folks, getting them in the door, and getting in the size of the labor force that we need, it's becoming something that is now more of a challenge than it was when we were a lot smaller, I'll tell you that. And so, we will probably air on the side of getting a little bit more in the door sooner rather than later to make sure we have the pool available.</p><p>BRETT HUFF: And then one last question, I think, Ed, you'd talked a little bit about Private Label going forward, and it sounds like you're spending time there. And I think the last call, you had said the 2015 Private Label spots to start implementing were starting to look a little scarce. First of all, I want to make sure that I'm remembering that right. And if so, can you give us your sense of that same view today?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, in terms of 2014, obviously, we're all booked up and it's straining the resources a little bit at this point. And so we probably -- we are drifting into slots for 2015 already, to your point. I would say we could probably launch up to at most 20 clients in a given year, given that we used to do five.</p><p>I'd say folks have done a spectacular job giving us that capacity, but I would say 20 is about it. And it goes back to the overall theme that we've been talking about which is organic top line is very strong. Revenue is very strong. We're going to flow through enough of it to give us the 20% plus earnings growth.</p><p>Our real issue this year is not going to be bringing in top line and organic growth. Our biggest issue this year is on execution and making sure that with these record books of businesses, especially at Epsilon and in Private Label, that the machine doesn't break down frankly. And that's where we're putting all of our efforts.</p><p>In terms of the year itself, I think the financials are in very good shape for the year. There may be a couple of minor tweaks as the year unfolds, hopefully to the upside. But we are 100% focused right now on just handling the two books of business that we've signed, and getting those on without things fraying at the seams.</p><p>BRETT HUFF: Great. Thanks for your time.</p><p>OPERATOR: David Togut with Evercore.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS: Thank you, and good morning. Could you comment on the unit pricing outlook for Private Label, Epsilon, and LoyaltyOne for this year and next year?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I'm not sure exactly what you mean David. I'll probably answer a little bit differently. If you were looking at EBITDA margins, we're looking probably for stable to maybe slightly up at LoyaltyOneAIR MILES. Obviously, well see some improvements coming through on BrandLoyalty as the year progresses. For Epsilon EBITDA margins, probably flat to maybe up slightly.</p><p>For Private Label, just because we'll have a little bit of a reserve build associated with the growth, you'll probably see a little bit of EBITDA margin compression in the Private Label space. Is that where you're going David?</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: That's helpful. And to follow that up, in the Private Label space, I'm curious if you're seeing any change in unit pricing as you compete for some of these new awards, or have most of these awards that you highlighted in the quarter really been sole sourced?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I wouldn't say we're seeing really any pricing pressure in that regard. If you look through the year, we're saying that gross yields may be down as much as 40 basis points. If I take out the ramp of the new programs, the required programs, basically flat to maybe slightly up.</p><p>So that would tell me really what you're seeing is the influence of the growth, not the influence of pricing pressure coming through on re-signing some deals or some of the programs that we have. Really it's just the ramp you're seeing.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: That's helpful. And just a quick final question on the Co-Branding side. Could you update us on your strategy in Co-Branding?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. I think that one of the things we're trying to do in our Private Label business is to diversify a little bit away from our traditional verticals, which would be soft goods, jewelry, home furnishings. And so Co-Brand, the choice of whether to use Private Label or Co-Brand is really up to the client.</p><p>And what we've found is there are certain verticals where Co-Brand works best, and specifically that would be T&amp;E, hospitality. Those are the areas where there's a huge amount of interest in just having Co-Brand. So if you see an announcement in those areas, so for example with Caesar's or with Virgin America, something like that, those are going to be the Co-Brand space. The majority of our business will always continue to be Private Label, but there is a slot that's opening up for Co-Brand.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: And then on that point, to what extent can you extract SKU level data from a Co-Brand card?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. It's the same gig. It's actually what you do is because we are the merchant acquirer and the issuer for Co-Brand, if the transaction takes place at that retailer, clearly, we can extract the same type of information as long as the merchant once again agrees to give us that information.</p><p>For purchases outside of the retailer, we can't get that level of information. We could probably only get where you went and how much you spent at the location. So for stuff that takes place at the retailer, we can get the same level of information, that's the deal with the merchant. And outside of that, we're stuck with just total dollars being spent.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: What percentage of purchases on Co-Brand typically occur at the retailer on the card versus outside of that?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I don't know David, I don't have that stat.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It's all over the place.</p><p>DAVID TOGUT: Okay, thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: David Scharf with JMP Securities.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Morning, thank you. Two areas. First, on Epsilon, wanted to follow-up on earlier questioning about cross-selling. Has there been a history thus far of moving any Agency clients to become data and technology clients, or is there a track record over the last couple of years since you've entered the Agency business?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It hasn't been nearly as strong as it should be. A lot of that has to do with we really just finished, I think when you're talking about last year, the organizational changes at Epsilon. Where as before, we sold by product. So you would have someone responsible for the agency P&amp;L, someone else responsible for technology, someone else for distribution, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>We rearranged everything so that now the P&amp;L is by vertical. So if you are in the auto vertical, your P&amp;L responsibilities are now cut across all the products. And as result, your comp is cut across all the products. And we have found that when you tie your comp to that type of goal, that that tends to move the needle.</p><p>So I would say that you had a smattering of deals last year. This year, we're beginning to see much more sellthrough, and it goes both ways. It goes Agency clients, which are now going into the technology side, and technology going upstream into Agency. I would say this year and next year should be significant years for the sellthrough.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it, that's helpful. And then secondly, turning to Private Label, that was helpful commentary on the yield outlook. Maybe there's more type of question to answer, it's more qualitative or macro driven.</p><p>But setting aside the near-term headwinds on gross yields just because you're boarding on more new clients, you have to build bigger reserves. Can you give us a sense for whether gross yields are still running below ignoring the new client aspect, whether gross yield are running historical peaks just based on the percentage of your yield that's coming from late fees.</p><p>I'm just trying to understand whether or not as we think about ultimately where that portfolio can trend, whether it's still, let's say, more of a prime portfolio, or a higher credit score portfolio than you actually like? Just trying to understand what key profitability can be, and whether late fees are still representing about a third of gross yield, or if payment rates are still too high.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I think if you take out the influence of the new program, it's right around to where it is. It is about we'd want it to be. To put it another way, we're not really trying to push it up or push it down.</p><p>You'll have some influence that's coming through there, David. Obviously, we have an APR tied to prime rates. So if you see short-term rates go up, then you're going to see the APRs go up, so you're going to see a little bit of float there naturally. The increase in APR offsetting the increase in funding costs.</p><p>The flip side of it is that, obviously, we are doing a little bit more Co-Brand than what we did in the past. Co-Brand is going to carry a little bit lower gross yield than what a typical PLCC would. So I'd say, [investing] for those will be somewhat static.</p><p>But those will have an influence on a go-forward basis that it's hard for me to really answer your question exactly. We do have a prime portfolio, we'll endeavor to keep it that way. Going back even 2007, we've kept our underwriting standards very consistent. Approval rates now are still pretty low for us, we could [exceed] them to come up over time as people repair their credit. But aside from the two [fedras] I talked about, I don't any impetus to make it to go up or down.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Very helpful, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY, ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: Good morning, thank you for taking the question. Ed, I appreciate the color on the pipeline, and it sounds like demand is strong across your businesses. I've been following Alliance for a while, and I certainly have less than perfect memory. But I can't remember a time when you called out 1,000 new employees in a call center, for example.</p><p>Can you just frame up for us how you balance visibility? And I think you mentioned a couple of potential large customers at Epsilon suggesting that they're not signed. Can you just frame up the balance between the front end loaded investment, and perhaps the risk on either timing of new deals coming on this year? Or the risk that you don't win the contracts that you think you're going to win, and how you frame that up in the context of your real confident second half outlook?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. You hit the nail on the head. It's a balancing act. What we're finding is that really especially at Epsilon and Private Label, you're just seeing more demand, more demand, and more demand, which is, as we say, a great problem to have.</p><p>I think hiring 1,000 people at Private Label, we need those folks up and running. We need the call centers built. We need the space provided well in front of these clients spooling up.</p><p>I think the messaging here is that none of this is hiring on spec. We're hiring folks based on deals that have been signed. So in the case of Private Label, as we said, we've got 20 new folks, 20 new clients spooling up this year. The backlog looks very strong, and at Epsilon we've got 23 big platform builds going on this year and getting those people in the door. That's the big challenge, and we're going to try to match delivering 20% earnings growth this year, at the same time not letting business fall through the cracks so we can have strong growth outlook for 2015 and 2016.</p><p>It's a long-winded way of saying it's a balancing act. It's a good problem to have, but it doesn't take much either way to get your expenses to shoot out of control for a quarter or two. And we want to make sure that doesn't happen.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: Okay. And you guys have a good track record of forecasting your business. One last one, if I might, just with regard to the loyalty business generally. When you step back and look at the traditional AIR MILES business versus some of the other things you're doing, whether it's BrandLoyalty or the cash rewards business in Canada or certainly the growth in Brazil, would you frame that up at all as a changing of the guard or a maturation of your loyalty business generally? Or is that too dramatic a comment?</p><p>BRYAN PEARSON: Let's put it this way. The program is 22 years old. When you've got a business that's been running for that long, and you've got 70% of Canadians participating in the program, you could look at it and say is it in a maturing phase as a business overall. And I think that you could put that color on it. The reality is, that we still see a lot of opportunity in that business for growth.</p><p>Is a going to be a strong double-digit growth in the future? No. Does it have the potential to be mid- to high single-digit as you go forward? Yes. And do we have some things that we put in place that will help us get there? And the answer to that is yes.</p><p>We probably had the best year of signing new partners that we've had in years last year. If you look at that 10 million households, there's a portion of them that they're very engaged in the program, and there's a portion of them that are using some sponsors but they're not holistically engaged in the program and using it as their primary reward vehicle.</p><p>And so, we see opportunity to continue to add sponsors in categories, to continue to basically add -- to continue to add more cross sponsor activation, as we would say. In other words, a measure of engagement. And as a result of that, we think that there's opportunities with things like the cash program to change the nature of what our growth pattern has been over the last few years.</p><p>I think as much as anything, Canada has had an anemic spending environment for probably the better part of 18 months now. And I think the consumer is cautious in terms of how they're spending, and so a little bit of economic recovery and a little bit of these other strategies will get us back to a healthier outlook going forward.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: That's great, thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Okay, I think that wraps it up, and we'll talk to you next quarter.

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded; if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And I will turn the call over to Ms. Sara Buda. Ma'am, you may begin.</p><p>SARA BUDA, VP, IR &amp; CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT, LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.: Great. Thank you, operator, and welcome, everybody, to the Lionbridge investor call to discuss financial results for the first quarter of 2015. During this call, we may make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws and which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements.</p><p>We've disclosed in greater detail on our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the factors that may cause such differences.</p><p>And now I'll turn the call over to Lionbridge Chairman and CEO Rory Cowan.</p><p>RORY COWAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.: Well, good morning, everybody. And thank you, Sara. Today, I'll talk about our very positive Q1 results and the momentum driving our continued strong Q2 outlook. I'll also touch on the integration of CLS, the stability and pace of business with our largest client, and some early successes with our new business initiatives.</p><p>So first, let me summarize the quarter. Q1 revenue, as you see, was about $137 million, an increase of about $17 million or 14% year on year. CLS Communications, an acquisition we closed on January 7, contributed about $21 million in the quarter, in line with expectations.</p><p>Lionbridge standalone was about $116 million in the quarter, a decrease year on year due to currency, of course, and the expected Microsoft decline from our largest client. However, normalizing for currency and Microsoft, standalone revenue grew 10% year on year. So the underlying revenue trend is really quite positive.</p><p>Margins are trending upward as well. Q1 gross margins were 33.8%, an increase of almost 300 basis points year on year. As Don will detail, margins in our GLC language and content segment were over 36% in the quarter. So we're pleased to see the margin momentum we've expected begin to emerge. Cost actions, currency, work mix, and volume all contributed to the strong margin performance.</p><p>This led to GAAP earnings of about $0.05 a share and non-GAAP earnings of about $0.14 a share in the quarter, both well ahead of expectations, of course. And even after the restructuring expense associated with CLS. So all in all, a strong quarter.</p><p>We're starting to see the early benefits of our strategy and we're migrating to new buyers in new verticals for revenue growth. We're accelerating our technology automation and offshore migration for earnings growth. And despite the dampening effect on revenue, we have a positive currency environment for earnings. As a result, 2015 should be a solid year.</p><p>So let me touch on some of the trends for Q2 and the year. First, let's talk about CLS. As you may remember, CLS is a Swiss-based translation company focused on the financial services, government, industrial, and life sciences market.</p><p>We closed CLS during the first week of January as planned. And from a revenue standpoint, they had a solid quarter in Q1 and their Q2 outlook remains strong. The revenue seems to be well on path, as expected.</p><p>From a cost perspective, CLS integration is also on plan. As we said when we announced CLS in November, the two companies have complementary geographies and complementary end markets.</p><p>As we complete the first quarter of combined operations, we remain enthused about the business combination. The synergy plan is straightforward and it is mostly overhead- and corporate-orientation, not necessarily field, given the complementary markets. And the cost reductions are moving along as expected. And while not in the plan, we are also starting to see some early opportunities for revenue synergies, which should play out in 2016 as well.</p><p>On all fronts, CLS continues to be solidly accretive transaction that accelerates our strategy for new vertical markets and allows us to optimize our combined cost structure.</p><p>Second, let's turn to organic revenue growth. Q1 focused on three areas: stability with our largest client, executing our growth strategy of new buyers and new verticals, and developing new online channels for growth.</p><p>Let's start by addressing the demand environment at Microsoft. In Q1, as expected, this account dampened our revenue by about $8 million year on year as they continue to implement their reorganization plan. However, on a sequential basis, Microsoft revenue remained relatively stable, as expected. So the client seems to be holding steady at current levels.</p><p>Looking ahead, however, we are starting to see a stronger pace of new business at Microsoft -- new opportunities, new bids, new pipeline. It's too early to be precise, but we're really cautiously optimistic that there could be some upside in that account for the second half of the year.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the combination of CLS and our new business momentum moves Microsoft to a less meaningful percentage, down to about 14% of revenue from 23% a year ago. So Microsoft seems stable, with early indications for growth, and we continue to grow our non-tech revenue streams as well.</p><p>Let's talk about the second phase of our growth strategy for new buyers and new verticals. New buyers -- we continue to increase our share of wallet within existing accounts by moving upstream to new buyers, particularly the marketing departments. In essence, we are taking skills we developed from managing complex global product releases and applying these skills to global marketing campaigns.</p><p>The investments we've made in building out our digital capabilities are paying off. And I recently visited our marketing Center of Excellence in Costa Rica and came away even more impressed with our digital marketing skills, from global SEO, to global web design, to global social listening capabilities, to video production, to global creative, to global social media knowledge. We are driving impressive results with some of the world's most demanding global brands.</p><p>We have the right operational model, the right technology, the right global footprint, and the right people to excel in the area of global digital marketing services. And as we continue to reconfigure our sales teams to address this demand, marketing services remains one of the fastest-growing areas of our business.</p><p>Now let's talk about new verticals. We continue to diversify our revenue with growth outside of our traditional tech sectors. On a stand-alone basis, our manufacturing and industrial segment is seeing solid growth with new business clients such as Cummins Engines, DRS and BAE. We've won some new engagements with clients in the consumer retail markets as well and our life science practice continues to scale.</p><p>The addition of CLS further accelerates this vertical market strategy, as they have a history in the financial services sector. And we now have UBS as a top 10 client and several other financial services companies. On the manufacturing side, CLS brings new revenue streams, with companies like John Deere.</p><p>In life sciences, we have a few new large relationships and CLS brings several large programs with the Canadian government. So clearly, the addition of CLS and our own sales reorientation accelerates our strategy of expanding into new vertical markets and selling to new buyers.</p><p>So last, let's talk about our online channels for growth. As many of you know, Lionbridge has really excelled in establishing large and growing recurring revenue relationships with global brands using a highly skilled enterprise sales force.</p><p>Enterprise sales will remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy. However, as we set our sights on $1 billion, we are now complementing this traditional enterprise sales model with online, telemarketing sales models, aimed at capturing and centralizing the disaggregated translation needs within large enterprises. Everything from videos to mobile apps, to end design files, to legal documents.</p><p>We introduced this OnDemand model about a year ago and I'm pleased with the early momentum we are seeing. We expect to exit 2015 with an annualized run rate of $8 million to $10 million, more than double the exit rate from last year.</p><p>So the momentum of OnDemand really demonstrates another means of expanding our leadership position in the translation and digital marketing services markets. It's a leaner customer acquisition model, a leaner delivery model, that builds on our global presence.</p><p>So in summary, Q1 was a solid quarter and our Q2 ramp is building on plan. We are growing large recurring revenue relationships ex Microsoft. The integration of CLS is progressing on plan, with ongoing opportunities for synergies.</p><p>We are driving new business across new buyers and new verticals. We are complementing across -- we are complementing our traditional enterprise sales model with online channels to drive further growth. And last, we are accelerating toward our goal of 10% EBITDA margins in 2015.</p><p>So now let me turn it over to Don for more details on the quarter and our outlook for Q2.</p><p>DON MUIR, CFO, LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.: Thanks, Rory, and hello, everyone. Today I'm going to walk through our Q1 financial results and I'll also provide an update on our outlook for Q2 and some of the positive trends we are seeing in the business.</p><p>Let me begin with an overview of Q1, starting with revenue. In the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $136.8 million. This reflects a year-on-year increase of 14% or $16.6 million from last year. There were a number of ins and outs for revenue during the quarter, let me break it down for you.</p><p>There were two main growth factors: one, the addition of CLS, which was about $21 million in the quarter; and two, stand-alone constant currency revenue growth of about $9 million year on year, ex Microsoft. These revenue benefits were offset by a $5 million negative currency effect and an $8 million decline with Microsoft year on year.</p><p>The key takeaway is that CLS revenue was solid, as expected, and our stand-alone revenue grew 10% in constant currency, ex Microsoft, a strong underlying revenue trend. Revenue in our GLC language and content segment was about $98 million, growth of about 20% year over year.</p><p>Our GES testing segment revenue was $33 million in Q1, about flat with last year. And [intereps] was relatively flat year on year as well, at about $5.5 million for the quarter. All of CLS's revenue is recorded in our GLC segment.</p><p>Now on to another part of the story, margins. Q1 total Company gross margin was 33.8%, an increase of 290 basis points from last year. Margins in our GLC segment were a record 36.1% for the quarter, growth of 330 basis points year on year.</p><p>Margins in our GES segment were 30.5%, growth of about 160 basis points. So margins were strong in all fronts during the quarter and we expect this positive margin growth trend to continue throughout the year.</p><p>First-quarter operating expenses increased by $6.5 million year on year, excluding restructuring. This was driven primarily by higher SG&amp;A associated with CLS. This is the first quarter of remapping CLS from Swiss GAAP into US GAAP.</p><p>And with the exception of the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the expense lines came through largely as we expected. And their revenue and gross margins were in line with expectations as well. So I'm pleased with the early indications for a smooth integration with Lionbridge.</p><p>Restructuring and related expenses were about $3 million in Q1. Looking ahead, we expect another $4 million to $5 million in the second quarter and likely another $3 million in Q3 before tailing off a bit in Q4 as we integrate CLS and rationalize the cost structure of the combined companies.</p><p>This is in line with our previously announced expectations for about $10 million to $12 million of restructuring expense this year. And as we've said, we expect a 12-month to 18-month payback on most of these actions. So the operations team continues to execute well on integration and we remain positive about the expected benefits.</p><p>Moving down the income statement, interest expense was about $500,000 in the quarter, as expected, given the incremental debt borrowed in the quarter to finance the CLS acquisition. That said, we did pay down $6 million of the new bank debt and continued to enjoy the very positive terms of our revolving credit facility, borrowing at a spread over monthly LIBOR rates, currently running at about 6 basis points.</p><p>We've had a benefit on the other expense line of about $2.5 million in the quarter. As you may remember, this is largely the effect of the currency effect on monthly balance sheet item revaluations. So this quarter, a few currencies, primarily euro, Japanese yen, and Polish zloty, worked in our favor. And overall, we continue to manage our FX exposures quite well.</p><p>The Q1 tax provision was about $1.1 million or 26% of pre-tax income in the quarter, despite the addition of CLS. And we believe that our full-year tax provision should be in a range of 25% to 30% versus last year's 29% tax rate. So we continue to successfully execute our global tax strategy as planned.</p><p>So with all these factors -- increased revenue volume, stronger margins, ongoing expense control -- we drove GAAP earnings of 0.05 per share in the quarter, growth of about $0.02 year over year. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.14 in the quarter, also well ahead of expectations, and growth of $0.06 year on year.</p><p>Moving to the balance sheet. Operationally, we consumed about $5.5 million of cash during the quarter. This is consistent with our typical cash flow seasonality. We tend to consume cash in Q1 followed by strong cash flow in Q2 and the rest of the year.</p><p>DSOs remain in great shape at 51 days, even after the addition of CLS receivables. Capital spending was $2.5 million in the quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to run about $10 million to $11 million, roughly consistent with prior years.</p><p>We ended the quarter with about $25 million in cash, even after paying down $6 million of new bank debt, repurchasing about $1.4 million of stock in the quarter, funding, restructuring and related charges, and continuing to invest appropriately in the business.</p><p>So our balance sheet remains solid. We continue to feel comfortable that we have the ability to pay down the incremental debt related to CLS within three years, if we choose to. We continue to support our stock repurchase plan and we have the flexibility to fund additional tuck-in acquisitions as appropriate.</p><p>Let me wrap up by talking about our outlook for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we are estimating revenue in a range between $142 million and $147 million. This would be a sequential increase of $5 million to $10 million from Q1, even after some currency volatility for revenue in April. And we expect continued margin and earnings improvement in Q2 as well.</p><p>For the second half of the year, we remain largely comfortable with current estimates, barring any notable currency movement. While we have a lot going on here between currencies, CLS integration, Microsoft, and new business ramps, overall business momentum feels strong.</p><p>Revenue continues to build. We exceeded both revenue and earnings expectations in Q1, despite currency volatility. Our Q2 revenue outlook shows a strong seasonal increase and we expect our positive revenue and earnings momentum to continue in the second half of the year.</p><p>So Rory, back to you.</p><p>RORY COWAN: Well, thanks, Don. Not much more to say there, other than it was a -- certainly a positive quarter, with really solid underlying revenue trends and currency trends. Our strategy of new buyers and new verticals is really beginning to get some traction. And the CLS integration is running smoothly.</p><p>So I'll open the call up to questions.</p><p>SARA BUDA: Operator, we can open the call to questions now.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) George Sutton.</p><p>GEORGE SUTTON, ANALYST, CRAIG-HALLUM CAPITAL GROUP: Thank you. Rory, you mentioned your Center of Excellence in Costa Rica. I'm not sure if you've contemplated an analyst day? But you have my full endorsement.</p><p>RORY COWAN: (laughter)</p><p>GEORGE SUTTON: So relative to your guidance in Q2, obviously you've got some impact from the currencies in April. Can you talk about CLS in Q2 versus Q1? Because if memory serves, as financial services is still large, that really impacts them positively in Q1.</p><p>And then also could you give us an update on GSK? I thought we would start to see some contribution at this point from them.</p><p>RORY COWAN: Great. A couple of good questions here. First, let's talk about CLS in sequential quarters. They tend to be a Q4, Q1 sort of center of gravity for strength. We are seeing that they are getting some traction in Canada that may keep that momentum going through Q2. So we don't see any real transitions there.</p><p>I'm a little hesitant, as generally if you are going to get any -- having done this enough times, if you're going to get any customer fall-off because of a change of ownership, it's generally the second or third quarter, customers have had enough time to sort of reconsider the relationship, should they be nervous about this.</p><p>I'm not anticipating much of that, George, only because most of this restructuring that we are dealing is really putting together the corporation -- the corporate aspects, not the customer-facing aspects. Because they're complementary markets and geographies. So I think that CLS should be fairly stable.</p><p>Your next question about GSK. GSK is taking a little bit longer to ramp, although we are getting connected. It is a gnarly and diverse nation state and we've gotten a lot of their data on to our platform.</p><p>Things are beginning to ramp with them. It's probably a couple million dollars lower than we would like this year, but we may pick that up and have to as we move some of their larger operations on to our platform. Like all these things, it's just organizational change and business process reengineering.</p><p>GEORGE SUTTON: Okay. And in your prepared comments, you mentioned you were seeing some early opportunities for revenue synergies with the CLS acquisition. Could you give us a sense of what you mean by that?</p><p>RORY COWAN: Yes. For example, in some of their financial services groups, they are beginning to embrace digital marketing. And so we are seeing that our connectivity with their content management systems really allow us to globalize many of their marketing programs.</p><p>So think UK, mutual funds, selling in Germany, for example. Not only the regulatory -- the multilingual regulatory requirements, but also the marketing requirements.</p><p>GEORGE SUTTON: Perfect. Okay, thanks, guys. Nice job.</p><p>OPERATOR: Kevin Liu.</p><p>KEVIN LIU, ANALYST, B. RILEY &amp; CO.: First question. Rory, I think within your prepared remarks, you mentioned some the realignment of sales efforts you're doing, just to gear yourself more towards opportunities in digital marketing. Could you talk a little bit about the scope of those changes, how significant they are, and whether you expect them to have much impact in the near term?</p><p>RORY COWAN: Yes, I think -- I'm sort of reassessing the focus of enterprise sales and also the end markets that we are focusing on. As you remember, Kevin, we grew up at the knee of Big Tech.</p><p>And so we've had enterprise sales people calling on product development organizations, developed very detailed and high velocity processes for getting these products released worldwide. That may or may not be the same caliber of salesperson or the same coverage that you want to focus on digital marketing.</p><p>A product buyer is quite organized and structured. A marketing buyer is much more problem-oriented, solutions-oriented, and less structured. So it's just a different customer interaction.</p><p>So that's one transition of enterprise sales. So we'll be reconfiguring a lot of our coverage here in the US and beginning to have salespeople focus on the new buyers at the new DMU -- decision-making unit.</p><p>I mentioned the other thing that we're doing is we are finding that as the whole idea of online purchasing invades enterprises, many large companies are now comfortable procuring (technical difficulty) line without an online sales force.</p><p>So we have a telemarketing team and a digital sales team that are really having great, great success. And you're beginning to see a lot of that through the OnDemand world. So the transition for the sales force is really twofold. It's product to marketing and it's enterprise to telemarketing and digital.</p><p>KEVIN LIU: Got it. And just with respect to some of the initial integration efforts, obviously the restructuring cost ticks up more so in Q2 here. When do you expect to start to recognize some of the benefits of the integration efforts? In other words, when should we see operating expenses start to tick down?</p><p>DON MUIR: Kevin, I think we'd expect to see the benefits in the second half of the year. Obviously, when you do restructuring and you've got a 12-month to 18-month payback on a lot of these things, it's going to take some time. That being said, we do have some operational efficiencies that may glean some savings earlier on.</p><p>KEVIN LIU: Great. And then just lastly, you guys opted to pay down about $6 million of debt within the quarter. Should we assume that you will continue to look for opportunities to repay that much debt in the coming quarters? Or would you expect to try to conserve that cash for other purposes?</p><p>RORY COWAN: I think it's going to be sort of opportunistic here. It is a very good line. And if we find some other tuck-in acquisitions along the way, clearly I think that those may take precedence. But if we don't need the cash, there's no reason to be borrowing it.</p><p>KEVIN LIU: Great. Well, congrats on a stolid start to the year and look forward to more to come.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions.</p><p>RORY COWAN: Great. Well, look, everybody, thanks very much for your time this morning. I know it's a very busy earnings call morning, so if you have any questions, please track down Sara and she can pull Don and me in as needed. And again, thanks for participating this morning. Bye.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

With me today, as mentioned, is Charles Horn, our CFO, and Bryan Pearson, Head of our LoyaltyOne business, and that includes both the AIR MILES business in Canada, as well as the BrandLoyalty business headquartered out of the Netherlands. Charles will update you on the quarterly results, then Bryan will give you some color into the various businesses at LoyaltyOne, and I will wrap it up with the scorecard for Q1 results, as well as my outlook for the full-year 2016. Based on past comments, we are going to move with pace so we can have more time for questions at the end.</p><p>Take it away, Charles.</p><p>CHARLES HORN, CFO, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION: Thanks, Ed. Turning to slide 2, we will talk about the first-quarter results, and they were pretty much as we expected, with revenue up 5%, to $1.68 billion, and core EPS up 5%, to $3.84. It was a quarter with several positives but also a few negatives that tempered overall results. One of the negatives, foreign-exchange rates, reduced both revenue and core EPS by about 2 points for the first quarter. The good news is that FX rates seem to have stabilized, and the drag could drop to near zero in the back half of 2016.</p><p>Looking forward, we expect growth in each quarter to accelerate as 2016 progresses. Revenue growth of 5% in Q1 is expected to increase to 8% in Q2, and then double-digit growth in Q3 and Q4. Adjusted EBITDA and core EPS are expected to follow a similar trend. Now, why do we believe this? Putting aside improving foreign-exchange comparables, there were several reasons. First, gross yield compression at Card Services should lessen each quarter as we anniversary several program changes made last year. Second, loss rates are expected to drift downward from first-quarter highs. Third, BrandLoyalty has passed its most difficult comparable. If you remember, in the first quarter of 2015, the revenue was up over 100% on a constant-currency basis. Lastly, Epsilon's agency weakness should lessen, coupled with a record CRM backlog for second-half delivery.</p><p>During the quarter, we acquired 2 million shares under our repurchase program for approximately $414 million. The buy-back program remains our top capital allocation priority, and we expect it will be executed somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016. Essentially, we will look to deploy our free cash flow while maintaining the leverage ratio of less than 3 times.</p><p>With that, let's go to the next slide, and Bryan will walk you through the LoyaltyOne results.</p><p>BRYAN PEARSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF LOYALTYONE, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION: Thanks, Charles. LoyaltyOne had a better-than-expected quarter, as revenue decreased 2%, to $381 million, but adjusted EBITDA increased 10%, to $85 million, on a constant-currency basis. Breaking it down further, at AIR MILES, our revenue increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA increased a robust 11% on a constant-currency basis, and that was driven by a favorable issuance mix and prudent cost control. As expected, at BrandLoyalty, revenue was down 9% on a constant-currency basis, due to program timing differences.</p><p>Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a constant-currency basis, due to higher-margin programs that were driving a 300-basis-points expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins. AIR MILES issued increased a robust 5%, or 57 million miles, over the same quarter from last year. Issuance was particularly strong with our financial vertical, as we continue to convert [Vimo] MasterCard holders to the premium World Elite card that has a more compelling consumer proposition and a higher AIR MILES earn offer.</p><p>This strong growth was achieved despite economic uncertainty in Western Canada that is the result of the declining global oil prices that has been negatively impacting activity at our grocery partners, and also the suspension of point issuance on prescriptions in British Columbia. Looking ahead, we anticipate a 2% decline in issuance growth for the second quarter, due to reduced promotional activity and the one-time conversion of the [Sobe's] Legacy program that happened in 2015, which of course would not be repeated. As we've stated previously, quarterly results can vary based upon the timing of promotional activity, but our target remains a full-year issuance growth of mid-single digits.</p><p>AIR MILES redeemed increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with our AIR MILES cash program -- that instant reward option -- driving approximately half of the increase, as its liquidity feature resonates with collectors in the current macro environment. For the full year, we anticipate redemption growth to be in line with issuance growth. For the year, we anticipate full-year constant-currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for AIR MILES to be in the mid-single-digit range, as well.</p><p>Now, turning to BrandLoyalty, we anticipate a very strong second quarter, whereby revenue could be up as much is 50% on a constant-currency basis. On the North American expansion front, BrandLoyalty continues to increase its presence in Canada, with six promotions that have been planned for 2016. And this represents a significant increase in sales over last year. In addition, we launched our first pilot, in the US, late in the first quarter. We are pleased with the results to date and look forward to additional programs in this market. The full-year expectation for BrandLoyalty continues to be mid-teens growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as compared to 2015, on a constant-currency basis.</p><p>Lastly, let me update you on dotz and Precima. Starting with dotz, our Brazilian coalition program, where we continue to see steady growth in our collector base to over 18 million currently. In November of last year, dotz successfully launched the coalition program in Rio de Janeiro, with the Cencosud grocery banner called Prezunic as a key partner. Cencosud is the third-largest grocer in Brazil, and collector reception has been positive, with over 1 million collectors now enrolled and active in Rio. Precima, our data analytics unit, continues to fire on all cylinders, recently signing a deal with Morrison's -- one of the UK's top-four grocers -- where we will apply data intelligence and shopper insights to help Morrison's more effectively apply their customer-centric retailing approach.</p><p>In closing, LoyaltyOne achieved solid first-quarter results, with a positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the entire team on a great quarter, and look forward to their commitment to our valued clients and to LoyaltyOne. Awesome job, everyone.</p><p>I guess it's back to you, Charles.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: Thanks, Bryan. Let's turn to slide 4. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2%, to $493 million, and adjusted EBITDA decreased 22%, to $81 million, for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mixed, as three-fourths of the business -- digital and technology platforms -- grew a robust 8% during the quarter, while the remaining one-fourth -- agency -- underperformed, where the revenue declined by 23% versus the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $23 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher payroll costs, stacking levels increased in anticipation of revenue that has yet to occur.</p><p>Before we dive into the individual portions, you see that we have a new reporting format here. We felt that the old formats where we used to talk about database and data, and so forth, really is not reflective of the way we go to business these days. Specifically, as the broad portfolio of offline/online services Epsilon delivers are packaged or bundled omni-channel solutions, it just doesn't make sense for us to give it to you in that format. So what we've done is, we've put it together where we're going to highlight two categories that represent the underlying services and assets deployed to serve our clients.</p><p>The first category, digital and technology platforms, consists of businesses which is primarily derived from revenues tied to one of the many core data and/or technology platforms that Epsilon and Conversant manage. These platforms are used to house and manage data in real-time, to analyze and model data, and to automate the usage of that data across a variety of channels, whether it be through a loyalty program, within an e-mail communication, or an online message delivered on mobile or desktop devices. The remainder of the business, agency media and services, consists of services which are primarily focused on supporting the agency sector. Both media services deliver to agencies on behalf of their clients, as well as agency engagements in which Epsilon acts as the primary agency directly on behalf of its clients.</p><p>Now let's turn to the digital and technology portion of this segment, where quarterly revenue grew by $28 million year over year, or about 8%, mostly due to continued success of the cross-sell efforts and on-boarding of the strong CRM backlog within Conversant. The products offered within the CRM business continue to resonate with both new and existing clients, as 15 new contracts have already been signed this year versus 30 all of last year. The 2016 vintage thus far includes GNC, Brooks Brothers, Coach, and Sears, and is a great follow-up to last year's efforts. These clients, along with others, such as Walgreens, are connecting with real people as a result of combining anonymized first-party with third-party data and 80 billion daily online interactions, to develop a persistent consumer ID.</p><p>Moving on to agency media and services, revenue declined 23% from the first quarter of 2015. For Epsilon's traditional agency business, we saw broad-based weakness, especially in the telco, CPG, and retail verticals. In addition, the agency business at Conversant, which is the non-data-driven traditional display business, was down as large agencies push more programmatic buying through their internal trading platforms versus using third-party DSPs.</p><p>We don't know if this bubble is a bubble within agency or more structural, and needs to play out as the year progresses. If it's structural, we will have to be more aggressive on going after cost cuts to maintain our earnings. Although we will likely continue to see volatility within agency on a quarterly basis, it is a key part of the CMO selling process, which attracts more broad and less IT-centric relationships.</p><p>Now let's go over to the next slide and talk about Card Services. Card Services delivered strong financial results, achieving its 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue increased 17% for the first quarter of 2016, driven by a 27% increase in average receivables. Adjusted EBITDA net grew 9%, dampened slightly by the provision build. Importantly, principal loss rates were 5.2% for the quarter, 10 basis points better than our original guidance.</p><p>Focusing on the key drivers for our growth, credit sales increased a healthy 25%, driven by our proven ability to build customer loyalty for both our longstanding and newest brand partners, as well as favorable weather and an early Easter. Our core business, brand partners with us for four years or more, continues to contribute roughly half of our credit sales growth. Importantly, we continue to grow tender share, up over 200 basis points for the first quarter, by leveraging our large understanding of our brands, along with the deep data analytics we bring to bear.</p><p>Most of the tender share pickup is being driven by card members who have been engaged with their card for multiple years, not from new accounts. In other words, these are tenured card members with a proven spending and payment history, and they're demonstrating increased spend with the brands they love. This is a testament to the power of our customized marketing programs and the value they deliver to our longstanding partners. It is also a key differentiator and critical element in our ability to welcome new partners.</p><p>Looking at the remaining drivers of our performance, we talked about revenue grew 17%, driven by the strong AR growth. Importantly, we realized strong operating expense leverage, as we are able to drop our expense ratio by 70 bps for the quarter. As expected, gross yields experienced some compression, driven primarily by brand mix, accounting for acquired files, and lower late fees, as we have seen several declines for several months in our first-stage delinquency bucket. This pressure is predominantly in the first half of the year, and we expect yields to normalize as we anniversary these items.</p><p>Managing losses was key in the first quarter, and we exceeded guidance previously outlined. Losses, delinquency levels, and funding costs were all in line with both expectations and seasonal trends. During the quarter, we decided not to renew two card programs (technical difficulty) renewal at year end. The related receivables, net of the allowance for loan loss, have been reclassified to assets held for sale at March 31, 2016. Accordingly, $430 million has been removed from card receivables, and $15 million has been removed from the allowance for loan loss.</p><p>Our reserve for loan losses was 5.7% of reservable receivables at March 31, 2016, up from 5.5% at December 31, 2015. Reserve dollars dropped by $15 million from December 31, due to the reclassification previously discussed. In closing for Card Services, we delivered another stellar quarter, with all the key metrics outpacing the industry and consistent with our expectations. We are positioned for another record year, in line with our strategy of 20% plus credit sales and AR growth, leveraging both organic growth and new partnerships.</p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to Ed.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Great. Thanks, guys. Why don't we turn to first-quarter scorecard, and the goal, of course, is to have more green than yellows and reds. And right now, we are tracking with [the majority] being green. I would say, in terms of Q1, a couple of general comments. One is, as Charles mentioned, this was, obviously, our toughest quarter, and comp versus last year was very difficult. And, putting in a plus five top, plus five earnings was right on the money of what we wanted to do. And our view into the rest of the year looks solid. So it is good to get that behind us.</p><p>Also, you will find that it was a mixed bag, in terms of what had got us from A to B. But, at the end, the pluses outweighed the minuses and we got where we wanted to be. As we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year, things are accelerating nicely. We have good line of sight into the rest of the year. From a first-quarter perspective, consolidated, we came right in where we said, in terms of guidance, at about $1.7 billion top, at about $3.84 on earnings. That was -- that included getting hit on the FX side with about $26 million in top, at about $0.05 on earnings from FX, which, if it holds, will fortunately start to anniversary as we move into the back half.</p><p>We talked about the toughest comp of year is now behind us, and we were pretty active in the buyback, taking in a bunch of shares which we thought were pretty cheap. So, overall, consolidated, we got where we wanted to be, and remain on track for the year. And Card Services -- just the highlights, of course -- the portfolio continues to grow very quickly, with over 20% growth, revenue in the high teens. And then, obviously, due to the fact that we are growing so quickly, we need to obviously set up reserves, and that tends to be a damper on EBITDA. Nonetheless, that did grow 9%.</p><p>Yield gets the yellow. It was little over 200 basis points, due to multiple factors that we can talk about. Again, the good news there is that it is already beginning to burn away, and we expect less compression as each quarter goes by for the year. And we have pretty good visibility into that, as well -- so, more of a Q1 issue. The loss rate, we spent the first three months of the year here dealing with two questions that people were spooked about, the first being credit quality and the second being Canada going into a depression.</p><p>And what's interesting is, those are the two items that probably performed best during the quarter. Credit quality actually came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. We now expect it to drift downwards, as the year progresses, from a seasonally high Q1. And, similar to what we said three months ago, we will say the same thing now, we check with all our collectors and everyone else. There is zero pressure that we are seeing coming in that would suggest that there's any type of stress on the consumer at this point. So, we're just not seeing it, we did not see it before. And again, we are just normalizing the loss rates in the file, which right now we are tracking nicely to that.</p><p>I will emphasize the next point, which is tender share. That's often lost in all these discussions about growth, and are you growing too fast, too slowly? How are you growing? Is it good quality, bad quality, and all that other stuff. Tender share is up 200 basis points, which means if 30% of the sales at a retailer were on our card a year ago, now it is 32%. And that is not being moved by putting on a bunch of new accounts. And, in fact, what it essentially means is that when the retailer is growing 2%, 3%, we are growing 10%.</p><p>And so the first 10 points of portfolio growth are coming from a deeper penetration of that retailer sales base. And the next bullet point, to me, really brings it home, that 80% of this tender share gain, they are coming from the mature accounts. They're coming from accounts that have been with us for 20, 24 months or more, which means they've passed the peak loss point and they are very mature, and our ability to get in there and motivate incremental spend is what it is all about. And that's the data-driven targeted marketing.</p><p>And I think that's probably the most important takeaway, is that this is not coming from tossing on a whole bunch of new accounts or changing underwriting or anything like that. It is coming from driving those very long-term loyal customers to visit more often and spend a bit more on each visit. So, that continues to work out well. The pipeline, we expect another year of $2 billion in new vintages. We have a bunch that have been signed, have not been released, and they will be released over the next couple of quarters. So, the pipeline looks good.</p><p>And, as we move to Epsilon on the next page, that's where we run into -- probably, if you were to ask me about where the concern is for the year, it is certainly not on the credit side, it is certainly not on the Canadian side, it is certainly not on the technology and data and digital sides of Epsilon and Conversant. We are focused, however, on some weakness on the agency side, which is about one-quarter of Epsilon and Conversant. And what we saw there was a general pullback in a number of the verticals, and we're going to watch that carefully, as Charles said.</p><p>We don't know whether that's just a result of CMOs taking a breather in the first quarter, given the turmoil, or whether that's more structural. In any event, if it is structural, we will make sure that earnings will remain on track, which means we'd have to focus on the expense side. But we don't know right now, and we are not going to knee-jerk it at this point. On the other side of it, the digital and technology platform stuff, up 8%. That's three-quarters of Epsilon and Conversant, and we continue to see very, very strong take-up, in terms of the data-driven targeted display offerings from Conversant.</p><p>The number of wins that we are seeing right now are already half of what they were for the entire year last year. And then, from an expense perspective and flexibility perspective, our India office is up and running, and we are hopefully continuing to staff that up as the year progresses. And that will finally begin to move the needle on the expense side towards the latter part of the year.</p><p>LoyaltyOne, I think Bryan covered that. Obviously, BrandLoyalty is a very choppy business. It had, frankly, a little bit better Q1, from the EBITDA perspective, than we had initially talked about. But recall last year, Q1 was when revenue was up 100%. So it was then down in Q2 this year, it will be more of the reverse, where you will have a very strong Q2 for BrandLoyalty, and it is all driven by when the grocers have decided to put the programs on the calendar. Bryan also talked about the BrandLoyalty expansion into North America. Canada is doing quite well, and moving nicely towards our goal there. And the US, actually, we are beginning to make some nice inroads there, as well. So good news on that front.</p><p>Again, the concern on the AIR MILES side in Canada was that issuance would fall off as consumer spend was weak. What we found was the reverse, which was issuance was very strong, and specifically issuance in the financial services space, which had been lagging before, actually came back quite strongly. So it looks like Canada is still alive and kicking, and doing quite well. Revenue and EBITDA, plus 4%, plus 11%, frankly, on a constant-currency basis, was the best we've seen in years. And so it looks like the business up there is back in growth mode.</p><p>Overall, for those of you who have covered ADS for a number of years, it is a typical ADS quarter. You have got a bunch of things that went a little bit better than expected, you had some things that went worse than expected, and the end result is they even out, and we meet or we beat our guidance. And that's pretty much been our track record for the last 15 years. We expect that to be the case going forward, as well. If you look at it in the Cards group, the yields were little bit worse than we had anticipated, but losses were little bit better. And then at Epsilon, the digital and tech platforms remained on track.</p><p>We talked about agency and media was weak. That was offset by the fact, in LoyaltyOne, that AIR MILES was better, while BrandLoyalty was tracking. So, again, with us, you can pick and choose whatever data points you want, but at the end of the day, the pluses and minuses hopefully even out to get to a double-digit growth rate for the year. And as we turn to our full-year guidance, that's exactly what we are saying. It is very straightforward.</p><p>Now, with Q1 behind us, we have even a higher level of confidence in how the rest of the year is going to play out. And we feel very comfortable reiterating our full-year guidance of revenue of $7.1 billion, up 10%, and earnings of $16.75, up 11%. And the nice thing about it is the slowest quarter is behind this. We're going to ramp up to high-single digits in the second quarter, and then we will do double-digit top and bottom Q3, double-digit top and bottom in Q4, and that will give us a nice jump-off into 2017.</p><p>Visibility is quite strong. Q2 guidance revs around $1.6 billion, up 8%, and earnings also up about 8%. I think those are good numbers to start the acceleration. From a Card Services perspective, you will see the principal loss rate forecast that we gave a while ago. And, lo and behold, it seems to be playing out at that level, if not just a smidge better, which is good. We expect, for the year, Card Services to once again deliver double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, net of funding.</p><p>Yield compression, which I'm sure we will get some questions on, will lessen each quarter as the year progresses, so that we wind up at the end of the year with a very modest compression, which is how we want to take it into 2017. And then we said the pipeline is very robust, and that will get into a little bit about our decisions around who to renew, when to renew, at what levels will we renew clients, given that there's a certain amount of capital we want to put into the business, but we want to maintain a 20% plus growth rate in the file. And that means maybe our capital is better spent on other areas, and we don't renew certain folks.</p><p>So that's where we are on Epsilon. We talked about digital and tech platforms are three-quarters of the business. We expect that to continue clipping along in the high-single digits. The signings for the Conversant CRM vintage, if you recall, last year, was about 30 wins and a very strong vintage signing of 80-ish plus, once they fully spooled up. We expect at least that this year, if not a little bit better, which would be great.</p><p>And then the agency stuff, look, we are going to watch it, and we are going to see it is a people intensive business. It is at about one-quarter of Epsilon and Conversant. From what we are seeing, it looks soft, but it looks already like it is lessening, in terms of the softness, as we progress into Q2 and the rest of the year.</p><p>Okay, last slide, full year, LoyaltyOne, BrandLoyalty, Q2 is the big one for them. So expect a very, very strong double-digit rev in EBITDA. And then, in AIR MILES, we remain comfortable that issuance, which is the key metric there -- it is how we get paid -- is going to be up about 4% for the year, which will drive, on a constant-currency basis, low-single-digit revs and EBITDA full year, which again would fly in the face of the weakening consumer in Canada. Overall, as I mentioned, several moving pieces, but full year is shaping up nicely. We're seeing zero stress on the consumer side. We are not seeing weakness in Canada. So those two data points are consistent with last quarter and the quarter before that.</p><p>I just would talk a little bit about the model itself for Alliance. From 2007 through 2015, we produced annual growth rates of 15% and 18% for revenue and earnings per share, respectively, every single year. And for 2016 and 2017, as losses normalize, and with the huge growth in the file, we're setting aside reserves for future losses. What you're essentially doing is, you're knocking that growth rate down a bit, but you are still looking at low end double-digit growth rates in top and bottom. So this year, we are looking at 10% and 11%, and that includes [some drag] from FX.</p><p>And then, in 2018, if in fact we are right and these rates have stabilized, then there's no reason to doubt that it would snap right back to the prior model, and you'd have a re-acceleration in growth rates. So, if you look at long term for the Company, you are looking somewhere mid-teens to high teens, revs and core EPS. Then, when you are in a period of normalization and building reserves, you are probably looking at low end, top and bottom, double digit, and then you snap back mid-teens when that normalizes.</p><p>So, overall, not too shabby of a model. You will also find with us that we tend to have different levers and different businesses cycle up and down at different times. But, overall, the model holds together quite nicely. For guidance, on the last slide, we're keeping it the same. And we are not going to spend a lot of time going through the [nits and nats] of how we get there, but it looks pretty solid at plus 10%, plus 11%. And that puts our organic growth rate actually quite a bit above our 3 times GDP target.</p><p>We looked at cash flow, looks very nice, very strong this year, at about $1.4 billion. And, look, when it comes to FX and all that other stuff, we will adjust it when it becomes meaningful as the year plays out. But, again, we are not going to be tweaking everything every quarter. We are going to try to get this thing going on a consolidated basis.</p><p>So, that's all I had. Why don't we open it up for Q&amp;A? Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p><p>Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS, INC.: My first question is on the agency side of Epsilon. Charles, you mentioned that you are not sure if it is structural or not, in terms of the weakness there. And maybe Ed or Charles, you could talk about it a little bit more. Is that weakness specific to Epsilon? Or are others seeing similar weakness? Obviously adjusting for maybe one or two large clients that have unique issues?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: It is a good question. Don't know enough yet at this point. We do know -- I can only say what happened in our business, which was, across a number of our verticals, CPG and Telco and retail, it was interesting, we also have pulled back in Q1. It looks like it is beginning to trickle back in, as we start moving into Q2, but it still little bit soft.</p><p>So we don't want to call it yet, but it seemed like a lot of people just stepped on the brakes in Q1. So I just don't know what the others are seeing out there right now, Sanjay. But from us, it looks like Q1, people just pulled back. And then as we're looking at Q2, it looks like it is beginning to loosen up a little bit. And so if it continues to loosen up, we are not going to need to take any action. If it continues to stay soft like this, we are going to have to take some internal actions.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: And I assume you are assuming continued softness for the rest of year in your guidance?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: We are assuming, for the three-quarters of Epsilon and Conversant that's the tech and digital and everything else, we assume they're going to continue to be quite strong at about plus 8. And then on the agency side, to your point, we are assuming in our guidance that it will be soft, but not nearly as soft as Q1.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Got it. And than just second question, my final question. Just on those two portfolios that you chose -- or that are not renewing in card, could you just talk about how that unfolded? Why? And how tenured were those relationships?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, this gets. It is a good question, and we are at the point now where we've got the business growing, the files growing 25% a year, which is pretty much -- we don't want to drift much higher than that. But we are also finding that the pipeline -- the number of opportunities that are out there, as people shift their dollars to the data-driven targeted spend, frankly, there's a whole bunch of business out there. And there are times in the past where we've had some clients who have decided not to pour all their energy and efforts into driving tender share growth and card growth.</p><p>That usually comes with a change in management. Other times, it's a change in strategy. And normally, we've just said, that's fine, we will go with the flow. Right now, we are dealing with, how do we allocate our capital? And if we want to continue to grow the business, the file 20% plus of the year, how do we maintain the type of returns that we expect? And frankly, there are a couple of programs there that based upon -- how do we say it -- the comments being made about the dollars that folks are willing to put into it, and the direction of those businesses, it did not look like the best use of our capital.</p><p>And so we have reallocated that capital to a couple of wins that we think are -- I think more down the fairway for us. So it is a nice -- I'm trying to be a polite way of saying, there is going to be some times where the capital is better used elsewhere, and this is one of those times. We've just never been capital constrained, but we are at the point now where the growth rate in the file is pretty much at our max level.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: And how does it affect the growth assumption for that business? Does it?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It doesn't affect -- no, there's no effect at all. It's already been spoken for. And I know we had some -- already some questions about whether it was -- which client it was. And obviously, we haven't negotiated anything in terms of where we are going to put the file. But it is just FYI, it is not any client on the left coast. So that's all I can say on that one.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI: Okay, great. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Darrin Peller, Barclays.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks, guys. Let me just quickly follow-up on the Epsilon side. If you can give us a little more granularity, first into the strength of the tech and data side there? And I know Conversant, in the pipeline, looks strong still. But -- I guess I just want to make sure that's sustainable, in terms of, you're not seeing any of the same clients on the agency side pull back at all on the tech side. Obviously, the growth doesn't show that yet.</p><p>And then if you can give us a little more color on the levers that you have capable of pulling, from a cost standpoint, at Epsilon? And if it has to start next quarter, I guess how much room do we have? It just feels like an area that you've tried to cut costs in the past, and outsourced things to India, et cetera. So I'd love to just hear more color on how much room there is.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, right now, what we are seeing is the continuation of strong demand for the digital products at Conversant, specifically the SKU level, data driven targeted display offerings. Very strong. In general, the more core Epsilon, big loyalty and customer database builds are strong, and data offerings are strong. So all the heavy tech stuff demand continues to be strong. We expect that to continue for the rest of year.</p><p>On the agency side, look, we need to be very careful we don't knee-jerk this thing. If it is an air pocket, then great, and we are back in business. If it looks like it is softer than we expect, then it is a very project-intensive, people-intensive business. You would have to move quickly to make sure that revenues and expenses sync up. But what we're seeing right now is, the softness in Q1 is already lessening a bit as we move into Q2. So we're going to hold off knee-jerking this thing.</p><p>And if, in fact, Q2 comes in very soft on the agency side, we will still make our [nums] for the Company, from a guidance perspective, for sure. But we will have to take some expenses out, to make sure we make our nums for the year.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: Maybe I just missed it. But in terms of the 5%, what was your overall Epsilon outlook for the year now, in terms of organic growth, for the whole segment?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: What we talked about for Epsilon is mid-single-digit plus on top and bottom. I think we'll stay there.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: You're staying there now, okay. All right. Thanks. Let me just shift, and then I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the private label, on the card services side. I guess first on growth, do you agree -- co-branding, I know, is tougher now from a competitive standpoint. So just revisiting the addressable market, in terms of opportunities, obviously, given your divesting, I think this is the first time I remember hearing you guys divesting a couple of portfolios, based on better opportunities for probably more profitability elsewhere.</p><p>But either way, I guess just revisiting the addressable market would be helpful, given it seems like it is more private label focused than co-branding now. And then on that note, the yield compression is a combination of things, like you guys mentioned automated payments and new vintages, but also co-branding. With all of those things anniversarying and co-branding potentially moving lower now as a percentage of the mix, should the yield potentially rise in 2017? Or at least be stable?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I think the yield will be relatively stable in 2017, exactly to your point. As we are burning through these compression issues and the (technical difficulty) anniversary, and to your point exactly, a little less emphasis on the co-brand side, you won't have that large compression that you've seen the last couple of years of 100 basis points or so on the yield side. [It will be] significantly less than that.</p><p>And that has to do, again, with, we are looking to optimize the portfolio, which means that at this part of the cycle, you've got an awful lot of mouths to feed when it comes to co-brand. So that isn't quite as exciting to us at this point in the cycle. We've seen this play out before. So we are looking to optimize the files, continue the growth at 20% plus, and keep the compression much more modest on a go-forward basis. And based on the pipeline and what we are signing and what you will see released later this year, we feel pretty good with it.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: All right, that's helpful, guys. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Does that complete your question?</p><p>DARRIN PELLER: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Kevin McVeigh, Macquarie.</p><p>KEVIN MCVEIGH, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Great, thanks. Nice job, guys. In terms of -- Charles, the improvement in credit to 10 bps, what drove that? And how should we think about that over the course of the year? Still sticking with the [5.5%]? Or should we expect some improvement there, as well?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: What we gave guidance to is a [5.0] loss rate for the year. (multiple speakers) We came in a little bit better in Q1. I think you will see we could come in a little bit better in Q2 and Q3, could be up a little bit in Q4 compared to original guidance. But I would say we are right on track to hit the 5% for the year. In terms of [missing] -- doing better by 10 bps of the first quarter, some of its timing. But I would say for the year, we're tracking right to the [5.0] loss rate that we gave as guidance.</p><p>KEVIN MCVEIGH: Got it. And then as we think about the mix of private label versus co-brand, going forward, we are still in the range we talked about historically? Or more of a shift on the private-label side?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I would say we're still around 80/20, 80% private label, 20% co-brand. To Ed's point before, we're doing less co-brand. That's where most of the competition is, so we're focused more on private label. You know us. Private label is our secret sauce. That's where we have all the expertise. And so you will see more growth coming there, which, long-term, should benefit the yields, going back to Darrin's question before.</p><p>KEVIN MCVEIGH: Awesome. Thanks. I will get back in queue.</p><p>OPERATOR: Bob Napoli, William Blair.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY: Thank you, good morning. Hey, Ed and Charles, are the additional buybacks in your guidance? You bought back about 400 million. You said you had 500 million, and I think you expect to buy back closer to 800 million to 1 billion?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: So the second piece of our authorization is not considered, Bob. So the initial 500 million was considered. The second 500 million is not considered in guidance.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: Okay. Thank you. Then on the tender share improvement, the 80% from mature accounts, that is very helpful ago. But are you -- is that piece being driven by increasing credit lines for those individuals that are using the line? And obviously, since they're mature accounts, they -- I'm sure they are performing well, credit wise?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. We are not popping up lines. We've never had, really, an issue with an open to buy. I think, Charles, you may know better than I. But if we have a $500 balance, we may have an $800 line. So there is plenty of room on the open to buy, and we re-score all 40 million accounts every quarter. So it is not a credit line issue. It is more of if I have an 800 line and a 500 balance, and I'm growing it normally 5% a year, how do I get it to 7% or 8%?</p><p>And that's basically the whole tender share game, which is, how do I get her to make one more visit if they are not visiting the store itself? A lot of our tender share gains, or I'd say the bulk of it, is coming through online sales, where we reach out to her and make some type of compelling offer to her, and she will go online to buy it. And a lot of this is, to use the lingo, she's snacking online. Meaning that we're seeing a lot of incremental purchases that are relatively small in size, but they are happening very frequently.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: Great, thanks. And then just last question. On the agency business on the Epsilon business, is that -- have you lost -- is this just pullback by client? Have you lost some clients? Are you losing share of a client to another competitor or piece. So what's going on there? I don't think the industry has pulled back as much as we saw in your business in the first quarter. And who are you primarily competing with today in those sectors?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It is a good question. We don't -- one quarter doesn't a trend make, so it still up in the air, in terms of what exactly is [moving on]. All we did see was, we saw project business basically dry up in the first quarter that we had counted on. And as a result, the business we needed to close to make agency hit Q1 did not happen. Now, are those projects beginning to drift back in? It looks like they are slowly drifting back in. So that's all we know at this point.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: And who are you seeing as your -- by sector, agency versus tech, who would you point out as your two or three largest and toughest competitors?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: I think it is all over the board, in terms of when it is pure agency, you could have the big Madison Avenue players involved there. You could have some of the other digital smaller agencies involved there. But for the most part, what we do is, we like to link the agency as the tip of the arrow, to get in the door with the CMO to flow through to the big heavy-duty, high-visibility tech platforms that we build for them. The project-based stuff on the agency side, as you can tell, is the stuff that can jerk around quite a bit on a quarterly basis.</p><p>So that's what we are seeing. The big tech platforms continue to be built, and it is just these projects on the agency side that we just saw softness in Q1. So we just don't want to get out in front of this thing and start saying, my gosh, we've got long-term weakness in agency, when it could very well just be a one quarter phenomenon.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: So Bob, the only thing I would add is, it's not a case where we're losing clients. It's not a number of clients going away, it's just less spend. So in the first quarter, we really saw less spend going back to its point where on a project basis, CMOs cut their budgets with us for whatever reason.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: Great, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY, ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ed, I guess I want to ask a big pictures strategic question with regard to Epsilon. Is there -- as you think about agency, irrespective of the quarterly volatility in that business, is there still the same competitive strategic rationale for having agency as part of Epsilon as you might have thought there was five years ago? Has your thinking changed on that at all?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: No. I think it is absolutely critical that we have that skill set, because that's the skill set that can get in the door, have the conversation with the CMO. And that will then lead to the pull-through to the big client database work, the big loyalty platform builds, the big CRM business at Conversant. So no, it's -- I think the skill set there is critical, in order to pull through for the other parts of Epsilon. It is almost like even though it is a bit soft this quarter, my view is, if you take it away, what you're going to wind up with is, you are going to cut the head off the rest of the big tech pull-throughs at the rest of Epsilon, and the whole thing will eventually slow down.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: Okay. And is there -- with regard to, again, agency, is there a customer concentration issue, do you think, within that business? Is that part of the reason we see the volatility? And is there anything you can do about it if there is?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: It is part of it, Andrew. If you look, our biggest clients in Epsilon are all on the agency side of the business. So when they pull back on any project or maybe not supporting a particular offering, they can move the needle quickly. And being project-based, they can do volatility intra-quarter quite a bit for the year. You can pretty well estimate what they are going to do.</p><p>But they can basically open up the faucet or close it quite quickly, based upon what they're wanting to do with their marketing spend. And so what we saw in Q1 was, they basically closed the spigot. We think that they will open it up as the year progresses, so we are not sounding alarm bells. But it is big companies, big budgets, and they can flex it quite quickly.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: Okay. And then quickly, with regard to your outlook for what may be a loss rate plateau in 2018 and beyond. Can you dig a little bit into the rationale or the thought process that gives you confidence that we might see something that's pretty unprecedented, historically, in terms of stable charge-offs?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, if you look at it, it is a great question. The fact that, as we talked about, the bulk of our growth, the 10% in the core growth that we're seeing, is really coming from accounts that are very mature, have been well seasoned, well past the peak charge-out cycle, we are normalizing the loss rate. I think maybe two more stats might be helpful, which is look, we thought, before the Great Recession, our normalized loss rate was 6.5%. We are saying it is 5.5% now. Why is that? Why are we comfortable that's our long-term run rate?</p><p>And that's what we are normalizing towards. Probably a couple of interesting stats there. One is, with the new mix of co-brand, which carries a higher-scoring customer, as well as some of the higher-end type retailers that have joined us, we are attracting card holders that tend to skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum. So for example, if you were to compare all of our active accounts today versus 2007, the scores today, on average, are higher than they were in 2007, even with some of -- a lot of the accounts that we've added recently.</p><p>So from an active account basis, the average score is higher. Also, if you looked at it from a balance perspective, the average score per balance today is higher than it was in 2007. And so you put those two together, and that's how you get to, we are not going to normalize out at 6.5% -- we are going to normalize out of 5.5%. But look, it is not like we are trying to keep it lower. The fact is, you give up some yield by not being at a higher loss rate. So I'm not sure it is a strategy of ours to keep it at 5.5%. It's just the way the file is playing out right now.</p><p>ANDREW JEFFREY: Okay. Appreciate it, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ashish Sabadra, Deutsche Bank.</p><p>ASHISH SABADRA, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the agency weakness here. So the agency has (inaudible) worsened as well as core Epsilon. I'm just wondering if the 23% decline that you saw that was consistent across both those segments? And then Charles, you mentioned that there is intra-quarter volatility there, depending on the projects.</p><p>Is there something you can do strategically, going forward, to lower that volatility? Or is it just that as tech continues to grow faster, it will be a bigger portion of the revenues? I was just wondering, how should we think about the volatility coming down in the agency? Because it has been a volatile over the last several quarters now.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: You are right, Ashish, we are going to have grow the technology piece of the business quicker. That's just frankly where it's going to be. Agency, in a good year, is going to grow 3%. Technology, in a good year, is going to grow 10% plus. So from a mix standpoint, you will basically take some of the volatility away from it. If you look at the breakdown, it was weakness in both categories. We saw weakness in traditional agency for Epsilon, where we saw we weakness across many verticals. I couldn't pinpoint it to any one client, because it was broad-based.</p><p>On the Conversant side, on the traditional display, we definitely have seen fewer people trying to use their private exchange. You've got the big agencies trying to push the programmatic buying through their own trading platforms. So regardless of the quality of the impressions we can provide, they're trying to stuff it through their own system. And we just saw a general pull-back there. So that was a little bit unexpected. So I would say it was both sides of it. We do think we will get some stability as the year goes on, but there's really, going back to Ed's point, nothing in particularly we can point to, aside from it just seemed like there was soft spend in Q1.</p><p>ASHISH SABADRA: Okay. Just quickly, on the margins for the Epsilon business, you highlighted a couple of reasons for the margins being lower. But how should we think about margins, going forward? Technically, if agency tends to be a lower margin, tech was higher-margin business. And as tech is growing faster, you would expect the margins to go up, going forward. So just wanted to better understand, how should we think about the dynamics for Epsilon margins over the next several quarters, but also the longer-term?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: So the way you would look at is basically, you are right. Agency will grower slower. It's the lower EBITDA margin. Your technology will grow quicker. It's the highest EBITDA margin, so just from a pure mix standpoint, you should get some EBITDA margin expansion in this year and in the future. Clearly, we will have to look at the agency and play through it. Is this the short-term hiccup or air pocket, as Ed said before? Or is it a case where we have to structurally cut back on cost to get our margins back where they need to be? That's a little bit of the unknown at this point. But long-term, I would expect the margins to expand slightly, based on mix.</p><p>ASHISH SABADRA: Okay, that is very helpful. And one final question, on the gross [and compression]. So the late fees have been weighing on -- the lower late fees have been weighing on. Which is actually better, because it helps you -- or [it's reflective] of the better consumer environment. But just how should we think about that compression? How much visibility or how much confidence do you have that comes off in the second half and going into 2017? Thanks.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, we have very good visibility into this, as we go into the second half. A large chunk of it, probably half of it, relates to what I call consumer-friendly programs, which I probably should define. It basically means we looked at all of our practices and basically said, how do we continue to be the premier provider in the marketplace, the most customer friendly provider in the marketplace, as we continue to ramp up? And so there's a bunch of things that we put in place, as we went into the back half of last year.</p><p>So for example, it doesn't seem like a lot, but it does move the needle, in terms of if someone gets paid on the 15th of each month, but their bill is due on the 13th, that doesn't work out all that well sometimes. So what we have done is, we've given everyone the right to move their due date to later on in the month if they wanted to. And that -- again, it doesn't seem like much, but it actually does affect the late fees. And -- but at the same time, it also helps our OpEx, as you see with the leverage, because we have much lower talk time of people calling up saying, I need a couple more days. So you have that.</p><p>You have people who are calling in, where they used to be a fee if you are paying by the phone. We decided that wasn't best practices. We took that out, as well. And so we just took a number of things out of the system that frankly caused more grief than they added. We got a lot of it back in lower OpEx, in terms of talk time and everything else, and we have a much happier client and customer base. And so I think that's what it is. None of it was dictated by any regulatory authority.</p><p>It was something we proactively went out and just did. And we think taking the hit now for it, and seeing it anniversary in the back half, is probably the best thing to do. And hopefully that will pay dividends down the line.</p><p>ASHISH SABADRA: Thanks, Ed.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: One more? Okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: David Scharf, JMP Securities.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll apologize in advance, Ed, because it is a repeat of some that have been asked, but I just want a clarification. On the agency side, can you give us a sense for how much of the business for agency is so-called project-based? Versus, I guess, work that you would deem to be, while not an annuity, pretty reliable and recurring? Obviously, it is all based on CMO budgets. But is the vast majority of the business things that you would deem to be quarter-by-quarter project-based, where there isn't necessarily great visibility?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Definitely on the Epsilon side of it, that's the case, where it is -- you've got one or two year contracts, but it is project to project. On the Conversant side, it is going to more volume driven, because it's basically [site display]. Basically, you have got a lot of unpredictability when you get to agency. You can have a longer-term contract, but if it flexes based on volume, predicting what it's going to be on a quarter-to-quarter basis is just a difficult thing to do, David.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it. And when we think about the cost structure -- and obviously, the agency business has always had the least amount of operating leverage, given it's people intensive. But can you -- you've talked about, in the disclosure, that agency is roughly maybe one-quarter of the Epsilon segment, the traditional Aspen business plus Conversant. But from the standpoint of the percentage of fixed cost, how should we think about it?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: I would say your premise is right, David, it is a higher fixed cost business. It's more of a people driven business, so variability is pretty low. Part of the reason why you saw that our EBITDA was down quite a bit in the quarter was because the revenue was down on agency, and it doesn't flex very much. So you are right, I don't have an exact percentage. But you can assume it is our highest fixed cost business would be within agency. So if we see it's a structural issue in the market, then we'll have to go through and address the fixed cost. And we can do so pretty quickly if we need to.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Okay. And as we think about the description of a lessening degree of revenue decline in Q2, 23% is a big number. Should we be thinking 15% to 20% down, or more closer to 10%? Just trying to get a little bit of context.</p><p>CHARLES HORN: Yes, I don't think we are in a position to really say that at this point, as to what it is going to be. We do feel good that it's going to get better. We had a difficult comp in Q1, so we know it's going to be less than Q2. But at this stage, it would be very difficult for me to quantify it for Q2, Q3, Q4. As you know, David, we look at our guidance in total, not in any single piece. So just like in the first quarter we had over-performance in some areas and weakness in other, we would look for the year to be the same way. So it's very difficult for me to quantify that for you by quarter, David.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it. And as you referenced, a little bit of loosening in Q2, maybe some of the project-based expected or hoped for backlog is starting to materialize again. Are those coming specifically from those larger clients that may have pulled back unexpectedly? Or are these new wins, new contracts?</p><p>CHARLES HORN: I would say it is a little bit of both. You do have some new wins coming through, and we'll look to focus on that during the course of the year. And I do think you're going to see budgets open up a little bit with us as the year progresses, as well. As Ed said, before, we think there was a little bit of a knee-jerk reaction with CMOs in Q1. I know I was told over and over we heading into a recession quite quickly in the US. So I think many people listen to the rhetoric, and I think on project-based, discretionary-based marketing, I think pulled back a little bit in Q1.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it. And then just lastly, on the card side. It sounded like some pretty guarded or crafted language regarding the two programs that won't be renewed. But is it fair to say -- should we think of that as two retailer partners that perhaps are not willing to commit as much marketing push behind the product as before? Basically deemphasizing the store card as one of their marketing tools?</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p>DAVID SCHARF: Got it. Okay, thanks very much, guys.</p><p><person><nameText>ED HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Okay. All right, everyone, thank you. We will see you next quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference, and thank you for your participation. That does conclude the conference.

I'm here with Rob Norman and you've got Adam Smith there, I think.</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: Correct.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. So shall I kick off, Paul?</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: Yes. Just say a few words and I'll get into the financial section in a second.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. So welcome everybody to the trading statement for the first quarter of 2016. We're here in New York. Paul is in London as you know and we're going to kick off with Paul going through the results for the first quarter and then I'll come back with a little bit of commentary on the strategy and the background.</p><p>And we've got Adam and Rob here principally because they've just published GroupM's Interaction Report which deals with a number of major opportunities and issues. We thought it would be useful to have both Adam and Rob available for any questions, particularly obviously in the media investment management area.</p><p>So Paul, do you want to kick off with the presentation?</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: Yes. Okay. So good morning here in London. This is being webcast. So I'm moving now to slide 4 where we talk about the first quarter 2016 highlights. Again, just to remind people, this is a revenue and balance sheet update, not the full P&amp;L report.</p><p>So reported billings were up 8.3%, just under GBP12b and up 6.7% on a constant currency basis.</p><p>Revenue growth was 10.5%. The like-for-like growth is 5.1%. 3.9% of the growth coming from acquisitions and 1.5% coming from positive benefits from currency.</p><p>Net sales growth of 8.1%. On a reported basis the like-for-like growth of 3.2%. 3.5% coming from acquisitions and 1.4% coming from currency.</p><p>Revenue, net sales and profit in the first quarter were well above budget and ahead of last year. And at constant current, revenue net sales growth in all regions and all business sectors.</p><p>Net new business billings of $1.8b in the first quarter and it continued to lead the net new business league tables year to date.</p><p>So in terms of taking the financials, starting at the like-for-like growth, and let me just talk about the revenue numbers first.</p><p>So like-for-like revenue numbers, growth of 5.1%. Acquisitions adding 3.9% and constant currency therefore rates of revenue growth of 9%. Foreign exchange was a benefit to the Group in translation, so added 1.5%. Therefore, the reported sterling numbers were revenue growth of 10.5%.</p><p>If we were a dollar-reporting company, our reported revenues would have been growing at 4.6%. If we were a euro-reporting company, our reported revenue growth would have been 6.3%. And if we were a yen-reporting company, our reported revenue growth would have been 0.9%.</p><p>And similarly on the right hand side of the chart you can see exactly the same analysis done on the net sales basis.</p><p>So turning now to the revenues and net sales by sector. So overall, revenues of GBP3.076b, up 10.5% on a reported basis. And net sales of GBP2.616b, up 8.1% on a reported basis.</p><p>I will focus on and concentrate on the net sales numbers. And turning now to advertising, media investment management, which represents 42.9% of the Group of net sales of GBP1.122b, up 3.4% on a like-for-like basis, which compared -- and in all cases this is the same story -- to the full year numbers of 2015.</p><p>So in 2015, for example, the advertising, media investment management growth on a like-for-like basis was 3.8%. Currently in the first quarter we're at 3.4%.</p><p>In data investment management, with GBP433m of net sales, representing 16.5% of the Group. Revenues are basically -- net sales are basically flat consistent with last year where we grew at 0.3% in 2015.</p><p>Public relations and public affairs, which has GBP234m of net sales, representing 9% for the Group with net sales like-for-like growth of 2.3% compared to last year's full year growth of 3.4% on the same basis.</p><p>The branding, identity, healthcare and specialist communications businesses representing 31.6% of the Group, or GBP827m of net sales, growing on a like-for-like basis in the first quarter by 5.2%. Last year growing at 4.2%. We've had a pick up in the rate of digital revenue growth of around 8.3% in the first quarter which compared to a year ago, we were running at around 7%.</p><p>So turning now to advertising, media investment management for some comments. So it was the strongest like-for-like revenue growth of the sectors at 7.9% with net sales growth of 3.4%.</p><p>Advertising grew in North America and Asia Pacific, but remained challenged in mature markets, particularly Western Continental Europe. J Walter Thompson Company performed well in North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Grey was up strongly in North America and performed well in the UK and Asia.</p><p>Media investment management remained strong with constant currency revenue and net sales growth. And even a stronger net sales growth in North America and Latin America.</p><p>Advertising acquisition of 3yz in Brazil, ArcTouch in the USA and Vinyl-l in South Korea were completed during the quarter.</p><p>Secondly, turning now to data investment management. Constant currency net sales were up 5%, driven by the acquisition of IBOPE last year in Latin America. But on a like-for-like basis, net sales were flat.</p><p>Western Continental Europe, Latin America and Africa and Middle East showed like-for-like revenues and net sales up strongly. But North America, UK and Asia Pacific were more difficult.</p><p>Kantar Media, Kantar Retail, Kantar Health, Kantar Worldpanel, Kantar Indian Market Research Bureau and The Futures Group performed strongly.</p><p>In the quarter, there was acquisitions of Analytics Quotient in India and Millward Brown Denmark ApS was at step up -- sorry was acquired. And as a step up in TNS ICAP in Greece.</p><p>Next, moving to the public relations and public affairs business. That had like-for-like revenue and net sales growth up 2.3%. All regions except North America were up with particularly strong growth in the UK.</p><p>Also, strong performances from Cohn &amp; Wolfe, Finsbury, Hering Schuppener in Germany, Ogilvy Government Relations in the USA and Ogilvy Public Relations and Buchanan in the UK.</p><p>Acquisitions in the quarter include Acertys in Canada, Effect PR in Turkey, Maquina in Brazil and TSE Consulting in Switzerland.</p><p>The fourth discipline, the branding, identity, healthcare and specialist communications businesses had constant currency revenues up 10%. Obviously where the bulk of our acquisitions had been directed. And like-for-like growth of 4.7%. The strongest constant currency net sales growth of the Group of 10.9% and like-for-like was up 5.2%.</p><p>Growth in all group businesses in this sector except healthcare. Particularly strong growth in direct, digital and interactive. Especially communications.</p><p>In the quarter, a branding and identity acquisition in Holland was completed. Healthcare acquisitions of CMI, The Lathe was completed. Viscira in the USA and sports marketing investment in Courtside Ventures was also completed this quarter in the USA.</p><p>Turning now to the direct, digital and interactive sector. This cuts across all the four sectors. But we've pulled this out to give you some indication of how we're doing.</p><p>So as at March 31, the revenues of this discipline were categorized at $1.7b, over 38% of the total revenue. This is up from $1.5b, or 37% respectively a year ago.</p><p>The growth was up 13.6% in constant currency and up 8.3% like for like. And the number of people working in the Group in this subsector is now almost 34% of headcount, approximately 44,000 staff members.</p><p>There were acquisitions completed in the quarter. In Mexico Cacto, Conrad Caine in Germany, KKCreate in the USA, Potato in the UK, investments in Mitu in the USA and Latin America and Imagine Entertainment in the USA.</p><p>I also would add that in terms of the 8.3% growth, it was very evenly split across all the regions. So USA, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America all strong -- saw strong digital, direct and interactive growth across the regions.</p><p>Turning now to the revenues by net sales by geography, and following the same pattern as we did before. So overall, revenues were GBP3.076b, up 10.5% as you'll recall and net sales of GBP2.6b, up 8.1% on a reported basis.</p><p>Turning to North America which had revenues of GBP1.19b and net sales of GBP1.019b, representing 39% of the Group grew on a like-for-like net sales basis of 3.9% compared to 4.1% in the full year 2015.</p><p>United Kingdom had net sales of GBP375m, representing 14.3% of the Group and had like-for-like net sales growth of 3.2% compared to 2.9% for the full year 2015.</p><p>Western Continental Europe had net sales of GBP508m representing 19.4% of the Group with growth in like-for-like net sales of 2.3% compared to 2.5% on a full year basis 2015.</p><p>And Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe, which had GBP714m of net sales, representing 27.3% of the Group this quarter had like-for-like net sales growth of 3%, consistent with last year's full year growth of 3%.</p><p>And coming now to give you a bit more color about the revenue and net sales trends. I think as we've mentioned before, the quarterly growths are somewhat impacted by the previous year's quarter, whether it was strong or weak. And we found it useful, if not more helpful, in terms of looking at the two-year combined cumulative revenue and net sales performance.</p><p>So, just for example here, to take the revenue line, if you were to add the quarter one growth in 2015 of 5.2% to the quarter one 2016 revenue growth of 5.1%, you come to the two-year cumulative of 10.3%. And we have done that over the last eight or nine quarters. And you can see a consistent pattern on the two-year cumulative growth on both revenues and net sales. It shows, I think, a better indication of how we're trending.</p><p>And when we compare this on slide 14 to our sales, which again only our sales are reporting on a revenue basis so we can't compare on a net sales basis to the competition, our 10.3% cumulative two-year growth was very consistent. And leads top end of the range versus our competition, which you can see here on slide 14 in detail.</p><p>Turning now to the revenues by geography. So we've broken out nine sub-regions of the revenue. Overall the Group was growing at 5.1%. We saw growth in eight of those regions in revenues. Mature markets are growing at 5.7%, the faster-growth markets at 3.4%.</p><p>Even the Central and Eastern Europe market that was down, it was really driven down by Russia, which was weak. But Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania were strong.</p><p>And in Asia Pacific, you'll see later, we were down in China, but up quite strongly in certain markets including Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines.</p><p>So overall, we are growing in all eight of the nine sub-regions on revenue. And compared to last year, it's a very consistent pattern. So last year, as you recall, revenue growth for the Group was 5.3%.</p><p>Looking at the same on slide 16, on net sales basis. Again, basically eight of the regions are growing. We're flat in Central and Eastern Europe. We see good positive growth in North America and Latin America actually at the same rate of 3.9%.</p><p>Mature markets are still slightly stronger at 3.3% overall net sales growth in the quarter versus the faster-growth markets of 3%. And overall, the Group is growing at 3.2%. Very similar to last year's growth of 3.2% as we mentioned.</p><p>Turning now to a bit more color on the six major markets for the Group. Again, we list both the revenue growth and the net sales growth both for the full year numbers in 2014 and 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.</p><p>So you can see there, consistent growth coming through in the United States, when you look at the revenue lines. Between 7% and 9% for the net sales lines.</p><p>Again, the same story for the UK. A consistent steady growth on either revenues or net sales.</p><p>China is somewhat challenged in the first quarter, particularly against the strong quarter one 2015 of 7% net sales growth. And when we look out at the rest of the year, so the first quarter revenues are basically plus 0.4% and net sales are down 1.7%. When we look to the balance of the year for China, for the operating companies, we're expecting revenue growth overall in the remaining nine months of around 4.5% and net sales growth in the balance of the year in China of just under 3%. So a tough start against a tough quarter in 2015. But looks to be coming good as the year progresses in China.</p><p>In Germany, again you can see consistent, steady growth of between 3% and 4% of net sales.</p><p>In Australia, New Zealand, this is the last quarter which we just report our old -- our own businesses. Again, going from quarter two, we'll be reporting on the combined STWA WPP businesses collectively. So in the first quarter, growing net sales at 3.1% and revenues at 3.5%.</p><p>And France, the first time for a while, is turning positive where we've just appointed a country manager. Revenue growth of 2.1% and net sales growth of 1.2%.</p><p>So turning now to BRIC markets, which represented 11% of revenues for the Group. You can see there the issues that we are seeing in the four BRIC countries. So China, we talked about. Having a better rest of the year, hopefully.</p><p>India, very strong on net sales. 10%, 10% and 11%, very consistent, very solid growth.</p><p>Growth in Brazil is challenging. And although we are down in Brazil around 5%, consistent with the competition, and what we see elsewhere we're strongly up in Mexico and Argentina, hence our growth in Latin America.</p><p>In Russia, it's no great surprise. It was down last year. It remains down in the first quarter at the moment.</p><p>So, in summary, North America saw constant currency net sales growth of 5.8%. It was the region with the stronger like-for-like growth at 3.9%. Advertising, media investment management, direct, digital and interactive performed well.</p><p>In the UK region, with the second strongest constant currency net sales growth at 7.1% and the second strongest like-for-like growth of 3.2%, advertising, media investment management, public relations, public affairs, branding and identity and specialist communications performed strongly.</p><p>In Western Continental Europe, the constant currency net sales growth of 6.5%, but like-for-like growth of 2.3%. All markets except Italy. Again a very tough comp for Italy, 9% growth in quarter one 2015. It was slightly down this year in the first quarter.</p><p>Difficult markets, but in Holland, Norway and Greece in the first quarter also with Germany, Scandinavia, Turkey particularly strong actually, around 20% growth, and Ireland all growing well above average.</p><p>In Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, the region with the strongest constant currency net sales growth of 7.9%, saw like-for-like growth of 3%. Again, very consistent with last year's performance.</p><p>So banding the countries, the top 20 countries by revenue, again, no great surprises in terms of we saw good strength coming through Argentina, which has been consistent, partly inflation driven I must add. Good growth in Indonesia and Turkey, very strong actually. Denmark and Mexico were strong. And then in some of the major markets, USA, in the 5% to 10% bracket was good.</p><p>And then in the 5% and less, you saw a number of markets. I would call out India which had low revenue growth of 4% but very strong net sales growth of 11%. A number of markets where challenged there, but also a number in the European markets which are modestly growing in that band as well.</p><p>Turning on the same analysis, by category. Really not a lot to add. It's really further penetration with existing clients in these categories that have assisted us in certainly the media and entertainment category and in the computing category, as opposed to anything else.</p><p>Obviously the major categories, such as automotive and personal care and drugs are in a 0% to 5% band as we show here.</p><p>In terms of currency, currency movements accounted for a plus 1.5% increase in reported revenues and just under that in net sales reflecting the weakness of the pound against the dollar. Basically 5% weaker and the euro basically 4% weaker. Partly offset by the strength against most of our markets, particularly Brazil Reais, where the pound was strengthened by nearly 30% and the South African rand also where the pound has strengthened by almost 30%.</p><p>If we were to plot out what we expect the current foreign exchange rate to mean for the Group in 2016, and all I can say is that we always get the direction right but the actual quantum is very difficult to predict. Obviously it's subject to what sterling will do in the next nine months.</p><p>The last year overall we were basically down just over 1% translation impact. The first quarter, as you've seen, we're up basically 1.4%, 1.5%. We're expecting, if sterling remains where we are today, a positive translation benefit for the rest of the year, resulting in expected foreign exchange benefits to reported revenue and profits around 3% to 4% for the year.</p><p>I think that's slightly higher than I indicated back in February when I think it was closer to 3%. So midway between the 3% to 4% range currently, as we ran it I think a couple of days ago.</p><p>In terms of trade estimates of major new business wins, a number we had reported in February to you. So the MediaCom, global win at Sony PlayStation and the Maxus win at Jet.com in the USA, we had reported previously.</p><p>Since then, since February, we have picked up the Wendy's business in the USA, their creative work and other creative assignments over the media assignments in Europe as well as you can see here, listed out.</p><p>In terms of losses, a small number of losses. Significant, Procter &amp; Gamble. We did lose one of the brands there on a global basis to Publicis.</p><p>On the Westpac business, it really was a switch between MediaCom and GroupM in Australia. So we have retained the business, purely moving it from MediaCom up to GroupM.</p><p>In terms of our own estimates of net new business wins, it's quite strong at GBP1.8b compared to GBP1b first quarter last year which was a bit light, given that last year we did win GBP8.6b overall.</p><p>I think pleasingly, when I look at what is particularly strong compared to a year ago, the creative wins at GBP925m compared to around GBP577m we reported a year ago first quarter.</p><p>In terms of movement since April 1, again it's been a little bit of a switch. So Hayworth which is an associate which reports into GroupM, they have moved, or let's say the target business has moved from Hayworth up to GroupM which is the main movement in this period.</p><p>And also MEC have won more work in Australia for Mitsubishi.</p><p>So in terms of where we came out as a result of the 44 largest switches and moves that occurred throughout 2015. It's a chart we have shown before. But the retentions, as you saw and as you know, were very strong as were the new business successes for ourselves, almost GBP2b.</p><p>And we have there for information what the RECMA reported for all the other competitors with some adjustments since the end of the year resulting in our win of Sony and the Publicis loss of Walmart.</p><p>So turning now to average net debt. In the first three months it was up GBP767m to just under GBP3.7b compared to GBP2.9b a year ago. This is really driven by the cash outflow that we incurred last year of around GBP600m where the acquisition spend, if you recall, was very strong.</p><p>In the first quarter, again as you can see in the detail, basically we've done approximately 26 deals already spending around GBP152m including a modest amount of earn-outs in this quarter compared to only GBP22m last year.</p><p>And likewise, we have scaled back the speed at which we've been buying shares compared to last year, where we bought GBP156m in the first quarter. This year, we bought GBP62m. I think principally because the number of acquisitions we saw in the pipeline meant the allocation needed to be different in the first quarter/the first half.</p><p>So the net debt as at March 31 was up GBP700m at GBP4.1b compared to GBP3.4b a year ago at constant exchange rates reflecting the incremental spend on share buybacks and acquisitions in the last 12 months. More than offsetting the working capital improvements that we've seen certainly in the last two months coming through for the Group.</p><p>So the average net debt to headline EBITDA range, we remain comfortably within our target. And again, just to remind people, our target is to remain within the 1.5 to 2 times net debt to headline EBITDA ratio.</p><p>So, as I've mentioned, there were 26 acquisitions in the quarter. Three have been completed subsequently. Those are in the red. And again, as you can see here visually, the vast majority are in the quantitative and digital and the fast growth markets combined.</p><p>So in terms of the use of the free cash flow, what our targets are and how we're trending against them. So we have on the right hand side, the full-year 2015 spend on acquisitions, which I mentioned were GBP649m. This year to date GBP144m on new acquisitions. Our target remains the GBP300m to GBP400m to be spent on acquisitions.</p><p>Share buy-backs. Again, the target remains the 2% to 3%. And we've been a lighter touch in the first quarter, about 0.3% of shares bought back compared to 0.8% a year ago.</p><p>Our payout ratio, we're still targeting a 50% payout ratio. It is possible and likely it will be achieved in 2016 compared to the 47.7% payout ratio we paid out in 2015.</p><p>So overall, comparing the returns to shareholders or distribution to shareholders since 2004, you can look at the escalating graph. And we're paying approximately, on a cumulative basis, between 2004 and 2015 around 62% through a combination of share buybacks and dividends.</p><p>And with that, I'd like to hand over to Martin. I just remind you Martin, I will have to control the slides, unfortunately, from London. So just give me the nod when you want to turn the pages.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. So let's move to 33. As usual, we try to give you a view on the environment both at a macro and a micro level. Obviously GDP top line growth for the world is around 3% to 3.5% depending on real or nominal. Very little inflation. And if anything, estimates have come down a bit in the last few months, the World Bank, IMF projections. But there is a strengthening and recovery in the US, or a consistent recovery. Some believe a little bit patchy, but we've seen obviously the growth of our business in the US and the growth of market share.</p><p>The UK and the Eurozone also improving and despite Brexit. A number of journalists this morning have been asking the impact of Brexit on ad spending in the UK. It doesn't seem to have had much of an impact within the first quarter. We'll have to see how it pans out. Probably the impact has been more on other investment spending, more capital spending in terms of delay.</p><p>And the Western Continental Europe, Eurozone has improved. Germany continues to be pretty strong. Italy, some mild signs of recovery generally. And the same for Spain. And despite the political issues there.</p><p>And France, we're seeing a little bit of improvement and improvement of psychology there.</p><p>There is, however, the overhang from deficit management and the reversal -- the potential reversal of easing and that's an issue. Debt levels in the US and the UK and in the EU, as well as probably Japan.</p><p>Obviously, from a political point of view, there's great concern about migration crisis and the terrible acts of terrorism that we've seen, particularly in Europe. Continued concerns about Russia and the Ukraine, although that does seem perhaps to be easing a little bit. And of course, the general situation in the Middle East and Syria and oil supply politics and the impact on the USA energy industry on the banks and indeed the impact on the oil-producing nations, the weakening of the oil-producing nations.</p><p>Traditional media continues to be under pressure. We've seen some impact on traditional legacy newspaper and magazine spending on both sides of the Atlantic. And new entrants are experimenting in the agency space.</p><p>There are opportunities, however, in Indonesia. The Next Eleven, the CIVETs, the MISTs Next Eleven including Iran in Jim O'Neill's original definition, offer interesting opportunities.</p><p>So Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Egypt, Nigeria, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Argentina and most post-[MAP3], Argentina all offer opportunities. And we're already established in Cuba. And obviously there is the potential of Iran, although that's proving I think to be a little bit more difficult than people anticipated in terms of the banking restrictions and indeed some of the licenses that are required.</p><p>On a micro basis, we do see a low growth environment, low inflation, very little pricing power for our clients. A number of clients in coming out with their results for the first quarter have mentioned lack of pricing power. And that results in a focus, quite understandably, on costs.</p><p>If you're running a legacy business, or attempting to run it, you have disruptors at one end of the spectrum, zero based budgeters at the other and activist shareholders who seem to be focused on the short term, even if they indicate they're looking at the long term.</p><p>There's a lack of confidence, which reduces investment in the business and favors buybacks and dividends. You will have seen the graph which I'll come back to, the S&amp;P 500, which shows quite clearly that since the Lehman, in 2008, buybacks and dividends have been rising as a proportion of retained profits to the extent that they now, on a fairly consistent basis, exceed retained earnings, which implies the S&amp;P 500, if you took it as one company, would be shrinking.</p><p>However, clients are focused on opportunities in faster growth markets despite the fact that they have slowed a bit and on following consumers into new media. You saw the Facebook statistics yesterday, advertising being up 58%. I got -- received from Facebook our spending with them in the first quarter of this year. That's up 68%, interestingly.</p><p>There is growing importance of what we call a horizontality, which is integration. We're seeing that on a competitive basis too. But there is a difference between ourselves and indeed our competition. Some of our competition believe more in the vertical brand and less in integration. Some believe in integration rather than the vertical brands. I think we believe in both.</p><p>We believe in maintaining those vertical brands but at the same time trying to encourage as much integration as possible. I think the key issue is the speed with which this is done.</p><p>This is the horizontality process, we think, takes time. We've been at it for a really significant period of time. We think we get tremendous advantages of it as the new business record clearly demonstrates. But it's not something that you can rush in a transformation process.</p><p>Also, areas of shopper marketing are critically important. I think what we've seen in the so-called media tsunami, the application of technology and the sort of things that we're doing with AppNexus and Xaxis, in data the sort of things we're doing with comScore and last but not least, content, with [Vice], Refinery29, Fullscreen and Imagine Entertainment. All these things are good examples -- and Media Rights Capital -- are good examples of what we're doing with content, and providing differentiation.</p><p>So the business, instead of being differentiated solely -- agencies being differentiated solely on talent or on price, increasingly being looked at in terms of how they interpret and apply technology and data and content.</p><p>Having said that, efficiency and effectiveness is still key. And there is continued pressure on pricing and payment terms. And there's pressure, obviously, at the same time for continuous improvement. And from new entrants in the ad tech and marketing space.</p><p>And as I say, on the media tsunami, we came out as clear winners. AppNet winners and there are losers as well. And we are increasing our market share, particularly in the United States.</p><p>And interestingly, I'll come onto this in a minute, I think one of the most interesting things going on in the industry is the emergence of a new agency convergence model, which, as I said, I'll come into in a bit more detail.</p><p>Slide 34, please Paul. We compare there WPP's revenue growth. Those are the blocks on a quarterly basis with nominal GDP growth. We take the Goldman figures for nominal GDP growth and we correct it for what we think is the -- or what is the nominal WPP GDP, if you like.</p><p>And you can see that the two lines converge historically -- diverge historically. And that was because although we are very well represented, in fact we have the strongest businesses, for example, in Asia Pacific and Latin America in terms of scale, we're under-indexed against the world GDP. And, therefore, when those markets were growing faster, there was a greater deviation between what we call the WPP GDP, the blue line, and the orange line which is the worldwide, the actual GDP. That has narrowed. That difference has narrowed as the fast growth markets have slowed and the mature markets of the US and Western Europe in particular, have started to accelerate.</p><p>And you can see it pretty much -- our revenues remarkably do follow pretty much GDP, which is what you'd expect. Interestingly for 2016, there is a little bit of a divergence between there. And we haven't got the Business Council's estimate of GDP yet for this year, but we've taken the IMF. And you can see there's a bit of a divergence. And that's largely due to these are dollar-denominated figures and there's a variation obviously because of the inflation rate. But also because of the strength of the dollar.</p><p>But by and large, what we're expecting this year is GDP growth, real and nominal, in the 3% to 4% range, 3%, 3.5%, 3% to 4% range. And that, from an advertising point of view, should be buoyed by the 100 basis points or 1% that we usually get from the maxi-quadrennial events of Rio 2016 this year, of the Euro Football Championships which will start shortly and, of course, the impact of the US presidential election, which does tighten up media markets and make markets stronger. And we can talk a little bit about that if people want.</p><p>Can we turn to 35, please? This is the S&amp;P slide that I mentioned before. If you think of the S&amp;P 500 as being one company, you can see that coming out of Lehman -- this is starting Q2 of 2009, so Lehman was Q3 of 2008. The S&amp;P 500 were distributing effectively about 60% of their retained earnings in buybacks and dividends.</p><p>That started to rise quite significantly, reflecting the willingness of companies to distribute earnings back to shareholders and touched -- almost touched 100% in Q1 of 2014. And you can see in Q1 of 2015 and Q3 and Q4 of 2015, started to exceed, having been touching or getting close to 100%, exceeded in Q3 and Q4.</p><p>So, effectively, the S&amp;P 500 is shrinking and companies are indicating they're passing back to shareholders more than their retained earnings. In WPP's case, as Paul pointed out, the last 10 years we've distributed about 60%, a little over 60% of our earnings, retained earnings, in dividends and buybacks. And we think that's the right balance to maintain a long-term strategy.</p><p>And talking of long-term strategy, on 36, we just highlight. This is a graph that has not been published but will be published in June with the FT's supplement on the top 100 global brands.</p><p>And what we've done here is just assumed that over the last 10 years, including the survey that will come out in June of this year, if we took the top 10 brands every year, under the brand valuation index that Millward Brown, BrandZ do, if we invested equally in those companies, we would outperform the MSCI by something like about 450%.</p><p>And the -- that's a real proxy for these brands, because they're global brands, the World Index. But if you just took the S&amp;P 500 index, which obviously has a big constituency of overseas earnings but is American based companies, it outperformed by about two-thirds, about 70%.</p><p>There's a strong correlation, it seems, between those companies that invest in brands and build their top line growth and total shareholder return in terms of share price appreciation.</p><p>On slide 37, I just touch on this new model. I think it's interesting that one of our French competitors, and I've called it the Bollore model, that's on Bollate's Investissements company, a separately-quoted company which main family investment vehicle effectively controls Vivendi and Havas. And Vivendi of course controls, or has an effective controlling interest in a telecoms platform, network in Italy, Telecom Italia.</p><p>It has media ownership with Canal+ and now the premium channels at Mediaset in Italy, controls content, through Universal, Universal Music and is making investments or trying to make investments, or re-enter the gaming market with Gameloft and Ubisoft. And of course has agency services.</p><p>So for the first time, we're seeing the emergence of a competitive model that combines telecommunications, media ownership, content and agency services.</p><p>Our strategy is just, again, highlighted on slide 38. We've moved horizontality to the top of the four strategic objectives. Horizontality, just to remind you, is ensuring our people work together through client teams and the country and sub-regional managers, country managers, for the benefit of clients.</p><p>Our clients, we believe, want the best people working on their business. They don't really care or worry too much where they come from as long as they're getting the best possible thinking, implementation and distribution.</p><p>And that's key, we think, to developing the business. We care, maybe, about the verticals and the balance between working together and those verticals. But the clients really do want the best people.</p><p>The second objective remains faster growth markets. 40% to 45% of our business is the objective. We're already really in that territory. We're fast moving towards 40%. But currently around 30%, 31% as a whole. But we will get there eventually.</p><p>But much faster is in the new media area where we're already up close to 40%. The target is 45%. So we anticipated being in that range within a year or so.</p><p>And then finally, data investment management and the so-called quantitative disciplines to be one-half of our business, already achieved that, but with that focus, as I mentioned before on technology, data and content.</p><p>On 39, we just emphasize the horizontality objective. We now have 45 client leaders covering GBP7b out of GBP20b of our revenue, about 38,000 people. That's the first objective.</p><p>The second one, or just reinforcing that, the next slide on slide 40 emphasizes the structure that we have. So you have the verticals, in the case of our advertising groups, J Walter Thompson, Ogilvy, Y&amp;R Group and Grey. There are four that operate separately as separate verticals.</p><p>GroupM, which is the sub-holding company for our media investment management business, with billings last year of $73b. Kantar, approximately a quarter of our business. Similarly sized in terms of revenues to GroupM.</p><p>H+K Strategies, one of our public relations operations.</p><p>The BtoD Group, which is our branding and identity operations, brand union, pitch, land or set.</p><p>GroupH, which is our sub-holding company for our healthcare.</p><p>WPP Digital, our digital businesses and our specialist communications businesses, are the last remaining vehicles -- verticals.</p><p>So we have 11 verticals and we have two horizontal integrators. One is client leaders. As I said, there are 45 of those. And then the country and regional managers covering about 51 out of 112 countries, the latest addition being France.</p><p>The next strategic priority on slide 41 is new markets. We're at around 28%, 29%. Obviously, currency has had an impact on that in slowing the growth to the range of 40% to 45%. But we think that will pick up, particularly as the BRICs and Next Eleven start to accelerate.</p><p>And on 42 we have the new media objectives which we are very close to achieving getting into the 40% to 45% range. Already at around 38%.</p><p>And last but not least, the technology, data and content objective around -- on slide 43 where we're trying to make sure that our measurable marketing is at least 50% of our revenues which we've managed to do.</p><p>We go into a little bit more detail on slide 44 on our technology investments, our data investments and content. Obviously the most important AppNexus, together with Xaxis. But our investment in Globant, which is heavily into the technology consulting space and is doing extremely well.</p><p>And then other technology investments around mobile and video such as Mutual Mobile, ActionX, Medialets and not forgetting the acquisition late last year of the digital media agency Essence, which has a strong involvement with Google and its platforms.</p><p>In data, we invested in comScore, in Invidi and Infoscout. And comScore obviously is trying to develop a more comprehensive media measurement set of tools that covers not just offline but online and deals with the issues of bots, mechanical viewing of ads or fraud, or the C+3 versus C+7 and viewability and value and validation.</p><p>And last but not least content where we've made a number of investments, most of them pretty successful, like Vice, like Imagina and Imagine Entertainment and Fullscreen. And others like Refinery29 in terms of investing in content. Mainly online content, but content generally.</p><p>So to sum up on slide 45 the first quarter of 2016. Sector-leading revenue growth of 10.5% with like-for-like revenue growth of 5.1%. Net sales growth strong as well, 6.7% in constant currency and like-for-like growth of 3.2% and 3.5% contribution from acquisitions.</p><p>Completed over 20 acquisitions and investments in the first quarter. We have a secured approval of the STW merger in Australia, which should alone add 2% to revenue and net sales on an annualized basis.</p><p>And the results of the media tsunami do show, we think, the strength of our media offer and in particular around technology, data and content.</p><p>The model on slide 46 remains the same. Our objective is to secure organic revenue and net sales growth in the range of 0% to 5% in line with market growth.</p><p>To secure margin improvement of 30 basis points, or 0.3 margin points before -- or more before currency movements with a long-term net sales margin target, as you know, of 19.7%. So we're now in excess of 17%.</p><p>And use of our substantial cash flow to enhance EPS through acquisitions through share buybacks and debt reduction. Acquisitions absorbed about GBP300m to GBP400m of about GBP1.3b, GBP1.4b of free cash flow.</p><p>Share buybacks of 2% to 3%. As you know in the first quarter we bought back about 0.6% of the equity. And a payout ratio target of 50%, which we feel possible we'll achieve this year one year ahead of schedule.</p><p>We implemented incremental buybacks to 2.3% from 1.2% previously to deliver effectively another 20 basis points, 0.2 of margin points.</p><p>And if you put all that together, it means that we deliver 10% to 15% EPS growth.</p><p>And on 47, we just track our long term, or the long-term impact of the financial model over the last 22 years or so. Our compound average growth rate in EPS has been 14%. And you can see the impact of the recessions in 2001, 2002, the Internet bust or the Internet 1.0. and then the impact of Lehman in 2009, Lehman having occurred towards the back end of 2008.</p><p>But having said that, despite those two cycles, and if you went before 1993 which is when we had our 1992 rights issue, or the impact of it, you went back to 1991, 1992, that was the third recession in the third year that was affected out of 31 years.</p><p>The outlook on slide 48. The preliminary first quarter revised forecast. We'll be doing that over -- we've got the flash on that. We'll be doing that in detail over the next couple of weeks -- is in line with budget, the revised forecast in line with budget with like-for-like revenue of well over 3% and net sales growth target of over 3%. And that's maintained, those objectives are maintained, by the Q1 RF.</p><p>The like-for-like headcount is flat in the quarter, the first quarter, with hires in the balance of the year to support the growth that we see in revenue but carefully controlled and making sure we have the necessary conversion.</p><p>First quarter revenue, sales, profit and margin ahead of budget. A margin goal of 30 basis points improvement and that's supported by the first year of impact, really, of our restructuring and IT transformation project.</p><p>And as always, we believe we're well-placed geographically not only in the mature markets but in the fast-growth markets. And functionally, not only in traditional media but in new media to capitalize on the industry trends.</p><p>We've got the leading position in faster growth markets in new media and in data. And that includes analytics and the application of technology and of course horizontality which is reinforced by a leading creative and effectiveness position at Caines in the competitions that we focus on. We've had extraordinary success over the last five years and we believe that will continue. And emphasis obviously on the three areas of technology, data and content.</p><p>So that sums up the presentation in the first quarter. So we're now open for questions, Paul.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: So if you can just put your hand up, say who you are and just wait for the man with the microphone, I would be very grateful. So just start on the left -- my left, your right.</p><p>CHARLES BEDOUELLE, ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS: Good morning, Charles Bedouelle from Exane. A couple of questions. The first one is do you get any inspiration from the finally positive growth from Ipsos last quarter and what it could mean for consumer insight, market research?</p><p>And the second question is for Paul. Where do you see the net debt and average debt maybe at the end of the year? Thanks.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: On data, you've seen that in the first quarter it was flat. We had a stronger March. The integration of our data business with our media business, you put the two together, the combined revenues of the two businesses are GBP10b out of approximately GBP20b.</p><p>So media and data are really half of our business. Another quarter of our business, maybe a little bit more, is digital. So three-quarters of our business are media, data and digital heavily linked together. But we think that the leverage that we're getting from media and from data is quite significant.</p><p>Ipsos is -- business tends to be more custom than ours. We still see a difference between the custom business, which is much more project orientated, and the syndicated or semi-syndicated business that we have, which is built around copy testing and tracking and our panel business. Which is more, let me put it like this, a Nielsen-type business which is more syndicated. And we did see a little bit more stronger growth in March. But margins are strong and much stronger. Some of the restructuring expense that we took in 2014 and 2015, a significant part of it was directed at the data business and particularly in Western Europe. So I think we saw a little bit of improvement in March.</p><p>But one of the primary focuses is to make sure that we leverage what we are doing in data and measurement more effectively. One of the big areas is ensuring that we get maximum utilization and application that came out in Adam's and Rob's report in the area of measurement.</p><p>And being able to access the data, the sort of data that Google and Facebook are developing. And there are signs, certainly with Google and I think latterly with Facebook as well, that they're starting to free up some of the data, if not all of it, to then make available to our media operations and our data operations. And that they will be less of a walled garden, if I can put it like that in terms.</p><p>Do you want to add anything to that, Rob?</p><p>ROB NORMAN, CHIEF DIGITAL OFFICER GROUPM, WPP PLC: No, we have great relationships with all of them in terms of them feeding data into our own research and analytics models. We are still seeking more transparency from them into the real shape and nature of their audiences and the profiles of their heaviest using segments which we believe are important to advertisers to really understand the social significance of those platforms relative to other media.</p><p>And it's a tremendously productive relationship, but it's relatively tough sledding to actually get to the final datasets we want.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. So Paul, do you want to cover the net debt question.</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: So Charles, I'll talk about the average for the year, so to December 31. So last year, as you may recall, the year-to-date average was around GBP3.5b. And in terms of the average net debt to EBITDA ratio, the end of the year about 1.78.</p><p>I'm expecting the average net debt throughout the year to increase by the end of the year around GBP500m on a constant currency basis. But the ratio at the end of the year to be very consistent with what we saw last year end.</p><p>I think there are two just adjustments you need to keep in mind. Is because of the weakness of sterling, and we had the majority of our debt in euros and dollars, in terms of the gross debt number, there's around a GBP200m adjustment at 2016 rates.</p><p>It doesn't affect the leverage ratio because obviously we're going to get the benefit on the EBITDA in a similar fashion. So the ratio remains the same. But also in addition, with the completion of the STW deal, although we did not pay cash and we've been issued shares for our assets, we are taking on their balance sheet, which had on balance around GBP200m of debt as well.</p><p>So without those two adjustments, just to keep it clean and simple, it's around GBP500m higher average net debt but the ratio the same. And we're looking to have I think a more even balance to the cash generation and the cash outflows in 2016 whereas last year we were quite a heavy outflow of around GBP560m.</p><p>JULIEN ROCH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Julien Roch with Barclays. First question on P&amp;G. You just announced recently that they were continuing to cut how much they were paying to agencies. They've already cut by 25% which is about GBP400m. There's about another GBP200m to come. So is anybody doing it? Because I know you talked about pricing pressure. But are we talking about 35% cut, which is quite big and why is there no impact on overall agencies because if you look at the growth rate, it's pretty similar? That's my first question.</p><p>Then ISBAR this morning sent to their 450 members a standard contract because apparently there's a lot of capacity and keeping of rebates among agencies. And I'm sure that's not the case for WPP agencies, but it's the second industry body that's said ether's something wrong in media buying at D&amp;A. So your comments on that.</p><p>And the last question is on account wins. Publicis is telling us it's going to cost them 100m, 250m of organic. And yet as the winner, you seem to have no benefit as this year growth is supposed to be like last year. So a comment on that as well. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Well let me just deal with the first one. I don't think we can talk specifically about one specific client. P&amp;G is our third-largest client after Ford and Unilever. But I think it would be inappropriate to talk about specific clients other than to say, as you know from the analysis that we gave you, the macro and micro analysis on the slide, we do refer to pressure. And then the pricing pressure that there has been in the marketplace, the pressure on payment terms and the like. This is not a new thing. This is something that's been going on for a significant period of time.</p><p>But I come back to the general point that what we're seeing is that corporates are very focused on returning capital to shareholders.</p><p>There are others that are looking at growing the top line and ultimately I think everybody accepts, even zero-based cost budgeters, that in the longer term, they have to invest in brands and have to grow the top line to prosper. So in any particular case, any particular company will go through cycles, or go through cycles where they emphasize costs, and then having done that, and having created a much more efficient base for their operations, there'll then start to build again. Packaged goods companies in particular are very focused on advertising and promotion.</p><p>Unfortunately, we don't get often the breakdown between advertising and promotion. Promotion, by and large, if A&amp;P rises because A is rising, obviously that's good for agencies. If it rises because of promotion or P rising, that's not so good. And similarly on the downside. So I think it would be wrong to categorize everything in the garden as being rosy.</p><p>And we've had this discussion with you before. We talked about parallel universes; you have to be optimistic if you operate in our industry. But having said that, there are pressure points, and we have highlighted consistently over a long period of time that there are these pressure points, ever since, really, Lehman. We had to snap back in 2010, but from 2011 onwards, it's almost like a square root sign you saw, the snapback, but it's with a gently sloping upward tail to the square root sign. So without, again, focusing on specific clients, that is the situation.</p><p>On ISBAR and the agencies, I haven't seen the contract. But of course, we have contracts with our individual clients. And as we've said in the case of the ANA, if any client has any issue with any of our agencies, we have a constant dialogue, not through ISBAR and not through the ANA, with each of the clients. And if they have any concerns about the relationship or the way that we operate, or indeed anybody else operates, they should do it directly with the agencies. And we do have strong dialogues all the time with all our clients.</p><p>On the new business, I'm a little bit mystified by the question because you do see the benefit of it, and you do see the benefit. You've seeing the increase in our market share in North America. We are, according to RECMA, our billings are GBP104b I think in the last RECMA survey, which was around I think 2014. I don't think they've issued the full numbers for 2015. We give you an audited number. You know that we did GBP73b of billings last year. You know that our billings are up by 8.3% reported and 6.7% constant for the first quarter of this year.</p><p>I think, coming back to your comment on ISBAR, and indeed, the ANA, a lot of the issues that are supposed to be focused on could be removed by every agency giving their billing information, every agency giving their revenue information, which they do, and every agency giving their net sales information.</p><p>We included the table in the press release, which is somewhat unorthodox, some people observed, but we put it in into the press release because we think it shows -- it highlights the difference in the data. We give you the revenues of each company for the last quarter. We show that local -- in local and revenue, because sometimes the exchange rate varies a bit, and we give an explanation of that. We gave you the growth rate. And we gave you the growth rate our revenue and net sales. And we now know that at least two, maybe three of the competitors have their own platforms, and buy media as principles.</p><p>Now we were very forthright on Xaxis and the opt-in basis of Xaxis. Omnicom then revealed that they had their own platform, Accuen, and they give a -- in response to questions they give each quarter an indication of what the impact of principle digital buying has been in the United States.</p><p>Publicis, in their last call, referred to their Apex platform, which as I understand it, from what I've been told, has been in operation for some time.</p><p>IBG say they don't act as principle.</p><p>Havas I don't know whether they do or they don't. I think from what we've heard, they possibly do.</p><p>So we think that, coming back to your question about benefit around new business wins, etc., you can see it in the numbers.</p><p>And going back to the ISBAR question, I think a lot of the question marks would be removed because it then get into the areas of barter and pass through costs. The other area that makes the difference between revenue and net sales, in our case, is not just online media buying as principle, but also the pass-through costs on data.</p><p>And obviously other people have pass-through costs. IBG in their call this quarter referred to pass-through costs yet again. So showing revenue and net sales, I think is important.</p><p>TOM SINGLEHURST, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Good morning. It's Tom here from Citigroup. I have a couple of questions. The first one is on the convergence of agency models and the moves towards horizontality and cross-group client teams. It strikes me that the way we should think about WPP's approach is basically they have a series of concierges basically dipping in and out of the main agency brand. And the question is, given some of the big competitors are now going to full unified P&amp;Ls, and on the face of it slightly more integrated approaches, is the concierge approach going to be enough in the context of what's happening in the world landscape? So that's the first question.</p><p>And then the second question. You mentioned the Bollore model. You didn't really talk about whether it was a good thing. And I just wanted to understand whether that's some sort of signal that we should expect you to (inaudible).</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: I raised it as an interesting point, Tom, because I know you follow these things avidly. I just think it's a different model. It's yet to be determined whether it's a good thing or a bad thing. But I think it's probably one of the most interesting things going on in the industry, if not the most interesting thing, that you have a model that combines a telecom's platform, and it may well be that Telecom Italia company, that the network is separated from the pipework, if I can put it, or the cables.</p><p>But I think it's just very interesting that in a group, and it's a group of companies, really, minority interests, so effectively controlling interests, is being put together for the first time that I can see. I think there are some parallels in some parts of the world. I can think of one in South America.</p><p>But it's unusual to have agency services plus a telecoms platform, plus media ownership, plus content ownership being put together in this way. It does raise all sorts of interesting issues, and I think it's just interesting that convergence, and I think it is the fact we are seeing convergence in a number of areas, is just manifesting itself in a different way.</p><p>Going back to your concierge question, this is not a concierge operation. I think that's a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation. Whilst -- the point I'm making is this. If you've got one end of the spectrum is let's say vertical, and the other end of the spectrum is total integration or what we would call horizontality, we have clients that we have totally integrated, where we literally have one single P&amp;L, where we've literally fused it and there is not a cigarette paper of difference.</p><p>And there are two or three of those that are very strong. They are effectively agencies within WPP to service a particular client. And we see that in the automotive category, in the packaged goods category. There are some clients who insist on global decentralization. I don't like that the word concierge. I wouldn't even call -- describe them as concierge, but where they're much more comfortable with let's say the vertical operating as the integrator.</p><p>The risk, I think, of going too quickly is that you disrupt your organization, and you can see it in the exit rate, in the churn rates that you can monitor, actually, increasingly. If you look at various social media, you can monitor what's going on. We monitor very closely what's happening to the churn rates, the turnover rates, between ourselves and key competitors. And that's particularly the case since the POG merger or the mooted POG merger. Since that broke apart, and we've continued to monitor that, and that shows quite clearly some differential turnover rates that are quite significant.</p><p>The point that I was making in our presentation is given the difference between vertical and horizontal, it's got to be done gradually. It can't be force fed, because it causes far too much disruption.</p><p>The brands that we have, have been in existence in one case for well over 150 years. And to force-feed people, to cram it down their throats that they're going to move to horizontal, unified model, uni-branded model in a short period of time, I think our judgement is that's highly destructive.</p><p>Others in our industry are more vertically geared and aligned, and they've used the value of their brands is greater than the benefits they will get. So this is not concierge. I react against that word, because we have models that are highly unified. We also have models that are highly decentralized. I think the trend is towards more unification. The difference I would have is the pace at which it gets done.</p><p>RICHARD JONES, ANALYST, POWERHOUSE: Hi. It's Richard Jones from Tower House. Can I just follow up on that question, just how client attitudes towards client conflict have changed over the last five, 10 years?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Richard, we'll come back to the conflict, but Rob just wanted to add something.</p><p>ROB NORMAN: Yes, within the horizontality construct, I think it's interesting how it's operating in some parts of WPP. And I think of the agents Plus for Chanel. I think if they keep L'Oreal, for L'Oreal, I think of [Team Arrow] for Target in which we're taking assets across countries and across disciplines and across agencies from within GroupM even in order to build custom assets for clients whilst retaining complete sovereignty for many others in MediaCom, Mindshare and so forth.</p><p>So I think what we've got is a very flexible infrastructure and the muscle memory of collaboration in building throughout the business. It's no longer unusual, and it's much easier to do this through muscle memory than it is through dogma.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. Fair enough. On the conflict issue, Richard, I think broadly the answer is it has become less of an issue. And clients have accepted conflicts within structured parent companies, holding companies, as long as there's separation and there are rules of engagement, or rules of disengagement. So there are all sorts of things in relation to privacy, secrecy, confidentiality, audit, cooling off periods in relation to people working on pieces of business.</p><p>So I think generally, the issue of conflict is less prevalent. It is still probably more than, with all due respect to the investment bankers that might be in the room, or brokers who might be in the room, that the conflicts that you have to deal with are indeed consulting companies. That they are able in one brand to handle conflicts, whereas in our industry, for good reasons or bad reasons, handling conflicts in one vertical is difficult.</p><p>And that comes back to the previous question, Tom's previous question, often you have to maintain -- and this is this question about how fast you go, if you slam everything together and unify it into one, that whole conflict issue that you raised is going to become more difficult to deal with.</p><p>So there is a logic to the separation, not just about different cultures or different brands or different histories, but conflict of clients, and indeed I will add another conflict, conflict of people. Sometimes people just don't want to work with or for other people, and you have to respect that, and respect that difference. So that's another reason why going too fast can be a dangerous thing to do. But I do think generally concern about conflict has got less. And of course, if there is pressure in the system to reduce pricing, to -- on payment terms is another thing that we've discussed over time, the result is there has to be consolidation, which there has been in our industry.</p><p>And I think one of the things you're seeing, one of the questions that was previously, why is it that the industry seems to be in reasonably good health, if you look at -- and you look at GDP growth? And I think part of the reason is that the bigger agency groups are gaining share because it is more difficult, again, rightly or wrongly, for smaller or medium-sized agencies to continue to operate independently.</p><p>We were talking to one company yesterday who said that the chief reason they were interested in talking to us was because they needed more global representation, even more regional representation in the context of the US market. So the whole -- and they had been precluded from agency RFPs because they didn't have the requisite resources.</p><p>So one of the maybe unintended consequences of greater pressure on pricing, etc., is that the conflict differentiation is less necessary as a result, certainly less necessary than Don Draper would have seen -- would have known.</p><p>LISA YANG, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Good morning. It's Lisa from Goldman Sachs. My first question is on your organic growth for the full year, and how you think about the shape of it. It looks like the comps in the second half are getting tougher, yet you expect stronger growth. So any kind of comment that would be appreciated.</p><p>The second one is on Kantar. You recently announced a big reorganization. So I know it's early days, but any color you can give on how this reorganization is going, and when do you expect to achieve top line growth?</p><p>And the last one is a bit more on the topic about need to invest in your brand to grow your top line. It looks like there are more and more outside companies that grow their brands without having to invest much in traditional media if I take the example of just your traditional media you would use, etc. So I'm just wondering if you think that digital will lower the barriers to build the brand, and what are the implications for the agency?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Adam, if you could just deal with that third question about the relative importance of tradition, because I think you've got some strong views on that, on traditional media and the balance. And then I'll come back on the organic second half and Kantar.</p><p>ADAM SMITH, FUTURES DIRECTOR, GROUPM, WPP PLC: Yes, in the Interaction report we've just published, one of the sections deals -- looks at specifically the amount of traditional media used by online brands to increase their market penetration, which is substantial. And to give you a specific example, in the UK, the big tech brands are growing their TV investment at double the market average. That's on the one side of the coin.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, do digital media reduce the barriers to entry? Well, one very distinct sign I see here in the UK, if you look at regional advertising, which is by definition small budgets and national (technical difficulty). The ratio of -- the cost of getting the reach is falling, because digital media are cheaper but you have to manage the data that go with it. And so earnings profile seems to be distinctly moving in the case of smaller budgets from fees and commissions and media placement to payment for data-related services, essentially. So there are still barriers to entry, although I agree that the media cost may well be cheaper.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Thanks for that. Rob?</p><p>ROB NORMAN: No, I think other than to say that, as Adam points out, as regards becoming bigger and bigger investors, there is a definite need for many of these companies to achieve significant celebrity in their own mind. One of the newest clients is Max, in the US, for example, is Jet.com, which is a competitor to the other e-commerce platforms. Its a marketplace level business and it needs to drive a level of awareness so people consider jets.com versus Amazon and eBay and others, and they are pushing very aggressively into the marketplace with traditional media.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: And you -- Adam, just to further underline the point. In your Interaction report, you talk about TV is definitely not dead. Do you want to add anything in relation to -- and particularly one of the questions that flows from that is what's happening to the -- and Rob, you can comment on this as well, on the upfronts here and the scatter markets here. Do you want to just talk about TV and its role, Adam, a bit?</p><p>ADAM SMITH: There is this perception of TV as in some kind of crisis with the departure of younger viewers. And so we asked our networks to quantify the scale of this. And the net result is that yes, of course there's been some erosion of younger viewers, I would say typical more than 10% loss of volume. But what we buy is reach. And 10% loss of volume does not equate to 10% loss of reach. It equates to something rather less than that. So I visualize that problem as managing the problem.</p><p>We compensate for the loss of reach by using digital media where we know this audience resides. Rob's earlier points about some of the digital companies not telling us as much as we'd like to know about reach, is quite important because I think it may benefit them to be a little more open so we can establish just exactly how much reach we can pick up quite easily. I think there maybe there is an incentive there for them to be more open.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I've done some -- no.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: You've been told on pain of death not to say anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. There is the [high occupation] area calling the upfront at this moment.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: All right, okay. So discretion is the better part of valor. Just coming back to organic. As we've said in the statement, we think on the basis of the Q1 one RF that we have, as I say, we're going to go through that in some more detail the next couple of weeks. But we think that the second half will be slightly stronger despite the stronger comparatives. So I think that's the pattern that we see.</p><p>As far as Kantar is concerned, it comes a little bit back to Tom's concierge question. If you look at Kantar, that is definitely not a concierge operation. But what Eric Salama, who runs Kantar, which is, as you know, is about a quarter of our revenues, is doing, which is no different actually to what we've been doing in other parts of the operation, but I think it's interesting, because it is emblematic of what we're trying to do elsewhere, and in fact at WPP as a whole is a, he calls it, Kantar first.</p><p>And he's building a much more integrated Kantar where in each country there is much more of a unified back office, the pipework is much more standardized, and yet you have people focusing on country and country cooperation across brands. Not losing, again, coming back to the importance of the brand, at least from our point of view, not losing their brand, not being -- not becoming uni-branded, but certainly trying to get the maximum amount of efficiency and the maximum amount of cooperation clear from what we've seen.</p><p>And it relates to the other part of the question about top line growth. What's clear is that having implemented that, there's a totally different attitude in each of the brands as they work together as to how they treat RFPs, how they treat RFPS if they can't compete with them for -- it might be Richard's question about conflict or whatever it happens to be or capability that they are much more aware of the other capabilities within Kantar and within WPP</p><p>So I think that structural -- and we're looking at it very carefully in terms of how it's implemented because it has lessons for us in what we're doing in other parts of the operation.</p><p>That 11 vertical slide which simplifies the structure with the four agency groups, GroupM, Group H, B2B, etc., gives you an idea of how the structure has been simplified. And what you've got is subgroups around function, that each and every one of them is becoming much more streamlined, much more efficient, much more back office shared service center, ERP efficient. And that's the way we think it should go. But being a little bit careful on all the issues that we talked about.</p><p>ADAM SMITH: And Kantar's reorganization is a very significant issue for the collaboration with GroupM. So I think of [Serene Wong] who leads the L'Oreal relationship with both Kantar and GroupM overall, I think of [Gera Sumenska] who I think leads the Nestle operation for both GroupM and Kantar. It's streamlining those relationships is making it easier for us to yield the data investment management dividend on media.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay.</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: Right. Some of the regions last year relatively underperformed in the second half of the year, in particular Asia Pacific market sector, Middle East and rest of the world. Those are expecting quite a strong bounce back in the second half, which is logical given their performance last year.</p><p>And I'd say in terms of the discipline of the specialist businesses, it effectively gets stronger, although it's had a good start throughout the second half of the year. So there is a logic to the understanding, despite higher comps. Some of the underperformance relatively last year is being made up on the second half of this year.</p><p>PATRICK WELLINGTON, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Patrick Wellington, Morgan Stanley. Just quickly, three questions. China. Is your optimism simply based on comps as the year goes on or is there something more substantial making you feel that China is going to get better?</p><p>And just on the UK, are we seeing any Brexit effect in Q2?</p><p>Secondly, quickly, the ANA report, is that ever going to come out? There was some talk it was going to come out in April. Has it ever happened?</p><p>And thirdly, Martin, you mentioned that bigger agencies are taking share, which potentially gets us back onto the old theme of is WPP thinking of making another acquisition across those row of agencies. There's some smaller ones on the far right could easily be consolidated. Are we back on that theme?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: It doesn't strike me as being a quick question, Patrick. And there were four there, I noted. Your three has become four. But anyway, let me try and deal with them.</p><p>China. I think it is a comps, a comparative point. I think first quarter was pretty -- was limp, I would describe it. GDP growth I think in China is not at 6.5%. Probably most observers that we talk to think it's around 3% to 4%. But we'll have to see how it shakes out for the rest of the year. But I think it's more to do with comparatives than anything else. But we remain very strong, unabashed, not just of China, but of Brazil, despite the difficulties they're having at the moment. And I would add Russia, but that will take a longer time clearly to come through.</p><p>On the UK, to my knowledge, April hasn't finished, so I don't think we can answer your question.</p><p>I don't know whether Adam is going to add anything on the Brexit thing. But I have not seen stuff that I would associate on advertising spend with Brexit yet. I've heard clients say that Q1 generally was soft, not because of Brexit but for other reasons. One said to me even the pattern of holidays, the pattern of where Easter is, whether Easter is early or late, so there are lots of potential reasons. I do think, however, that Brexit, or the possibility of an exit, has affected other investment decisions.</p><p>So on the ANA, I don't know. You would have to ask the ANA as to -- I think I've said on a previous call, a meeting has been arranged between at least -- I think it's four of the agency holding company heads and the ANA. But that will be sometime in June. So I don't know about the reports.</p><p>On the bigger agencies, we remain very focused, Patrick, on the small and medium-sized acquisitions. We have done a public company deal which was STW. That is effectively -- it's not a nil premium merger, but it's a small premium merger. We stepped up from 21%, I think it was or 22%, to 60%, 61%, and the deal that was done was merging our remaining assets in Australia and New Zealand with STW, now being called WPP Australia New Zealand.</p><p>And when you look at the structure of that transaction, although we did pay a small premium on the value of their business in relation to ours, effectively it's a nil premium, or close to nil premium merger. So we think if we are going to do something of that nature, we get credit for doing that in that way rather than blundering in in the way that you seem to be suggesting by your fourth question.</p><p>I just think that -- just on structure, and I'm not saying we would be involved in this. But I do think since six becomes four in time, I'd still hold that view. But we shall see. The interesting thing about the Bollore model is that creates a different model. So Havas, which is the smallest of the six, is -- you can conglomerate it with the other assets that the Bollore family have, you have a very different -- it's a very different kettle of fish. So I think that in and of itself is sort of interesting.</p><p>CHRIS COLLETT, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Good morning. It's Chris Collett from Deutsche. Just two quick questions. One was on IBOPE, obviously one of the larger of the acquisitions you've done recently. Could you just comment on how that has been performing in what -- this is a difficult market?</p><p>And then secondly, it was just to pick up on a comment that was made about some of the walled gardens from Google and Facebook, the garden walls coming down a little bit. Could you just talk a little bit more about what is driving that and why, what's the incentive for them to lower their garden walls, if you will?</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Well, we have an expert on -- an expert gardener here. Rob, go ahead.</p><p>ROB NORMAN: Well, I think that the walls remain robust. They're fine brick and mortar. They are merely taking more stuff over the wall that they've built. And I think what they have realized, not under pressure from advertisers and us, but in quite collaborative conversations with their advertisers and us, that it's in their interest to see all the boats flow upwards of brands growing. And they know that brands will only flow upwards if there is media investment and advertising investment across channels and the attribution is more able to be considered.</p><p>I think they've grown more confident, incidentally, in their own ability to deliver certain numbers of advertising objectives to different people. And the more confident people become in the performance of their channel I think the more happy they are to share some of the data from their channel which endorses their position.</p><p>We would like it to come down further. Our own strategy is to gather up the original data we collected in WPP from Kantar Shopper and transaction level and elsewhere, and back to consumer and behavioral data with KPMG in other parts of the Group and then to append more and more data so we have some visibility across the piece and they're not entirely dependent on them.</p><p>I think we are reaching a kind of mutual status, if you like, on that data sharing where they're keeping secret what they want to keep secret, and we are making use of what we need to do to achieve is our overall goal being cross-channel demand driving business.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Just to add to that and, Adam, you might want to come in as well. But I'll just ask Rob, it's not just the Google and Facebook walled gardens. There is the Amazon walled garden. There is the Ali Baba walled garden. There might even be a ClickCarts walled garden. There are a number -- the Apple walled garden -- there's a number of them.</p><p>ROB NORMAN: Well, the coincidental nature between all of the people who finish those walled gardens with are the people that are the biggest owners who want to become the virtuous first party data. So the people who have created terms and conditions for use of services, often utilities like Facebook or commerce services like Amazon, or entertainment services that come with Apple, who have acquired through their user agreement a number of rights to the use of data and targeting and so forth. And there is a clear separation between those businesses and what we think of as the rest of the traditional media sector. So that is highly significant.</p><p>And data alliance, which we created between GroupM and Kantar and Wunderman and other assets within WPP, has been absolutely focused on opening up the partnership pipes between us and all of those companies. And I'm glad to say we do have partnership rights between us and all of those companies. And the job is not to turn the fire hose on, as it were. The job is to take enough to inform appropriate decision-making. We are not unhappy with our progress in that area.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Yes, and I'll just add to it, Chris, before Adam, if you want to add anything else. What's really interesting is there is a considerable amount of concern. You know the regulatory concern in Brussels with the new competitiveness, DG, invest to go in relation to Google. You know, I'm sure, that a number of people are concerned about the data that, for example, Amazon has and controls.</p><p>And in fact, the data that an Ali Baba gets through the [Tarval] platform in terms of what's happening to movement of product and service and replication of that product and service. So there is -- the more walled gardens there are, in a way, the greater the role that we have. It's a bit like fragmentation of the media. It plays in a role that we have in not arbitrating between them, but helping our clients navigate.</p><p>ROB NORMAN: There's a general rule that businesses like ours trade quite well in environments that are characterized by strong oligopolists rather than massively fragmented markets or single monopolists. So I think that we are now moving into a phase of a number of very strong oligopolists and I don't think that's a terrible thing for us.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Adam, anything you want to add before I respond on IBOPE?</p><p>ADAM SMITH: No, only that I have visualized this shift in our relationships with the big tech companies as being -- they are coming from a transactional direct response mindset to the more brand focused, intangible idea that most of our clients are pushing, where reputations are at stake. I realize part of what we do is risk management around price quality, security, context, reputation, this sort of thing. And the more collaborative our relationships are with the media vendors, I think the better the issues can be delivered.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Just turning to Chris's question on IBOPE, I think it's gone quite well, actually. One of the reasons why I think, if you compare the statistics and you got the statistics, or we can supply you with the statistics of the Latin American breakdown between us and the competition, one of the reasons we might have exhibited, certainly Brazil has been tough in the first quarter for everybody, including ourselves.</p><p>But I think in the context of Brazil and Latin America, IBOPE, because of the nature of its business, gives us more stability than perhaps we would have had without it. So on balance, good. And within the region, I think becoming stronger actually, when you look at it on a market-by-market basis.</p><p>PAUL RICHARDSON: I think, Martin, that's the last of the questions. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL: Okay. We've got Fran Butera is over here with me and with Rob and you are there, Paul, with Chris Sweetland. So thanks, everybody, and we'll be talking to you at the end of the first half.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>This call is currently being webcast over the internet, and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at Investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. The PowerPoints that contain the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website, as well.</p><p>Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements.

Let me start by saying how excited I am to be with all of you. I just completed my first quarter at Visa, and passed my two-month mark as the Chief Executive Officer. I think as many of you know, I've been a Board member since early 2014, so I've been involved in the business, and was a party in approving the Company's strategy and priorities. I also understand the majority of the opportunities and challenges around the world.</p><p>My objective from day one has been to make this CEO transition at Visa seamless for our clients, our partners, our employees, and our shareholders. I have no big plans to change our strategy in the short term, but as a key player in a dynamic payments ecosystem, we certainly have to be prepared as necessary to adapt are thinking as facts and circumstances change.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, I've spent the majority of my time traveling to meet our valued clients, regulatory personnel, and talented employees. During this time, I've met with or talked to over 50 clients. I've also visited with regulators or government officials in nine countries, and visited 12 of our global offices. I have to say it's been exhilarating and enjoyable. It has also reinforced my belief in our great global brand and the first-class group of clients we have globally.</p><p>Let me begin by sharing a few early observations since I joined the Visa team; then I'll highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter, and close with some thoughts around our strategic pillars as we move forward.</p><p>First, I would say we have a fantastic leadership team. I thoroughly enjoy spending time with them, and working with them on a day-in and day-out basis. I will also tell you that we have a talented group of employees, after visiting with a number of them in our offices around the globe. We need to continue to foster a healthy culture that tracks, retains, and develops the best talent to maintain this high level of Company performance.</p><p>Second, we certainly have strong relationships with our issuer clients, our acquirer clients, and the merchant community of clients, and we're constantly looking for ways to build upon those. It's been very valuable to for me to hear their perspectives on Visa, and how we can be a better partner in addressing our business needs going forward. We need to identify areas where we can remove friction from the process in enabling digital payments as we pursue partnerships. At the same time, we recognize that this industry is very competitive, and the regulatory environment continues to evolve in many markets around the world.</p><p>Third, we're in a growth industry, and there's a huge opportunity in front of us. The global opportunity to digitize cash and check is enormous. We have a vibrant core business in developed regions, with even more growth opportunities in the international and emerging markets with low penetration rates. Governments in emerging middle classes are leading the way to digitize more payments in developing countries, while e-commerce is displacing cash and check in developed countries.</p><p>Through our focus on technological innovation and partnership development, Visa is well-positioned for sustained growth going forward. As a market leader in payments technology, we're enabling new forms of digital commerce, and supporting the new businesses in mobile payments, the Internet of Things, data security, and the sharing economy. Our global network connects over 16,000 financial institutions to over 44 million merchants, with strong commercial partnerships built over many years, and a brand that's recognized by consumers for acceptance, security, and convenience.</p><p>I'm gratified to see the business strength and fundamentals that I knew as a board member continue to be realized in our financial results. With that, let me highlight some of these now. In the fiscal quarter just ended, we saw healthy overall growth in terms of payment volume, cross-border commerce, transactions, revenue, and earnings leverage, as the business performed better than our internal expectations.</p><p>We grew net revenue by 25% and adjusted EPS by 23% versus prior year's adjusted results. Transaction growth, strong cross-border activity, higher currency volatility, and client incentive delays all contributed to our revenue out-performance. This is the second full quarter with Visa Europe in the results, which makes it a little more complicated, but Vasant will take time later to cover the financial results in greater detail.</p><p>Our operational metrics are improving, and we're on track to meet our financial goals. In terms of co-brand partnerships, issuer renewals, and other competitive deals, they are a normal course of business, and as usual, we have had very good success in the last quarter. We have a lot of momentum in the business, and have exciting days ahead of us. We're executing on our 2017 operating plan, and I'm pleased with the progress to date.</p><p>When I look out longer term, we remain committed to our strategy and the six guiding pillars, three of which I look at as foundational, and three of which are keys to grow. The foundational elements of our strategy are first and foremost to retain and attract the best people. In my mind and based on my experience, success starts there.</p><p>Winning teams and organizations have the best people, so we need to build upon the solid foundation and high-performing culture we have here at Visa. We continue to strive to be an employer of choice, where we can constantly attract the best talent, develop our people, and recognize their achievements, as we are clearly doing excellent and wonderful things here.</p><p>Second is transforming technology. We want to constantly be on the leading edge and push the pace of innovation. As part of extending our network and enabling easier access, we're pushing toward open access software for our clients and partners. We're providing an open platform for developers to access our APIs to quickly launch new products and experiences. We're adding technical resources in many locations around the world, and also building a European innovation center in the UK, that will open at the end of this month.</p><p>The third foundational element is championing security. It is an imperative that there is a high level of trust in the payments ecosystem, and we are committed to be an industry leader when it comes to security. One way we're doing that's through tokenization. We continue to make excellent progress with the Visa Token Service, which is now live in 27 countries, and more than 1,300 financial institution partners are participating globally. We've enabled launches of many financial institutions' wallets, as well as the various pays in several additional countries in this past quarter.</p><p>Now let me turn to the three growth elements of the strategy, the first being expanding access to our network and services globally. Expanding and providing access to our network drives value for our clients and partners, consumers, merchants, and governments. Around the world, we're developing, supporting new products and methods of acceptance. We're recognizing local market conditions. Through these efforts, we have provided payment accounts to countless number of people who previously didn't have access to the formal financial system.</p><p>Second growth element of our strategy is deepening partnerships. Partnerships are critical in the payments world, and we strive to be the best possible partner we can be to enable growth opportunities for all parties in the ecosystem.</p><p>We need to continue to build close relationships with our issuing partners; likewise it is very important that we work hard and demonstrate a commitment to our acquirers and the merchant community in each market, and find ways to deliver additional value there. Being a trusted partner is a key to our business success, so we always want to look to strengthen these relationships, and we will continue to do just that.</p><p>The third element is digital expansion. E-commerce enabled by mobile and other form factors is a significant opportunity, and we are definitely investing behind it. As payments move from the physical to digital world, we're leading the way in developing solutions for our clients, our partners, and consumers.</p><p>One great example of this is Visa Checkout. We now have over 18 million consumer accounts in 23 countries, and over 1,500 financial institutional partners participating around the world. More than 300,000 online merchants have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $173 billion in addressable volume.</p><p>Another key area for Visa is the acceleration of international markets. The integration of Visa Europe is tracking well. It's still in the early innings, but we're encouraged by the progress, and see meaningful growth opportunities. During the quarter, we continued our focus on local market priorities, along side client engagement.</p><p>The vast majority of our payments volume in Europe remains under contract. The European market continues to represent a large opportunity to displace cash, and we are accelerating digital innovation in Europe by continuing to roll out our token service in several markets, as well as supporting many digital wallets.</p><p>A number of people have asked about the China market opportunity. Visa remains committed to China for the long term, and we want to deepen our partnerships with our clients and partners to advance economic growth. We look forward to the opportunity to formally submit our license application; however, we're still awaiting additional clarifications for the government before we can apply. It's our intent to move very quickly to set up our processing infrastructure, once we have greater clarity from the PBOC around the timelines for their decision in granting licenses.</p><p>The move to a more cash-less economy in India also represents a large opportunity. Concurrent with other measures, the new government has implement measures to incent merchants and consumers to move to digital payments. These new measures include capped POS terminal charges, no PLS import tax and duties. In the last quarter, we've seen a nearly 75% increase in payments volume in India, and more than twice the number of processed transactions.</p><p>We're working with a number of key stakeholders to sustain the momentum, to drive digital payments in the Indian economy. Examples include working with issuers to raise awareness and drive debit activation. We're also working with acquirers and merchants on digital acceptance solutions like mVisa to rapidly expand acceptance, and with key government bodies to facilitate longer-term ecosystem growth. It is early days, but we are excited about the opportunity to expand electronic payments to consumers.</p><p>Let me now share some thoughts on managing our capital and delivering shareholder value. Our number one priority with capital is to identify and find ways to grow our business. This can be - this can come organically or through acquisitions.</p><p>One example of the latter is the acquisition of Cardinal Commerce, which closed yesterday. This acquisition helps our clients and merchant partners accelerate digital payments and commerce by improving online payment security. It builds on our strength in the sector, and augments issuer services and our cyber-source capabilities. In this dynamic payments ecosystem, we need to invest to drive future growth, and maintain our market-leading position.</p><p>Second, we will continue to deliver value by returning excess cash to our shareholders. In this last fiscal quarter, we returned nearly $2.2 billion, consisting of $1.8 billion through share repurchases and nearly $400 million through dividends. As we've stated before, we have accelerated our share repurchases to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe acquisition. We will continue to be prudent as we think about ways of managing and allocating our capital.</p><p>Lastly, we plan to maintain a healthy dialogue and good relationships with our investor community. I hope to meet and spend time with many of you as we move through the year. To that end, we are in the planning stages to hold an Investor Day in June, so we will come back to you shortly once the dates and locations are confirmed.</p><p>As we begin this new year, I'm excited about the many opportunities ahead. We're off to a really good start in our fiscal first quarter. I feel great about the future of Visa. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant to cover some of the financial details.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU, CFO, VISA INC.: Thank you, Al. FY17 is off to a strong start. First-quarter revenue and EPS exceeded our expectations, driven by accelerating fundamentals, which more than offset the drag from exchange rate shift. On a GAAP basis, fiscal first quarter net revenues were up 25%, and EPS up 7%.</p><p>Net income for the first quarter was $2.1 billion, and EPS $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusting for the $255 million non-cash gain in last year's first quarter from the write-off of the Visa Europe book liability, EPS was up 23%. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively affected both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points.</p><p>There were four key drivers of our Q1 out-performance. First, constant-dollar payment volume growth stepped up between 1% to 2% percentage points in most geographies. Second, normalized for the impact of Visa Europe, the cross-border recovery accelerated by two percentage points globally, from 10% to 12%. Once again, the acceleration was broad-based. Third, normalized for the impact of Visa Europe, process transaction growth picked up by one point, from 12% to 13%, driven significantly by India, as well as the US. Fourth, timing of client incentives and delays in expenses added almost $0.03 to our Q1 results. Strong business fundamentals more than offset the negative impact of a strengthening US dollar and a weakening euro. The balance between strong business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shift will drive our results as we look ahead to the rest of FY17.</p><p>A couple of other points to note before I get into the details of our Q1 results, and our outlook for the year. We did not issue $2 billion in debt as we had planned. We did issue $567 million in commercial paper to fund our stock buy-back and operating cash needs.</p><p>We have over $8 billion of offshore cash, which could be repatriated if it can be done tax efficiently. We will wait to see what the new administration's plans for permitting cash repatriation are before we issue longer-term debt. In parallel, we continue to work on other strategies to bring cash back to the US. Until there's clarity on this front, we plan to issue commercial paper or short-term debt to fund our buy-back and other on-shore cash needs.</p><p>We bought back $22.3 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $79.77, or $1.8 billion in the first quarter. We have $3.9 billion remaining in our stock buy-back authorization.</p><p>Moving now to a review of our key business drivers in the first quarter. US payments volumes grew 12.4% in Q1, as credit grew 20.2%, helped by Costco and USAA. US debit grew 4.6%, helped by USAA debit conversion, but hurt by Interlink volumes. Interlink volumes were down due to lapping a significant win in the fourth quarter of FY15, as well as PIN debit routing choices by acquirers and merchants. Excluding Interlink volumes, the US debit growth rate stepped up by 3 points, due to USAA and rising gas prices. Gas prices added approximately 1 point to both credit and debit payment volume growth in the US.</p><p>As reported, Q1 international payment volumes grew 70.5% in constant dollars. The step-down in the growth rate from the last quarter is the result of the exclusion of co-badge volumes in Europe. As you know, effective June 9, 2016, Article 8 of the EU Interchange Fee Regulation states that payment networks cannot impose reporting requirements or the obligation to pay fees on payment transaction where their payment brand is present but their network is not used.</p><p>Prior to this regulation, Visa collected a small service fee in a few countries, particularly France, on domestic payment transactions where Visa cards are co-badged with the domestic network. France and Europe continue to report co-badge volume through the quarter ended September 2016. However, effective the December 2016 quarter, Visa co-badge volumes in Europe are no longer included in our reported payment volumes.</p><p>Item 2 in our operational performance data package will help you adjust for this change. As you can see, excluding co-badge volumes, European payment volume growth stepped up from 7% last quarter to 9%. There was strength across Europe, and especially in the UK. Payment volume growth rate in Asia was up 1.6 percentage points, driven by India, Japan, and Australia. Our SEMEA region growth rate was higher by over 3 points, helped by the Middle East and some improvement in Africa.</p><p>The only region with a slow-down in growth was Latin America, pulled down by continuing weakness in Brazil. Adding in Europe to last year's payment volumes and adjusting for co-badge volumes -- in other words, on a comparable and normalized basis -- constant-dollar global payment volume growth accelerated by 1.5 percentage points in Q1, versus the last year -- versus the last quarter.</p><p>On a reported basis, cross-border volumes grew 140%, driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis, constant-dollar cross-border growth globally was 12%, up 2 points from the last quarter. This information is provided in item three of our operational performance data package. US cross-border growth in constant dollars hit double digits for the first time since the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>The strong dollar drove robust out-bound commerce from the US, especially into Mexico, Canada, and the UK. Our large US acquired business was stable, benefiting from commerce in from Canada and parts of Latin America. The weak pound is driving significant in-bound commerce into the UK from all parts of the globe.</p><p>Euro zone cross-border growth rates remain healthy, helped by a weakening euro. Cross-border commerce was strong across most of Asia, especially out-bound from Australia and Southeast Asia. Other high-growth corridors were out-bound commerce from Russia and eastern Europe. Overall, the cross-border business was an important contributor to our Q1 out-performance.</p><p>On a reported basis, global process transactions grew 44%, driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis, global process transactions grew 13%, up 1 point from the last quarter. US process transactions grew 11% due to Costco and USAA. De-monetization in India drove the increase in international process transaction growth. European process transactions were stable.</p><p>Through January 28, US payment volumes are up almost 13% in constant dollars. Normalized for Visa Europe, constant-dollar cross-border volumes grew 13%, and process transaction growth was 14%. As you can see, first-quarter growth trends remain intact so far in Q2.</p><p>A quick review of Q1 financial results. Service revenues grew 17%. Service revenue growth was helped by the announced price increase on US-acquired debit card service fees, offset by negative currency translation impact. Service revenue growth is lower than payment volume growth we reported in the September quarter, reflecting the fact that service revenue yields are substantially lower in Europe than in the legacy Visa business.</p><p>Data processing revenues grew 28%. Once again, transaction revenue growth is lower than processed transaction growth, reflecting the lower yield on European process transactions relative to the legacy Visa business. India demonetization doubled transaction volumes, but did not contribute much to revenues in Q1. As you may be aware, in response to a request from the Indian government, Visa voluntarily charged no fees for processing through December 31, 2016.</p><p>International revenue grew 44%. This is up from the September quarter growth rate, driven by cross-border volume acceleration, higher than average currency volatility, offset by an unfavorable exchange rate impact. Other revenues grew 2%. Other revenues no longer include Visa Europe license fees.</p><p>Client incentives came in well below our guidance range of 20.5% to 21.5%. This is all due to timing of deals being done in the US, Asia, and Europe. Many of these renewals will be executed in the second quarter, shifting these client incentive payments from the first quarter into the second quarter. Lower client incentives due to delayed deals added approximately $0.02 to our EPS in Q1.</p><p>Expenses grew 16%, due to the inclusion of Visa Europe. There were some shifts in marketing and technology spending to upcoming quarters. In addition, as Europe completed the consultation process, new hiring, growth projects, and integration activities were modestly delayed. Delayed expenses added $0.01 to the first-quarter EPS. These expenses will be incurred through the balance of the year. Our tax rate was 30.5%, driving EPS of $0.86, up 23% on an adjusted basis.</p><p>As we look ahead, two significant counter-valing trends will drive our results. Strong business momentum, especially cross-border growth, is a tail wind. The strengthening of the dollar and the weakening of the euro are head winds. The cross-border recovery is broad-based, and accelerated in the first quarter. We hope this will be sustained. This is a higher-yielding revenue stream, which improves our revenue mix.</p><p>Continued strength of the dollar is a risk to monitor. Treasury volatility staying about long-term averages, as it did in the first quarter, will also help. The broad acceleration in payment volumes globally is another reason for optimism.</p><p>The counter-trend is exchange rates. Based on spot rates and the forward curve, the dollar has strengthened around 4% versus our major currencies since September. The stronger dollar is a stiffer head wind than we expected. Our hedging program will offset some of the negative impact.</p><p>The euro has weakened almost 5% versus the dollar since September. Since we did not own Visa Europe until late June, we are not hedged on our euro exposure. In addition, the euro is now a functional currency for us, and we can only do economic hedges, which could add volatility rather than dampen it. As such, we may choose to stay un-hedged on our euro exposure.</p><p>The weakening of the euro will hurt Europe results as reported in dollars more than we expected last September. This trend, counter-trend of favorable business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shifts, drive our FY17 outlook.</p><p>For the second quarter, where resuming payment volume momentum will be sustained, the strong dollar could cause some moderation in cross-border growth. Client incentive spend will step up with the deals that are shifting into the second quarter from the first quarter. We expect client incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be well within our guidance range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Expense growth rates are expected to be higher than the first quarter, as we ramp up spending in Europe, and delayed initiatives in technology and marketing move into the second quarter.</p><p>For the full year FY17, we are reaffirming the ranges we previously provided for nominal revenue and EPS growth. We expect that stronger business fundamentals will offset stiffer currency head winds. We have increased the likely currently translation drag on our reported revenue and EPS growth rate by 1 point versus prior estimates.</p><p>While client incentives were lower than expected in the first quarter, we expect client incentive as a percentage of gross revenues to be very much in the 20.5% to 21.5% range for the year. Other elements of our outlook for the year, operating margins and tax rates, remain unchanged.</p><p>We continue to work on tax and repatriation strategies related to the Visa Europe acquisition, as we've told you before. If and when we are able to execute a tax reorganization, we will let you know what its impact will be on future tax rates, and cash debt management plans.</p><p>Visa Europe revenue and operating income are tracking well, despite the negative impact of the weaker euro. Integration plans are modestly behind schedule, due to a longer consultation process. With the employee consultation process now complete, the reorganization is being executed. Technology integration planning is on track. Discussions continue with clients to ensure that our pricing stays competitive post the elimination of rebates, as well as to extend existing contracts. Even as this process is under way, it is important to note that the vast majority of our volume in Europe remains under contract.</p><p>In summary, FY17 is off to a good start. Strong business fundamentals are helping overcome unfavorable exchange rates. We hope this trend will continue through the year. With that, I will turn this back to Jack.</p><p>JACK CARSKY: Thanks, Vasant. At this time, May, we're ready to take questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.</p><p>(Operator Instructions)</p><p>Bob Napoli.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY: Thank you very much. Al, congratulations on a very nice quarter. You really have accelerated momentum since you have become CEO, so congratulations on that.</p><p>AL KELLY: Team effort, but thank you, Bob.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: The question is on client incentives. The change in client incentives from last year to this year, what percentage of that is from the integration from the Visa Europe acquisition versus other items, like Costco or just general business conditions? And do you expect as we look to FY18, 2019 to see that percentage continue to increase?</p><p>AL KELLY: As we said on our call last quarter, we said it was roughly half due to Europe, and some of it is how the accounting works when you remove rebates and replace them with [client] incentive. And the rest was driven by Costco USAA and also renewals that we expect this year. So, nothing has changed much on those fronts.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: As far as the longer-term outlook? The trend into 2018. Sorry.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: I think it's too early to talk about that. We will certainly get into all that as we get to later in the year and talk about next year. As you know, we are tracking below our range in the first quarter, so you should (inaudible) with that and it will catch up in future quarters this year.</p><p>BOB NAPOLI: Thank you very much.</p><p>AL KELLY: Thanks, Bob.</p><p>OPERATOR: Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW.</p><p>SANJAY SAKHRANI, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS, INC.: Thanks. I was wondering if we get more color on where you guys are with the pricing initiatives in Europe, for the year.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: You know, they are moving ahead with plans we had, and some of it, as we told you before, we don't plan to announce them per se in calls like these. Certainly, in the market in Europe people are well aware of what we have done.</p><p>As we said in our comments, we are engaged with all our clients and issuers and acquirers in Europe on all these issues, they're ongoing discussions. We're happy with how things are going. And as far as that is concerned, we are very much on track in terms of everything we wanted to do.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.</p><p>JASON KUPFERBERG, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: Thanks, guys. Just in light of the longer consultation period in Europe and a little bit of the delay in the integration, is 2% to 3% EPS accretion from Visa Europe still the right number?</p><p>AL KELLY: I think that's certainly what we're continuing to target, Jason.</p><p>OPERATOR: George Mihalos from Cowen.</p><p>GEORGE MIHALOS, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great, thanks. Nice to see the encouraging trends pretty much across the globe.</p><p>Curious within the US market and others, I know there's a number of deals that are still ramping up. On an apples-to-apples basis, are you seeing an acceleration on the part of your issuers in trying to push more credit products and maybe the volume you're seeing again on a same-store sales basis ex Costco and USAA?</p><p>AL KELLY: Given the continued amount of attention reward products are getting, we're certainly seeing that our issuers are very focused on the credit card segment, for sure.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: [General] credit growth rates when you normalize for all things that are, as you said, adds to our business, the underlying growth trend is higher in credit than debit and is roughly stable quarter over quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research.</p><p>CRAIG MAURER, ANALYST, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Yes, hi, thanks. I was hoping with all the noise in the numbers, you could help us see through to some level of organic growth for the European franchise. Thanks.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: We've tried to do our best to give you the business drivers, so if you go to our operational performance package, what you will see is that European payment volumes grew two points faster than they did last quarter. So, it was 7% growth last quarter, 9% this quarter, and that is item 2 in the operational performance data, so you can see that.</p><p>And then in the commentary we talked about cross-border been quite strong in Europe. We are seeing a huge amount of inbound commerce into the UK, certainly helped by the pound. Generally speaking, cross-border across Europe is quite strong. Helped by the weakening euro, Europe is definitely a beneficiary of a lot of inbound commerce.</p><p>And then in terms of transactions, I think you heard us say in our comments that transaction growth rates in Europe were stable. We're moving very well in terms of all the other actions you want to take in Europe, as it relates to cost and so on.</p><p>So, all in all, as Al said earlier, we feel very good about both Europe's financial performance and also the accretion that we anticipated this year. We are on track to do as well as or better than we had assumed we would this year.</p><p>GEORGE MIHALOS: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Darrin Peller from Barclays.</p><p>DARRIN PELLER, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks, guys. Just a little bit of a followup on that, and then on the incentive side again. First, can you help us understand, is there a way that you can tell us what the pro forma growth revenue growth rate would've been had you owned Visa Europe this time last year?</p><p>And then part of your guidance obviously some seems predicated on, as you said, Vasant, incentives being notably higher than the run rate in both fourth quarter and now the first quarter was the same as a percentage of gross. You had USAA and Costco both in there.</p><p>I know a lot of the European banks were done already. Why would it increase that level? Thanks again, guys.</p><p>AL KELLY: There were a couple of deals that we thought would close in the first quarter that have just drifted into the second quarter. And a couple of them are big deals outside of the United States. And so, we have pretty good insight to what the second quarter is going to look like, based on the fact that these deals are either have closed or were at the very last level of red-lining the deal.</p><p>We have pretty good insight. So, I think the guidance that you heard from Vasant is good guidance.</p><p>In terms of the first part of your question, we are not in a position to start getting into a lot of the detail on Visa Europe individually, and I think we are very excited to have moved to a one-Visa concept that is quickly as we possibly can. We are going to be happy to able to talk about it on a total global company basis.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to divide up the reports, the financial reports into this is Visa Europe's performance separately. We try to help you as much as we could in the business drivers to give you a feel for how Europe is performing and how the business is actually performing on an organic basis if you adjust for Europe. And then I think the other question you asked was why would we expect incentives to be higher this year than the fourth-quarter of last year.</p><p>It's a variety of reasons, some of which we walked through on the call last time. Some of it has to do with all the accounting for the rebates worked, post the acquisition of Visa Europe. It's Visa Europe coming into our numbers, it is Costco and USAA being in there for the full year, and it's some of these renewals that we were anticipating this year that Al mentioned.</p><p>So, what we told you is what we still expect. And that's why we indicated that what you saw in the first quarter was a result of some delays, but the overall full-year expectation for client incentives does not change.</p><p>OPERATOR: Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Hi, thank you. I will ask on the debit routing modification that caught a lot of news when it was announced in December.</p><p>With you taking up guidance here, does it seem to be a big issue from a P&amp;L standpoint? Just curious if you can comment on how impactful that modification or clarification has been or could be to your P&amp;L. Thanks.</p><p>AL KELLY: Per the request of the FTC, we made the clarification, but I think that for the most part, we were acting in the appropriate fashion. But we have seen very little impact of any meaningful level on the business, whatsoever.</p><p>OPERATOR: Dan Perlin, RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>DAN PERLIN, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Hi, quick question on India. You talked about significantly increasing transactions, but not driving much revenue, and part of that was a function of the Indian government asking you guys to keep prices subdued for a little period of time.</p><p>I'm wondering, as you think about the guidance that you just gave us, are you assuming more normalized pricing in that horizon? If not, when would you expect that to somewhat normalize in your opinion?</p><p>AL KELLY: I think we are assuming some pricing in that model. I don't think we are -- I would say, being fairly conservative in what we expect to be able to gain in terms of revenue. This is, I think for us, very importantly and strategically, this is a build opportunity that the government really has put out there in front of us.</p><p>And so, in my mind, at this point, I am much more focused on capitalizing on this opportunity and investing heavily behind driving both awareness for consumers and incentive for merchants to get signed up. There's only a very fractional amount of the merchant community in India that is enabled today to be able to accept electronic or digitized payments. And we want to try to get that number up as much as we possibly can.</p><p>I think when you consider the economics of the investments we'll make in India, plus a fairly conservative pricing, it's certainly not going to be a market in this fiscal year that is going to drive a lot of profit for us. But I think it's a great year for us to make sure that we do everything we can in one of the two largest-population countries in the world to get as good a position as we can to help us over the next decade.</p><p>DAN PERLIN: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ken Bruce, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>KEN BRUCE, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thanks, good afternoon. My question also relates to Europe. I'm hoping you might be able or willing to compare and contrast the go-to-market strategy with the issuers, and how -- what you are doing or what you plan to do in Europe differs from the US.</p><p>You pointed out that you've got a very incentive-driven market here in the US, and you are able, you've been very successful in terms of using the interchange framework here to drive a lot of issuer wins. Can you maybe help us understand how you are attacking Europe differently?</p><p>AL KELLY: I think, Ken, Europe is almost a number of different segments in and of itself. Europe for us right now is hugely dominated by the UK, where we have most of the debit market taken up. Then there is four or five other markets across the EU where we have a reasonable amount of business.</p><p>And then there's a number of big economies, certainly Germany being one example, where it's still a heavy cash society, where I think we've got a lot of opportunity, in the medium to longer term, to see more of commerce digitized or in some form of electronic form. Europe is also different than the United dates in terms of processing. Where there are in certain markets domestic processing schemes, and we've got a strategy to try to win more processing volume in Europe, as well.</p><p>So, we are engaging I would say, hopefully, what I believe to be a thoughtful segmented approach with different issuers, and different acquirers on a country-by-country basis, because each of these countries is different. And having spent most of my life as an issuer, on the issuing side of the business, I know full well that the issuing business is really a local consumer business, and you've got to figure out the right strategy on a market-by-market basis. We are not going to have a pan-European strategy, it's really going to be a market-by-market strategy within Europe.</p><p>OPERATOR: Lisa Ellis from Bernstein.</p><p>LISA ELLIS, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO.: Hi, good afternoon. Al, I just wanted to ask you if you wouldn't mind commenting on two areas that you did not explicitly mention in the strategy that you laid out. One is Visa's expansion into adjacent markets, like remittance or potentially into B2B, and what your plans are there.</p><p>And then secondly, when you mentioned partnerships you did not call out the big tech firms, like Apple, PayPal, Alipay, et cetera. I'm curious if you have a comment there. Thanks.</p><p>AL KELLY: On the latter, Lisa, I think I maybe shorthanded it, but I did say that we are working with all the pays. And so, it's all of those pays. And we are at different stages of relationship with all of them, but obviously they're increasingly important payment people in the payments ecosystem as mobile devices become an important form factor in the digital world. So, absolutely, we are working with them.</p><p>Look, I think there is a lot of vectors for growth for Visa. And the whole commercial space and disbursements of different kinds and business-to-business kinds of payments are very much on our radar screen. We have a group of people headed by a very senior person who is dedicated to this space now.</p><p>We are not as strong a player as we would like to be, but we are staffed up and spending a lot of time on this issue. And it's something that we do want to get a stronger position in the whole commercial and B2B space.</p><p>OPERATOR: Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities.</p><p>MOSHE KATRI, ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Thanks for taking my question. Can we get an update on the PayPal agreement in terms of where we are, and in that context, going back to Visa Europe, have we seen any change in issuer attrition while you are renewing your book there? Thanks a lot.</p><p>AL KELLY: In terms of the latter question first, I think either in mine or Vasant's remarks, we talk about the fact that a lot of our issuer volume in Visa Europe is under contract. So, we actually bought Visa Europe at a time where we've got a pretty good book of business that is going to be with us for a while. That said, as I said in my remarks, I am very much a client-focused person, we're going to work hard with every single one of our clients in Europe as well as around the world; but we do have a lot of good long-term relationships locked up.</p><p>In terms of PayPal, I'd say that everything is progressing as planned. Our issuer clients who are very important to us, obviously, are engaged with PayPal and they are working to migrate customers off of ACH back onto their cards. PayPal has been executing marketing campaigns, changes in their user experience to make it much easier for Visa card holders to pay with their Visa card and to make it their default payment option.</p><p>OPERATOR: Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities.</p><p>ERIC WASSERSTROM, ANALYST, GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES LLC: Thanks very much. My question, Vasant, is just on the use of CP and short-term debt rather than the debt issuance that you had planned. What motivated that decision, [briefly] given that the rate environment presumably would be pretty good still for term debt?</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: The fact is that we have offshore cash, and let's say we issued $2 billion of long-term debt and were able to repatriate somewhere [in the region] of $8 billion of offshore cash, either because there is a change in the rules that allows it to happen tax efficiently, or because we are able to as part of our -- some thoughts and ideas we have on the reorganization in Europe, been able to repatriate cash. We would have more cash than we need to keep for settlement guarantees and all that.</p><p>And that excess cash is available. So, that is the reason to wait a bit, and see whether we want to use our own cash rather than lock in more long-term debt. This is something we monitor on a regular basis, and if there any changes on that front, we will certainly let you know.</p><p>OPERATOR: Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.</p><p>BRYAN KEANE, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Hi, just want to ask, in the US debit market you talked about some headwinds due to the PIN debit routing choices. Is that a shift from Interlink to other EFT networks? Or are you guys seeing or think you are going to see a switch in the market towards more pin versus signature?</p><p>And quickly secondly, on cross-border volume, what are you guys expecting exactly in the guidance, continue at these elevated levels or to fall back down? Thanks.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: On the first question, what we talked about was really that our signature debit business actually stepped up in growth rates by 3 points this quarter. That's driven a lot by USAA. All we were referring to was switch-away from our PIN debit volume, which would be Interlink volume.</p><p>Some of it is because either the Interlink volume declined this quarter as it did last quarter, some of it we told you was because we were lapping a significant win from the fourth-quarter of 2015. And then some of it was because volume moved to other PIN debit networks, so it is all around volume away from our PIN debit network, or hard comparisons for our PIN debit volumes, versus prior years.</p><p>So, that was the answer on that one. What was the other question?</p><p>BRYAN KEANE: Cross-border volume.</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: I think as I said in my comments, the first 28 months, cross-border volume is certainly holding up. The first 28 days of January, cross-border volumes growth was certainly holding up.</p><p>But the dollar has strengthened, so our go-forward assumptions assume that a cross-border growth rate is healthy, but perhaps a little bit of a moderation in the rate of growth than what we saw in the first quarter. So, we will wait and see.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jason Deleeuw, Piper Jaffray.</p><p>JASON DELEEUW, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY &amp; CO.: Thanks. I was hoping to get an update on Visa Checkout, what some of the current investments are right now on the consumer merchant side. What is the longer-term vision for Visa Checkout, and how does that fit in with the partnerships with the other pays? Thank you.</p><p>AL KELLY: We think of Visa Checkout as a platform, and it's all part of us trying to make sure that we are a leader in terms of bringing potential solutions to the market. Because we feel very good about the fact that we now are up to $18 million users signed up for Visa Checkout. It happens to also be a very active base of customers in terms of usage of Visa Checkout.</p><p>We are facilitating more of our issuer clients to put their products side by side embedded within Visa Checkout. And at this stage, the pays are out there obviously doing their thing, as well. And we are going to continue to work with them.</p><p>I think it's too early to tell how all of this is going to shake out. My personal view is that there are too many wallets out there, consumers are not going to ultimately want to have 50 wallets, and we are not necessarily anxious to be in the wallets business, per se. But we are anxious to be -- to take advantage of us being a trusted acceptance mark in the payments eco space, and want to be able to make sure that we are taking a leading position in establishing Visa as a trusted mark, and as an important partners to our issuers, in terms of them trying to establish as much volume as they can get in the digital space.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>JAMES SCHNEIDER, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Wondering if you could maybe comment on the impact broadly that you expect from the Trump administration and other congressional policies. Both in terms of tax policy, regulatory impacts, or other impacts, and maybe talk about some of the largest positive or largest potentially negative things you can see in the future.</p><p>AL KELLY: Jim, I think it's too early to tell. We are barely two weeks into this presidency. And while the president has been active with executive orders, I think as things start to settle down and we get into more specific policies, and his cabinet is confirmed and in place, and the legislature gets going, I think it remains to be seen what happens.</p><p>I will tell you this, that we have a world-class group of government relations people, we are already fully engaged as much as we can in the relevant conversations in Washington. But I think there are things that relate to trade, relate to taxes, all of which could play into our business, but I honestly think it's too early to start to speculate. And we're certainly not building anything into our plans, positively or negatively for that matter, related to any policies that might come out. But I can assure you that we are watching it very closely.</p><p>JACK CARSKY: Thanks, Jim.</p><p>OPERATOR: James Faucette, Morgan Stanley.</p><p>JAMES FAUCETTE, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thank you very much. Wanted to follow up on that. You talked about having visited with a lot of customers, as well as government officials, et cetera, around the world since you've taken on the CEO role.</p><p>Can you talk and summarize a little bit what the particular regulators are asking from Visa, and what their objectives are, and how Visa can help fulfill those? And I guess what has happened in India creates an interesting lens through which to view that, so, maybe you can elaborate a little bit on some of those relations, et cetera. Thanks.</p><p>AL KELLY: I have talked to regulators in both very developed markets, as well as regulators in developing and emerging markets, and I think that the content and tenor of the conversations is a bit different, depending upon who you talk to. There are governments around the world who very much are seeking a close partnership with us. Their desirous of learning how they can be helped in moving to a much more of a cashless society.</p><p>How they can get many more of the people in their countries actually engaged in a financial system, how there could be greater financial literacy. And so, in those particular cases, I would say that we are trying to take a very active role, and in some cases a very proactive role, in helping shape how the government thinks about what steps they ought to take.</p><p>Including, by the way, in some cases working with governments to have them be a role model by making sure that they are moving away from paper in favor of a digitized world. So, for example, in Egypt instead of vouchers being handed out, giving people prepaid cards so that they can in fact begin to start to have an experience with plastic. And what that does is it automatically start setting up and incenting a whole merchant network to get built out as these people have to have a place to go to be able to spend their money that is on these prepaid cards. And merchants in this particular example, who are involved in food and beverage, for instance, want to be able to get their fair share of that volume. So they are very quickly incented to get to a point where they can accept plastic and be signed up as a merchant.</p><p>In more developed countries, there are countries where the ship has sailed, and they've made decision on interchange, as an example. Probably Australia and Europe being two real examples there, where I think now it's just a matter of what does that mean and how does that play out for issuers and consumers in those markets?</p><p>I think there are countries that I've talked to, where there is pressure on both sides of, say, the finance ministers in countries where some of the merchant coalitions want to see lower interchange. But in markets, for example, where reward propositions are big on plastic, or on whatever form of payment vehicle it is, the consumer is going to get hurt in terms of those programs if interchange is lowered, because it's a two-sided market. The economics sector, there's only so much economics and people do what they'll have to do to make sure that they stay economically viable.</p><p>So, I think there are a number of markets where, truthfully, the government is trying to stay out of it and let the free market system takeover. And I think in general, there is markets where the regulators are taking a very active role, and in other cases, I think, a much more passive role. Again, often quite different, depending on the specific country we are talking about.</p><p>JACK CARSKY: Thanks, James. We have time for one more question.</p><p>OPERATOR: Tom McCrohan from CLSA.</p><p>TOM MCCROHAN, ANALYST, CLSA: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. You've covered so much ground on the call, I will ask a simple question. Total integration cost of $450 million to $500 million over the next three years, any change to that?</p><p>VASANT PRABHU: We said it was $80 million this year, we will wait and see how things go, and give you any updates as we get towards the end of the year on future outlook. But at this point, really, we wouldn't say anything different about the future. We expect that we will spend the $80 million we thought we would spend this year.</p><p>TOM MCCROHAN: Thank you.</p><p>JACK CARSKY: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to call Investor Relations.</p><p>And when we have a set date for our June investor day, we will put that out in the public domain. Thank you, all.</p><p>AL KELLY: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

And want to sort of say that we announced this morning a very stellar set of results. Record net profit of $1.52 billion, up 26% on broad-based growth. So -- and return on equity was 13%, the highest in the decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To tell us more today, we have with us our CEO. Piyush Gupta; and our CFO, Chng Sok Hui.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So without further ado, Sok Hui, please.</p><p>SOK HUI LIM, CFO, DBS GROUP HOLDINGS LTD: Hey, good morning, everyone. We achieved record earnings of $1.52 billion for the first quarter, up 26% from a year ago and up 25% from the previous quarter. The increase was driven by broad-based growth in total income of 16% from a year ago and 10% from the previous quarter to $3.36 billion.</p><p>Net interest income rose 4% from the previous quarter on a day-adjusted basis from higher net interest margin and loan volumes. Net interest margin improved 5 basis points during the quarter to 1.83% where loans grew 2% or $8 billion. Compared to a year ago, net interest income was up 16%.</p><p>Fee income rose to a record $744 million, up 12% from a year ago, led by wealth management fees and cards. Fee income was up 17% from the previous quarter as most fee streams were higher.</p><p>The cost-to-income ratio improved 1 percentage point from a year ago to 42%. Excluding [ANZ] and a nonrecurring item, underlying expenses were 6% higher than a year ago. Return on equity rose to 13.1%, the highest in a decade.</p><p>With interest rates and allowance charges reverting to more normalized levels, the results demonstrate the success of our assets over the years to improve the structural profitability of our franchise.</p><p>Asset quality was benign. Total allowances were 18% below a year ago as specific allowances declined to 20 basis points of loans. The amount of nonperforming assets fell 4% from the previous quarter, with new NPA formation at a 4-year low.</p><p>The NPL rate improved slightly from the previous quarter to 1.6%. Our capital and liquidity remained strong, with ratios remaining well above regulatory requirements.</p><p>This quarter's year-on-year comparisons are affected by a significant 7% average depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar from a year-ago period. This had the impact of lowering the key reported profit and loss line items by 3 percentage points from the actual change. The numbers on this chart are based on reported currency.</p><p>Compared to a year ago, total income rose 16% or $474 million to $3.36 billion. Net interest income increased 16% or $297 million to $2.13 billion. Net interest margin rose 9 basis points to 1.83% from loan pricing in line with the higher interest rates.</p><p>Loans grew 13% or $39 billion to $328 billion. The growth was broad-based across corporate, trade and consumer loans.</p><p>Net fee income grew 12% or $79 million to $744 million. It was led by the 31% underlying increase in wealth management fees from higher bancassurance and investment product sales. Card fees were also higher partly due to the consolidation of ANZ.</p><p>Other noninterest income rose 25% or $98 million to $488 million. There was a gain of $86 million from the sale of a property in Hong Kong. Trading income was also higher. These gains were partially offset by lower gains on investment securities.</p><p>Expenses rose 12% or $150 million to $1.40 billion, which included ANZ and a nonrecurring cost item. Excluding these factors, the underlying expenses were up 6%. The positive [jaw] resulted in a 20% increase in profits before allowances to $1.96 billion. Total current allowances were $36 million lower at $164 million as asset quality improved.</p><p>On constant currency basis, total income was up 19%, and net profit was up 28%. The quarter-on-quarter comparisons are affected by a 3% average depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar from the previous quarter. This had the impact of lowering the key reported profit and loss [line items] by 1 percentage point from the actual change. The numbers on this chart are based on the reported currency. Compared to the previous quarter, total income was 10% or $305 million higher from strong business momentum. Net interest margin was 4% higher on a day-adjusted basis.</p><p>Loans grew 2% while net interest margin rose 5 basis points to 1.83%. Fee income was 17% or $108 million higher. The growth was broad-based, led by -- broad-based and led by a 46% increase in wealth management and a 29% increase in loan-related fees.</p><p>Other noninterest income was 52% or $166 million higher as the property disposal gain and an improvement in trading income was partially offset by lower gains from investment securities.</p><p>Expenses are 3% or $41 million higher. The positive jaw resulted in a 16% increase in profits before allowances to $1.96 billion. Total allowances of [$164 million] were 27% below the previous quarter. On constant currency basis, total income was up 11% while net profit was up 26%.</p><p>This chart shows the growth in various income streams over the year-ago period. Business momentum, which had accelerated in the second half of last year, was sustained during the quarter. Total income rose $474 million from a year ago. The size of the increase was greater than all 4 quarters of 2017. Net interest income continued to be the biggest contributor to growth. This was due to a sustained increase in net interest margin compared to the year-ago period as well as steady loan growth.</p><p>Net interest margin has been rising year-on-year since second half 2017 after bottoming during the middle of last year. Noninterest income contributed more to growth during the first quarter than the 4 quarters of 2017.</p><p>Fee income growth continued to be healthy. The difference was in other noninterest income, which rose during the quarter as a result of an improvement in trading income as well as the property disposal gain. As a 16% year-on-year growth in total income during the first quarter was significantly above the 4 quarters of 2017, the growth in profit before allowances was also substantially higher at 20%.</p><p>Net interest income of $2.13 billion was 4% higher than the previous quarter on a day-adjusted basis. Contributing to the strong growth was a higher net interest margin, which rose 5 basis points from the previous quarter to 1.83%. We benefited from high interest rates in all our major currencies, the Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar and Hong Kong dollar. This resulted in a repricing of loans across the board. The increase in loan yields was partially offset by higher deposit costs for U.S. dollar and Hong Kong dollar fixed deposits.</p><p>We are maintaining our guidance for full year NIM of at least 1.85% compared to the full year 2017 NIM of 1.75%. This is predicated on 2 to 3 more U.S. Fed rate increases and a meaningful pass-through to SIBOR and SOR as well as the impact of higher LIBOR and HIBOR rates than last year.</p><p>We had underlying loan growth of $7 billion or 2% during the quarter. In addition, we consolidated $1 billion of unsecured loans from ANZ in Indonesia, bringing total loan growth to $8 billion. The underlying growth was led by non-trade corporate loans for property transactions in Singapore and Hong Kong, deal-related borrowing and working capital financing. Singapore housing loans also continued to increase but at slower pace than the fourth quarter, in line with market trends.</p><p>Our market share of housing loans increased during the quarter. Underlying loan growth for the full year was $30 billion or 10% from increases in corporate, trade and consumer loans. Including $9 billion from ANZ, full year loan growth was $39 billion or 13%.</p><p>Deposits rose 2% during the quarter and 13% from a year ago in constant currency terms to $376 billion. They included $12 billion from the consolidation of ANZ, of which $1 billion was from Indonesia in the first quarter. Other funding rose $2 billion during the quarter to $43 billion from issuances of medium-term notes.</p><p>Our liquidity ratios remain well above regulatory requirements. The liquidity coverage ratio was 125% while the net stable funding ratio was at 110%.</p><p>Gross fee income was $851 million, 15% higher than a year ago. Wealth management fees rose by an underlying 31% to a new high of $331 million. The growth was partly due to the addition of the ANZ customer base. 2/3 of the increase was from investment products, including unit trust as buoyant market sentiment boosted demand. The remaining 1/3 was from bancassurance.</p><p>Card fees were 27% higher at $156 million from higher transactions in Singapore as well as the consolidation of the ANZ, particularly in Taiwan and Indonesia. Transaction services fees were a little changed at $156 million as an 11% increase in cash management fees was offset by a decline in trade finance. Cash management accounted for about 60% of transaction services fees during the quarter compared to about half in the year-ago period.</p><p>Investment banking and loan-related fees both declined due to fewer significant transactions compared to a year ago. Compared to the previous quarter, total gross fees was 16% higher. The increase was broad-based and was led by wealth management.</p><p>Institutional Banking's total income rose 5% in constant currency terms from a year ago to $1.36 billion. As the average U.S. dollar depreciated 7% against the Singapore dollar compared to a year ago, Institutional Banking's reported total income growth was 3%. The constant-currency growth for IBG's profit and loss and balance sheet items on this chart are about 3 percentage points higher than the reported growth.</p><p>Cash management income grew 40% from new customer mandates and deeper customer relationships, with the introduction of new products and solutions through digital channels. In addition, while cash management deposits were up 1% to $134 billion, there was a shift towards lower-cost deposits out of more expensive ones, resulting in a higher net interest margin.</p><p>The increase in lower-cost deposits was broad-based across all segments, particularly from SME customers. The higher margin of these deposits contributed to the 9% increase in SME customer segment income to $455 million. The increase in cash management income was offset by moderate declines in other products, including loans from lower net interest margin, trade volumes and treasury customer sales.</p><p>Consumer Banking and Wealth Management total income rose 19% in constant currency terms from a year ago to a new high of $1.36 billion. The constant-currency growth of CBG's profit and loss items and AUM on this chart, [about] 3 percentage points higher than the reported growth. The growth in total income was across all key product categories. Buoyant market sentiment boosted investment product income by 25%. Card income grew 25% from growth in transactions as well as the consolidation of ANZ. The 12% increase in loan and deposit income was due to higher loan and deposit volumes as well as higher net interest margin.</p><p>Wealth management customer segment income grew 28% to $663 million. Assets under management rose 22% to $208 billion, including $22 billion from ANZ. Income from the retail customer segment increased 8% to $696 million.</p><p>Our market share in Singapore housing loans was at 31% while our market share of Singapore dollar saving deposits was maintained at 52%. Both our housing loan market share and savings deposit market share continued to show incremental improvements quarter-on-quarter.</p><p>Total treasury income of $572 million was 18% higher than a year ago in constant currency terms. The increase was 2 percentage points higher than the reported growth of 16%.</p><p>Treasury Markets income, which comprises trading, market making and structuring activities, rose by 1/3 to $249 million from the more favorable trading positions in interest rates and equities. Treasury customer income was moderately higher at $323 million. Higher income from wealth management customers was partially offset by declines in income from corporate and institutional customers.</p><p>Expenses rose 12% from a year ago to $1.40 billion. Excluding ANZ and the nonrecurring item, underlying expenses were 6% higher than a year ago. The underlying increase was due to higher headcount and other investments to support the growth in business volumes over the past year. We continue to maintain a positive jaw during the quarter as the underlying 6% increase in expenses was lower than the underlying increase in total income.</p><p>The cost/income ratio was 42%. We continue to target productivity gains from digitalization and cost management initiatives and expect the cost/income ratio to progressively improve over time.</p><p>Hong Kong. In constant currency terms, Hong Kong's earnings doubled to $436 million as total income increased 48% to $721 million. Excluding the property gain, earnings increased 66% to $350 million while total income grew 31% to $635 million. Earnings and total income, excluding the property gain, were both at new highs. The increase in total income was broad-based.</p><p>In constant currency terms, net interest income rose 24% to $402 million. Loans grew 20% from lending to large corporate customers. Net interest margin increased 8 basis points to 1.87% as loans were repriced with higher LIBOR and HIBOR rates.</p><p>The deposit franchise improved further as the proportion of CASA deposits increased 5 percentage points over the 12 months to 63%, driven by 32% year-on-year growth in CASA deposits.</p><p>Fee income rose 24% in constant currency terms to $166 million. The increase was led by sales of Wealth Management investment products, bancassurance and cash management. Excluding the property gain, other noninterest income more than doubled in constant currency terms to $67 million from higher treasury customer sales and trading gains.</p><p>Expenses rose less than income, and the positive jaw resulted in a 79% constant-currency increase in profits before allowances to $489 million. Excluding the property gain, profit before allowances rose 48% in constant currency terms to $403 million, which was also a record.</p><p>There were [allowances write-back] totaling $18 million for both impaired and non-impaired portfolios compared to a charge of $20 million a year ago.</p><p>Nonperforming assets fell 4% from the previous quarter to $5.8 billion. New NPA formation fell to a 4-year low of under $200 million. The NPL rates improved to 1.6%.</p><p>Allowances for impaired loans or specific provisions fell to $162 million or 20 basis points of loans, below our through-the-cycle average of around 27 basis points. Most of the SP charges taken during the quarter were for existing NPLs.</p><p>The SFRS international line was implemented on 1st January 2018. One impact of the new accounting standard is the treatment of general allowances. We had $2.62 billion of general allowances on 31st December. This was equivalent to 1% of credit exposures, net of qualifying collateral under the MAS guidelines. This is the level of general loan loss reserve the MAS still requires us to maintain today after the new accounting standard implementation.</p><p>On implementation of the new standard on 1st January 2018, the stage 1 and stage 2 expected credit loss, which replaces general allowances under the new standard, was calculated to be $2.53 billion. This was $95 million lower than the 1% required by the MAS.</p><p>On the MAS Notice 612, if the expected credit loss is below 1%, the difference must be held as regulatory loss allowance reserve in shareholders' funds. As such, the $95 million was transferred to the regulatory loss allowance reserve on 1st of January 2018. During the course of the quarter, the expected credit loss rose to $2.57 billion. Of the increase, $7 million was for credit growth, net of transfers to specific provisions. This amount was taken through the profit and loss account. The remaining $40 million was taken through the balance sheet, mainly for the ANZ Indonesia expected credit loss reserve.</p><p>The 1% requirement on 31 March was calculated to be $2.72 billion. As the expected credit loss of $2.57 billion was lower, a regulatory loss allowance reserve of $150 million was required. As a result, additional $55 million was transferred out of retained earnings during the quarter to increase the RLAR to $150 million. The transfer had no impact on either the profit and loss account or the amount of shareholders' funds.</p><p>Both the ECL, the expected credit loss, and the RLAR are used in the computation of allowance coverage. The adoption of the new accounting standard also affected the classification of certain financial assets and the treatment of hedges. These 2 expected to not have a material impact for us.</p><p>Our capital ratios remain strong. The common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.0%, 10 basis points higher than the previous quarter as the accretion of retained earnings was partially offset by loan growth. After the payment of the final and special dividend of 2017 in May, the common equity Tier 1 ratio will be 13.0%, in line with our targeted range. Our leverage ratio of 7.6% was more than twice the regulatory minimum of 3%.</p><p>The result of improvement to our franchise has been masked in recent years by low interest rates and high allowance charges. With both reverting to more normalized levels, the increased profitability of our business has become more evident in the first quarter's results. The results were also underpinned by broad-based growth in loan volumes and noninterest income. Business momentum remains healthy as we continue to capture opportunities in a reflationary environment across the region.</p><p>We'll continue to maintain a positive jaw as digitalization and cost improvement initiatives deliver productivity gains over time. The gradual improvement of cost-to-income ratio will be another [lever] in enhancing returns for shareholders. At the same time, our continued focus on customer centricity and [journey] thinking will allow us to use digital technology to seamlessly integrate banking into the lives of our customers.</p><p>Our balance sheet is healthy. Asset quality is benign, with new NPA formation at a 4-year low. Our capital and liquidity are healthy. We are well placed to serve customers and deliver future -- for the shareholder returns in the coming year.</p><p>Thank you. I'll now hand you over to Piyush.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA, CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, DBS GROUP HOLDINGS LTD: Okay, thanks. Thank you, Sok Hui. I actually didn't have that many independent observations this time. As Edna and Sok Hui pointed out, it's a fairly stellar and clean set of results.</p><p>I thought, however, I would make a couple of comments on our digital agenda. The good news is that, as you know in November last year when we did our Investor Day, we've had results of our digital transformation for the first half of last year, and then we forecast what we might see for the full year. In point of fact, our actual performance for the conversion from traditional to digital for the full year outperformed the expectations that we had.</p><p>So we originally expected that we'd have about 2.3 million digital customers by year-end. We finally wound up at about 2.5 million digital customers by year-end. And our total digital income, which we'd thought we'd hit about $3.1 billion, we actually hit $3.3 billion. And so both in terms of the customer transformation as well as the income we generate from digital customers, that's continuing to track extremely well.</p><p>In Singapore, we also are having a lot of good traction from our payment franchise. In the past, I've talked about DBS Remit cross-border payments business, which is doing very well. In this quarter, the business of domestic payments through both PayNow and PayLah! in particular actually also did extremely well. We today have almost 900,000 PayLah! customers or individuals in Singapore who downloaded PayLah!. And the total PayLah! transactions have been going up extremely rapidly.</p><p>So we've reached the stage where today, we are seeing about 50,000 transactions a day, 350,000 PayLah! transactions a week, and that's broad-based. That's both person-to-person transactions as well as at the hawker stalls, at the campuses and Comfort taxicabs. So we seem to have [hit a] tipping point in terms of PayLah! adoption in Singapore in the course of the last quarter. We're actually quite pleased with that as well.</p><p>Outside Singapore, Digibank in India and Indonesia continue to grow well. We have about 1.8 million customers in India. We have -- these include wallet and savings account. I think about 700,000 of them are full savings accounts. We have about 110,000 savings account customers in Indonesia, but the performance are doing well. The average balances per account are continuing to improve quite nicely.</p><p>In the first quarter, we also launched our digital lending capability in India and an algorithmic lending product in Indonesia as well. It's very early days. They've only been in the market for less than a month, 3, 4 weeks. But again, early performance in both countries is actually quite good, so we're quite optimistic about being able to layer on these incremental products on top of our base digital and Digibank offerings.</p><p>So net-net, the first quarter continued to show good momentum with our digital transformation journey. And we are fairly confident that through the course of this year, we will continue to see the trajectory maintained. Slide.</p><p>I guess, the only other thing I'd thought I talk about is outlook for the year. I think global growth momentum is still fairly robust. The U.S. is charging along first quarter slightly slower, but on the whole, it is still very robust. Europe's disappointed a little bit in the first quarter, but it's still higher than most people expected it to be. Japan's behaving okay and so is China in the region.</p><p>So our own sense is that the global growth [reflationary] environment will continue to stay in place, which means that our opportunities that we see are [continuing] to stay before us. As you can see in the last few quarters, we've been growing our [loan book] at between $7 billion and $9 billion, roughly about $8 billion a quarter. And we think we should be in a position to continue to do that.</p><p>The pipeline's quite good. We can see -- we have line of sight to a whole range of opportunities. As Sok Hui pointed out, the opportunities are broad based. It's not just some property transactions, but there continues to be a lot of deal flow, which we are financing, and there continues to be a lot of demand for working capital. So it's fairly broad based.</p><p>What could go wrong? I guess the trade war is on everybody's mind. Our own sense is that the broader trade issues are [tired] of barriers on steel, aluminum, on cars and so on. It will have some impact, but unless there's a big crisis of confidence, we don't see them -- that having a really material impact on the overall business climate.</p><p>Other than I've written on the slide, the technology sector. I think the impact on the technology sector needs to be watched because the U.S. actions on the back of the intellectual property concerns on Chinese companies -- that could have spillover ramifications, which might be slightly broader. That could even get into the supply chain of the tech sector.</p><p>It's hard to [dimension] what the impact of that might be, but my own sense is that you will see some more noise in the technology sector though. Overall, I don't expect the trade wars to materially [derail] the economy.</p><p>(inaudible) to monetary policy. I think it's quite likely that you will see consistent trade hikes -- rate hikes this year. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised you wind up with 4 rate hikes instead of 3. The general consensus seems to be that you might see an extra rate hike in the course of the year. But given that we're coming from such low interest rate environments, it's not likely to me that you will see again a [derailing] of growth on the back of interest rate hikes this year.</p><p>If rate hikes continue into 2019, you might start seeing some greater impact and further slowdown. But I think this year, I'm relatively sanguine about the prospect for the global economy.</p><p>On NIM, we've guided before that we should expect to see full year NIM of at least 1.85%. If you wind up getting an extra fed rate hike in the course of the year, and obviously, with SIBOR, we [saw a path] to improving in the last couple of weeks. We might actually better that by 1 basis point or 2. It's kind of hard to say because I thought the main things which are variable, there's a [tab] between the OIS and the LIBOR rate. There is also (inaudible) uncertainty about the pass-through from LIBOR into both HIBOR and Sing dollar. So you can't call this exactly accurately. But based on current trendlines, I think it's a distinct possibility that we might actually better that 1.85%.</p><p>On cost-income ratio, Sok Hui pointed out, we've guided to 43%. Our first quarter is actually better, [saddled] a little bit by that property divestment, but I think we should be in a position to be able to come in at the 43%, so underlying expenses for the first quarter actually grew 6%, which is not bad. Some of that is headcount. Some of that is actually wage increase as well.</p><p>But on the whole, we think we should continue to be able to deliver good productivity. And finally, asset quality is looking very good. New entity formation is very low. We did not have to provide SPs of any meaningful order for new NPAs. We did take some SPs in the first quarter just to top up SP, mostly in India. But across the region, the overall portfolio is looking good, so I'm actually quite optimistic about the cost of credit line in the course of the year as well.</p><p>So (inaudible) when you put all of that together, it's shaping up to what I think would be a fairly strong year for DBS. Happy to take questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: This is (inaudible) from Bloomberg. The first question, how sustainable is the 13% ROE? Do you think that could continue for the rest of the year? Yes, [that is first one].</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Well, the ROE, as I said, was flattened a little bit because we did have this onetime property divestment in Hong Kong. If you back that out, then your ROE would be closer to 12.5% and not 13%. On the other hand, there's also the case that we gave up almost [$60 billion, $70 billion] on the currency -- the strong Sing dollar in the course of quarter. And as you know, next week, we will be dishing out fairly large dividend payment, which means our equity base will [sink] when that happens. So some of that should have countered the effect of the one-timer. I think when you look at our current business profile, which is structurally we're doing better and better return businesses, cash management, wealth management, et cetera, if you look at our productivity [dive], which is our cost-income ratio (inaudible) improve. I think this in the back of that, getting to a range of around 12.5% to 13% this year, I think we should be able to do. Whether we hit 13% frankly depends to a large extent on the cost of credit line. It's not entirely clear how the environment will stay the course of the year. So I think 12.5% range, [I think], fairly confident of being able to get to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, and I just move to the next question about credit. I mean, it looks like you have contained it, but do you see any possibility of credit issues building out of the oil and gas sector this year at all?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Of it spilling out of the -- out of the oil and gas sector or in the oil and gas sector?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Exactly. Outside of the oil and gas sector.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Yes, that could be because it depends on what the consequence of the rising rate -- interest rate environment is. I've often said that if interest rates go up, you should expect to see higher delinquencies in the consumer books on secured financing and in the SME books. And so depending on the pace of interest rate increase, [we] should start seeing some pickup in cost of credit for those businesses. That's what I was alluding to just now. It's not exactly clear. Will they continue to be relatively okay, which is how they've been? Or will the pop-up in the course of the year increase because interest rates increase? That answer will determine what kind of ROE we might wind with in the year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And last question. On the IBG division of the bank, the corporate -- income from the corporate side shows no growth. Is it a sector that you want to boost? And why there was no growth in this sector?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Of course, as a sector we want to boost. And actually, if you look at the underlying, the small and medium enterprises, SME part of that business actually grew very nicely. It grew 9% or 10%. What was relatively slow was the large corporate business. So the average of the growth was about 5%, which is not bad, but the large corporate business was somewhat slower, and the large corporate business has got plus and minuses. We're still trying to manage the portfolio for some of the weaker sectors and the [outstands] we have. And we're growing some parts of the business, particularly the China business and the China outbound business. We're getting some growth in loans as we speak, and I think that loan growth will be quite good. The real impact in the business was one that treasury-related revenues from customer saves in the top end of the market. Those have been slow. And second, the margins at the top end of the market have been somewhat tighter. But [absolutely] we -- we're positive on the business, and actually, we think we'll see good growth in the business in the later parts of this year.</p><p>SOK HUI LIM: And we have constant-currency growth of 5%.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Any other questions? (inaudible) Can you speak to the mic anyway?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) from (inaudible). I'm just wondering what is the impact from the trade dispute on the trade finance because MAS mentioned in their recent review that if it escalate to maybe more tariff, more coming out of it, the local banks, the trade financing could be hit. So is this something that you're looking at?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Yes, I guess when I say I expect (inaudible) because MAS is (inaudible) if it escalates, then of course, (inaudible). My view, they won't escalate. That's really why I'm saying I don't expect that the impact that they have right now on the tariff is imposed, impact about less than a couple of percentage points of actual trade between the countries. Now [they] do wind up expecting a lot more escalation in the trade war. I don't think that'll happen. I think it'll focused on the technology sector as opposed to more broad based.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: No impact or (inaudible) on the trade...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Our trade book is holding up, and our margins are continuing to increase because yields are better and our volume of trade is holding up so far.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Also another question. I think you have seen in the news that (inaudible) is growing into like consumer credit, and they're going to sell insurance products for their drivers. I don't know, maybe some passengers, so is this something -- because it's coming to Southeast Asia, what do you see the impact is to see that -- a potential competitor coming?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Yes. I think I do see a potential competitor coming. Having said that, there's something we've anticipated for the last 3 or 4 years. I've said for a period of time that you will expect to see the big tech players being our competition, not just the local banks. And as a consequence, our whole digital transformation over the last 4 years have been focused on trying to preempt some of this new competition. I'm actually confident that in these last 3, 4 years, we've been able to build up our capacities, to be able to hold our own against many of these competitors. There's a point I made about -- if you look at our PayLah! wallets, for example, we're continuing to get a lot of traction in the payments in the country, and if you look at our digital -- other digital offerings, which allow mass market people to be able to consume services, those have actually grown quite nicely as well. So yes, we do expect competition to increase, but I'm also fairly optimistic that all the work we've done in the last 3, 4 years should allow us to be able to maintain our market shares and our position.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I think earlier, Sok Hui mentioned that the [house bill] for housing loans is slowing down. Can you give more color on why it's slowing down, the growth, I think you say slowing down?</p><p>SOK HUI LIM: I think it's growth relative to previous quarters, so it's just the growth for this quarter. If you look at the charts, I think we saw $1 billion growth this quarter compared to sort of $2 billion maybe for the previous quarters. So that is the point I was making, but overall, our market share, notwithstanding the [lower] volume, show an increase for the quarter.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Listen, the -- actually compared to first quarter last year, growth is up, so on year-on-year. It's only compared to the fourth quarter last year growth is down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I wonder whether you could eliminate a little bit on the overall housing loan market, in fact, not just your share, but...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So I do for some reason. If you look at the Singapore housing loan, both drawdowns as well as bookings for the last 3 years, it tends to be very slow in the early part of the year. I think it's to do with Chinese New Year (inaudible). No, I think the [Lunar New Year] impact that since we look at this thing the market is slow in the first 2 quarters, and it picks up in the third and fourth quarter. So I think the right comparison to eliminate the seasonality is to compare first quarter this year with first quarter last year, and if you do a quarter-on-quarter comparison, actually, this year is stronger than last year. But it's lower than the fourth quarter of last year, and I think that's the seasonality effect that's kicking in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) from (inaudible). Further on the trade dispute and your trade loans. You mentioned about your concern in the tax sector. It's -- and I think you said you expect some more noise. The noise could come out without the trade war being more escalated.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: In my mind, I'm thinking of the trade war in 2 ways. One is the broader tariff barriers imposed on a range of goods and the desire to equalize the trade balance. That includes automobiles, steel, aluminum, a bunch of parts. As you know, the U.S. announced the range of [duty] on some Chinese [gold]. The Chinese announced a range of [duties], but at the same time, the Chinese have lowered the import tariffs on automobiles. For example, they've improved access to financial markets. I think after some negotiating, they will come to a situation or position which is acceptable to both parties. I think the Chinese recognize that trade surpluses are very high, and they're willing to make compromises to reduce the size of the trade surpluses, so I think you'll get a reasonable outcome on that part. I think the issues around technology are not to do with trade and balance, that they're to do more with intellectual property rights. I think there is a concern in the U.S. that the Chinese are catching up very rapidly on high-tech. And they want to be able to control that pace of the high-tech [listing] in China. IT has less to do with imbalances, less to do with protection of the technology and intellectual property. And if you look at some of the action they have on companies like ZTE and Huawei and so on and so forth, I think those are more targeted from an IP standpoint. I think that will continue to stay in place, and therefore the impact and ramification of that are less clear in my mind.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: What's the exposure of DBS loan towards that sector? How...?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Actually, the big company is not big, but you don't know what the secondary impact of that might be because the entire supply change in Taiwan, China, the people who make parts for iPhones, people who supply this thing, it's a fairly complicated supply chain. And as you speak, we're actually [continuing to do] a portfolio review of that part of the supply chain to make sure that we can -- we don't get damaged if something untoward happens.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Is that a significant...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: No, that's not the biggest...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: The last point on -- your trade loan seems to be coming down, and looking at the Page 7 of the slide. But you're saying that the trade loan is a...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: I think it must be a currency impact (inaudible). I'm seeing trade loans up $1 billion or 2% on the quarter and $7 billion up 17% on the year in the slide.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: But these are growth numbers? Those are growth numbers?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Anshuman.</p><p>ANSHUMAN DAGA: This is Anshuman from Reuters. Can you give some details about the wealth management business? It had a good run for the last 2 years -- at least the last 2 years. I mean, what's -- are you winning more market share? What's going on there?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: First of all, the wealth business across Asia is continuing to do well for everybody. I think if you are 1 of the top 10 players in Asia, you're doing well. And you can see that in the reported results of all of the Swiss banks, the large regional banks and so on. As you know, we're somewhere around #5 or 6 in Asia, and so the market grows, and we continue to grow with that. That's positive. Our platform is actually performing well. We're continuing to win business both in North Asia and Southeast Asia but also now in the Middle East and in the international markets, so the business is doing well. One of the big other boosts we got our business, we saw that when we did the SocGen acquisition 2, 3 years ago. We've seen that also in the ANZ acquisition, that our ability to increase the productivity of the new RMs, the ANZ relationship managers, that's actually been very good. And therefore, in the first countries, we integrated Singapore and Hong Kong. The ANZ RM productivity we've already brought up to the DBS RM productivity level, which is almost a doubling of their productivity at a per RM level, so that's actually been quite helpful as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Janice,] you had a question here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm [Janice] from (inaudible) Asia. With regard to the nonperforming assets, it fell compared with the previous quarter, but on a year-on-year basis, it actually rose, so can I just get a sense of what contributed to that? And also, can I just find out why the number of housing -- nonperforming assets for housing loans have increased, but the allowances have remained the same at 7, so just what's the reason for that? Yes.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: The first, as you know, we did a pretty aggressive recognition of nonperforming loans in the oil and gas sector in the third quarter of last year. If you remember, we were quite aggressive when we took a lot of loans, which are actually not over 90 days, and we categorized them as nonperforming, and we provided against them. That explains the year-on-year lift in the NPA. But -- and that was widely reported a couple of quarters ago. So the key thing to look at is the quarter-on-quarter, where actually, the NPAs are now coming off. On the housing loans, while there's some pickup in the NPAs, it also reflects a continued pickup in our size of our business. The underlying denominator for business is also increasing. As we pointed out in the last few quarters, our market share has gone up to about 31% from 24%. So the absolute NPA number will obviously go up because the size of the business is going up. But the reason (inaudible) don't go up is that there really no losses from this business. They become nonperforming, but either because they're well collateralized, our loan to values are low, or the client pays back. You don't have to book any losses against it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Clara?]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) I'd like to ask a macro question. You seem fairly sanguine on the impact of 3 and even 4 U.S. rate rises, but we saw a very agitated week for Indonesia last week. So I wondered if you could give us an idea of how you assess the impact on Indian Indonesia to important market fees, given what we saw back in 2013.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So I think it is possible that we see very volatile markets, and it is quite possible that you'll see weakness in the currency for both those countries, but given the current account and the trade deficits that there are, so that is possible. So you could see some volatility on the currency account. But as you saw in the 2013, it does not materially impact our business. So as there's a macro volatility -- net-net, DBS does very well in rising interest rate environments because our margins improve. And the size of Indonesia and India and overall book is actually not consequential. So even if there's some volatility in those 2 countries, it [doesn't] move the needle very much for us. We just do [somewhat] better in our core businesses when that happens.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I just wondered in terms of your own assessment, just macro wise, and you're obviously very familiar -- in with both of those countries, do you think they're better prepared or not...?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Actually, I think if you look at the FX reserves in both countries at a country level, they're very robust. I think Indonesia last year saw about 10 months worth of imports in FX reserves. India also has a lot of strong FX reserves. So the countries from a reserve standpoint are pretty well equipped to handle the short-term debt and the consequences of outflows. I don't think you're going to see a macroeconomic risk at a NPA level caused by this. I do think, however, that if you wind up with a weakness in the currencies, then you might see some more portfolio outflows, and you might see a position taking both in equities and fixed-income markets. I think the volatility will be in the markets more than in the underlying economy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Is there final question (inaudible)?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. Can I just follow up on [housing loan]? So can you give a sense of how new sales are this quarter or...?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: New sales are being fairly (inaudible) our total new bookings in the quarter were about $2.5 billion. Again, they're up on last year, down on the fourth quarter, but they continue to be fairly strong. And they're broad based. There's obviously some amount of resale and refinancing in that as well, but also building under construction has being quite steady.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, if there are no further questions, we'll end early today. Thank you, everyone for coming. See you next quarter.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: All right, thank you all.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

My name Rod Alfv\u00c3\u00a9n, and I'm heading up the Investor Relations.</p><p>We will start with a presentation of the group CEO and President, Mr. Casper von Koskull. Then, we will have [a fin] time. And then, we will have a Q&amp;A session with the analysts. The journalists are welcome to have individual interviews with Casper. The rest of you are welcome to stay for Q&amp;A with our new CFO, Mr. Christopher Rees and me.</p><p>So Casper, please welcome.</p><p>CASPER VON KOSKULL, PRESIDENT &amp; GROUP CEO, NORDEA BANK AB (PUBL): Yes. Welcome, everybody. Good to see you all here. Again, one quarter is behind us and 2018 has started.</p><p>If I would maybe just give one or two words on kind of the economic or the backdrop of 2018, I think it's fair to say that '17, particularly, was actually an environment very stable, very benign economic underlying environment; and when we're into '18, I think the benign economic environment is continuing, but maybe more volatility, maybe somewhat more uncertainty, certainly, in the financial markets in '18, but still a very benign economic environment in all of the 4 markets that we have.</p><p>When I look at the first quarter result, I'm pleased, because we are improving profitability. We had a weaker quarter in Q4 2017, and we're now clearly improving. Our operating income is coming up from that quarter; and more importantly, operating profit is meaningfully above the fourth quarter and actually in line with what we had a year ago, despite the fact that I said those uncertainties and the volatility that we have seen in the beginning of '18. Most importantly, we're delivering on what I call the 4 Cs; and the 4 Cs, I think, are the critical element of any bank moving forward in this environment. And the 4 Cs to me is: cost, credit, i.e., risk, risk under control, capital and compliance. Those have been our focus over the last 2.5 years, and I'm very pleased that we are delivering on all 4 of those elements.</p><p>On cost, we have mentioned that '16, '17 were years where we had invested heavily; and when we actually are past that period, those costs would be coming down. They are coming down. We see that in the first quarter, and are now very confident that we will deliver on our cost target in 2018. Of course, that will then also continue. So cost is under control.</p><p>Credit quality that we have today is the strongest we have had since really the financial crisis started. So very confident on that. Having said that, we've been, in addition to that, because credit quality reflects decisions made in the past. Last 2 years, we've been very diligent and actually been less aggressive in those segments which we have seen higher risk. We have de-risked the bank. That de-risking actually will be seen in the future. That is usually an element that sometime tends to be forgotten when looking at banks. Decisions, de-risking, you'll see that in the future. We've done it and I think we've done it in the right segments. We have also grown less in those segments where we've seen some of the risk elements over '16 or '17.</p><p>Capital -- and I'll come back to capital as well, capital ratios that we have today -- and I think, I've said this in every single Q meeting I've stood here, we have never had the level of capital historically that we have today. I would say today that of any large European or Nordic bank, we have the strongest capital base; and in that sense, are the strongest from a capital and balance sheet perspective. I'm firm on that.</p><p>Compliance, we have invested heavily; basically, completely revamped our whole operational risk compliance IT security platform over the last 2.5 years; gives us confidence to move forward. That's an area where you're never done, but it feels very good in an environment, which is more uncertain, more volatility, to have a much more robust bank in that regard.</p><p>And, of course, I have always a however, because where I'm not pleased is that we did predict that the first quarter would be somewhat slower in terms of top line, but top line has been somewhat weaker than I expected. Not a full surprise, because we did say that the first quarter would be -- given kind of the run rate we had coming into the first quarter, it was expected that it would be somewhat. So on top line hit something that we internally have said, now with 2 years, more inwardly focused; now it's time to really move and put the focus to get that business momentum. I'm confident that we can get it. We have a great platform in place. And with the 3 Cs in place, it is now time to really beef up that side.</p><p>So in that side, I'm not concerned. It means, of course, that the revenue guidance we said, which was actually growth from the restated number is more challenging, but I'm not going to change it. But where I'm confident is that we will have a higher net profit in '18 than we had in '17. So EPS growth is something that I'm very confident, where we have a little bit more uncertainty but we're working on is actually the guidance on the top line. So, in that sense, somewhere a quarter where we've proven a lot of the things that we wanted to prove, the 3 Cs and now being able to focus externally.</p><p>Numbers, I probably have covered already. Operating income, i.e., revenues, yes, that's where -- yes, we are up on last quarter, but yes, we are down on the quarter before; and kind of a slight weakness that I see is in NII, and I'll come back to that. Fee and commission, the line that actually has been strong in the first quarter is actually net fair value. The line that is very strong, I think, is cost, because cost is something that we did tell you that we would turn that and actually deliver, and we are delivering and we will continue to deliver on that side. Operating profit, of course, meaningfully higher than in the last quarter and in line pretty much the same as we had last year, which I feel is a good achievement. Credit losses, I already mentioned. We never had that number in the last 10 years. And, of course, on capital, i.e., management buffer is today at soon 250 or it's 230, but we have a meaningful management buffer. So I don't think there's any question on the strength of this bank now moving forward in terms of its capital base.</p><p>Let's look at, just quickly, on some of the line items. And when we look at net interest income, I mentioned some weakness there, but actually when I look at margins and volumes, they're pretty okay. I mean, there's no real movement in margin or volumes. We have somewhat lower lending margins that's offset by higher deposit margins. The weakness maybe come or the lower NII actually comes from funding cost and then regulatory cost that are kicking in; they count really the key. So NII pretty much flat in terms of underlying business momentum.</p><p>The weakness maybe has been more in net fee commission and that is driven by asset management. When we compare it to the fourth quarter, of course, we have the performance fees coming in in the fourth quarter. So, yes, that has an impact. We don't have the performance fees in the first quarter. Here, we have had some outflows in the beginning of the year, predominantly January, February. We had inflows in March, which really, to me, is saying that we were impacted by MiFID. We were inwardly focused probably towards the end of the year and in the beginning year just to get MiFID in place. So the fact that we have net inflows in March actually tells me that we are getting that momentum back, but clearly that's an area where we are focused.</p><p>The fact that we have a track record and probably the best performing funds shows that we actually have the product and service capabilities to put the momentum back in that, but it's mostly on that line. Somewhat weaker also in -- on the corporate side advisory. Although, here, when we say that it was not that active, actually we are very active in the first quarter, the fact is that some of these big deals are now closing and they're closing in the second quarter. So we actually have a pretty good momentum for the second quarter already on fees and commissions in -- from that side. And in that sense, I already have confidence that some of that has been turned in that business segment. So mostly, I would say, asset management and where we need to now kind of learn to live in the MiFID environment and actually get back the customer focus, the momentum into the business, which I'm pretty confident that we can.</p><p>Net fair value. Underlying net fair value is actually coming pretty much where we would expect. We've always said our net fair value expected where we should be is between EUR 300 million and EUR 350 million, and we are kind of bang in the middle of that in terms of the underlying. Now in terms of customer flow, customer flow still reflects kind of the environment, which we've had really in the last 5, 6 quarters, somewhat lower. But it's a healthy customer business, but it's still somewhat lower from the history.</p><p>But in the last 5, 6 quarters, we've had that type of customer flow. And here, really the improvement is actually on the trading side. Some of that volatility coming back, more normalized trading. So the underlying net fair value. And then we have a one-off really a positive impact from new valuation models that then takes our fair value to the number that we have seen. So that is a one-off, but the underlying is also looking reasonably healthy. So, all in all, something that I'm very pleased of.</p><p>Cost is, I think, the thing [where no] I've been questioned. Are you or do you have cost under control? And I think we have now, both internally, externally, proven that we have put a cost plan in place, and it's been very deliberate to actually grow our cost in '16, '17, given the investments we've done. There is some increase in staff cost, but that is actually just due to the periodization that we have there. But otherwise, this trend is now down.</p><p>The big savings are in the big group projects, consultants, et cetera, and of course staff levels also coming down, given the change in the business model that we are doing, becoming more digital and actually having much more common, we are going into centers of excellence, et cetera, et cetera. So we are changing the way we run the business. This is not cost cutting kind of -- cutting from an existing base, this is changing the way we do the business, and this is also the way we will furthermore, in the coming years, have reduced cost and more efficiency. So on that one, I'm very confident.</p><p>We've mentioned this before, because we always look at reported cost. We should also look at cash spending and cash cost. And here you see that the cash cost is also coming down, which, I think, is the more important, because cash cost is actually the thing that, i.e., lower cash cost is the thing that will actually generate capital. And, of course, capital is key in this business. Cash cost, for this year, we expected EUR 400 million less than last year. We will deliver that, and we are well on our way also and I'm not changing the target to actually take cash cost down to EUR 4.5 billion or EUR 4.7 billion by 2021. That's EUR 1 billion less of cash cost by that time. Again, I emphasize, that improves capital generation. That's part of the transformation that we are doing. So we're well underway on that.</p><p>Asset quality, I think, is key at this point of the cycle. I don't know how long the cycle will last, but I think it is fair to say that maybe it is on its second or last leg, or whatever, but it will not last forever. So actually the de-risking we've done and now actually having the lowest loan loss ratio for the last 10 years, I think, is the right time to be in that position. So I'm very confident on the quality of our credit book.</p><p>We do not see, in the coming quarters, that this situation would continue. Some of the weaker segments is still probably oil offshore, Danish agriculture. But, overall, very confident on this side. I emphasize again, the 3 Cs are very important when you're at this point of the cycle. In terms of impaired loans, this is a new number because we do now IFRS 9, EUR 5.2 billion, half really serving, half non-serving; pretty much where we would expect it to be as well. So, all in all, very confident on that.</p><p>Capital, almost -- this is almost like a parrot. We have never been as well capitalized before. And that I have said every single quarter I have stood here, it's continuing, and I think it is important that you can see that this is a bank that can generate capital, because at the end of the day, that's what makes the fact that you can run long term and be the bank to your customers that you want to be.</p><p>I think it's important when we look at CET1 ratios. This has annoyed me, frankly, in the past because you get this -- although it's quite easy mathematics, you still have this notion that your CET1 ratio is lower than this or that, or how do you compare. These numbers have never been comparable. And now, I think, what the Swedish FSA is doing by actually putting these floors, i.e., the mortgage risk weight floors into the risk-weighted assets, which you should do, because then you can compare banks, then everybody is on the same line.</p><p>If it really is reflected in the risk-weighted assets you have, then you can say apples-to-apples, how do banks look. And when you look at that, it's very clear that we are and we have the highest CET1 ratio, frankly, of any bank in Europe of our size; certainly, the highest also. And that doesn't change meaningfully our capital buffer. So this is a very solid, well-capitalized, maybe even over-capitalized, but let's not go in there, bank.</p><p>Transformation. I always get, how does the core bank system work, or how is that progressing, is that you're -- core bank system is just one, but one very important element of our transformation. Our transformation is a lot more than that, a lot more than that. The branchification of this bank and then the following re-domiciliation, which is not yet complete and we need to, of course, say we need to complete it, that is a fundamental transformation of this bank, particularly the branchification. We are probably the only bank with significant branches in our core markets operating with a model we have. A very pure European, very clear bank on how you run it and how you look at it. We are unique. You talk to the European regulators, they love that structure. I think we're a model that many banks would like to, but it's not been easy to get there. That transformation is pretty much complete.</p><p>Simplification, come a long way. Core bank system replacement is part of that, but a big part of that is also simplifying products, processes behind so that we can actually then change the core bank system. We have launched -- proof of concept already done way back in time, we have launched now a new product on the new platform; and now, we have actually, in larger numbers, moved existing customers and existing products to the new platform.</p><p>And I can say, that transfer has gone extremely well, actually without any major hiccups. A hell of a lot of work behind the scene, I can tell you, but it's gone. Now it's actually easier to stand here to say we are confident that, by 2020, we will have the core components of the core bank system in the 4 core markets, because it's not only in our proof of concept, it's not only proof of that it works for customers; now, we have actually moved large amount of customers onto.</p><p>We also have our Credit Transfer Interbank payments on the new Global Payment Engine. So we again see that this is happening. When we started this exercise 3, 4 years ago, we had 47 payment systems, I remember counting those. We are now moving into a new world. So simplification is also going in right there. But there's a lot more to simplification, it's also new ways of working. We are moving into an agile way of working in many of our businesses. That is also simplification. We are breaking down the kind of vertical silos and we're starting working much more horizontally in lean teams.</p><p>De-risking is an important part. De-risking of the asset side I've actually mentioned, but de-risking is also the investments in the operational risk compliance, IT security, all the things that we've done there, which we, of course, will continue because, on this side, you are never done. This side you are never done. You will always have to improve on that side. But now we have both the competence processes, people in place, which we did not have 2.5 years ago.</p><p>And then of course, critically, the whole digital journey with the digital channels that we have are now creating both with collaboration with small and medium-sized exciting fin-tech players, but also some of the big tech giants like Apple and Samsung, where -- who have chosen us as a partner here in the Nordics. And of course, generating and creating now a new momentum in actually coming up with new products and services. So transformation, still a long journey to go, but I think the key components of, what I call, transformation are now coming in place and we can become more customer-centric and customer-focused. We have a good base to do it.</p><p>When I look at Martin, who's sitting there in the corner, I look at the wholesale bank he's running and look at what we've done, again in the first quarter, and I always look at kind of 4 main components: where are you on equities, where are you on advisory, where are you in bonds, and where are you in loans. Those are kind of -- and from there, a lot of risk management and other products then flow from that. And we are pretty much where we want to be, i.e., the leading player in this region. The fact that we were a lead advisor and a financier of the 2 largest transactions -- landmark transactions in the Nordics, the acquisition of TDC and the merger between Tele2 and Com Hem, actually is a testament of the leading position we have in this region. We were also part of the 3 largest IPOs -- European IPOs of the first quarter of 2018, and you know they were not all in the Nordics, so that means also we are the Nordic choice when equities needs to be distributed in this region by European blue chips that actually are -- have actually become public early this year.</p><p>Same thing in funds. Yes, we have had outflow in the first months, now inflow, but to actually succeed in this, of course, you need good funds. Last quarter, I mentioned about our performance in '17. We have some of the top performing funds and we have actually now, also in the first quarter, got a lot of rewards in -- on this side really across all the 4 markets in terms of our fund performance. And maybe most importantly, the question I get on customer satisfaction, I'm not satisfied with our customer satisfaction, that's for clear, that's for sure. I mean, I just want to put it. We are working on this, but at the same time, and you've heard me say this in -- at the AGM, in those segments where we have our relationship customers, in those segments where the customer is using multiple products from Nordea, with a lot of interaction, we have very happy customers. So, of course, we need to actually broaden our relationship with all of our customers.</p><p>But the second thing is also, we have also -- maybe been again, too inwardly focused, customer interaction, meeting customers, be it online or physically, is key to be accessible. And so we have a lot of new initiatives, where all of us, me included, that's why the funny picture, take part in talking to clients. We talk to thousands of clients now proactively to be closer to them, and that actually gains loyalty. So we are having a new momentum in this. And in all of our core markets, all 4 markets, and in all of our those relationship segments, our customer satisfaction is nudging up. But I'm not -- I mean, I'm not saying here that we are where we want to be, we will work on this, and I get it.</p><p>Then we also have the broader mass market. The solution there is much better digital deliveries, and that's why the transformation is -- and the digital investments we do, that is the answer for a lot of the customer satisfaction questions, particularly in the broader mass market. But it's not only those, I mean, technology plays an important role, very important role also in customer satisfaction and how we use technology to become closer and more relevant to your customer. That's why I would like to invite a person, Mattias, to the stage. And I will ask him one very simple question. Who are you?</p><p>MATTIAS FRAS, GROUP HEAD OF ROBOTICS STRATEGY &amp; INNOVATION, NORDEA BANK AB (PUBL): Thank you, Casper. My name is Mattias Fras, and I solve problems with AI in the bank. It's not only me, it's my team, and we work together with our Data Science Lab, and advanced analytics team, and different business units to solve good problems, to make it better for our customers. And I really think that I have the best job in the bank right now, Casper. I know you like your job too, but I think mine is better right now.</p><p>CASPER VON KOSKULL: (inaudible)</p><p>MATTIAS FRAS: Yes, let's talk about that later maybe. But -- so what do we do, right? So we -- basically all the stuff that we do is to make it better for the customer, right? So we do in 3 categories. One is to infuse intelligence in the way we interact with our customers to make it more relevant, more pleasant to do business with us. It's about super-powering our employees, give them better tools, insights; they can focus more on the customer. It's about enabling instant banking, so doing banking in new ways that we didn't think were possible before. So we do that.</p><p>I'll give you some examples of what we do. We have our robotics family. I don't really particularly like the word robotics. But we have our software robots, not really AI, but we have around 250 of them. And last month, they executed a quarter of a million tasks like sending a letter to a customer or opening an account. We have our Nova, our virtual agent. She had 10,000 interactions last month with customers and employees, helping them to solve problems or answer questions. We are developing an AI-powered platform to send one-to-one communications to our customers, to be more relevant to them and do it in the right time and the right channel.</p><p>We are making our AML case handlers. We're giving them super powers to be more effective and handle larger volumes. And we are actually reinventing, I would say, the way we deal with the insurance claims in our Life and Pensions business. Totally redoing that by using machine learning, robotics, text analytics, advanced OCR, setting up in a way that a fin-tech would do it. So I think that's pretty amazing.</p><p>So in some of these areas, I also think we are a front-runner in Nordea, but we are still in early ages of AI, obviously. So having said that, we -- I will show you a short movie. It's like 1 minute. And it's -- in the movie, you will meet Gustav. Gustav is sitting right here. He's an AI trainer. An AI trainer is a new role in Nordea. It's -- and he is teaching our Nova how to speak. So we are now developing speech. And hopefully, you will see that in the not-too-distant future. So, thank you. Let's see if it works.</p><p>(video playing)</p><p>CASPER VON KOSKULL: A little bit of taste of the future. I think we'll try to do this also going forward. I think, Rodney, now you're kind of the master of this. So we may take both questions, but, yes.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Yes. We will start with some high-level questions for Casper. I also want to be dressed like that at work. I'm too old. We have time for a few high-level questions for Casper, and then we'll do the analyst Q&amp;A. Magnus, please start.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON, RESEARCH ANALYST, ABG SUNDAL COLLIER HOLDING ASA, RESEARCH DIVISION: Magnus Andersson at ABG. Just on the income side. Since -- I mean, you were talking about the 4 Cs, and I think most of us here are focusing on the I. And to start or just take a high-level on net commission income, the fee income line was the weakest one since Q3 '15. And when I look at the split, I see that it looks like the investment banking parts are quite weak, securities, brokerage, corporate finance, et cetera, the weakest for at least 3 years, probably more lending fees coming down quite significantly, guarantees, et cetera. At the same time, I look at wholesale banking where you have ramped up for quite a long time and profitability is still 8% there. I know you have a 12% real core target. Can you just try to tell us more? What are you going to do here to that fee income more explicitly? What measures do you think you can take to get profitability up to reverse this trend on the fee line, which I think stood out the most to us sitting here today?</p><p>CASPER VON KOSKULL: First of all, I think I -- I mean, the corporate side, of course, is always a little volatile. So the second quarter, you will actually see a different number. We have some very big -- the pipeline -- the deals that I mentioned, they will close in the -- and you'll see that with other banks as well. So the cycles when you compare bank to bank, particularly in different geographies, is different. So that's one. Then the second thing is that we have actually done a major re-haul also in -- cost wise in our wholesale bank, which actually is now coming through.</p><p>And that has not been a cost-driven exercise, it's been an offensive-driven exercise, where we have become -- and I probably should give more word to Martin here who sits, but I -- where we actually have become much more -- we have now moved purely into a very global organization, and we can see now already effects of when we deliver more relevant, better products on a global. We have been in that business, maybe a little bit too regional, local up to date. And we've done a big -- and you probably have read about it, a big change there, where we have both become more efficient on the cost side, but actually will also drive revenue and that's predominant in the markets trading and that side.</p><p>And then in terms of deals itself, of course, league tables will drive revenue, it's always. I have been in the business for 30 years, in that business in particular, league tables on your position and your position with clients; that will drive the revenue side. You have to be up there and now we have shown that we are not only -- in the past, we used to be in Denmark, Finland; weak in Norway, Sweden. Now we're actually strong in all 4 countries and with a very broad -- and also when we look at customer satisfaction, we actually have the best customer positioning in all 4 markets today of any bank. So I think that will actually -- that's it on that side.</p><p>On the asset management side, it's little bit also the fact that we have had tremendous growth over the last year, particularly in kind of the -- on the international side. And when you have that very rapid growth, you will come to a point where kind of the breather. Now also with equity volatility, there has been kind of profit taking. And then when you add that to MiFID II, we have actually said that we have slower growth there, but we think that we can get back to that growth path, when we make some of the changes that we need to make there as well.</p><p>But I think those are kind of the highlights of those 2 businesses, which are the key drivers of the fee commission line. But then I always emphasize, you have to look at the platform and your position on that platform, and that is actually solidly in place, then I would be concerned, because those are in place. The fund performance is there, the organization is there, and of course, the key position in or the lead position in wholesale banking. So it's in place. You just need the momentum.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Do you think that the short term -- sorry, the reorganizations you've done within markets, do you think that might have had a negative impact short term that should recover?</p><p>CASPER VON KOSKULL: Undoubtedly some. Although when you look at the numbers, the numbers you -- is not that bad; I think the number, both the customer number and the trading number in the first quarter. We have always said that this is a business where we should be in this kind of an environment between [EUR 300 million, EUR 350 million]. I think the number is now [EUR 320 million, EUR 330 million] for the quarter, and it's not a fantastic backdrop in terms of environment. So even the new organization has performed, but I think when I look, as Martin has always said, this is just the beginning. So the offensive moves that we've made there probably hasn't come through.</p><p>So you could have maybe expected even, but I've always said that the last 2 years we have been inwardly focused throughout the organization. When you branchify, when you re-domicile, when you change your whole operational risk and compliance side, when you start changing the operating model, when you change core bank systems, when you do all that, everybody in the organization is involved. It undoubtedly has, but you don't go and announce it and advertise it. I think we've done a remarkable job actually to keep the momentum, which we can now actually accelerate.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: You can hand it over to Andreas, please.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON, ANALYST OF BANKS, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Andreas Hakansson for Exane BNP Paribas. And I remember a year ago, we sat here and you said that your key target for the year was to improve the customer satisfaction or brand affinity, whatever we would call it, and then some events where the move has actually made things worse and you seem to be losing market share primarily in Sweden, but -- maybe a bit in Denmark. But in Sweden, what we have seen externally that you've done is that you cut mortgage pricing twice. Could you tell us, if the market share is not recovering, do you have other things that you're going to focus on or will you continue to cut price, is that the strategy you have out of it?</p><p>CASPER VON KOSKULL: I'm not sure. I mean, I think this focus on mortgage is a little bit overdue -- overdone, because it's not like we are the mortgage bank. We do -- mortgage is a very important element in our Swedish business, in all of our businesses, but when you look at its share of [hold], when you look at our mortgage volume in 2017 in Sweden, it was flat, we haven't declined. Our market share may have declined, but we took and we actually announced that, more than a year ago, we will take a more cautious view in a very hot housing market. That housing market corrected, we have seen a stabilization and I think it's the right time to be kind of a little bit more forward leaning, actually to maintain -- we're not going for big volume. I don't need to kind of go volume and market share. I mean, again, the 3 Cs, you have to remember banks are also taking risk. So I think that was very deliberate what we did.</p><p>Now when you look at the first quarter, we are flat. But when we now have changed pricing, we had -- I think, in the first week, we had a 36% growth, but we are not going for a lot of market share gain. We want to have roughly the kind of the market position we need and want to have, which we've had historically. So I'm -- I don't actually buy the fact that we have lost that much. Particularly on customer satisfaction, I'm working on it, but the customer satisfaction in the large corporate segment, #1 in the region, customer satisfaction in a lot of our key segments in commercial banking, very good. It is in the mass market, and the mass market customer satisfaction we can only improve by becoming much more digital, more simple, easy to use, anywhere, anytime for customers. We need to become more customer-friendly.</p><p>And then, of course, we do need to work on because when you have domicile issues and others, they do impact branding. And we need to tell more, a better story what we actually are doing. We're one of the largest taxpayers in Sweden. We are probably one of the leaders in sustainable finance and how we actually approach sustainability, a lot of the good things we do. We need to become better in telling that, but that's actually a long term journey. So I think on a lot of these, we actually have moved in the right direction, but I admit that there's a lot of misunderstanding with domicile issues, there were a lot of misunderstanding on Panama. And we put that behind us, we are very different bank today with what we have done in the last 2.5 years.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: So that means that if you don't grow faster than the market, we shouldn't expect more price cuts. Is that the way of looking at it?</p><p>CASPER VON KOSKULL: And now, again -- I think, you are looking at, again, very 1 segment. I think we will continue to look at and adjust. There's a lot of things happening in the Swedish mortgage market, and I'm pretty confident that in terms of who we are and the position here, we can actually -- we can handle that. It's not a new thing in terms of price and other competition, and I think we will go through a period now where we'll see what the new entrants will do, what will actually the challengers do. But just what we have done recently, I think we have shown, just in the 1 week, that, hey, we can play with that. But the first -- no, sorry, the last 4, 5 months of last year were very deliberate, we did not want to grow with the market. We said that as well, and we kind of delivered on that, because we did -- had to take a more cautious view on that very, very hot housing market that we had last year, which now has, in my mind, corrected and stabilized. So we can take these steps.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: We have room for one more question. And Peter, please, you were earlier.</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF, RESEARCH ANALYST, SEB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Peter Kessiakoff from SEB. Just one question on the de-risking. I think you've mentioned for a few quarters that de-risking is coming to an end, and I read that in this quarter report as well. Could you elaborate a bit on what that means in reality, and when do you think that we have reached the end for real?</p><p>CASPER VON KOSKULL: I think, it's for real, because I think when you look at -- I'll just take 1 -- 2 segments. When I look at shipping offshore in Russia, if you take EUR 6 billion out of that, that's almost EUR 200 million in just pure NII, that's done; and actually that -- I don't see that we are at a level and I would actually say that 2 -- now I'm actually very comfortable where we are in Russia. We are kind of at between probably now at the moment, EUR 2 billion, EUR 2.5 billion. We used to be at EUR 6 billion, and that is actually a very well-run portfolio, also a portfolio that can be managed in a sanctions environment.</p><p>But I also remember, a month ago, people kind of shook their head and said, did you really need to do that? There's not a single person who questions our de-risking today as it comes to Russia, because people only wake up when things happen. And I think we've done the right thing, we can manage that business, it's a profitable business, we can navigate that in this environment, but I would not like to have it with the size we had before. So that de-risking was the right thing to do, and that's EUR 200 million, those 2 just -- it's a EUR 200 billion top line. But if somebody likes that top line -- top line always comes with risk; that I always remind. This is not a -- and that sometimes tends to be forgotten. I think I'm very comfortable where we are and how we can grow from the base we have now.</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF: And then...</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Sorry, we need to move on. We will continue soon with a Q&amp;A for the analysts. But the journalists who would like to have individual interviews with you, please go back and (inaudible) will take care of you. And everyone who wants to stay in the room, please feel welcome. And then I'm welcoming up Mr. Christopher Rees on stage. Thank you, Casper.</p><p>CASPER VON KOSKULL: Thank you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: So we'll wait a minute while everything is being settled. We also have a telephone conference with us and we also have the webcast, and we will, of course, welcome questions from the telephone conference as well. So, Christopher, our new CFO, has been CFO for a month. So before this event, I've tried to teach him everything I can; and as you can imagine, that went pretty fast.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES, GROUP CFO, HEAD OF GROUP FINANCE &amp; TREASURY AND MEMBER OF GROUP EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, NORDEA BANK AB (PUBL): Thank you, Rodney. Thanks for that coffee, that one coffee. That means today you will answer most of the questions.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: So should we start kicking off...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Maybe one moment just before we start is, given I am new here and I have just been here a bit more than a month, I thought actually it might be appropriate, at least for the analysts, to introduce myself a little bit. Rees is not a Swedish name, but I am actually half-Swedish. Rees is a Welsh name. So half Viking, half Celt. Don't really know what that makes me. But anyway, I have spent most of my career in the U.K. prior to joining Nordea. I worked at Merrill Lynch, then at Morgan Stanley; and the last 8 years prior to joining in Nordea, I was at Barclays. And most of my career, I've been in the capital markets businesses, running various types of businesses across the Nordics, as well as EMEA.</p><p>And at Nordea, I've been the COO for the wholesale bank. And to Casper's earlier questions, I was running markets just a little bit more than a month ago, and now I'm here as CFO. One of the key things, I think, for a CFO is to do what we're doing here. It's about relations -- investor relations. And what I would very much look forward to, as we go forward on this journey, is to get to know all of you a little bit more, both in groups and bilaterally, and so that we can, together, work on the Nordeajourney as we move forward. So I very much look forward to meeting you all in person.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: So should we start then -- we can start with Jens, followed by Johan and then Maths.</p><p>JENS HALL\u00c3\u00a9N, RESEARCH ANALYST, CARNEGIE INVESTMENT BANK AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jens Hall\u00c3\u00a9n from Carnegie. If I start with maybe a big picture question, there was a bit of a softer revenue guidance in the report this morning. I mean, how much buffer have you got to your net profit target with growing '18 over '17, are we getting close to not being able to meet that?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: No we are confident that we are going to meet our net profit target. What we're saying here, the revenue guidance is still as is. But given the soft quarter that we've had in some of the core element of our business, we talked about NCI earlier and NII, we will -- we have a softer quarter. So there the revenue guidance is slightly more at challenged. But given the initiatives that we are taking right now in the various businesses, we believe that we will have momentum coming into the second half.</p><p>I want to mention the Casper's point about the fact that we have been somewhat internally focused, and I basically joined the bank when the bank went slightly more internally focused. But I think it's important now that the momentum and that Nordeagets its commercial zeal back into the business. And Casper talks a lot about customer satisfaction. It is about customer intensity, it's about customer proactivity, and we are actually shaping our business particularly also for the mass market to deliver those products. So, yes, the revenue is a little bit more uncertain as we go forward, but we have always guided for a softer first half. But net profit increase, we are confident we will achieve.</p><p>JENS HALL\u00c3\u00a9N: Okay. And then talking about that momentum, I know NII is less than half of your revenues, but we still have volumes which is -- which are falling quarter-over-quarter. Can you give us a bit of flavor maybe by market on what are you doing to stem the outflow? And when we will be able to see some growth coming back into Nordea?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: I think if you look at the retail piece, I mean, actually in local currencies, the volume has actually stabilized. I think the volume loss in NII was more on the wholesale banking side, or the large corporate side. But there, we're actually seeing some improvements in margins. You have seen and Casper talked about what we did in Sweden. And we are continuously monitoring all the markets, and we will want to grow with the market going forward. So we believe that there is momentum to drive volume as we go forward, albeit under slightly tighter margins.</p><p>I think the momentum, if you look at -- I'll comment a bit on the NCI, I do think that in wholesale banking or that side, there has been a lot of momentum in Q1, and actually that line is impacted by IFRS 15 as well, and it's roughly EUR 10 million. So actually NCI quarter-on-quarter in wholesale is broadly flattish. And therefore, you need to take that IFRS 15 piece into account. And there, the momentum is very strong, and I do believe that the pipeline in Q2 will materialize.</p><p>In asset management or in funds flow, there are a couple of effects. Firstly, we are selling our Private Banking International business, which is having an impact. We have moved customers from private banking into personal banking, and that is changing the way we account for assets under management. Then there are also some seasonality effects. I actually believe Casper had the bridge up earlier. All those mean that actually the net outflow is more from -- [it's not EUR 3.6 billion, it's more EUR 1.5 billion]. And there clearly, Casper made the point that equity markets has an impact, there has been some reallocation. And I'll emphasize the fact that we have grown, and we have also soft-closed the stable fund, which has made the wholesale distribution asset management slightly softer. So going into Q2, it is softer, but we do believe that Q2 will improve over Q1 in terms of inflows.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: We can move then to Johan, please, sorry, followed by Martin and Magnus.</p><p>JOHAN EKBLOM, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF BENELUX AND NORDIC BANKS, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: So first just clarifications there on the revenue guidance, which is -- there's a comment today in the report as well. So I think previously, we've discussed 1% to 3% revenue growth or so in 2018 vis-a-vis 2017. So when you're saying that is more challenged, we should think about those 1% to 3%, and then from what base? Is that EUR 9.2 billion or EUR 9.3 billion, or what base is it?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: EUR 9.2 billion.</p><p>JOHAN EKBLOM: Okay. And when we look at the asset management and wealth management business rather, overall, so we can -- if we go back a year or so, we can see that now you've had 0 inflows overall, and I understand that you've had MiFID implementation as all banks have had without equity volatility, et cetera, et cetera. But would you say that is it a structural issue where you have outflows from previously sold volumes via the national distribution, or any other more structural issue which is causing now outflows to offset inflows in other areas, or if you could define that issue the way you see it internally for us, because we don't have much inflows from the retail funds either for a while? So just trying to square that box and see what the issue is and if it can be solved with better equity or capital markets here in the second and third quarter.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Maybe I can give it a crack and then you can add. Firstly, actually our retail distribution in Denmark and Norway actually had net inflows. Finland was broadly flat and there was some outflows in Sweden. I think a lot of it has to do with -- yes, there has been some close of these stable return fund, and we have had inflows in some of the other funds but enough to offset it. The issue, I think, is actually getting enough inflows to drive it. A part of that is the market. I personally don't think that there is some fundamental structural thing in this, because we are going out, we need to market ourselves.</p><p>We've had, just like in some of the other areas of the business, a lack of intensity with clients. MiFID II was actually more of an inertia in terms of the systems and processes to get that going, so there's very little activity in the first 1.5 months of -- in some of the businesses. So that actually changed; and in March, we actually had net inflows into asset management. So, I think, it is -- there is potential but we are coming into the year slightly softer than expected.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Yes. I mean if you look at the 4 different components, I mean, if you look at private banking, that's basically only because of the divestment of Private Banking International and that we move clients to personal banking. So that is underlying, it's no outflows. If you look at the institutions, I mean, this is the soft closure, and then you have big mandates that are going back and forth every quarter; and you know they're coming in, and sometimes they're coming out, and you have some seasonality there as well. If you then look in wealth -- sorry, if you look in Life and Pensions, there are no outflow at all. And if you look at the retail funds, it's basically Sweden, the rest of the market we have inflow. So there's no structural thing at all.</p><p>JOHAN EKBLOM: Okay. One more question there on another product line. So going back to mortgages, which was a previous question as well, and not just in Sweden but primarily in Sweden, perhaps, where the market share has gone down to close to 0 or a little bit below, actually. So I guess that over time, the bank is unhappy with being that -- at that low level, and now your normal market share is more like 15%, I guess, in the Swedish market. And my question is, would you like to get back to that market share now in the next year or so? And if yes, what are you prepared to do to reach that market share, because it is a competitive market, fairly transparent with quite a few players are trying to get new volumes? So one, is that your ambition; and two, what you're prepared to do to reach that, please?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: So as Casper mentioned, we made some changes this year on the pricing, and just like we did not make the changes previously, because we did not go for volumes, and that served us well in 2017. Now when the market has corrected, we have made these changes, because we do want to support Swedish economy and Swedish people when they actually make their big purchases and also be there as a long term strategic player in the Swedish market.</p><p>And then we also took a risk-based approach. Now is a good time to make these [movements]. So we're not going to change market share nilly-willy. At the end of the day, we are business people, and we're going to be monitoring the market's development, we're going to monitor what happens, and we're going to make the necessary adjustments to participate in a market at a level that works for us and our customers. So this is not purely a market share gain, but we will monitor it and we want to participate and take our natural market share in Sweden and grow with the market.</p><p>JOHAN EKBLOM: So the answer is you want to be like 15% market share in a year's time or so, growing from where you are now if we think about new production now, of course?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: If the market -- if we are comfortable where the market is and it continues to grow and it's got the stability it has, we hope to grow with the market. I'm not going to give a number, because it depends on the market in a year's time.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Please, Maths.</p><p>MATHS LILJEDAHL, RESEARCH ANALYST, HANDELSBANKEN CAPITAL MARKETS AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maths Liljedahl, Handelsbanken. I wonder if we can go more into the corporate segment, maybe building on Magnus's questions. Previously, we see league tables are good, but we also note, in the report, that commission from these income lines is declining slightly. So if you can comment just on the activity level across regions, across products, what you see here going forward?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes. Firstly, I'd like again to make the point that NCI, or as you talk about the fees and commissions are actually impacted by IFRS 15, [is about by EUR 10 million]. So if you add that on top, it's actually not gone down that much QonQ in the large corporate segment. But the activity has been very strong, but just this is a lumpy business, and I've been in that business for well over 20 years, and some quarters are good and some -- you need to look at a longer period of time, and we have some fantastic mandates driven by where you can see it publicly on the league tables, and the pipeline is very strong, and we hope that will materialize as we go forward in Q2. So activity is pretty strong across the board there.</p><p>I would also like to point out on the market's activity, it's actually in line with what we have guided before, it's EUR 325 million. And I think the key issues there is actually there hasn't been some big corporate events that have made that little extra, but that is also a potential pipeline going forward. So I think in the large corporate space, activity is strong. And if you look at the lending volumes, both on the CBB space and in wholesale, we have a lot of new leads coming in. So there is a momentum there as well, but that takes a bit of time to come through. And actually in CB, we've increased our lending volume and actually we're seeing some margin increases in Sweden. I think where we've had some large lending falls is in Finland in large corporates, and that is mainly driven by a very large migration of loan to bond, which obviously is slowing the fees from previous years. That's the main driver there.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: We have international guests also on the telephone lines. So should we invite them, please, operator?</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We will now take our first question from Willis Palermo of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>WILLIS PALERMO, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I have 2 questions. The first one is on the housing market, just to pick up on the comments you put on the press release when you announced the change in pricing in Sweden, you said you were anticipating a more stable housing market going forward. So I saw the signs of stabilization in the first quarter. What makes you think this will continue?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Yes. I mean, we saw a quite sharp correction last fall on the housing prices; and in the most heated area, prices went down 20%. We think that was fundamentally sound. It was driven by, what we view, a temporary oversupply. There's never been any issues on the demand side, that has been very stable. And as you know, the overall economy is performing very well, but it was a temporary oversupply coming from a lot of new housing starts.</p><p>We know now that they will come down in '18-'19. So we see a market that is in balance between supply and demand, we see continued extremely low interest rates and our forecast is now that the rates will remain stable till 4th quarter of '19. I mean, it's very long time. And then, of course, unemployment is on low level. So we don't really see any issues in the housing market that we saw basically 18 to 20 months ago, when we saw that asset inflation was high-single digit to low-double digit. We felt uncomfortable with that. But now we see it's much better in balance.</p><p>WILLIS PALERMO: Okay. And the second question is on the [terminus platform], the core banking transformation, I heard Casper commenting that everything was on track. You also mentioned in -- at the 4Q results that there were a slight delay in the roll that happened in 1Q instead of 4Q. So I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. If net, net, there was a catch-up, when would you expect the first savings to come as a result? Also if you decided if you would be rolling the product by geographies or by product or any feedback you could share on that transformation?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes. Casper was referring to the fact that we have migrated over a quarter of million customers in Finland in April, and that migration went very well. And as we go forward over next few months, we'll continue to migrate the customers onto the core banking platform. And very -- in a very near future, we will also -- they will also be able to open accounts on that platform through their mobile app.</p><p>And then as we go forward, that will -- mobile app will also be rolled out in the various other countries. We -- the plans and the deadlines they're probably referring to were set sometime back, alright. And we are more focused on actually doing this in the right way, with the right quality. Simplification on the core banking platform and the technology efforts that we have is one of our top priorities for the firm. So for us it's more about the customer experience, doing it with quality and doing it well rather than actually setting a specific deadline. And yes, the scope -- you've got to also remember that the scope has indeed increased here in this program as well. So that is more important for us than hitting a specific deadline that was set many years ago. So, yes, you could argue it's delayed, but for us it's about the quality and customer experience when we launch this.</p><p>WILLIS PALERMO: And maybe last -- a small thing on the cost side as of 4Q. You were mentioning that the target for 2018 cost base included EUR 150 million, I think, of transformation cost. You booked a bit lower amount in the first quarter. Is the EUR 150 million still stand for the full year?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes, it does.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: So you should expect these transformation costs to go up a little bit in the coming quarters. On the other hand, we have seen quite small effect on the cost initiatives; you see will see a gradual increase from them. So we are still very confident to deliver on the '18 targets.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll now take our next question from Natacha Blackman of Societe Generale.</p><p>NATACHA BLACKMAN, ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE: And I have a few questions on funding. You mentioned, in the release, that you are expecting to issue non-preferred senior this year possibly using a contractual subordination solution. Would you be able to tell us how much are you looking to issue in total? And then how much of that would be -- would you begin to do this year? That'll be my first question.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes. We are indeed expected to issue a non-preferred security this year. This is the starting. I believe it was [EUR 2 billion] in this year. As we go forward, that would develop. On a total, I believe it was EUR 20 billion...</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: You round that number.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Round that number.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Yes.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: That kind of caused change, [depending upon] the balance sheet change.</p><p>NATACHA BLACKMAN: (technical difficulty) Swedish rules that is likely to come down, I assume?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Sorry, we didn't hear the last question.</p><p>NATACHA BLACKMAN: I assume that would be coming down, because obviously that's under this Swedish MREL rules [EUR 20 billion].</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: I mean, we'll see what the MREL requirements would be. So you're right.</p><p>NATACHA BLACKMAN: Okay. And how much would you like to do this year?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: We're still evaluating market, but I think we have communicated previously a few billion.</p><p>NATACHA BLACKMAN: A few. Okay, great. And then my second question is in subordinated debt, do you have any needs to issue there, so in AT1 or Tier 2, or are you done for now?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: On AT1, we don't have any plans to issue this year. On Tier 2, I'm a bit more uncertain, so let us come back to that one later on. But on AT1, we are already filling the demand. Next question?</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll now take our next question from Matti Ahokas of Chase Bank.</p><p>MATTI AHOKAS, HEAD OF EQUITY RESEARCH OF FINLAND, DANSKE BANK MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: It's Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank, I haven't changed jobs. Two questions, please. Firstly, you mentioned that the revenue momentum would be picking up in the second half, but also at the same time, you're saying that at least the commission side would be picking up also already in Q2. What are the underlying assumptions that Q2 would not yet see the increased revenue momentum? And then if you could talk a bit about the outlook for lending margins in the different geographies that Nordeaoperates at the moment.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Okay. To remind where the collections [have]. So when we talked about previously on -- questions on the momentum, that was very much related to the brokerage fees and in wholesale banking. Of course, the questions prior on asset management, it is indeed softer on the fees and commissions on the savings and investment products. The other revenue momentum we have is, we believe that we will grow with volumes as we talked about in the lending side, but there is margin pressure. We have in Norway and PeB the increase of NIBOR has created some margin pressure. So we're going also into Q2 slightly softer there. In Denmark, it's more about the lending mix, and we have a initiative that we will roll out hopefully towards latter part of this year and that we can probably support the consumer lending business in Denmark to improve that status. And then in Sweden, we've just talked about the mortgage margins here. In the corporate side in Sweden, we are actually seeing lending margins -- signs of that ticking up as well as some potential volume pick up. So that's a positive sign. And I think that gives you hopefully enough flavor.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will now take our next question from Adrian Cighi of RBC.</p><p>ADRIAN CIGHI, EQUITY ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have 2 questions, please. One follow-up on NII, particularly on wholesale funding. How much of a headwind did the U.S. LIBOR higher spread increase contribute to NII this quarter? And assuming it remains at the same level, how much more of headwind will contribute to Q2 and -- I mean, Q3 and Q4. And then on capital, please. You're now meaningfully higher than your own target. While we know that you have a new regulator and -- starting October, do you think they'll ask a much higher management buffer or what is the risk or risks that you see them stopping you from distributing at least some of this excess capital back to shareholder?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: So let me start with the capital question. As Casper said, we're very highly capitalized, we've got a huge capital buffer of 230 basis points. And if given the new changes in the Swedish risk weight floors, we're actually one of the highest capitalized banks in Europe. We are currently a Swedish company; and as such, we will go through the normal Swedish SREP process. And as we enter into the SSM, we will go through their process, and we are following those guidelines. So that's really where we're at. We'll have to see what the outcome is of that when we move. And we have -- our intent or we are willing to commit to actually going into the SSM at the current capital levels. The first question was?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Funding costs.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes, we had a slight higher funding costs than -- in this quarter, which was actually indeed driven mainly by the U.S. And the difference of funding cost was about EUR 5 million, if I recall correctly, and that was driven by that. And I think we are expecting -- and if you look at our funding cost has come down over the last year or so and it's still trending and we still expect a lower, but slightly higher than we have previously guided about the quarter. You got to tell me when we guided. So we still expect funding to be slightly EUR 70 million or so better than the before.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Correct. Yes, the change here is that previously we said that the increase in regulatory costs were to be met with lower funding costs, and that's around EUR 100 million on both sides. The regulatory costs are now kicking in EUR 26 million [higher], so that's around EUR 100 million per year. The funding cost, we do expect to be down some EUR 70 million, EUR 80 million. So there is a slightly lower decrease in funding cost than we expected before. Should we take a pause with the telephone conference and enter the room again? So Nicholas, please?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Nicholas's hands is hurting.</p><p>NICOLAS MCBEATH, ANALYST, DNB MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Nicolas McBeath from DNB. A question on the cost guidance that you've kept intact now at EUR 4.9 billion. That was the cost guidance that was set after the Q3 results last year, and if I take into account what's happened with FX movements, we've had quite a depreciation of the Swedish and Norwegian, the kroner versus euro, and also the divestment of Life and Pensions in Denmark, I end up with annualized cost tailwinds of around just slightly north of EUR 100 million. So I understand you'd maybe don't want to change your guidance on the back of such fluctuating factors, but is it fair to assume that assuming the current FX relations that you should be able to outperform the cost target, or has there been kind of other cost headwinds since the cost target was set in Q3 that means that we should still expect cost to be, yes, closer to EUR 4.9 billion?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: So first, we'll reiterate the target of EUR 4.9 billion. And on the FX comment, we are -- as Casper said, we are actually changing the firm. We're not -- well, I mean, we're actually do changing the firm in terms of how we leverage the scale and synergies of Nordeaand that drives cost efficiencies as well. So we are not looking at costs and we are not changing our plans on a month-to-month basis depending on the FXs. And hence, the cost target remains at EUR 4.9 billion. And then NordeaLife and Pensions in Denmark.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Yes. And as you may remember, we said that this will lower our cost base with some EUR 40 million. And we said before that around EUR 4.9 billion, but that EUR 4.9 billion was slightly above EUR 4.9 billion, and now we are talking about slightly below, but we still round it to EUR 4.9 billion. And then the FX impact in this quarter was EUR 11 million. So that's a tailwind, obviously, as we get. But that -- I mean, we don't forecast on currencies in our cost outlook. So therefore, yes, if we get tailwind, that's good; but we can have headwinds as well. So no one knows.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: (technical difficulty) move in 6 months' time in the opposite direction, right?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Yes.</p><p>NICOLAS MCBEATH: But then revenue should improve as well?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes, [it probably has to].</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Magnus, please.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Yes. Just on the wholesale banking to try to be a bit more specific, just a year ago, almost you had invested in London, and you talked about your plans for each business area, and you launched a 12% return target for this business. We are still at [8%], same level as one year ago. Cost/income ratio up quite significantly. You have reduced capital consumption though, withdrawn risk-weighted assets. So when I look at this business, you're not only ones having profitability problems with large corporate business. Do you think this is purely cyclical, or do you think there's something structural? And what do you think about the 12%? Is it really realistic within a 2- to 3-year time period as you see it?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: We've talked a lot about the de-risking, and the de-risking actually sits very much in wholesale Russia and with the shipping oil and offshore. And it was also about covering and working with the right client. And I think the initiatives that wholesale have put in place both on the efficiency side and also in terms of shaping the markets business, I do think that they will have momentum and the target still remains at 12%. As indicated, obviously, de-risking -- revenues have risk and we have de-risked something that has higher NII. The efforts now is actually to grow the corporate business that we have had in place. We have deselected a few clients, but we are now seeing a lot of leads, lot of new momentum. So we hope that that will slowly come in 2.5 years' time for sure. And the momentum in the advisory business is good and we have restructured the markets business. So all the components are there to grow and achieve that.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Please remember also that the loan losses are still elevated here. In this quarter, we had 1 Danish corporate customer that costed us a quite a lot. So we have 35 basis points, which is elevated.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: And finally just if I may be a bit bold, do you think you will be able to grow NII at a group level quarter-on-quarter in Q2?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: We don't do quarterly forecast. Andreas, please, sorry.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: Just, when I look at the NII in treasury, it declines significantly, and partly or part of that is the transfer pricing that we've seen in other divisions. Can you tell us how much is that and how much is the underlying performance in our treasury? And then you can also say, where does it go, how much goes to the key divisions.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: I can give you all the details later on, but EUR 40 million is transferred from group functions into the BAs.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: EUR 40 million?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: EUR 40 million. And now the remaining EUR 20 million, one is a repayment of a loan. If you may remember, we had a funding agreement with a buyer of Polish business and they have now repaid that fully, and that is around EUR 6 million, EUR 7 million. Then we have slightly higher funding cost as we discussed, and the rest is simply higher regulatory costs, i.e., resolution and DGS.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: And then could you just...</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: So you can say -- sorry, so you can say this is a fair run rate going forward.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: And then the IFRS 13, right, in Denmark, how is that split between business banking and retail banking?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: EUR 77 million in personal banking and EUR 58 million in CBB. Peter?</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF: Yes. Just a follow-up on NII margins in personal banking. In Finland, NII was down some 10% QonQ. If you just could elaborate a bit on what drove that and...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes. We've had a challenge in Finland, that is the front book is having lower margin than the back book. We have had a lot of competition in Finland. However, given the changes recently in the risk or the mortgage floor is actually giving a bit of respite now in terms of the margin. So we do think that this is stabilized and we actually think we can grow market share in Finland from there.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: And if you look at the decline, I think it's EUR 9 million or so, EUR 8 million, EUR 9 million; and actually EUR 8 million were higher deposit and guarantee fees and EUR 2 million the day count effect. So underlying is not really happening at all.</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF: Okay. And the commentary on kind of margins and the volume growth in Finland, do you expect an uptick in the margins...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: We expect to grow with every market.</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF: But in terms of margins, is there any particular trend there?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: On household?</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF: Yes, I guess, mortgages.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes. I think the -- we're seeing a better respite, i.e., a bit of -- with the margin pressures coming off a little bit not necessary that is increasing.</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF: Okay. Then just one follow-up question on the funding costs. I mean, you mentioned in the past that it would probably be some back-end loaded in the year, that you find in funding cost. How should we look at Q2? I guess, it goes back to Magnus's question on the [quarter 4].</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: That I can support you with. We do expect funding cost to come down with a small amount in Q2, we are talking single-digit euros, and then it will remain on those levels in Q3 and Q4. So fairly small movements from Q1. Do we have more questions from the telephone?</p><p>OPERATOR: Certainly. We would take our next question from Bruce Hamilton of Morgan Stanley.</p><p>BRUCE HAMILTON, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Just a follow-up question looking at fees and commissions. When I look at the savings and investment income in Q1, it's down 13% year-over-year, and you've given some reasons. But the assets under management have only declined by 3% over that same period, and it looks like, in terms of where outflows have been, it would probably be where I'd expect, lower rather than higher margins, so institutional. So what's driving the much sharper decline in fee and commission? Is there just structural pressure on fee margins? Is it lower sales, because you're not generating as many sales? How do I understand what's going on there and whether that continues?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: If you look at asset management fees, I mean, you have seasonality, so you have no performance fees. Then we actually have another seasonal -- Yes. Then we have some seasonality also when it comes to the fund fee days, so we have less in Q1 and the rest is explained by lower volumes. If you look on the income spread under asset management, they have been fairly stable at around 42, 43 basis points. So we don't see any margin pressure.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will now take our next question from Riccardo Rovere of Mediobanca.</p><p>RICCARDO ROVERE, BANCA DI CREDITO FINANZIARIO S.P.A., RESEARCH DIVISION - RESEARCH ANALYST, MEDIOBANCA: Three questions, if I may. So on the discussions you're having with ECB, when do you think you will be in the position to say something to the market about your capital requirement and risk weighted assets? Do you think this is going to happen ahead of October 2018? This is my first question. The second question I have is on the capital gain that you will get from the sale of UC AB. Is this going to be treated like normal earning, so it's going to be part of a potential dividend payment? The third question I have is on the risk-weighted assets. That's come down a bit this quarter. Assuming the loan book doesn't change, should we expect IRB parameters to continue to improve over the next few quarters, and so RWA eventually to go -- to keep going down if the loan book remains flat or to go up less than the loan book, should the loan book start growing again? And the very final question I have is on -- given that the share price is kind of over and over, closer and closer to the tangible equity, would you consider efficient to maybe replace or substitute part of the dividend payment with a buyback?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: So let me maybe start with the capital and then see if I remember the following questions. So as I said earlier, we are in -- under the Swedish regulation, we are following the Swedish SREP process for 2018. We will then -- and we continue having dialog with ECB as we go forward. When we go into the SSM, we will follow their process. So the capital outcome of that will come out when we have clarity from SSM, how we land in terms of our discussions in accordance to their processes. And that also relates to question on buybacks. Buybacks, first of all, will need to be decided by the AGM at a later stage, and we will see what the capital outcome is as and when we are in SSM and what happens in the future.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: And on the capital gain, and I'm looking at Powell, I think it's other operating income, yes. And it's net of tax. And that we plan to report in Q2. We also plan to have the capital gain from the NordeaLife and Pensions Denmark in Q2, and that number is around EUR 250 million.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Did we miss a question?</p><p>RICCARDO ROVERE: Alright. No, no, no. I think I'm -- just on risk-weighted assets.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: Exactly, yes. And decline in this quarter, we had EUR 3.1 billion decline. Of that, almost everything relates to improved credit quality, it's around EUR 2.5 billion and the rest is FX; and the FX is then...</p><p>RICCARDO ROVERE: I understand that. But do you think it's going to go on like that? I mean, the credit quality within the group would allow further positive migrations, I don't know how to call it.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: We don't give guidance on that. We are very happy when it happens.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will now take our next question from Kim Bergoe of Deutsche Bank.</p><p>KIM BERGOE, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Actually most of my questions have been answered, but again just a little bit on what you said. Casper, I think you briefly just used the wording being over-capitalized, but obviously as you're saying, your cash spend is now going down, you've got these one-off effects coming in in the coming quarters. So it looks like your cash generation is going to be relatively strong this year as well. How should we be thinking about this? I mean, that you -- your buffer, what does that mean, what do we -- what should we expect from that? Is that just -- if it's not really -- if it's not distributable, then is it a buffer? So just how should we be thinking about this?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Maybe I'll just comment very briefly on the dividend policy. Obviously, we keep a dividend policy as is and we are accruing EUR 0.06 to EUR 0.09 for this quarter, which is nothing more than EUR 0.01 more than the previous one, and that is in line with our dividend policy. We have actually communicated that policy to our new regulators and we had no pushback on that. So that remains intact. And I think the answer to your other question remains as is, i.e., we will follow the process in SSM and we'll see the outcome of that and we will communicate that in due course.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We will now take our next question from Jacob Kruse of Autonomous.</p><p>JACOB MAX KRUSE, PARTNER, SCANDINAVIAN BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Can I just ask, when I look at the league table data you provided for your large corporate banking business and your commentary around some of those deals perhaps being more Q2. If I understand you correctly, this -- how much of your Q1 deal flows was reflected in Q1 and how much do you feel is flowing into Q2, or -- not precise numbers but what kind of magnitude are you talking about there? And then my other question was just quickly, the headquarter move that is scheduled for October 1, '18, is that on track and is that still where you expect to have that finalized?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: On the first question, was that how basically the level of income in Q2 in the wholesale banking, is that what you were asking?</p><p>JACOB MAX KRUSE: Well, no. I guess, what I'm asking is, if Q1 -- if you're saying Q1 was a strong quarter in the wholesale bank from a league table point of view, but perhaps not as strong from the revenue point of view, is that element of Q1 performance getting about to be booked in Q2?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: I mean, we've had a -- I mean the league tables are strong, the environment was good, and we've had very good deals in Q1 as well. But it's -- it was weak, but the momentum now going into Q2 is strong. So there is an element of pipeline that we have, which is -- that we see which is good, that we hope will materialize in Q2.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: And also if you look at the tombstones we presented under the investment banking chart, you saw some very sizable deals that are not closed yet. And unfortunately, we are not allowed to invoice before we close the deal, but we plan to do that in Q2.</p><p>JACOB MAX KRUSE: Right. Okay. And this headquarter move?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes. At the moment, we are continuing our discussions with the relevant authorities and we are aiming and on track to meet the 1st of October date.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00c3\u00a9N: And maybe [already into] with the head of the Swedish FSA and we were happy to hear that he has exactly the same view as we have on the capital side. So we are pleased to see that we are aligned in the thinking.

Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a, Chief Executive Officer; and Philippe Heim, Chief Financial Officer, will present the group first quarter 2018 results. Gentlemen, please go ahead.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 G\u00e9N\u00e9RALE SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 ANONYME: Good morning to all of you. Thanks for attending our conference call on the first quarter results. I suggest that we proceed like usually. We'll meet with Philippe Helm, our CFO, with short presentation, and then we will, with our management team, answer your questions. I'd like to again highlight the good discipline that we keep usually, 2 questions per each person.</p><p>So let me start immediately with the first slide, Page 4, to have an overview of our first quarter results. In an environment, which was robust in terms of economic activity, mainly across the world and in particular in the Eurozone. And with market environment where we commenced with a sharp contrast from one region to the other. When we look at this first quarter, first of all, if you look at the profitability on an underlining basis, normalizing for the IFRIC 21, a return on tangible equity of 10.9%. We have still work to do but I find this figure encouraging.</p><p>When we look at the net banking income, first of all, good developments for all our retail activity . In French retail, good commercial momentum, with revenues still affected by the low interest rate environment and also by the effect of the larger renegotiations on the mortgage, which creates to a certain extent an unfavorable base effect. Fundamentally, we are advancing in line with our expectations toward the stabilization of revenue, we expect for the full year of 2018.</p><p>Regarding International Retail Banking &amp; Financial Services, we have positive momentum across the board. We will look at this more in detail. And regarding the Global Banking &amp; Investor Solutions, of course, we suffer from the decrease of the dollar versus the euro. We have roughly on these activities, 40% of our revenues, which are influenced by the euro-dollar foreign exchange rate. And also, as I said, by a sharp contrast that we've seen between our different activities and geographies.</p><p>In a very awkward quarter, which was already commented by all the banks, we have a strong start, but then something more sluggish in February and March. We feel in particular, very strong activity on the slow equity business in the U.S., while on the other hand, in Europe, we had -- we saw low demand, for example, on structured products with probably some impact related to MiFID. All in all solid performance with the decrease of revenues, but of course, which is influenced by the business model in the capital market activities.</p><p>We maintained a strong discipline on the cost, of course, the cost base, for example, retail has an all -- let me just remind you that all our transformation costs are allocated to the businesses, then and you will notice, in particular, the first quarter that we have a Corporate Centre, which is at the breakeven. So we have all our costs of transformation on the businesses. But beyond this, we maintained a strong discipline on the cost. Can I just highlight the increase of the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund. This first quarter, we, of course -- the IFRIC 21 effect, we have booked EUR 430 million, that's net of tax, it's unpredictable, which represent an increase of EUR 78 million compared with last year, and again, of course, allocated to the business.</p><p>Regarding the cost of risk, it remains very low at around 18 basis points. Let me just remind you that it was a similar figure for 2017 at 19 basis points. Again underlying net income, at EUR 1.2 billion. And I've as mentioned already, this return on tangible equity at 10.9% again normalizing the impact of IFRIC 21.</p><p>Regarding just the Slide 5, the objective on the 3 main businesses. As you know, for this year, it's a very important year of transformation. We want to progress and in particular the utilization of our processes. We effectively guarantee closing back offices. We are reducing the number of branches and at the same time, deploy the new growth initiatives. I like to highlight that we will look at that more in detail in particular. The strong dynamic of Boursorama with more than 126,000 new clients during just the first quarter. And I already commented on our expectation of a stabilization of revenues in 2018.</p><p>Regarding all our International Retail Banking &amp; Financial Services, we are posting, as I said, strong revenue for growth, in particular, on the International Retail Banking and the Insurance business, we talked about an 8% revenue growth on the like-for-like basis, and with good differences across the board. The return on normative equity, the underlying return on normative equity stands at 17%. We are basically at our target for 2020 and above. Fundamentally, we want to pursue and we are confident that we would see the kind of -- this kind of perspective for 2018.</p><p>In Global Banking &amp; Investor Solutions, what we are seeing is again the impact and the effect of this transition towards a more normalized monetary policy. Europe is behind the U.S. It's very clear, as I said. We saw all the elements of the markets in U.S., perspective of higher rates, the positive impact of lower tax cuts, which means a better result for the U.S. tax but also potentially share buybacks. The volatility effect, in particular, impacting big tax stocks. The VIX impact on certain products, we had not the same thing in Europe, and we have, again, in mind the progressive normalization but we -- it would -- it might take some time.</p><p>Overall, what we want to achieve is a focus on our 2 main strategic objectives in terms of European product, and I'd like to highlight our #1 position, for example, in terms of the euro-denominated bond for corporates as well as I must say a #1 position, for example, for global securitization. So we see the benefits of a strong positioning.</p><p>In capital market, we will see that in more detail, and let me highlight, we had confirmation of market share gain in 2017. And you will see the more precise figures, that stronghold of product. What we want to achieve is, again, to pursue the development also of our derivative franchise on a worldwide basis. With a selective and a strong optimization of capital usage. When you look at our GBIS results this quarter, we post more than 10% return on normative equity after-tax that shows this discipline, and we want to achieve globally this capacity to outperform our European peers in terms of profitability.</p><p>Now I will pass to Philippe, who will enter more into the details.</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM, DEPUTY CEO, SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 G\u00e9N\u00e9RALE SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 ANONYME: Thank you very much, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. So now let's have a look on all the aspects of the group results, starting with the cost of risk. If you move to Slide 6, you have the description of what we've got in terms of cost of risk.</p><p>First, the group results, we see that we have a very low cost of risk in Q1, coming at 18 basis points versus 24 last year. It reflects, of course, the [once again] the structural results we delivered in the past 3 years. It reflects the so -- the buy-ins and trade economic environment. You can note also that in terms of nonperforming loans, although we've (inaudible) we move down from 4.8% to 4.2%. And then all across the board, in every business line, we had the same pattern. So cost of risk at 29 in Q1, 28 in international retail, and net, let's say, reversal of a positive cost of risk in GBIS, minus 5 basis points.</p><p>So what is the outlook now going forward, I may -- they anticipate a questions. We are indicating during Investor Day that it's reasonable from this point to anticipate the gradual normalization of cost of risk during the cycle and converging positively to something between 35 and 40 basis points in 2020. Our guidance for this year was for cost of risk between 25 and 30 basis points. Obviously, given the low level we see in Q1, this guidance can be qualified as very conservative.</p><p>On capital, I will be short, not surprised at all on capital. You have the CET1 ratio standing at 11.2%, down by 20 basis points. But related to 2 elements I mentioned before during the year-end results, you have the first-time application impact of IFRS 9, and we decided not to adopt this, let's say the phase-in approach, so to take in one go the impact of IFRS 9. As all French banks, we have this methodological add-on on irrevocable commitments on Single Resolution Fund with impact of 8 basis points. On the top of that, we have the usual seasonal effect of IFRIC 21. So bottom line, if the CET1 ratio is down by 20 basis points, it will neutralize the effect I mentioned before. We created this quarter, 7 basis points of capital. So on a yearly basis, something between 25 and 30 basis points. So let's say, right in the middle of our usual guidance in terms of capitalization. I confirm that we expect a CET1 ratio at [11.5%] at the end of this year.</p><p>Regarding the other metric of the balance sheet, you see that with the benefit of the issuance of the AT1 issuance beginning at April, with a TC capital about 17.1%, leverage ratio at 4.2%. We are already TLAC compliant. So overall, we have a very solid balance sheet structure, and we very recently from end of guide from Moody's, our senior debt rating has been lifted from A2 to A1.</p><p>Page 8. I will be brief, this is the summary of the consolidated results, with the elements already described. So revenues down by 2.5%, affected by a change effect. Operating expenses, if we -- linearize or annualize the IFRIC 21 effects, operating expenses were up by 1%. Net cost of risk is very low at EUR 208 million, so we have reported group net income at EUR 850 million. But we're smoothing out the effect of IFRIC 21. We cannot [waive] our underlying group net income at EUR 1.2 billion, representing a ROTE of 10.9%.</p><p>So now let's review the activity of, let's say, the businesses particular with the French Retail. And we'll focus first on individual customer segments, where we continue to deploy our model. Regarding Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord, as a foreword, I think that in Q1, we have maintained our strong discipline on the quality of our origination, both in terms of margin levels and risk appetite, and focusing on mass affluent and wealthy clients. Boursorama, and then we'll elaborate on this, demonstrates the strength of its customer acquisition engine. And regarding specifically, to let's say, the client base, the number of mass affluent and wealthy clients was up by 5% in Q1.</p><p>Regarding the commercial activity, we are first on the real estate market. Our production was down by 19% but it was the high base points, Q1 of last year. Issue analyzed sequentially, the production is up 4.7% compared to this Q4. We were on last year in the middle of a negotiation wave. This movement is now over. The current annual negotiation base stands at 3% in the Q1 versus 26% last year. In consumer credit space, the production dropped 18%, the outstanding is up by 2.4%. It's interesting I think to mention that we have also consumer credit activity in France namely in auto loans, in [CGI book] in Western Europe. If you put together all our consumer credit outstanding books, in fact we have an increase of 7%.</p><p>Regarding the key initiative this quarter, you can see that is net inflows of private banking activity is well oriented, an increase also EUR 1.1 billion. Again in Boursorama, record quarter in terms of acquisition is more than 126,000 new clients, close to 1.4 million clients. And I have to highlight that Boursorama, contrary to strong market players who only develop payment services, Boursorama is a full-fledged bank delivering a compounded set of products and services.</p><p>Switching to professional and corporate clients on Page 11, you see that we continue to develop [supply and debt] with a goal of 2.5% for the corporate clients. The book is up by 3.3%. We decided this quarter to make a specific focus on Credit du Nord's model. You know that 60% of Credit du Nord's customers and professionals are SMEs, with a very high level of customer satisfaction that is a clear differentiating element. We have a network of professional banks capable of addressing specific local characteristics and needs of our clients. And this model is powerful in terms of acquisition in Q1 alone, where the 6,200 new relationships.</p><p>A word on transformation. We describe largely, let's say, the strategy, we deploy on the French market. The idea is to completely reshuffle overall the distribution platform and your guiding model by 2020, with the reduction of number (inaudible) by 20%. This will be, of course, a company that by roughly 3,400 redundancy. This confirmation program, of course, requires investment and expenditures. The HR aspects are covered by the exceptional provision we took in Q4, roughly EUR 400 million. As you may know, in early March, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, we designed -- we leveraged on the new scheme introduced by the Macron ordinance (inaudible) French labor code. In this context, we have signed a maturity agreement with the trade unions for corrective mutually agreed combination, what you call (foreign language) of more than 2,000 positions. And we're one of the first corporates using this scheme. Over and above each aspect, there are other operating expenses, other investments cover regarding the depletion of the network coverage. We plan to close one of our branches this year. Where we saw expenses or investment to overall and upgrade the customer experience and positive in that respect. We have a [land-locked delivery] this year with innovative tools like biometric face recognition of 360 view to have a real-time [intrinsic] vision of all premium data. At the end of 2018, this is an important milestone, 50% of our main processes will have been digitalized within the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale network.</p><p>So what is the magnitude of this investment? What is important to keep in mind is that this is fully consistent with our trajectory. So between 2016 and 2020. As indicated during our Investor Day, the cost increase will be -- the annual cost increase will be contained within 1%. And more specifically regarding 2018, costs are expected to increase by less than [3%].</p><p>So moving to Slide 13, to give you an overview of the results for the French Retail division. Revenues are down by 1.6%. So we confirm that, positively we are heading towards a stabilization expected for the full year. It should be positive because indeed, if we take the example of the interest margin revenues, they are down by 4.3%. We have the usual, let's say, effect of interest rate (inaudible) has on the reinvestment of deposits. But on top of that, the bulk of, let's say, this decrease is related to the renegotiation wave of last year. During which, we received fees and revenues associated with renegotiation and early termination of around EUR 27 million. This effect will be fully absorbed between Q2 and Q3. That's why its normalization and the full year stabilization will be seen moderately in the year.</p><p>Regarding commissions, they are slightly down by 0.9% due to, for example, the disposal of OnVista in Germany, the subsidiary of Boursorama, where we saw bits and pieces of this gradual business effect. Bottom line, it is a good start of the year (inaudible) and private banking.</p><p>Operating expenses increased by 4.2%. Net cost of risk is relatively stable compared with last year. All those elements leading to a contribution to the operating income of EUR 270 million.</p><p>So now let's move to IBFS, starting with Europe, Russia and Africa, delivering altogether a return on normative equity of 15.5%. We continue to enjoy in Europe very strong results in a sound economic environment with solid growth of outstanding loans, up by 8%, ranging between 12% in Western Europe in consumer finance space to 5% in Czech Republic in a lot of mature markets, but still a good performance given the characteristic of the market. In this context, revenues were up 6%. We have a clear positive jaws and profitability stands at 21% for Europe.</p><p>Regarding Russia, of course, the situation I described is one of the -- quarter's starting just in Jan and ending end of March. In the context of progressive normalization, an inflation of 2.5 is stable at that time, ruble. Interest rates growth down to 7.25% by Central Bank of Russia. We have the usual seasonality effect in Q1 and the continuity of the background we have identified the past 2 quarters. So progressively, a catch up in the accelerated pace with recovery of retail loan as the production is up by 29%. Overall, revenues are up by 9% in Russia.</p><p>In Africa, the economic environment is very solid between the Mediterranean Basin and Sub-Saharan Africa. We have the loan book up by 19%, revenues up by 13%. The point for us in Africa is to lift the return on normative equity of above 15% by both developing our revenues and increasing -- improving our operating efficiency, we will accelerate deployment of regional ops where support functions and (inaudible) will be located and put.</p><p>A word on the bankinsurance model, Page 15. An activity which we guided EUR 2.1 billion of revenues in 2017, up by 8%. This will -- those revenues are distributed between the insurance business unit collecting EUR 0.8 million of revenues and the retail network for EUR 1.3 billion through distribution fees. We want, down the road, to further increase the concentration of insurance activities through lifting the equipment rate of our retail banking clients, for example, our objective the in P&amp;C space. We want to lift the P&amp;C equipment rate from 9% in 2017 to 12% in 2020. And also we want to increase the share of unit-linked products in life insurance outbound. And one of the key factors of success, of course, we need to deploy to improve the simplicity and liquidity of the customer experience. That's the (inaudible) we have already implemented several innovations. For example, (inaudible) with electronic signature to subscribe in a fully car autonomous manner, car insurance or property insurance.</p><p>Page 16, you have the big picture on IBFS. So revenues, up by 3.9% adjusted for changes in cost structure and at constant exchange rates. Operating expenses rose at the same time by 3.2% because we need to accompany the movement of development. Overall, IBFS delivered high level of contribution, EUR 429 million, stable with last year. And this is a quite nice performance given the fact that we now consolidate only 80% of ALD following the (inaudible). And you remember that we had benefited last year after the sale of Komercn\u00c3\u00ad banka head office for prospects effect of EUR 17 million. So we managed to cover those elements and to strategize the consolidation of net income and where the return on normative equity standing at 17% this quarter adjusted for IFRIC 21.</p><p>So now moving to GBIS. And before commenting the results, we share with you the data we collected from Coalition on market share. And I think that before commenting the year-on-year evolution on specific statements, but online it's very relevant and it's (inaudible) to see that over particular time between 2018 and 2017 all across, let's say, the activity on geographies, we are one of the banks capable of increasing market share. So relatively speaking we move from 3.5% to 3.7%. We strengthened our market share in equity, in FIC and commodity.</p><p>So now moving to, let's say, the result of [GB], starting with global markets and investor services. Revenues were down by 13%, with diverging developments between businesses and regions. Starting first with fixed income, activities declined significantly by 27%, mentioning that Q1 structure was (inaudible) for activity from extremely lower activity in Europe, in particular. Financing, which was (inaudible) last year, was weakened by increased competition. On the other hand, we have a pretty resilient performance of the structured product with FICC underlying [into 1]. Regarding equity, revenues were down by 5% if we neutralize the foreign exchange effect (inaudible) 2 factors. We have a pretty good performance, onshore products and specifically in the U.S., but we are less exposed on the U.S. activity and geography. Regarding structured products, which are represent our franchise, we have less, let's say, buoyant environment, in particular, in Europe with a more pronounced weight (inaudible) by our clients and, at some point, more conservative buyers -- of course, the volatility spiked in February. Moving to securities services, very good quarter, revenues up by 9% with a good level of commissions.</p><p>Moving to Slide 19, Financing &amp; Advisory. 50% of revenues in this division are in USD. So if we neutralize this effect, let's say, this is -- and we neutralize the foreign exchange impact, revenues were roughly stable, minus 1%, with good performance in all asset-based activity, export financing, real estate, project finance. Revenues in securitization were up for the ninth consecutive quarter. We have also quite nice achievements in this year. Finally, in wealth and asset management, revenues were down by minus 2% [versus] last quarter. We had good, let's say, momentum in terms of inflows, more than EUR 7 billion. Altogether, Lyxor and one wealth management, we reached an all-time high of EUR 234 billion of AUM.</p><p>So the summary of the results for GBIS, revenues down by 13% due to negative foreign exchange effect. OpEx were up by 1%, impacted significantly by the increase of the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (inaudible). Cost of risk remained very low. And the contribution of GBIS to group net income stood at EUR 166 million. And excluding -- let's say, excluding the effect of IFRIC 21, we stick to a cost stability at 10.2% for GBIS.</p><p>A word on the Corporate Centre, Slide 21. I would like to remind you that with the new IFRS 9 standard, we have, let's say, the effect of revaluation of our own financial liabilities and will now go directly to the shareholder equity. We have, this quarter, a positive GOI, plus EUR 36 million. Regarding our guidance of Corporate Centre, GOI of minus EUR 400 million, we can state that this guidance is conservative. And we will come back to you regarding, let's say, the guidance later on this year. Lastly, regarding disputes, we can confirm that we have entered into a phase of [marquee] discussions with relevant authorities to conclude the production agreement on labor and (inaudible) cases within the next few weeks. We have good visibility regarding the financial impact. We are comfortable with the around EUR 1 billion provision. We're satisfied within our provision of EUR 2.3 billion.</p><p>So much from me. I'll leave the floor to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric for the conclusion.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Thank you, Philippe. Just in a few words, Slide 23, to recap our main objective for 2018. I think we have already commented on the revenues. I'd like again to highlight that this year will be a very significant year of transformation, in particular, in the French retail but not -- just on the French retail. I'd like to again reemphasize on our commitment to deliver on cost and maintain a strong discipline. The outlook for the cost of risk, as we've already mentioned, is good, and our current guidance appears to be conservative, very conservative.</p><p>On the refocusing that we had announced, I can say that the processes are underway to deliver our target and we can expect some material announcements by year-end. And of course, at the same time, we are fully committed to objectives in terms of responsibility, CSR, for example, in terms of climate change, and the deployment of our culture and conduct program.</p><p>Can I just, of course, finish also by saying a few words on the change of our management team that we have announced also yesterday? As you know, the board had to face the unexpected departure of Didier Valet, who was, in practice, our younger Deputy CEO in a team of 3 Deputy CEOs with myself plus the CEO. So having to deal with the situation, the board organized a very structured process with a very clear time frame with 2 objectives: first of all, of course, ensure full continuity and capacity to deliver our strategic plan; and at the same time, preparing the future, the succession plan. The process was -- and we generally use that process to explore all the internal options and, of course, review the potential external options with these 2 objectives in mind. In practice, between the different internal options, we decided to go for the most ambitious one. We could have -- both could have made the choice just to replace Didier and then implement progressive changes alongside the strategic plan. The board decided to go for something more ambitious, on one hand, ensuring continuity and, in particular, announcing a little bit ahead of the usual framework that -- they will effectively propose the renewal of my mandate as CEO to the vote of our shareholders in the general assembly of 2019; and at the same time, change effectively the composition, in particular, and more marginally the organization, going for 4 Deputy CEOs instead of 3.</p><p>First of all, let me say in that context, Bernardo Sanchez decided to leave the group to pursue other opportunity. As you know, Bernardo has been with us 8 years, has very good -- great contribution with the strong current improvements of the results in IBFS that's reflected also in the first quarter as well as in 2017 and has launched successfully this long-term transformation of the French Retail. And I would like to thank him and really highlight his contribution to our group.</p><p>We have decided to appoint, alongside S\u00e9verin, who was already Deputy CEO, 3 new Deputy CEOs, which I think share the same -- I mean, they are all very seasoned, experienced bankers with different backgrounds. Let me just remind you that Philippe Aymerich is appointed the Deputy CEO in charge of all the French Retail activities and the financial services. What I mean by this is IT, procurement and real estate. And he has spent 30 years with Societe Generalemainly in corporate investment banking activities in the risk function. He had been the CEO of the U.S. -- Deputy CEO of the risk function and was before the CEO of Cr\u00e9dit du Nord. Philippe Heim, our current CFO, joined us in 2007 and after and experienced as a senior banker, head of strategy and CFO, is taking over as the Deputy CEO in charge of international retail banking activities and financial services as well as the insurance. S\u00e9verin, who, as you know, is also -- has a diverse profile in the [financial] industry and joined us more than 10 years ago. He is taking over Didier Valet's role, something that he -- activities that he supervised in the past. And we will -- again, the objective to implement the strategy and further nurture our talents. And Diony Lebot -- and I say I'm very proud to appoint the first woman as the Deputy CEO in Societe Generale, is also a seasoned banker, Greek by background. She spent more than 30 years with us mainly on the businesses in the wholesale banking business. She worked, for example, as head of the U.S. activities in 2012. She has had also responsibilities in the structured financing business as well as in the coverage business of wholesale claims and was, since 2015, head of our risk department.</p><p>Alongside these appointments, I'm very happy also to have been able to appoint additional strong talents of Societe Generale. William Kadouch is taking over as CFO. William, the same thing, joined us in 2007. He has had an experience as senior banker in U.S. banks then was also a senior banker with us and followed the same path (inaudible) Philippe, after his senior banker experience, was appointed head of strategy and now CFO. You can see that we are building career development with a very long-term plan to [feed] our succession planning objectives. And Sylvie R\u00e9mond is taking over Diony Lebot as head of risk; same thing, has long experience as a banker with Societe Generalemainly in the structured finance business. She had been our also deputy head of risk, and she was currently co-head of our coverage activity.</p><p>So if you wish, what I'd like to highlight in looking at this profile, there are backgrounds -- there are ages. I must say I'm very proud to have the team of very seasoned bankers who know how to work together, who had been fully committed in the preparation of the strategic plan, who are diversified. And we have a real force, the diversity of the team, and I must say I think we are actually delivering on the 2 objectives, continuity and capacity to deliver the strategic plan and prepare the future.</p><p>So that's what I wanted to say, and we are now open to your questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We have our first question from Mr. Tarik El Mejjad from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.</p><p>TARIK EL MEJJAD, EQUITY ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have 2 questions, please. First, on CIB, so what happened? So all your peers showed very good numbers. Consensus was relatively low to beat. So my question here -- I mean, I hear your answer about the flow in U.S. and structured products being weaker, less demand (inaudible) but I mean, I think the structural question here is like for the last 3 quarters, really, you underperformed the market despite market share gain actually. And it's really actually the engine -- structural engine of the equity market is working as (inaudible)? Or do you think there is something more structural to fix there? It is maybe management changes and discussion by the [title]. That's really to understand what's going in there. And my second question is on cost. How the EUR 17.8 billion by 2020 is really relevant? What if you don't see this revenue's revival actually coming mainly on CIB, I would say, would you review that one down?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Tarik, I will take the first question and leave the floor to Philippe for the second one. First of all, again, I'd like to come back to Slide 17, and here, we are presenting figures provided to us by Coalition. As you probably know, Coalition is, in our view at least, the institution which has the most granular and precise information regarding revenues on the different segments of capital markets. And on the slide, you can see that we have gained, marginally every year, market share. It is in terms of revenues. And that's true for all geographies, and that's true for all products. Now if I jump to the first quarter, as I said, now we saw very contrasted activities. And just to reflect that, we have very good activities, for example, on the equity flow in the U.S. while, on the other hand, it was more muted on the credit flow in the U.S. And in Europe, we have effectively low demand on structured product at the beginning of this year as well as on the [flow side]. We just made -- not just -- we'd like to tell you we've made a pretty theoretical calculation. But based on the Coalition figures, which enable us, if I would say, to model, for example, an average U.S. bank in terms of business mix and that's, for example, for equity, so of course, much more geared towards U.S. equity, cash and derivatives through a business than we are. And we have plugged towards that model our own performances for each segment in the beginning of this year. And effectively, in practice, we end up with increases of revenues in equity. I would say [periods] because it increases, which are pretty similar to the ones posted by our [best] competitors. So we have really the feeling that we have, this quarter, something very contrasted. As I said, all the elements which happened was largely centered in the U.S., the volatility on big tech stocks, the events (inaudible) on certain products. And we feel that explains largely the document of peers as well as reflected in our own performances, for example, on the U.S. flow and, of course, with a percentage of our business which is smaller. Looking forward, we think that we have effectively centered our strategy on the businesses which offer, in the longer term, the best growth revenue prospectives. And there have been a recent in many surveys highlighting, for example, the [fact] that probably services to corporates might offer more growth prospect than activities towards institutional investors and that, effectively, we have in mind the development of the European capital market going forward. At the same time, we also had factored in our strategic plan that we would -- could still see in the coming quarters this awkward transitional environment in Europe in particular, where effectively, rates will increase progressively. Volatility might not come back structurally and that clarity would be probably needed in Europe to have more stable conditions. And effectively, what we have in mind is that going forward, there will be, for example, more ability to do a structured -- new categories of structured products with different rate curve and fundamentally further extract more synergies from our different activities. You will have noticed that in the prime services, we see an increase of revenues. We have in mind to further develop this activity and, of course, take advantage of further synergies with our client base. There is more capacity to optimize the franchise on that business. So I think that again, this quarter is very contrasted. These conditions might last for -- again, for sure, for a few months. But going forward, if I look at the next 3 years, we are again considering (inaudible) capacity to deliver growth in these activities. And there was, again, nothing specific beyond conservative. And we maintain a conservative risk approach when we hedge our book of equity structured products. It can cost in the kind of environment we've seen. But there was, in our view, nothing specific beyond these contrasted -- more than ever contrasted activity levels depending on geographies and products. Can I turn back to Philippe regarding the costs?</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: Yes, Tarik, okay. So regarding the cost, you have a different way of considering the cost. So the reported view -- so we have an increase of 4.7% at face value. But this is, of course, inflated by the IFRIC 21 effect and notably the surge of the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund. We have an important surge also, EUR 80 million this quarter for the group. And as you know, 75% are allocated to GBIS. So the impact for GBIS loan is, first, EUR 60 million. So it's fair to -- let's say, to smooth this effect during, let's say, the year. Bottom line, let's say, the division has been hedging on the cost-cutting measures that we implemented in the past quarters. We continue to deploy those measures. You know that we will maintain the discipline in our strategic plan. What is important is to see that on an underlying basis, the return on normative equity of GBIS stay at 10.2% in this kind of environment and this kind of situation. So I think it is a strategy hedging on performance in terms of profitability.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Mr. Guillaume Tiberghein from Exane.</p><p>GUILLAUME TIBERGHIEN, HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN BANKS TEAM &amp; ANALYST OF BANKS, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: I've got 2 questions. The first one relates to your plan to reduce RWA by 5% in the course of the next 3 years. And you highlight that you expect some important measure to be announced before year-end. Can you quantify, in terms of earnings, how much we should expect to lose from this 5% RWA reduction? Is it as simple as a 5% EPS cut? And the second question relates to, actually, your 2020 targets, which are admittedly not yet trusted by consensus. But if you take your EUR 1.2 billion of net profit for Q1, assuming IFRIC is annualized, if you normalize cost of risk and maybe a bit of losses in the Corporate Centre, you're only at EUR 4 billion of profit and you need to go to EUR 5.2 billion. I'm really struggling to see how you can grow 30% from there. So can you, maybe in terms of building blocks, try to explain to us how we go from here to there?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Guillaume, the first question was on risk-weighted asset, what I can tell you is that we are targeting activities with (inaudible) lower profitability. So it's a way to improve the return of normative equity of our different activities. And we'll see what we will do with this money. But fundamentally, there would be a benefit in terms, again, of capital return. I can't give you (inaudible) a magnitude, if you wish, of the earnings but it will be positive. Regarding your question on the 2020 plan, it would take long because we would need to go back to again the different components of our revenue growth. I presented 9 fundamental initiatives. Can I say when I look at the figures -- first of all, the French Retail, obviously, is in a kind of [trust] currency. We have -- we are -- as we said, we see the progress with the improvement of the revenue evolution basically this year towards the stabilization this year and then an improvement and a mechanical improvement, may I say, just by the normalization of the -- on the rates and, of course, with the cost with cost evolution, which will benefit from all the efforts that we've made and we are investing currently to effectively transform the networks (inaudible) et cetera. So the current contribution, definitely, does not represent what we expect in 2020, and the cost of risk should not fundamentally vary from its current level in the French Retail. Regarding our international retail banking with -- and financial services, you remember the kind of jaws that we presented, 5.5% evolution of revenues, 4% on the cost. Yes, on this activity, we should have some normalization of the cost of risk which remains extraordinarily low, in particular (inaudible) banks for example, in Romania. But we are very confident that we would maintain a strong profitability but with a [pie] which will [increase] significantly. And then on the GBIS, as I've said, here, we talk about activities where -- and I must say it was reflected by our U.S. (inaudible) this quarter. Well, you don't have necessarily a linear increase in the environment. Of course, it bottomed from that perspective. We will further develop, as I said, in the long term with a very strict focus, our activities. The paradox is that yes, we are gaining market share. As I said, we -- I've never seen so high [lead] tables on the European product in this year, for example, than this -- end of the first quarter. We are #1 in all DCM issues for corporates in the Euro bond market. So we see the capacity to further extract the [newer clients]. We have more synergies to extract. And on the cost side, the discipline will be there with significant changes, new systems, more offshoring, things which are -- with structuring, improve the profitability. Yes, the cost of risk should increase a little bit compared still with write-back, what we have in mind for risk appetite overall, and it should not change the picture. And on the Corporate Centre, we've been discussing for quite a while -- some time the division of the Corporate Centre. I'd like to highlight that we have finished the journey to charge the liquidity cost to the businesses. We don't allocate the restructuring costs (inaudible) it should be more negative than what we are preparing in this quarter -- presenting but (inaudible) we've also commented on gross operating income which -- just to be pretty conservative this year. So we are again confident that in a different environment, progressively, normalization of rate, we will effectively achieve this target with the benefit of the (inaudible), I would like to highlight, of our effectively (inaudible) of capital. And just to finish, I'd like to say 10.9% return of intangible equity for this quarter, precisely without exceptional performances on the market, seems to me to be an encouraging performance.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Mr. Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>BRUCE ALLAN HAMILTON, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I'm going to go back to CIB. I hear you about some of the mix impacts in your business, but from conversations I've had, it sounds like even in structured products in Europe, quite a few of your competitors saw growth. So I just want to understand, is it something do with the sort of retail SKU in your structured book? Or something else going on there? Or was there any hedging imperfection that drove some unexpected moves in Q1 that might reverse because clearly that would help on the book forward? And then linked to that, I mean, in what is normally the best quarter of the year, you've printed just over EUR 50 million of pre-provision profit, down 85% year-over-year in the global markets business. Cost are flat, revenue are down 17%. So it doesn't look like you can hold off taking more aggressive action on costs for long. So how quickly and how dynamically can you move the cost base there to improve your returns because it looks like you're quite -- I realize some of this will build into the longer-term plan, but if it was far off kilter, you need to do something far off. So how are you thinking about that?</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: I will maybe let Frank way ahead of us (inaudible) the global capital markets, it's a little bit your -- the first element of your question, which is related to structured products. And on the cost, we have, in this division also a capacity to optimize the structure of the cost. And when I say this, it can be by reallocating resources from one sub activity to another, which will effectively at least improve the profitability on capital. Second, as I said, and there are some structural further action with IT investments, which will lead effectively to further cuts, for example, in support functions, and we have planned which are ambitious on that front, we're also further off-shoring. So it cannot be -- it will take a few quarters, it's not something that you change from one quarter to the other, but we have plan as well. We have presented that actually GBIS will contribute to the asset on the productivity in the 3-year strategy by, if I remember, something like EUR 300 million, I think, under the control of Philippe Helm, but I have in mind that kind of objective.</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: Frank, can you perhaps elaborate a little bit on the first elements of Bruce's questions?</p><p>FRANK BENZIMRA, HEAD OF ASIA EQUITY STRATEGY, SOCIETE GENERALECROSS ASSET RESEARCH: Yes, it's sure that our activity on structured product, we have -- a strong part of our revenue is coming from distribution of structured product to the retail. It's true in Asia and it's true as well in Europe. And compared with the -- to the competition, we are more geared toward the distribution products and especially on the equity side. And it's true that in Q1, while we are seeing a strong development objectivity in Asia, it was quiet in Europe. So we think that there was the MiFID II impact. And also the fact that maybe compared to Asia and the U.S., there was less story in the equity market in the Q1 in Europe, which explains as well why we are seeing a relatively quiet activity on the distribution product in Europe.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Maxence Le Gouvello from Jefferies.</p><p>MAXENCE PATRICK PATRICK LAURENT LE GOUVELLO DU TIMAT, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I would have 2 questions. The first one is for Frederic. The stock is down by 6% to 7% today. In your view, what are we missing that explains this kind of underperformance on the day and since the beginning of the year? The second question would be on French Retail. Can you share with us how much of the cost base is linked to increase -- is linked to the investment that you are making in Q1 and Q2?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: First of all, I will leave the second part of your question to Philippe, Maxence. I noticed that we are down by 5% because the European banks, which are also, I noticed, down today. And I will not mean that you can see that some of the result disappointed after performance which was not so bad since the beginning of the year. Structurally, we don't look at our performance on a daily basis, but we have, yes, due to 2 things: first, definitely the base of the crisis, may I say, which means put behind the litigations, we have commented on that front. You might have noticed our communication, which is to say that regarding 2 of the 3 potential settlements we have on LIBOR and LIA, we are having very active discussions, and we think we can potentially settle in the coming days or weeks. And effectively, we've anticipated potential financial impact in line with the level of provisioning that we have previously communicated around EUR 1 billion within our general EUR 2.3 billion provision. That's one. And then effectively, structurally, sure in the market that we can deliver once again the level of profitability and effectively then have valuation much more in line with I would say between the tangible book and the book. We are just at the beginning of these profits. We are just starting with 2018. As I've said, we're probably are mixed in terms of the results, which does not reflect market expectation at the beginning of this year. But we, as I've said, have a 10.9% return on tangible equity, which I think is encouraging, just at the beginning of this journey, knowing that when I think I can see improvements on the revenue and the cost and the cost efficiency going forward. And as I've said, I don't expect a very significant deterioration of the cost of risk. So it is just the beginning of the journey. We've always felt that, yes, we have to deliver consistently our results, so it could take a few quarters. But I think fundamentally, the development we are seeing in our businesses are in line with our anticipations, of course, in a stable environment, which is more contrasted in Europe than in the U.S. Philippe, can you elaborate?</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: Yes, of course. So the increase of cost we've seen in the French Retail this quarter is around plus 4.2%. Of course, we have to smooth the effect of IFRIC 21. We have to search for a neutralized perimeter effect. So increase are discussed is around this 3.2%. To simplify, this is the debate, I assume that apart from what we can call the natural [drift] of expenses, roughly around 1%. Everything is more or less ready for transformation. So to give you, it's in order of [92] So say what we invest, what we didn't take to the transformation that says large-scale transformation of the network both on the distribution channels and on your accounting model.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Delphine Lee from JPMorgan.</p><p>DELPHINE LEE, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: So 2 on my side. First of all, I just wanted to come back on your guidance for French retail costs on Slide 12. Just to understand, the 3% -- on the 3%, because it looks like the consensus is expecting cost flattish. So I'm just wondering where that's coming from? And the except for no charges, I assume is only the EUR 400 million, which you booked in Q4 of last year. So if you adjust for that, it looks like there is a slight increase. I'm just trying to understand the limits of what's under that guidance? And then secondly, just more generally, for this year, is your target to increase the dividend per share? And -- or anything you can comment on already on dividends?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: I will let Philippe answer your first question. I think it's very premature, first of all, to comment on the dividend. But I must say we have announced a policy, which is to have a payout ratio of 50%, a floor at 2020, and we are not changing this policy, and we have applied this policy as early as 2017, and there's no change to be expected. Philippe, on the first question?</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: Yes. So on your question regarding this again. Yes, the whole story of the French Retail is to accelerate the transformation to deliver in 2020 event that is more efficient and with return on equity, we described today around 14%. So bottom line, we have to invest in the meantime. And yes, we took a specific provision in Q4 that -- let's be clear. From a net operating standpoint provision, it's there to, let's say, to cover cost or to cover investments that are not producing any cash flow in the future. So you can provision by on HR voluntary services some specific trending of mobility cost. But everything around let's say adopting the network coverage, everything around working on the processes is in the cost base. So we are, let's say, this year and in 2019, we will specifically mitigate budget for that, and we will see that in the cost base. But ultimately, between 2016 and 2020, this is consistent with the project (inaudible) because those 2 points, 2016, 2020 because they contain cumulative increase below 1%. And we'll deliver in 2020 headline savings of EUR 260 million. The point is that, we, as the effect, the benefit of reducing the footprint of branches, the benefit of reducing the number of people will be seen progressively. This is an ongoing process.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Azzura Guelfi from Citigroup.</p><p>AZZURRA GUELFI, VP, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions for me. One on the leverage ratio and one on litigation. I'll start with litigation first. It's a good progress, the one that you have made on LIA and IBOR that you have indicated. But can you indicate -- can you show us any further progress that you have on OFAC, which seems to be the biggest and the one that is still with less clarity for the market? The second one is on leverage ratio. The leverage ratio still stand at the end of the peer group in terms of level, and this quarter has been going backwards a little bit. Could you explain to us what has been the main impact, I don't know, liquidity effects? And what could be the impact of this on your business? Is there any constraint on this level of leverage ratio?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: I will let Philippe comment on the leverage ratio but there's no specific (inaudible)</p><p>results fundamentally like I would say probably all bank. Regarding litigation, well, I've commented already on LIA and LIBOR. On the OFAC, we stay with the idea, yes, we should in the coming weeks and months. So we pursue active discussions, but as it was the case 3, 4 months ago, there will be probably a slight time gap between the 3, but we remain optimistic to be able to put that behind us again in the coming weeks or months. And again what I want just to say, we did not change our global provisioning in the first quarter. We tried every time to assess whether we can do it and we did not change the level of provision. On the leverage ratio, Philippe?</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: Yes, so on leverage ratio, with the benefit of the additions we made in the beginning of April, we have leverage ratio of 4.2. I think that we are completely in line with our European deals. And then on top of that, as you know, there is a wide security debate on how you regulate banks in Europe. So focus not so much on leverage ratio. You have an American approach where what you're seeing is precisely organized on focusing the supervision on the leverage ratio and on (inaudible) in Europe. We are more on the side of the risk-based approach to risk-weighted assets and (inaudible). And if you analyze the leverage ratio of our peer group, we are completely in line with this peer group. Please bear in mind that the pressure applied by the regulation, by the Basel framework join this 3%, and we are moving towards something adding to the 3%, else the logistics of charge. So ultimately, the threshold that will be applicable to Societe Generalewill be 3.5%, and we want to maintain the bank, our leverage ratio between 4% and 4.5%.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Jacques-Henri Gaulard from Kepler Cheuvreux.</p><p>JACQUES-HENRI MICHEL GAULARD, HEAD OF BANKS SECTOR RESEARCH, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have 2 questions on your management changes. First, Didier resigned basically on the 14th of March. And I was wondering if vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis, the investment banking business, this had any impact on the level of business that you've seen, I mean, over the following 6 weeks? And then I would like you to effectively give us a little bit more color on the process that led to the appointments of the management team. Obviously, do you choose to make appointments that were exclusively internal. I was wondering if there was a deliberate choice not to hire externally? Or if you had problems hiring externally?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Jacques-Henri, I don't think there had been a specific impact. Of course, such a departure, total departure is always difficult for the staff, the colleagues, but I would not, shall I say, it has had any significant impact. What is clear is that we wanted in the process to bring an answer relatively quickly and not to leave uncertainty for too long, and that's why we had this process. Regarding internal (inaudible), let me say our general policy, and I must say, it seems to me, it's the case for most companies, is at the deputy COO, CEO level, to try to bring people from internally. We pursue, of course, active policy to recruit whether it's a 25, 30, 35, 40. And if I may just state 2 of the appointments made -- announced yesterday. Typically, when I look at Philippe Helm or William Kadouch, both of them were not in the bank 10 years ago. They have very different profile initially. They joined the bank. We built a carrier just to check their capacity to integrate and develop. And we have now 2 managers [we're 50] and I think it's a better policy than trying to, by essence, recruit at such level. I must say, my experience, when you recruit, you have a 50% chance to make a mistake. And because how do you really know how people integrate their real capacity to share in vision, the values, et cetera, the behaviors of a team. So it's, I think, a policy which makes (inaudible) a lot of sense.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Jean-Francois Neuez from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>JEAN-FRANCOIS NEUEZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Jean-Francois from Goldman. I just wanted to ask about, in particularly, coming back to the derivatives and fixed income businesses. In the slide where you show the difference geographically, there is also geographies mentioning about the costly hedging that has affected this quarter. If I cast myself back into last year, in 2017, particularly in Q3, you highlighted the low-volatility environment having triggered also high hedging cost. Now the environment seems to have been different this quarter, much higher volatility. And I just wondered, so I would have expected this environment to be positive for your hedges, which were costly last year. And I'd like to have more granularity on that please? And my second question was on the management changes. I guess, so you've explained your process. The question is, at the Investor Day, which was so not long ago, you had the management team in place who presented. I just wanted to know whether we should expect any change in strategy? Or essentially, what pushed the board to decide to change the management team so soon after the release of the Investor Day?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: I will let Frank to answer the first question. Jean-Francios, what was not expected is Didier's departure. And as I said, you can look at the profiles of the deputy CEOs when we presented. He was the, as I said, the youngest. Okay, so when we think about the succession plan, if there's one thing that the board has to ensure probably beyond the strategy is that you have effectively a succession plan which works. And we had to face -- the board had to face the situation. An unexpected situation, which is, as commented, one of the main objectives of the changes was to ensure continuity and capacity to deliver. And I think that with people that I've just mentioned who are absolutely seasoned bankers (inaudible) and fully committed to the plan, you have this guarantee of continuity. Frank, what can we say?</p><p>FRANK BENZIMRA: I think what we say last year, it was that floor activities were impacted by the low volatility environment. And with the -- after the event of the (inaudible), we have seen the peaks of volatility and with old full activities that we have seen the decrease of the revenue. After, when we look at what happened after this (inaudible) this will change the work. The volatility is back to the usual level. In fact, the volatility has been -- the increase volatility has been, it was just contained in the very small players of the quarter. And again, it's on the short-term products activity, low-volatility environment is acceptable. Given this, we can take this from the consolidated guess or positive guess, we can cross a little bit. But it's mostly on the full activity that we are going to make (inaudible) the volatilities (inaudible).</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Mr. Jon Peace from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>KARL JONATHAN PEACE, MD, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: First question please is on French Retail Banking. With your guidance that you expected to be flattish in revenue terms this year, are you adjusting for the EUR 88 million of negative hedging costs in the third quarter of last year? Or is it going to be flattish on a reported basis ex PEL/CEL? And then my second question is on Russia. Your target's an 11% revenue CAGR and 16% return on normative equity. With the sanctions, do you still expect to be on track towards that this year? Or should we see some volatility?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Jon, so first of all, Philippe, the guidance on the stabilization over the years doesn't include this (inaudible).</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: Yes, Jon. So yes, in fact, we have to adjust our swaps hedging the market book, according to the IFRS rules. And so it has, let's say, a negative impact, if my memory is correct, that's for EUR 88 million in Q3. And taking into account, let's say, all the elements, we are -- in fact, we took in advance, let's say, some costs negative in the (inaudible) and although (inaudible) bringing together, we progressively see stabilization of the revenue base into '18. Again, on Russia?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, Jon. On Russia, in fact, the sanction has limited impact as basically it affects very few of our clients. Our growth is mainly driven by retail, which is unaffected by the sanctions. And so we confirm of objectives of 11% growth on the revenues and over 16% ROE by 2020.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Mme. Lorraine Quoirez from UBS.</p><p>LORRAINE QUOIREZ, DIRECTOR AND EQUITY ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: So the first one will be on the French Retail. So obviously, you're guiding for a flat revenue this year. I was wondering whether for 2019, we should -- we could expect something like plus 2% or above. And then the same thing on the cost. Obviously, you want -- you're guiding for plus 3% this year. I was wondering whether we could expect some cost decline as early as in 2019? So then for the second question, I'd like to come back on the CIB story for that. But I've seen on a video this morning an interview, I think it was Bloomberg TV where you were saying that your structured products performance was in line with peers, and I was a little bit puzzled with the comments you just provided during the call. So can you actually confirm whether you're doing worse or better or same as peer in structured products for the quarter? And if it's worse and if you think it's like MiFID II related, are you seeing sign of the wait-and-see approach or the discovery process actually ending anytime soon?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Lorraine, we will not -- we are not disclosing our figures for 2019 in the French Retail. And to be frank, I don't remember having said that -- made such a specific comment during the interview. And I think we have already commented again on the very specific business model on one hand structured product of (inaudible) spending on the geography and on the structured product, probably the most significant part on the distribution side with retail activities. And so I don't think we have -- we can comment much more than that at this stage before having more analysis. We regularly analyze our, again, relative performance, again, thanks to a company like Coalition. It helps you understand exactly more in detail the differences beyond global figures, so I think I can't comment more at this stage.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Jean-Pierre Lambert from KBW.</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE LAMBERT, SVP AND UNITED KINGDOM ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions. So my first one is capital management and the trajectory to 11.5%. You've been -- indicated in the press as interest in the commerce bank market activities, also potential sale of Bulgaria and Balkan activities and further reduction in risk-weighted assets. How should we see this in terms of time line? And is there any comment you can say how you see these building blocks? The second question is on digitization. It seems you're quite behind some of your peers in terms of automation or digitization of process even with your target of 50% by the end of 2018, and I was wondering if you had some similar assessment. And also regarding the digitization, it seems like you are automating the process of interaction with customers, but what about the legacy systems, are you changing them? Or are you keeping the old cost systems with additional satellites?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Okay. I will let Bernardo answer your -- the second part of your questions on the digitization. On your first part, again, I can't give you much more comment than we expect, as we saw previously in previous years, at the end of the day, with pluses and minuses of positive contribution on the core Tier 1 from our reallocation of capital. And regarding acquisition, there will be very few of them, so we will actually benefit from the allocation I've commented. There will be announcements this year but I can't say more. Bernardo?</p><p>BERNARDO SANCHEZ - INCERA, FORMER DEPUTY CEO, SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 G\u00e9N\u00e9RALE SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 ANONYME: So our current program is -- and we are talking specifically here about the French Retail activities. We talked [about] the ones who were positive when we talked about digitalization of the processes vis-a-vis -- [are] this much more digitalized already. And we will redesign and digitalize about 85% to 90%, most of our processes by the end of 2019, of which 50% are already -- almost completed and will be completed before year-end. So we assume and we think that this is a very advanced level of digitalization. What we have done since 2014, when we started the race to digitalize the bank is that we choose, first of all, to digitalize the front end of our relationship to the customers. And immediately after, we launched this digitalization process. We -- I don't have the feeling of any current competitor on the French Retail that is significantly in front of our way of doing things. The rest of the bank, I can remind you that we already have fully digitalized bank, which is called Boursorama, which is the leader in the market which is growing at an extremely rate -- fast pace and which is our most dynamic growth already today in the French Retail.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Alex Koagne from Natixis.</p><p>ALEX KOAGNE, HEAD OF BANKS SECTOR RESEARCH &amp; ANALYST, NATIXIS S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: Alex Koagne from Natixis, 2 questions from myself as well. The first question is for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. I'm just wondering whether you can slow down the pace of provision for litigation given the pretty confidence that you have for at least 2 of them. I think that you used to book something like EUR 300 million to EUR 400 million per year. So just wondering whether we should expect a similar level for this year. The second question is for Philippe. So my understanding is that you will upgrade your guidance for the July in the Corporate Centre for 2018. Would it be true also for 2020, which means that, obviously, you will increase your target of net proceed as a consequence?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Alex, your first question, as I said, I can't say more than what we expect in terms of financial impact on 2 of the 3 is now in provision. And for the third one, there's more uncertainty at this stage because we are less advanced in the process. But as I've said now, we have not added the provision. So what I would like -- what I might say is we'll wait for the detail for the final settlement to act. Again, we tried to take all the information we have to adjust, but as I've said, at this stage, we are not changing the provision. Philippe?</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: Yes. So Alex, so a few elements on the Corporate Centre. So we have indicated that we have a positive GOI this quarter on the Corporate Centre. And it can be explained by value [sentiment]. You have -- as [pretty secondly], you have the sensitivity effect due to a nonqualifying hedges. So you have the usual effects, and we try to park those effects in the Corporate Centre. They are volatile by nature. On the top of that, we have better-than-expected funding conditions for the group. So it may be and -- linked to market conditions. Also the positive impact of the fact that our rating has been upgraded. So let's say all the elements link both together. We'll see if we can revise our guidance, but it's too soon, too early, let's say, in Q1, for the discussion. We'll come back to you in Q2. And if we have relevant information for 2020, we'll come back to you as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question is from Stefan Michael Stalmann from Autonomous Research.</p><p>STEFAN M. STALMANN, PARTNER, SWISS AND FRENCH BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I have 2 questions, please, revisiting questions that have been asked before, I'm afraid. But just start with the equities business in global markets. Your Head of Equities, Mr. Quessette left in late April. Can we see this as any indication that something went wrong in the business? Or is it completely unrelated to the relatively disappointing revenue in Q1? And coming back to the French Retail business and the cost outlook, you're obviously looking at quite meaningful redundancies. You're closing hundreds of branches, digitalizing processes. Is there any reason why we should not assume that your 2020 cost base will be lower than in 2018?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Stefan, first of all, totally unrelated, and we will announce his successor in the coming days, first question. Your second question, sorry, you want to understand in what circumstances the cost in 2020 will be -- could not be lower than 2018. You mean the level of certainty we have in the piloting of the costs.</p><p>STEFAN M. STALMANN: Yes, I would assume that with all the measures that you're taking and with transformation spending dropping out, the 2020 cost base should be lower than 2018. But it seems that you're not too eager to commit to that.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: We have communicated very precisely on the evolution of the French Retail cost between 2016, 2020. So it gives you a figure for 2020. And we have now given you the figure for 2018, basically, our guidance, to illustrate that effectively we are investing a lot. So I think the 2 figures are there.</p><p>STEFAN M. STALMANN: I think that from my perspective is that the 2020 guidance of your 1% CAGR gives me a higher cost number in 2020 than the now increased cost number for '18. So it looks your guidance implies that cost will continue to grow from '18 rather than come down.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Let us check that more in detail, if I may. Okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Omar Fall from Mediobanca.</p><p>OMAR FALL: Sorry to come back to equities, please, and apologies if I missed this somewhere, but you quote in the press release that prime services was at a record level in the quarter, which implies that the underlying performance in equities was materially worse than the minus 5% you've reported, given you've just had a restatement, which means we can't really confirm that. Now can you tell us what the underlying decrease in just the equities line was, please? Second question, I recall from the investor workshop that you hosted recently that you'd flagged that the rise in some simple products like auto calls and structured products in the last couple of years in the rising market drove some of the loss of market share, specifically, in some parts that you'd seen in the past, but that a return to volatility would suit your hedging and structuring capabilities, more complex products. So I'm just trying to understand why that hasn't been reflected this quarter, sorry to retread the old ground on the call. And then just lastly, on French Retail, when we think about this rebound that you and all your peers are guiding for next year, do you think the scale of that rebound will be the same for you as with those peers given that you've, basically, not been growing the loan book anywhere near their rates, so that you can protect margin as you've highlighted?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Omar, first question, auto calls, yes, we said we have limited growth for auto calls, and there was no change beginning of this quarter in terms of the nature of the structured product to be sold. Now so, before you can also structure the projects, you are precisely looking at different rates conditions also and volatility conditions. Second, the proportion of -- first of all, we report -- like of the peers, we have a line of reporting with the equity and prime services together. When you look back at progress reporting, you will see that the proportion of the prime services revenues as a percentage is relatively low. And hence, we don't have a big difference between the so-called former limited equity parameter with the new one compared with the global figure. On, again, the French Retail...</p><p>BERNARDO SANCHEZ - INCERA: Yes. So on the French Retail, it's not possible for me to make any comments on our competitors. But what I can share with you is that, obviously, you have 2 aspects. The revenue base can spread between NIM and funding conditions. On NIM, what we expect is a decreasing pressure coming from interest rates, with some much expected normalization of the monetary policy...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible).</p><p>BERNARDO SANCHEZ - INCERA: The deposit rate with ECB is removed from (inaudible) lifted to 0 and with a positive (inaudible). We have a positive direct and positive impact on our liquidity buffer. Second, we are, as you know, we are very thankful of the quality of our origination. And so far, is not so much increasing widely, let's say, the book, is the quality of the book and the capacity to cross-sell. And when you acquire a client, you positively equip the clients. And this is precisely our strategy. That's why the old strategy that we want in the French Retail is based largely on the development of our conditions, both the sell and on the corporate sides; and how we intend to deliver our growth by 2020.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Kiri Vijayarajah from HSBC.</p><p>KIRISHANTHAN VIJAYARAJAH, ANALYST, HSBC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Can I come back to cost and specifically, the resolution fund? Are there any, kind of, levers you can pull to mitigate the inflation in those costs, so just those costs -- those levees continue to grow at this kind of pace for the next couple of years? And then on the kind of revenue side, what extent can you pass on these costs on to the end customer? And I'm thinking specifically, in the CIB areas which seem to be sharing, shouldering a lot of the resolution fund cost when you allocate it out divisionally.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Philippe, first of all, the mitigation elements.</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: Okay. So the increase was EUR 80 million this quarter -- or this year, taken in this quarter. And this contribution, I would say that roughly 1/4 is related to a change in the way the Single Resolution Board asks us to compute, let's say, the contribution. So there's a change in calculation. The other part is related to a pretty important increase of the deposit collected in the Banking Union, leading to an increase for all, let's say, players according to the size of the balance sheet. And there is no obvious way for us to mitigate this effect with, let's say, with the monetary policy we have. We all see in the market industry a surge of the [deposit rates].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible).</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: And -- yes. And on the client side, we can't pass that to the client because we have (inaudible) -- some banks are being commented. So most of our competitors (inaudible). So unfortunately, it will end in 2024, but at this stage limited in our capacity to mitigate.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Anke Reingen From RoyalBank of America. (sic) [Royal Bank of Canada].</p><p>ANKE REINGEN, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: From Royal Bank of Canada, it's Anke here. Two follow-up questions. Firstly on French Retail Banking, I actually thought that your loan growth slightly accelerated. And I was wondering if this is something you could see continuing as in, like, step up the volume growth there. And then secondly, I'm very sorry to ask about the equity derivatives again, but from reading your press release this morning, I got the impression that the hedging costs and carrying costs were quite a material headwind to your performance in equities this quarter. But from the call, it sounds more that the underlying trends weren't as supportive. Can you please confirm that the -- I mean, as much as you can, that the hedging carrying costs were not a material headwind to the equities performance in Q2?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Anke, I will leave Laurent Goutard comment on the evolution of the credit volumes. I think we have a dynamic growth. We don't make (inaudible) that, but he will comment. I think we can't say much more, Anke. Like what we said, it's a little of both in Europe, in particular for the demand. And generally speaking on the book, now the book being a reflection of the new production but also the underlying inventory. The fact that as we said, the volatility increased, yes, it came back to very low level, and we adjust our reserve. We adjusted our hedging policies to mitigate the risk and we have a pretty conservative approach. So it's more here on the inventories, too. Perhaps, Laurent briefly, on the production of loans.</p><p>LAURENT GOUTARD, HEAD OF SOCIETE GENERALERETAIL BANKING - FRANCE, SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 G\u00e9N\u00e9RALE SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 ANONYME: Yes, briefly, I would say we cannot -- different comments according to corporate loans and to all loans. For corporate loans, as you can see from the documents, the new production is very dynamic a 10% increase in comparison with Q1 2007. And when you see the outstanding, we are now, at least, 3.5% and even almost 5% when we exclude local authorities. It means that we are possibly closing the gap with the market and the competitors. And if we continue with the trend, I would say we will go back to the market trend at the end of the year. Cost/earning about the -- of loans, as you [can] said, this is a strategy. We focus the production on the top affluent and -- top affluent clients. It means that 80% of the new (inaudible) production is dedicated to (inaudible) people. So if we want to continue this strategy, keeping in mind that now the level of our negotiation is at very, very low levels. So it means when we grow the loan book by 2.5%, it is completely in line with all strategy and, I would say, of targets.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: And that just as one statistic to illustrate the difference of approach, when we look at 2017, our average maturity of the loans is according to our statistics, 2 years below the average of the market.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Flora Benhakoun from Deutsche Bank.</p><p>FLORA A. BENHAKOUN, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: The first question I have is regarding funding cost. I heard your comment on the positive surprise on funding cost in the Corporate Centre. I was wondering whether you could comment maybe whether the widening we had in the LIBOR OIS spread had any kind of impact on your U.S. dollar funding cost. And the second question is going back into French Retail, where I noticed that now you've changed a bit the reporting, maybe linked to the series change that you made. But you don't disclose the NII between individuals and corporates anymore, so whether you could comment on the NIM between these 2 categories, please.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Philippe, funding cost trends.</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: So on funding cost, okay. So on the funding cost, with the Corporate Centre, I was mentioning, among other, let's say, the fact that we are seeing decreased funding cost. The amount is limited now, so this is not of a huge magnitude. Coming to your points, no, there is no direct significant impact of the widening of the U.S. LIBOR, widening of the spread, no impact in our -- in activity neither in terms of the capacity to collect the -- no impact on the activity. This is certainly not all of across the business, and no impact for the group.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: The second point on the net interest margin for the 2 categories in France.</p><p>PHILIPPE HEIM: Yes. We have amended our disclosure. We'll come back to you on this aspect to give more granularity on the split.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Pierre Chedeville from CM-CIC.</p><p>PIERRE CHEDEVILLE, ANALYST, CM-CIC MARKET SOLUTIONS, RESEARCH DIVISION: First of all, I take the opportunity to thank Bernardo for the last past years on his kindness and availability to answer my long questions on Africa and Russia. Thanks, Bernardo. Two quick left questions regarding Lyxor. Today, we have a good net inflows but I wanted to know if you are okay with the profitability of the business today. Or if you consider that the profitability of the business has not reached your target because we don't know exactly what it is for Lyxor, which is the one with private banking. But when we see the bottom line of private banking in Lyxor, it's still very weak. And what is your view regarding Lyxor? And regarding ALD, I'm sorry, I had not the time to go through the slides of ALD so far. But I was expecting a decrease in revenues due to the fact that the price per unit of sales, of car sales, was supposed to decrease strongly quarter-on-quarter. And it seems to me that the effect was not seen this quarter and I was wondering why.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Okay. I will let Didier Hauguel answer your question on residual values and impact on net banking income. We are confident with the Lyxor level of profitability because I think the bottom line itself does not reflect all the benefits for the group. They are also the benefits with some capital market activities related to our activities on the ETS. So yes, and I must say, really, Lyxor is part of a strategic view that in the next 5 to 7 years, the world of asset management will change in Europe as well as it has in the U.S., with more transparency on pricing, the development of ETS. I think we'll have -- a lot things will happen in Europe, and for us Lyxor should benefit from that. Didier, what can we say on the evolution of net banking income and the residual values?</p><p>DIDIER HAUGUEL, GROUP COUNTRY HEAD OF RUSSIA, SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 G\u00e9N\u00e9RALE SOCI\u00e9T\u00e9 ANONYME: I think that the dynamics of the net banking income of ALD is driven by used car sales. And you will remember that basically ALD guided of used car sale per unit for 2018 between a range of EUR 200 to EUR 400 profit. And it ends up in a decreasing trend, and it ends up for Q1 to establish at EUR 417 -- 1 7 per unit. So it's slightly above the yearly guidance that is confirmed for 2018. So basically, there is a full confirmation of the guidance of ALD, which is making the similar calls in the same time.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question from Nick Davey from Redburn.</p><p>NICK DAVEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, REDBURN (EUROPE) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions, please. Sorry, back to the markets business. Main question here on cost, up 3.8% on constant scope and exchange. I take the point about the Single Resolution Fund. But even if I adjust for that, it seems like costs are flat to up. Why is there not more cost flex here, to the declining revenue line? Second question, one of your peers today discloses they had 2 minor events of loss above par in Q1. And I can hear we're all asking a similar question on the drivers of the equity weakness. Could you disclose a similar number about how many events have lost above par in the quarter? That might help.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Nick, we don't disclose I think the -- and I don't think there was any specific element regarding this thing. And on the cost, we are also investing. If you take out the foreign exchange and the increase of the [ForEx] we are just 1.6% for the global -- GBIS business. As I said, there are investments and we are fostering a policy of further cost efficiency. So it's not the end of the story regarding that [rate].</p><p>NICK DAVEY: On the bonus pool, was it adjusted down year-on-year instead of interest?</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Well, can I say -- if you look back at our 2017 figures, you will see that the revenue -- the bonus pool has been adjusted according to our performance. And as I said, Societe Generalehas a very disciplined approach from that perspective. Of course, we look each quarter to see where it would land for the full year.</p><p>OPERATOR: We don't have any more questions for the moment.</p><p>FR\u00e9D\u00e9RIC OUD\u00e9A: Okay. Well, I think that's clearly for -- we could even say, for the day because I think it was -- and I would like to thank you for your participation and your patience. Let's finish this call. Thank you very much, and have a good afternoon. Thank you. Bye-bye.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Welcome to the Interim Report January-March 2019 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, on Friday, the 17th of May, 2019.</p><p>I'd now like to hand the conference over to your presenter today, Thomas Heath. Please go ahead.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER &amp; HEAD OF IR, CLX COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL): Thank you very much. Welcome everyone to this Q1 2019 Conference Call with Sinch. My name is Thomas Heath, I'm Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Investor relations. With me in the room today, I have our CEO, Oscar Werner; and our CFO, Roshan Saldanha.</p><p>So welcome everyone and with that, I'll hand the word over to Oscar.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER, CEO, CLX COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL): All right. This is Oscar Werner, and welcome to this Quarter's Q1 presentation. So without further ado, let's start.</p><p>So first, Sinch, just to position what we do, many of you have heard this before, but I just have one slide of this so we position ourselves. So we deliver customer engagement for enterprises to consumers via mobile technology, and we have a cloud communication platform to do this via messaging, via voice and via video.</p><p>And what fascinates me about this market is that it has a 100% consumer penetration, and I've yet to find one single adult person that has not used this type of services. So I think we all have received an appointment from our dentist or a reminder from an airline, or getting the ticket from somewhere, or we have called Uber, or we have called our doctor via a video message. So that fascinates me that it has so high degree of penetration. And I think that's the same in any country that I go to across the globe.</p><p>This means that this is a growing, and it's a global and it's a multibillion-dollar market. So we are truly in a market where you can sell to in any country that our customers, and a very large amount of enterprises can be customers, and it's a growing, large market.</p><p>One thing that sticks out about Sinch, but not the only thing, but it's -- we serve the 8 out of the 10 of the largest U.S. tech companies. Around about 5 of those are live with significant traffic, and we are working on the others. And -- but we have -- given that we have a highly scalable platform, we have managed to win and keep some of the -- or the largest customers on the planet here, and that's probably where we stand out the most.</p><p>We also deliver software for mobile operators based on the same underlying platforms. We have a very deep technical competence all the way up from the enterprise down to the operator network.</p><p>Right, next slide, please. Growth markets. Just to make this point again, we have showed this slide before but messaging, which is our core market, as you've seen, we have changed the report a little bit, we talk about messaging, we talk about voice and video, and we talk about the operator segments. And on this slide, to shorten it a little bit, we only talk about messaging and CPaaS.</p><p>And -- but the messaging market is a large market, you can pick a number of different reports. We used to think that Mobilesquared has a good estimate of this market. They estimate this market to be $17 billion round about, but you can find estimates from $15 billion to $50 billion. And the reason for the size is, firstly, text messaging has been extremely effective, reaches everybody in the world, in a very cost effective manner and has a very high open rate. And now the growth is very much driven by the new messaging formats, making it possible to some more advanced forms of messaging to your consumers.</p><p>On the CPaaS side, this can be interpreted as the software layer on top of the termination fees on top of the message you send. That part of the market is growing very fast. You can -- market estimates range between 35% and round about 60% CAGR. So that part of the market is growing very fast. And this is basically all the software value add that you can add on top of just sending a message for an enterprise. So all in all, global market, large market and a growth market in many segments, and certain segments grow faster than others.</p><p>All right. Next slide, please. So then, looking at the quarter results. In Q1 2019, so we had a strong gross profit growth of 45%, getting up to SEK 289.5 million. And as you know, we focus primarily on gross profit that's what we think is our value add. We had adjusted EBITDA rising to SEK 112 million, which is round about a 73% growth since last -- on a yearly basis. And we have an adjusted EBIT, if we exclude acquisition-related amortization of SEK 102 million and profit after tax of SEK 57.8 million. We have rising gross profit and EBITDA in all business units, and we have organic growth, both from -- both organic and from acquired businesses.</p><p>And we also say that we are continuing our investments to capture new market growth opportunities in the new markets. We see a technology shift in the market and that we see the market going from -- can you imagine it being 160 characters text messages to almost being able to send an app-like experience to your inbox.</p><p>That obviously drives the market growth opportunity. You can imagine being at an airport, instead of just getting a reminder for your flight is delayed, you get a message, which behaves like an app, stating your flight is delayed. These are your 3 options for rebooking, press this button and you can rebook. And by the way, here's the voucher, so you can get a free meal. That's a better experience for you, and it's a cost saver for the airline.</p><p>That obviously becomes much better service, but it also takes a bit more software and a different go-to-market model in order to approach the customers with that type of service. So therefore, we are investing in positioning ourselves for the growth opportunities that we see are coming.</p><p>Good. Next slide. So if you then look at our 3 segments that you see we have organized the report around, we have the messaging segments, we have the voice and video segments and we have the operator segment.</p><p>If we start with messaging, we see rising message volumes, and this is driven by a couple of different factors, partly it is U.S. big tech companies is fueling a strong growth in this area. We managed to be a partner to the biggest companies in the world, and therefore, we do see strong growth driven by those companies.</p><p>We also see a very high demand for our personalized video services. So that is basically sending video messages directly to inbox, personalized to your own preference. This is driven by the acquisition we did with Vehicle, and we see strong growth for that. We also see positive currency effects in this quarter, which is giving us a tailwind here, which is affecting growth in a positive way. And again, we are investing in the next generation messaging and next generation technologies.</p><p>All right, next slide. On the volume side, we do see a rising number of transactions in -- on the [term breaks], we're going both with existing customers, with new customers and new use cases. And we are seeing a 13% organic growth in number of transactions in local currencies, and a 15% in an organic growth in both the currencies and gross profit. So we're seeing those following each other and in a good way, and we're happy with that growth.</p><p>Next slide. Gross profit per transaction is something that is very important for us, and so looking at all times, looking at how much value add do we make per transaction. So here we are -- here we're trading, both the gross profit per transaction and the OpEx per transaction. And what you can see here on this slide is that the gross profit per transaction depends on the mix of the terminating markets, where are we terminating.</p><p>It also depends on how much value add are we adding per transaction. So in the personalized video case, we're adding a lot more value add and a lot more software on top. And that's something that -- so that gives us a higher gross margin per -- gross profit per transaction. And that's something we're consistently working on, and across our business units to add more value in software on top of the message transmission.</p><p>And we're also seeing here a currency tailwind, which is increasing gross profit per transaction. And you can, in this graph, also see that we're doing investments for the future on the OpEx side, but that's following the gross profit increase relatively nicely in this slide.</p><p>Okay, next slide. We have the messaging EBITDA per gross profit, it's a very key metric for us. We see that for every gross profit dollar or crown that we generate, we generate a EBITDA of roughly 45% and that's been stable. So we're following this graph, and we want to be a highly profitable company and generate a lot of cash flow. That's core to our strategy. And therefore, we manage this graph carefully. And in this quarter, as you've seen the gross profit rise and we also see investments rise, in order to position ourselves for the future, and therefore, we have managed to keep this graph stable.</p><p>All right, next slide. As we have reported in previous quarters, we have strong momentum on the voice and video side, and that has continued during this quarter. So we had a really good Q4 and the Q1 is on the gross profit and revenue side, even better. And growth fueled by the number masking service that we do for ride hailing and also the verification services that we do. Here we're working with key operators of our service in more markets and in the markets where we see demand.</p><p>As you can imagine, in this type of hyper-growth situation, it is a lot of work to scale the systems, have the systems in order, keep up the good quality for customers, et cetera. So it's a lot of hard work in this area that we're doing in order to keep this type of growth. But we're very, very, happy to see that the turn to profit has continued on the voice and video side that we saw in Q4 and that's continuing out in Q1. Final (inaudible) and then focusing on stabilizing and setting this business up for -- on a higher level.</p><p>All right, next slide. Also very happy to see the improved conversion to orders in the Operator business. So we had a couple of quarters with -- weaker quarters in operators. And now we're seeing that we have a stronger pipeline and also a stronger conversion of pipeline or sales to orders in the operator business. So super happy to see that, and you can see in the results in Q1.</p><p>This, as you know, it's a business that does fluctuate depending on where those projects -- when those projects actually come in and when do we -- when can we report them as profits. But it is a strong trend in the pipe. We also see the partnership with Ericsson. We see that generating a lot of sales to us, which is very positive.</p><p>As you note, during the quarter, we also announced that we will target operators with an RCS as a service offering. That is basically enabling operators to offer RCS services to enterprises, and we're doing that from the Operator business. And then, as in the enterprise business, we are -- we're then enabling the enterprises. There is no impact of that initiative in this quarter's results on the revenue side and that's a future investment. But we see a strong pipe and a strong demand for operators on that side as well.</p><p>So all in all, we have the [U. S. big tech] driving growth, we have personalized video driving growth, we have voice and video driving growth, and we have operator driving growth, and we also have a currency tailwind in this quarter. And if you take that altogether, we have a very strong quarter, and we're super happy with that. And that's how it becomes when all the major areas we focus on go in the right direction, you have that type of strong quarter. So we have 2 of those now, which we're very proud over, and we're very happy to see those results.</p><p>That said, I'm going to leave over to Roshan, to go a little bit deeper into the financials. So Roshan, please.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA, CFO, CLX COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL): Thank you, Oscar. Good morning and hello to all of you on the call. It's a pleasure to present the Sinch's Financial Results for the First Quarter 2019, very strong set of results that we can talk about today.</p><p>On slide 12, called continued high gross profit growth, you'll find the bridge explaining our gross profit development. A significant part of our revenues are passed on as cost of goods to mobile operators. We pay them to send our messages and place -- our customers' messages and place calls. But the rates they charge vary greatly between markets. Since past 2 revenues did not contribute to our profits, we focus almost exclusively on gross profit, when we assess and steer our business.</p><p>Changes in our gross margin often reflect changes in geographical mix rather than underlying performance or competitiveness. Organic growth and currency affect are hence calculated against an adjusted comparison period in this graph, where we are adding the acquired businesses, Unwire and Vehicle from the first quarter 2018 to our reported Q1 2018 gross profit.</p><p>Growth in the acquired businesses, Unwire and Vehicle are included in the messaging segment. Consolidated gross profit rose by 45% during the quarter to SEK 289.5 million. Counting from the adjusted base in Q1 2018, which was SEK 225 million, gross profit grew by 28%. Positive exchange rate movements explain 7% of this increase. Organic growth in gross profit in local currency and comparable units was 21%. This change is explained by changes in traffic mix and growth in products with higher gross margin, as Oscar explained, such as personalized video messaging.</p><p>Moving on. Slide 13, where we summarize the effects of IFRS 16, the New Accounting Standard for leases, which we have implemented from the 1st of January. On our financial results, we have applied a simplified retrospective -- modified retrospective approach to the transition, meaning that the comparative year has not been restated.</p><p>With the interaction of IFRS 16, lease costs of SEK 6.6 million are now excluded from EBITDA in Q1 2019. These lease costs show up further down in our income statement as amortization. The groups' right of use assets are recognized at cost and are reported, both on the current liabilities and current assets parts of the statement. Here you see, I mean, also net debt increases by SEK 83.8 million due to these reclassification of IFRS 16.</p><p>Moving on to the next slide, Slide 14 for the condensed income statement. Consolidated net sales grew by 28% in the quarter to SEK 1.1 billion. The growth rate in the quarter was positively affected by the depreciation of Swedish kroner primarily against euro, pound and dollar. Positive currency effect on consolidated net sales was 6%.</p><p>Besides the currency effects on revenue and COGS, we also have currency effects in our OpEx as a significant portion of our OpEx is related to employees and contractors outside Sweden. Finally, we also have realized and unrealized currency effects on our current assets and current liabilities that affect our income statement.</p><p>When looking at the individual segments, we saw particularly strong performance in Operator segment, we are now seeing successful conversion of orders to revenue. But bear in mind that revenues and earnings in the Operator segment can vary considerably between quarters.</p><p>Reported EBIT was SEK 69 million in the quarter versus SEK 20 million last year. We have a new definition of adjusted EBIT from this quarter and going forward. Previously, adjusted EBIT excluded only items affecting comparability, primarily related to one-off items from M&amp;A transactions. From this quarter, adjusted EBIT excludes both items affecting comparability as defined previously and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets since these do not affect cash flow.</p><p>Adjusted EBIT amounted to SEK 102 million compared to SEK 59 million previous year. Acquisition-related amortization, which does not affect cash flow reduced EBIT by SEK 33 million. The amortization relates mainly to plan the amortization of acquired brand customer and operator relationships as well as software.</p><p>Please turn to Slide 15 for the cash flow statement. Cash flow from operating activities was SEK 38 million. Cash flow in relation to operating profit fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter because many of our customers maximize their liquidity by postponing payments to suppliers. Actual customer losses remain low, and cash flow in relation to operating profit is slightly improving over time.</p><p>Net debt amounted to SEK 484 million, down from SEK 547 million a year ago. The implementation of IFRS 16 on 1st of January, 2019, increased the company's net debt by SEK 83 million. Net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.2, down from 1.9 a year ago with the previous accounting principles before IFRS 16, the ratio would have been 1.0.</p><p>Finally, on the financial targets, just summarizing our financial targets. The financial targets of the company are unchanged from what we have previously stated, where we aim to grow adjusted EBITDA per share by 20% per year and maintain net debt below 2.5x adjusted EBITDA over time. Measured on a rolling 12-month basis, we grew adjusted EBITDA per share by 45% at the end of first quarter 2019. Net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.2, down from 1.9 a year ago, with the earlier accounting principles, as I said before, the ratio would have been 1.0.</p><p>With that, I would like to hand back over to Oscar to summarize today's presentation.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: All right. Thank you, Roshan. So to summarize, I mean, we're obviously seeing a strong quarter. We're obviously seeing the majority of our businesses doing well. And when those are impacting well at the same quarter and in the same direction, all of them, we have very strong quarter. The big ticket items are we have strong pipeline and performance for the U.S.-based tech companies, considerable interest and revenue growth in personalized video, strong pipeline and growth in voice and video and strong pipeline and growth on the Operator business in this quarter.</p><p>And we also see -- on the future side, we also see, we're doing investments on the rich media, the conversational messaging. So we're seeing a shift in the market, we're seeing market growth opportunities, which are large. And therefore, we think it's very, very important to position ourselves for growth. So therefore, we take, as you can see in our numbers, we take relatively large investments in those areas. But as long as we can grow the gross profit in the way we do today, I mean that has -- we continue to do good profits of course.</p><p>We're generally very positive to the market growth, and we're very positive to the market outlook. And we -- so positive market growth, positive market outlook. And the key thing for us now is to really positon ourselves into the new form upstart coming because we think that will drive this market growth and our own growth in many years going forward.</p><p>With that said, I will leave it over to questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Staffan Aberg from Carnegie.</p><p>STAFFAN ABERG, FINANCIAL ANALYST, CARNEGIE INVESTMENT BANK AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: So the organic growth within the messaging division was 14% in Q1. And you state now that the key driver for this growth was the U.S. tech companies. So now excluding this group of clients, what would you roughly estimate the organic growth to be in Q1 within the messaging division? Is it 10%, flat, or minus 10%?</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: Thomas here. Thanks for the questions, Staffan. It's correct that the U.S. big tech is an important growth driver for our group. And it's also true that the U.S. market as a whole is an important growth driver. We see significantly higher growth rates in the U.S. than we do in other parts of the world. It's an advanced market and where we perform very well.</p><p>We also built, purposefully built up a strong position as one of very few amount of global competitors who can take on really large global deals, and so these very large customers. As I'm afraid, I can't go into much more details than that other than to say that's an important source of growth. Both today, and we expect also the future, there's a lot of value we can bring to these companies. And that journey is only started.</p><p>STAFFAN ABERG: Okay, another question then. We've been talking back and forth about the RCS potential. And we've been talking about that for a while now, but it seems like it's always pushed forward a little bit. But now surely, after recent launches, you must have a better view of when the meaningful volumes might start to come? Or do you see still see a risk of further postponements?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: First, it depends on how you see risk. And I believe, and then I think a lot of us believe after I've been in this -- in the tech space for a long time, the rate or the time that it takes for a change to impact is always longer than you think. But the impact is always -- almost always larger than you think. So I think all of these new messaging formats are, it will take time and the primary driver or the 2 drivers for it to take time.</p><p>Part of is it for operators to roll it out, and we can see that any -- in any quarter, in any year, it takes time. They roll it out, and then they roll it out fast, and then there is a problem with this phone, and they need to bring their operability, et cetera. So it will take time for the operators, and they are -- and it typically take a little bit of time for -- to roll out things.</p><p>And the other things, the other reason it will take time is for enterprises. So for enterprises to really benefit from this type of new messaging formats, it -- they will need to change their processes, they will need to go into the customer journey. And they will need to, oh, suddenly I can re-book my flight via message, how do I do that? How do I integrate that into my own system? So it will take time, and I want to be cautious again. I think it will take time before we see significant portions of revenues on the rich messaging formats.</p><p>On the other hand, we need to be sure to communicate to you now, as for taking the investments now in order to position ourselves. So I believe it will take time, but we're doing investments now, and therefore, we're talking about it. Ideally, I could have waited to talk about it until the revenue came. But then you would wonder why I do the investments. So that's the balance.</p><p>STAFFAN ABERG: That's very clear. And a good bridge to my next and final question. Because you've been talking a lot about the need to reinvest the gains back into your operations, in order to leverage opportunities in the markets, such as RCS. But what exactly are you targeting in your investment plan now? For example, do you have any top 3 areas where you currently want to focus your resources?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: All right. I mean, we are -- as you can see in our report, I mean, we have divided the business in messaging, voice and video and operator. The -- by far biggest business for us is messaging. So therefore, our #1 area is various forms of rich messaging formats. RCS is one, but we sometimes focus a little bit too much on that. We think that the OTT channel, such as WhatsApp or Facebook or WeChat or -- they have a same -- from an enterprise perspective, they have a similar characteristic. We as a business, we don't really care, which channel it goes to. They may have different characteristics, but it's like, we see all of those messages, we see them billing one platform to handle all of those types of rich messages, that is the #1.</p><p>Another area, which we obviously see, is the a personalized video, which is by the way, a form of a rich message or a next-generation message. So when you talked about next-generation message, that's where we see the growth today. That's a portion of rich messaging that's growing very fast. Obviously, we will invest heavily there. Then you see voice and video, we are seeing growth there, so we're investing there.</p><p>And as you saw, we made a statement in this quarter that we will target operators within RCS as a service, offering, basically enabling operators to offer RCS. Because we see big demand, so that's another investment area. I think that's the main ones, but if you would pick out one, it's the rich messaging area including the personalized video business.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Djurberg from Handelsbanken.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG, RESEARCH ANALYST, HANDELSBANKEN CAPITAL MARKETS AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations on a strong report. My first question would be on, we could talk about the RCS again. I guess, you need to connect also to operators in terms of -- to get their APIs with RCS that you have with SMS, I think you have 250 direct connections, et cetera.</p><p>Do you see this uptick to be in progress with your own plans? Or do you see a risk to miss the potential future RCS raise because of fewer connections, et cetera? That was my first question.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Do we see in line with plans? And as I said before, it's always very hard to make exact plans in the tech industry where and when things will actually hit. I am very confident on the trend as a whole that this will happen, it will drive a lot of added value to enterprises. So I'm very confident on the direction, on where we're going. The exact timing is so hard, it's so hard to judge. And there, we need to continue invest, and be very diligent on it.</p><p>And on the ability to make money, I assume that's what you are asking, will it become fewer operator connections? And therefore, will it become harder to, as a middleman, make money? I assume, that's what you're saying. And I would think that -- I think -- or 2 things that are happening.</p><p>One, there are multiple technologies rolled out so we have RCS, where there are a set of connections, fewer than what we have in the SMS space. And then you have OTTs, where they are a set of other connections, well again, fewer to WhatsApp, you only need one connection to do the globally. On the other hand, there are multiple WhatsApps and there are multiple different formats. So there are fewer connections which would make it harder to make money as middleman. On the other hand, the connections are more different, so the differences in-between them are relatively large.</p><p>But then you have, on top of this, you have a software layer in order to create this type of more advanced message formats, you need a more advanced software layer, which is countering that, which makes it easier to make money because you provide more value.</p><p>So all in all, we believe that it's a good market going forward. And we believe that the ability to make -- and to make money going forward is strong. And that's why we're making those investments. And your last part (technical difficulty). Is there risk? There is always risk, of course, (technical difficulty) but we believe, we're doing the right investments in order to capture this market.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: May I just ask, on the software layer, you talked about -- is that fairly generic? Or is it highly a factor adjusted, what do you do to get good leverage out of them? Investments you do from a leverage point of view?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: We think -- it's a good question. And our strategy is to do -- to be a SaaS platform, and then our strategy is to do it cross industry. I wouldn't call it generic, but cross industry, in order to build for scale. I mean we're a scaled business, so we want to be a cross industry and have a SaaS platform for it. And we want to have partners, whether it's resellers or application sellers that do the industry-specific or customer-specific adaptations. So that's our strategy, and that's what we're trying to -- and that's what we are pursuing. And yes, that's our strategy.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: May I ask you also on growth potential. We see the PSD2 directive has I guess, started here in Europe. I think one of your U.S. competitor highlighted it as a potential growth trigger. Has -- I guess, you also have quite good strength in the finance sector. Can you comment on this, is it to direct give us a potential volume trigger for in Europe?</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: So I think you referred to the regulation that asks the banks to send notifications above certain thresholds for transactions. I think you're correct in that this is a potential market driver in that sector. And you're also correct that we have large exposure to financial sector.</p><p>That said, there are - when you come into a particular use case of some sort, there are multiple technology options. And that varies also geographically, which options are viable and workable for different banks in this instance. I think, yes, this is a potential. We haven't quantified it, we haven't seen it yet, but there is some logic to what you're saying.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: Okay. And then a last question here, if I may, to Roshan. It would be on, I might have missed this on the prepared remarks, but on the working capital build, you expand this cash management among customers, mainly I guess. But -- and the specific happenings in Q1, should we expect this to normalize here in terms of DSO coming quarter or are we at higher levels of the cost cash management be? They will be more aggressive going forward as well?</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: Yes. I think, as a general comment, we see enterprises being more tough with sort of how they're managing their own cash, and then we can also see that on the operator side, where we have a large portion of our COGS.</p><p>But at the same time, I mean, working capital is an item that does tend to swing from positive to negative on a regular basis. And if you look back at our historical results, I think it has been positive development 4 quarters in a row. So this was a swing in the other direction, and I don't think we are ready yet to give you good guidance on sort of how that will develop from quarter-to-quarter. But that will definitely be an ambition to get there.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: And given that we are in mid-May now, would you have seen a normalization since late last March?</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: I think, I mean, again, it's very difficult to stand here and to say exactly how the working capital would look like when we come out with our Q2 results. So I think I can stay with the fact that it tends to swing quarter-to-quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your next question come from the line of Fredrik Lithell from Danske Bank.</p><p>FREDRIK LITHELL, SENIOR ANALYST, DANSKE BANK MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Congrats for a good report. My first sort of housekeeping question to Roshan is the IFRS 16 SEK 6.6 million in the quarter, is that mostly derived in the enterprise division? That's sort of a small question.</p><p>For Oscar, the larger question. You stated in the beginning of your prepared remarks that 5 of 8 of 10 largest tech companies, you have significant traffic at 5 of the 8, you have relationship with today. Could you elaborate a little bit on the 5 that you have high traffic today? Do you work with them on sort of new projects? Can you see additional potential deals coming through the next coming, maybe 1, 2, 3 years? Is that something you're running for? And then also, what will it take for the 5 to go to 8? Where are you on that sort of timeline? And can you elaborate a little bit on that?</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: I can start with the simpler one. Yes, a large portion of that is of course affecting our enterprise business. If you want more details on that, we can take that off-line as well.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: And on my question. Yes, we of course, try always to work with our customers to win more projects and win more traffic within any customers we have. We have a specific focus on these big ones, of course. So we have specific focus to make us more strategic and to understand more what of them does order in them, because there are. I mean these companies are very, very large and you find new departments, not every day but there are, they're very, very large and they have a traffic and opportunities in many, many different places and that's a key strategic focus area of us. So yes, we're (technical difficulty). And yes, there is potential. Is it certain we will win it? No. But that's obviously, what we're working on.</p><p>Of the ones that are not there, so that's in a mix of being -- well you got to understand the work of these customers. Even if you sign them, there is no commitment ever to, all right, I will give you this much traffic or this is exactly how I'll run it, and then tomorrow they may do something different. So you don't know when the traffic and how much traffic will come. It is only based on your performance.</p><p>So if you perform well quarter-by-quarter, day-by-day, then you tend to build a good relationships to them, and you build up traffic volumes. So the ones that we haven't gotten significant traffic may -- with are either in the stage of, do we want to sign them? Or it's in a stage of, having been signed but for various reasons traffic hasn't grown to a significant level yet.</p><p>FREDRIK LITHELL: Okay. Yes, I understand, but elaborating on that, the 3 that remains this up to 8 of them. Is it so that you have signed those 3 completely with agreements and you have also done the necessary implementations of technologies. So it's -- the platforms are in place and everything and they are -- they know they can use you and sometimes they maybe try off and -- but it's not really volume. Is that how I should read it?</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: I think what we've said previously is that we have these 5 and maybe 6 would set meaningful volumes. The remaining ones were in some form of dialogue or commercial relationship where we are working of course, with the ambition to, over time, increase volumes. It's a little bit hard to be more specific than that, we're afraid.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have no further questions.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Okay, to -- as a summary then, I mean, we're very happy to report this type of strong results. It's a quarter where we have a strong tailwind from all of the different areas. We have U.S. big tech, we have personalized video, we have voice and video, and we have the Operator business, and we have the currency tailwind. So all of that all taken together, gives a very strong quarter result.</p><p>We are proud over that, and we're very happy to be able to report that. And obviously, you know our financial targets. And we continue to work on a long-term basis to reach the financial targets of 20% adjusted EBITDA per share growth.</p><p>So that's what we're currently doing or working hard to hit on the long run. And going forward, as we have said, this business is good, it's good today, there's a lot of traffic and revenue and opportunity to make money today. As you can see in our figures, it's also a combination of the growth market tomorrow. The big thing there now is to position ourselves to take the growth markets. It requires significant investments, which we're doing. But it's very hard to know exactly when they will hit.</p><p>But we're very confident on the market, on the investment we're making in the -- it's the right bets exactly timing wise. It's hard to time when it will come. That said, thanks a lot for this call. Thank you very much.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating.

NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG, CO-FOUNDER, MD, CEO &amp; MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, DELIVERY HERO SE: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 trading update. Yes, as you have seen this morning, we had a pretty good first quarter. Order and revenue growth reached its highest levels since our IPO. We managed to beat consensus again for the eighth consecutive quarter and have also increased our full year revenue guidance.</p><p>The additional investments further strengthen our leadership positions and drove growth in key regions. With significant cash in the balance sheet, we're in a good position to take advantage of opportunities that arise.</p><p>So before stepping into numbers, we would like to recap our vision and where we are today. We continue to be very early stage of online food delivery, we are seeing rapid changes in consumer behavior, with for us, higher order frequency across the board. As we further scale and drive leadership, we remain focused on achieving our vision to always deliver an amazing experience. We're excited to bring more food and more services to 1.2 billion people that live in our current markets.</p><p>So now to our Q1 highlights. We had orders up 55% year-on-year to 125 million, gross merchandise value, up 57% on a constant-currency basis to EUR 1.5 billion, and revenues up 93% on constant currency basis to EUR 267 million. This is the fastest we have grown since becoming a listed company.</p><p>Moving to next slide. Here you can see an acceleration in orders since Q3 when we started to increase our investments. This quarter is even more dramatic. We added 16 million orders in 1 quarter. It was 15 million if we exclude Zomato's UAE business that we acquired. This is compared to the previous year when we added 6 million orders. This highlights a very early stage of our market expansion that we're seeing and the significant opportunity we are capturing with our additional investments.</p><p>And moving to next slide. So we continued to deliver on our key IPO promises, which you should hold us accountable for. Growth, as number one priority, invest for leadership and build tech and product leadership. On the first one, our number one priority being growth, we committed to about 40% growth in the short to midterm. We are far exceeding this with 93% revenue growth this quarter. Invest in leadership. We are now leading in 33 out of our 41 countries, 80% of our GMV. We process more than 40 million orders per month in more than 4,000 cities, the same applies to our leadership position in own delivery with over 10 million orders per month in about 250 cities. We are delivering multiple times as many orders as any of our competitors combined in our leadership markets.</p><p>And last, innovation is part of our DNA and we will continue to invest in tech and product leadership to build a third generation on-demand platform. In the first quarter of '19 alone, we migrated 4 additional country operations to our global platforms with a long-term target of 8 regional platforms supported by 1 global platform. We believe this is a winning tech setup for our global business with local differences. We further invested in personalization as well as continued to roll out additional verticals.</p><p>Now to Q1 business update. We have successfully increased our investment across the group with fantastic results. As mentioned earlier, we added a record of 16 million orders in this quarter investing across all our segments and countries. We have been able to capitalize on this market expansion and greater customer demand. In MENA, we have seen rapid adoption of our own delivery services and been investing heavily in bringing new customers to our platform. We added the most popular and newest restaurants and brands. We have increased our multivertical capabilities such that you can have convenience items like groceries, flowers, beauty products and much more through our Talabat or Carriage brand. And then within 6 months, we are also going to have it in Hungerstation. All of the above is driving massive adoption of our services, high customer loyalty and driving increased order frequency. This also being the case for Asia. Order growth has dramatically increased from 49% in Q4 to 73% in Q1. Here the same dynamics are occurring. Early stage in expanding markets, our delivery services are connecting the most popular restaurants and brands and affordabilities allowing access to a larger group of customers. The same also holds true for Europe and Americas.</p><p>If we look at additional investments in Q1, we have been able to spend 2/3 on acquiring new customers to our platforms. This is a significant increase in new customers and we will continue to benefit from this for many years to come. Our order frequency has also increased through improved product and technology. This has meant that we are investing at even higher returns than what we originally expected.</p><p>We have also improved our restaurant coverage. We now have more than 290,000 active restaurants on our platform. This is an extremely diverse restaurant partner network. Less than 4% of our total orders come from any single restaurant chain. If you look at some of our food delivery peers, many have 20% or more coming from single chain, and this changes the outlook on unit economics drastically. For us, that's not being the case.</p><p>In Q1, we doubled our sales team global -- globally compared to previous year. This allow us to expand even faster to new areas and cities and assure we have a merged or the most unique and demanded inventory in any given location. Further innovation with our product and technology has also been a focus in Q1. This includes our second-generation kitchens and multivertical capabilities it also includes new product features such as the relaunch of subscription service in MENA with Carriage Black.</p><p>On the M&amp;A side, in Q1 we closed Zomato's UAE food delivery business and completed also sale of our German operations to Takeaway.com. First, these transactions had allowed us to strengthen our position globally and in particular in the MENA segment.</p><p>Now to next slide, Slide 8. We have updated our order cohorts 2018. You can see that our customers continue to return to our platform and are ordering more frequently. Once our customers start using the platform they require little to no marketing efforts. It means our investments span in new customers is one-off in nature. This creates a highly predictable reoccurring revenue stream that actually increases in frequency over time. And not only do we see our cohorts getting better over time but we also see that the new cohorts are better than the old cohorts. This is a very predictable behavior and it allows us to invest across the business with confidence in future returns. So with that, I'll like to hand over to Emmanuel for our financial deep dive of the quarter.</p><p>EMMANUEL THOMASSIN, CFO &amp; MEMBER OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD, DELIVERY HERO SE: Thank you, Niklas. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our trading update for Q1 2019. As you can see here, delivery orders continuing as a strong growth path. In the first quarter 2019, we clearly exceed our expectations. We accelerated the group order growth with 55% year-on-year as well as the group revenue to record growth of 93% year-on-year and this on constant currency.</p><p>So we are very pleased with the start to our additional investments, and the increase on our growth for this quarter. But now, let's start with the group financials, please. So as a reminder, first, Germany is considered as the discontinued operations since 2018, and hence, it is not reflected in our statement anymore. In -- on terms of orders, we increased by 55% year-on-year in Q1 2019 to 125 million orders. The strong top line growth is linked, but not limited to the further investment we deployed over the last 3 quarters.</p><p>Our GMV amount EUR 1.5 billion in Q1 '19 and this is representing a growth of 57% year-on-year on constant currency basis. The revenues are growing at the record pace with year-on-year growth of 93% on constant currency to EUR 267 million. The revenue growth is driven by particularly our strong growth rate in MENA in Asia segment. We give you more detail in a sec. On delivery orders are now 25% of total orders driven by great demand for our delivery services and so the take rate is at 17.7%, driven by this increase of own delivery services. Excluding this own delivery, our take rate levels are still very low at the 11.8%, and this is an absolute increase of 0.7% from Q1 '18. So as you can see there is still a significant potential to grow from here.</p><p>And now let's look at the performance on the 4 operating segments. And I'd like to start with here, with MENA. So the strong order growth in MENA is continuing. MENA is generating 65 million orders in Q1 '19. This is a growth of 57% year-on-year. The GMV growing faster by 70% year-on-year for the first quarter to EUR 747 (sic) [745] million. And the revenues are [skinning] a record growth rate of 147%, year-on-year, and this in constant currency and now amount for EUR 144 million. This acceleration that we see in revenues and revenue growth have been driven by the demand for own delivery services. They are -- own delivery orders that we deliver ourselves are now 26% of the total orders in MENA and so as a result the take rate increased to 19.3%. In MENA, as Niklas said, we continue to roll out additional verticals along with increase in the efficiency of our delivery network and so reducing the cost per order. Overall, and despite the significant investments we are making in this segment, we continue to expect the full year '19 adjusted EBITDA to be positive at EUR 70 million. The acquisition of Zomato, online food delivery business in UAE, have been completed for the first time from March 1, '19 onward. And we decide that no like-to-like adjustments would be made given this impact on the group revenue is very limited to 1.5%. So now, I'd like to continue with the next segment, in Europe.</p><p>Again, here, Germany is considered as discontinued operations and therefore, they are not -- they are excluded from this year's as we officially closed the year, the operations on the 1st of April, '19. Europe is generating 19 million orders in Q1, this is a year-on-year growth of 39% and the GMV grew by 35% on constant currency to EUR 232 million. the Europe revenues grew by 37% on constant currency to EUR 37 million. Looking at the own delivery, the own delivery orders are now 10% of the total orders and the take rate increased to 15.9% at the end of the quarter. So likely for Europe, we remain on track to breakeven during H2 2019.</p><p>Now let's move to the next one in Asia. Asia have been a focus area for investments for us in Q1 '19, we expand in many new countries, cities and also our neighborhood across the Asia segment. As a result, the segment is now generating 30 million orders in Q1, which is a significant acceleration of 73% year-on-year order growth. Asia, GMV increased by 54% on constant currency to EUR 416 million, and the GMV grew slightly slower than the orders due to our affordability campaigns and decrease of our minimum order value or MOV. The revenues reached EUR 67 million for Q1 growing at 61% compared to Q1 '18, on constant currency basis. And this, despite the affordability that I mentioned before and also lower prices for customers. So the stronger revenue growth is also due to the increase of our own delivery orders, which now stands at 29%, 29% of the total orders generated.</p><p>The take rate for Asia increased to 16%, and this, despite the investments in affordability that I mentioned just before. However, due to the successful adoption of the affordability campaigns, we not -- the reduced average basket size to now EUR 13.69.</p><p>And finally, ladies -- Americas. Americas generate 10 million orders in Q1, which represent the growth of 35%, however, this growth increased to 44% if you accounted the investment of Brazil. GMV grew by 19% in our constant currency and on constant currency, the growth would have been by 44% amounting to EUR 115 million for the quarter. As you can imagine and you know, we're facing some FX headwinds in the region and this is impacting our reported results in euro significantly for America.</p><p>The revenues grew by 76% and amount EUR 20 million. This is partly driven by our own delivery as well as the rollout, the continued rollout of our multivertical offering, including groceries and other demand items. Again, in Q4 -- in Q1 '19 like in Q3 and Q4, revenues as well as GMV for Americas, have been impacted by the application of the so-called IAS 29, means the hyperinflation accounting for our Argentinian operation. That came into action since Q3 '18. And the impact of considering Argentina as a hyperinflationary country, was negative by EUR 400,000 in Q1, regarding revenues but negative of EUR 2.8 million in terms of GMV for Q1. The proportion of own delivery orders is now 30% of the total orders for America. And now ladies and gentlemen, I hand over to Niklas for the guidance 2019.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Thanks, Emmanuel. Now to the outlook. On the back of the successful start of the year, we have increased our revenue guidance to between EUR 1.1 billion and EUR 1.2 billion, to give you some more explanation, we quickly look at the revenue bridge. So if you take the midpoint of the previous guidance range, of between EUR 1.08 billion and EUR 1.15 billion as a starting point, next you add full year revenue impact of the acquisition of Zomato's UAE business, which is expected to be EUR 18 million from March through to December. Then you account for the positive FX impact from last time reported, which is about EUR 1 million. And finally, we had the business outperformance which will get you to our new revenue guidance range of between EUR 1.1 billion and EUR 1.2 billion. As said revenue guidance now at EUR 1.1 billion, EUR 1.2 billion. In terms of adjusted EBITDA guidance, we expect to reach our previously announced adjusted EBITDA guidance of between negative EUR 270 million and negative EUR 320 million. As outlined previously, we will invest more in the second half of 2019 than in the first half of 2019. This is because it takes time to scale up our investments spend across our countries.</p><p>In terms of profitability on a segment level. We expect MENA to remain the most profitable segment and have a full year adjusted EBITDA of EUR 70 million positive. This is despite the fact that we have invest significantly in this region and rolled out multivertical platforms there. Europe is expected to reach breakeven during H2 2019.</p><p>We are extremely pleased with Q1 as you can understand. We have continued to increase our investments throughout this year, and we never felt more confident in our market position and the business growth. With that, I'd like to hand over for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: The first question is from John King of Bank of America.</p><p>JOHN PETER KING, RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on the good start to the first quarter. I was going to dig actually into some of the results from 2018 obviously with the annual report published. Emmanuel, on the gross margin side I think second half stepped down again, somewhere into the mid-40s on a reported basis. I'm just wondering, is there anything that depressed that result? What would you expect in terms of gross margin development as we look forward into 2019? And then the second one may be related, but I think looking at the disclosure on the commission rates, it seems as so though that delivery order commissions must have fallen. I may be wrong on that but, I guess, perhaps that's a feature of some of the delivery discounts. So perhaps you could comment on what the run rate is for commission rates on the delivery orders at the moment? And I guess, I'd just be interested in general, perhaps for Niklas, your view as to the sustainability of some of the prevailing price points in the industry right now, it feels like people are burning quite a lot of cash. Do you think this is a matter of just purely scale or do you think ultimately, we probably need to see commission rates and/or kind of consumer prices rise in order to square the circle on economics?</p><p>EMMANUEL THOMASSIN: Well, thank you very much, John, for the questions. I start with the gross profit margin. Yes. You're right, I mean, as we develop our own delivery services obviously the cost of sales are increasing, so the margin is -- the declining of the result of the margin is a result of our investments in own delivery. Having said that, we look also obviously at the absolute numbers and we look at the unique economics of our own delivery. So yes, the margin will reduce or reduced and we continue if our own delivery proportion is increasing but in absolute numbers, we remain very positive. The commission rate I -- probably here have a positive view from our side. Because we don't push so much on commission, I mean, the take rates is about 17.7% now and 11.8% without our delivery and we don't -- we not aggressively increase our commission rates across the regions, we much more focus on getting market share. So here there is room for growth, for sure.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Yes, on the sustainability. I think we have probably been the most aggressive of all. We've been free delivering in many markets, we have reduced also minimum order value. I think in a couple of markets, there have been exceptions of the players to have very small proportion of logistic being equally or in 1 or 2 cases, even more aggressive. I think overall, we have been the most aggressive one. And despite that, we are driving good view in the economics here. I think it's partially also because we have been very diligent on making sure that we have a commission rate that actually makes sense and where I think most of our competitors don't. They give away on a free for restaurants or sign-up on the same contracts on 15% and the delivery below 10 minutes, it's clearly not going to work out. And I think, that is not going to last for long. But I think, when you look at us, we have been very prudent in making sure that we take a commission rate that actually works. And despite that because we had the scale and the restaurants and restaurants chain have been happy to sign up on those commission rates while I think, for the more early entrance state they were forced to give away the service for free or at a very low cost.</p><p>I think, also a little bit different here for us being that we don't have the same concentration while I think, many of our competitors will have more than 50% of same concentration so they will have McDonald's, Burger King that's almost like -- almost only or 50% plus of their business. And, of course, you will not make [any] economics on McDonald's, that will never be profitable on the current commission that they charge. So the question is, is it going to be sustainable? Well, it is sustainable for us, but it also requires that your prudent on the pricing, and I think most our competitors haven't been that. And that's a big advantage for us.</p><p>JOHN PETER KING: And maybe if I could just ask one follow-up. I don't know how much you can comment on the situation at Hungerstation with the management departures. But any comments, I just wonder whether you -- there is any concerns that that's got other implications for you, you think that's dealt with the departure of the staff?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: No. I think. It started becoming increasingly important market for us with a larger proportion of own delivery and also the need for multivertical. And because of this, we also put Yousif Abdulaziz, who is a Saudi national now and the previous CEO of Carriage to take the lead in this. Carriage, under his leadership, has done an excellent job in executing and rolling out logistic across the region, including multivertical capabilities. So I think, this is a very strong change that I believe will further strengthen our position in the Saudi market. Former CEO, Ebrahim, continues to be a minority shareholder in Hungerstation and is also fully aligned in terms of his incentives to continue to grow the business. So I think, we be probably in a stronger position there. And as mentioned earlier, we are now even accelerating certain prior development skills in own delivery, multivertical so I'm very optimistic for the short and the mid and the long term.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Andrew Gwynn of BNP Exane.</p><p>ANDREW PHILIP GWYNN, SENIOR FOOD RESEARCHER &amp; ANALYST OF FOOD RETAIL, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Three questions if I can, just on the EBITDA guidance. Obviously, you have changed your revenue guidance but no change on the EBITDA? So presumably we're just, sort of, moving within the tram lines rather than anything, no sort of extra step up investments. Secondly, just on the investments, I mean, when you, sort of, announced that you were still a little bit unclear as to exactly where the extra investment was going to go. I am just wondering if you can give a little bit more color on what your latest thinking is? And then, sort of, connected just for the final question, is on those non-leadership markets. Is there a significant change in how you're thinking about your position there? I mean obviously you talk a lot about M&amp;A opportunities, but should we expect a significant change in strategy?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: [Let me] quickly cover. So on the EBITDA, yes, we have not changed the guidance. Of course, we are delivering higher growth and revenue and also profit contribution than probably even we expected. But at the same time, we see the investment working out so well so we see no need for us to, kind of, improve our EBITDA guidance but we rather reinvest. And we believe that we can reinvest that good return so therefore, we are not going to change our EBITDA guidance but rather invest a little bit more with extra profit contribution that we are generating here. In terms of where it goes, we intentionally didn't be too specific here, but from a comparative point of view, but for also for us to be able to reallocate where we see the best return and want to be very agile on this one. I think where you see we have invested a lot in Middle East. We -- you can see in the growth in Asia obviously where we go from kind of 47% or so to 74% growth in 1 quarter so clearly, some good investments here but no granular detail in secular-ish market.</p><p>In terms of where we invest, and a 2/3 of it being in marketing, the remaining 1/3 pretty equally spread between sales, affordability and product development so that should give you some hints there. In terms of the non-leadership markets, I think we have 4 or so markets or 4, 5 markets, which are small and non-leadership. Here, of course, we have to evaluate our -- and if we are willing to make big investments to catch up or rather find alternatives. I think then there are a couple big or large second markets. Here we are clearly going to invest and we believe that we are going to win leadership. It might take, kind of, years to get there, but I think if you look at the current direction in those markets then I'm very optimistic that in the mid- to long-term, we will be a leading player organically. But we are always open to acquiring any of our competitors. I don't think there is an option that we would sell in any other markets or in those large non-leading where we think that we can win.</p><p>ANDREW PHILIP GWYNN: Sorry, just to follow up on that. Has the sort of, pace of the opportunities presented to you, has that changed substantially over the last 3, 6 months?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: I think we always keep an open dialogue with all players. I cannot comment if more or less and we are very focused on our business and making sure that we build leadership and if we build leadership all options are available so that's our main focus. And then if something comes, then we will opportunistic act on it.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Joe Barnett-Lamb of Credit Suisse.</p><p>JOSEPH BARNET-LAMB, RESEARCH ANALYST, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I've got 3 from me. So starting with MENA, which again has performed incredibly well. Can you talk a little bit about any specific countries that drove strength there and also the degree to which multivertical delivery logistics fuels some of the MENA performance? Secondly, great strength across the group, but, I guess, the one area that may be potential spot of weakness is Americas, I think, you previously flagged Columbia and Canada, can you talk a little bit about performance across the Americas in the region? And then thirdly -- in the period sorry? And then thirdly, just with the German deal behind us, could you comment a little on the evolution of the European segment? And specifically, anything you can say with regard to evolution of gross margins post the German sale?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: So MENA, I think, it's across the board, I -- there is no market where we see weakness. And we see markets that have been around for a long time like Yemeksepeti, it's growing faster than -- on an order basis as they say, than we have seen years ago. So when we acquired the business, it's growing faster than back then in 2015. Of course with FX and so on it's a little bit different. But on the fundamental order basis there -- same with Kuwait, it's been around for 12 or so years. It has a scale with almost 1 order per inhabitant in that country now per month and it still grows fantastically, so still growing in mid-double-digit percentage terms. We also see the new markets having incredible growth and, of course, Saudi being very promising, Egypt very, very promising. Sorry, I couldn't put out any one single market, I'm very pleased across-the-board.</p><p>In terms of the multivertical, of course, it adds a little bit we should be honest it's a little bit -- it's still early stage, the main part of our business is still, of course, prepared food. But we want to have the best offering and we should make sure that we always have the best offering, and that's why we also offer this as a part. But it's still a single digit number that is coming from this multivertical here. Americas, yes, it's a very mixed picture in that sense. You have the Clickdelivery business that we under prioritize. It's now being migrated into PedidosYa. It's tremendous performance if you look at Argentina, if you look at Chile and SWAN is growing tremendously some of our fastest growing market, we're outgrowing Rappi, we are outgrowing on a global, we're outgrowing Uber, we're outgrowing everyone there, in absolute terms, of course. Because we're at a much larger scale but so I think, Pedidos team has tremendous performance, now we migrate to over those other markets, to that team, we'll see if we are going to push it or if we rather focus on markets where we are clear leader and where we know that we are going to win. In terms of Europe, strong economics, good growth, very good market, you will have some of the early stage market where we invest heavily to drive leadership that also includes some affordability and keep in mind when you're growing with hundreds of percent in some of those markets then your economics will be a little bit worse on the unit economic side. But I think, looks very good.</p><p>In terms of Germany, I'm not sure if that was the question or rather departure from Germany. We continued to see positive economics there as we [improvise] the business but also through remembering H2, we significantly increased our investments to bring it at similar levels as Lieferando and we focus our efforts on Lieferheld brand. And with that, additional investment Lieferheld was the fastest growing brand in Germany and that remained the case in Q1 where Lieferheld grew with 37% versus 31% for Lieferando -- 36% versus 31% for Lieferando. We also achieved 70,000 restaurants online as we start to scale up. That was the most restaurants in Germany, those with active online. And on a combined level, Lieferheld also outgrewed Lieferando and in downloads and acquisitions so I think you could clearly, see how the effect was happening there. How we scaled our business and start to build growth for 2019 and onwards. But that also means that economics were taken down. We aggressively invested in affordability and therefore, we saw very positive unit economics in the first 3 quarters, while we actually went to the negative, which was also partially why our conservative view on certain accruals for the historic dates between 2014 and 2019. So yes, now I call both Germany and Europe here on unit economics.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Andrew Ross of Barclays.</p><p>ANDREW GEOFFREY ROSS, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I've have got 3 questions as well. First one's on your share of associates, which you've given some more details on in the annual report, EUR 39 million loss. I guess most of that is Rappi. Given your 20% shareholder value a Board member, can you talk a bit about how the unit economics are developing at Rappi? And I guess, given how much cash they're burning, can you talk about the funding situation there, whether they need to raise more. Whether you'd be open to participating in Flash kind of big tech getting involved to making that segment a bit hotter. Second question is on Careem. Obviously, it's now being taken over by Uber. Can you talk a bit about Careem NOW food business in terms of has it got traction at all in any of the markets your in and MENA? I mean just give a sense of Careem NOW's positioning right now? And then third question is just a follow-up on the comment you made earlier Niklas on big markets where you are not a leader and I guess one of those is clearly Korea. Can you talk about the market share in Korea, over the last quarter both in terms of orders, users downloads et cetera. So -- to give us a sense of the extra spend your putting in is actually working in terms of market share on the grounds.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: On Rappi, I'm a little bit hesitant to share any insight here. I would leave it up to them. They are performing really well. Very nicely, of course, unit economics is at early stage and to be seen how we're moving it up there. I cannot share if we're participating or not in upcoming financing.</p><p>But we do see that's a very strong shareholding and I think we're proven success by being very early investor in this in global, and I think we made the right call in doing so. And that's the advantage, of course, being highly involved in our business, understanding economics, being able to forecasting better than probably most other investors. So I'm obviously very pleased with the both of those investments.</p><p>In terms of Careem. Yes. They've been around for quite some time now. Careem Eats. So they have been around for 1.5 years, 2 years. But it's still, I believe -- but it's still on a fairly small level. I don't know if the combination with Uber now makes a difference. Uber has also been around for quite sometime in Middle East, but I'm not sure if it has been a focus or not. I don't know if the combination makes it a stronger player or not, but to be seen. I think on ride-hailing they are obviously very, very strong. Both fantastic companies there.</p><p>In terms of Korea, so we have seen very good traction here and we're very happy with the investments. [indiscernible] also partially the contributing factor to the growth in the whole Asia segment. So we are growing now at high double digit, may we can move it to triple digit in terms of growth, but yes, I do believe that we are gaining market shares fairly rapidly in terms of downloads, and so on it's -- yes, we are doing well.</p><p>In terms of size, I know they're much -- they're still a much larger than us. We have a long way to go, this is not going to be catching up in 1 or 2 years. This will be catching up over the next 5 years, at least. But we clearly, see a good return on the investments we do. And we're willing to keep on making those investments until we see that we have gain leadership.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Monique Pollard of Citi.</p><p>MONIQUE POLLARD, VP, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Three questions from me as well if I may. The first one, just on the EUR 16 million of revenue from core business outperformance that you're expecting for 2019, is all of that a higher return on the investment that you're putting in? So you're getting more than the EUR 45 million that you're expecting for 2019. Or is some of that just underlying outperformance? And then secondly, we touched on the Americas but specifically Colombia. Has the performance in 1Q been better than the disappointing performance in order growth that you talked about for 2018? And then finally, just trying to understand, is there any specific or meaningful impact of the Easter timing that changes the 1Q versus the 2Q result? And also, does the World Cup have any kind of material impact on the business as we go into 2Q?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: I mean, yes, so I wasn't fully understood the first question with the EUR 16 million increase in core business performance. Could you repeat the first one?</p><p>MONIQUE POLLARD: Yes. I was just trying to understand how much of that EUR 16 million is being driven by the higher revenues from the investment than you originally expected.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Yes. It's a tough one to answer because we are doing so many things in parallel on product improvements, multivertical improvement in -- increase in marketing spending is one. It's hard to say where all the performance is. I would say the EUR 16 million is overperformance what we expected. And of course, we expected to deliver some of the multivertical, some of the product features, some of the personalization, so I would say that the larger portion of that is probably still by the investments that we've made. It's probably the largest portion of that -- or better return on the investments we have made is probably a larger portion of that overperformance.</p><p>In terms of Colombia and those markets. Yes. It's a very mixed views, where we have PedidosYa. It operates 5, 6 markets down in Latin America doing tremendously well. You have Brazil in there, which we sold but is still included in the numbers. That will take it up to 45%. And then we have Clickdelivery, which is Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, where we clearly dropped the ball there and we have to take the learnings and making sure that, that doesn't repeat in any other markets. So I think here we clearly dropped the ball, and therefore, we also see very weak growth in this part. And that kind of gives an average, which is then 44% I believe, excluding Brazil. But I do expect going forward that this would be an acceleration in growth as we conclude through remaining part of the year, then driven by PedidosYa.</p><p>In terms of Easter time, no, we don't see a big effect -- might have been -- yes, we don't see a big effect on a group level. It -- that there are a couple of extra holidays, which is good, but then there are a couple of days, which are also bad. So on average, Easter is -- has not made any impact that you have to take into account or worthwhile mentioning.</p><p>The World Cup, we see normally marginally improvements across the World Cup, but it's very marginal. So this is also on a group level not significant or not going to be significant.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Silvia Cuneo of Deutsche Bank.</p><p>SILVIA CUNEO, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations on the results. My first question is on the reinvestments. Can you give more color about how much capital is being deployed already? Have you started to deploy the EUR 250 million on top of the EUR 160 million originally announced in August last year? And then if most of this is going to be spent in the second half, is it fair to assume momentum can continue to accelerate during the year? Then second question about Asia. That's the region where order growth accelerated the most. Can you please talk about which countries are particularly driving this acceleration? Is it coming from Korea? There was an article in the press recently about the South Korea subsidiary planning to spend almost USD 90 million in marketing and recruiting. And then finally, on the order growth, can you share some more detail about the new customers' ordering habits? And what percentage of the new customers you acquired with affordability campaigns have already ordered for the second time?</p><p>EMMANUEL THOMASSIN: Thank you very much for your questions. In terms of investment deployment, you can assume that deployments will be equally between the 2 parts of the year, so the first 6 months and two 6 months. So we deployed like the 1/4 of the investments that you mentioned, the EUR 250 million, in Q1. This is one of the reasons of the return that we see and the evolution. So you could expect to see Q2, Q3, Q4 to have 1/4 of these investments in general.</p><p>To the Asian countries, not only Korea, as Niklas mentioned, is doing really well, but other countries like Taiwan, Thailand are -- and other countries in this segment are doing really, really well with high growth. So we're investing not only in Korea but also in these countries. And we see also very, very good results in return on investments in these countries.</p><p>The last question was on new customers.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Yes. So the reorder rate, the new customers come from affordability, and we see overall a higher repeat ordering behavior of the customers that are acquired now than we have done in the past. So that is a very good sign. We do not drill down into -- or at least, we do not disclose reorder rate by different campaigns and different activities. Obviously, that's something that we monitor very, very closely as we -- as the lifetime value, some different channels, different campaigns, different activities. But we don't disclose, but overall, we have better reorder rates now than in the past.</p><p>SILVIA CUNEO: Okay. Just I wanted to clarify on the reinvestment. I thought earlier you said you were going to invest more in the second half of the year, why you [indiscernible] tactically acquired -- I mean it's even mostly.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Yes. So it's difficult to invest at a good return, this amount of money or increased investment this amount of money. That's why there is a little bit more attribute to second half versus the first half. I think we should also be realistic. As we get to scale and the size we're having, it's of course going to be very hard to keep growth up at these levels. [And I know] that's nothing that we commit to. Of course, we see things very promisingly in Q2. So I do think that we can expect a good Q2. But I don't want to commit to second half. I think it will be a great year overall but of course, accelerating year-on-year at the scale of 125 million orders in a quarter, that -- that's obviously a big, big challenge.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Rob Joyce of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>ROBERT JOYCE, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Three from me. Just following up on some earlier ones. So firstly just on Korea. Can you confirm -- I think you said previously that you're profitable in Korea at the EBITDA line. Can you confirm that's still the case and the sort of organic path-to-market leadership can be achieved while remaining profitable? Secondly, just wondering if you could clear up something you said earlier about dropping the ball in certain markets just so we know what that kind of involves and on how you avoid that elsewhere. And then the third one is, clearly, the investments look to have been pretty successful early doors. Is the other signs there that beyond 2019 there may be scope to put some further investment in and actually secure some further growth beyond the initial investment phase?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: I can quickly cover. So Korea -- and now we are scaling beyond the organic growth. That would have been a good strategy to continue. But we feel like we want to really win the leadership here, and therefore, we are going to go into the negative with extra investments. But we all know how it works for the business. The investments goes into new acquisitions, new growth that is continuing forever, and we could scale back at that point in time to profitability. Obviously, that is not the strategy that we will pursue. But eventually, with higher size and larger scale, even that will capturing larger marketing investments and that will then also drive back into profitability. But in the short and midterm, you should expect that we will go and keep on being in -- investing significantly more than what we have done in the past.</p><p>On dropping the ball when we speak Clickdelivery, I think we didn't pay enough attention to the product offering. It was a very small market, small platform, was -- therefore, it was [probably lost], not in the priority while we were laser focused on the Middle East and also Asia, partially also some European markets. I think we didn't have enough attention to Clickdelivery platform, which was a couple of percent of our business. The product offering was clearly behind or getting behind on Rappi with the multivertical subscription features. We were not focused enough on the restaurant acquisition side getting the best accounts onboard. Logistics, we didn't expand logistics fast enough. We -- only until recently, we had only a couple of percent of logistics there. So overall, we had a significantly worse proposition, and that is not the sustainable way to drive a leading company in a region. So yes, that's why we are very fast in launching multivertical we are fast in launching subscriptions. We are fast in driving logistics to be able to add the best accounts to our platform. We are fast in making sure we have McDonald's and Burger King and all those key accounts on our platform. So I feel confident that in the current setup, we are stand very strong in those other markets.</p><p>In terms of the successful investments and if we would expand it further and then -- that will be no. We think that we are investing at very high pace right now. We are not yet at the level where we need to be in terms of our investments in order to reach the EUR 270 million-EUR 320 million, so we still have to be smart in finding ways and new opportunities. I'm very sure that we will be able to deploy all of it successfully, but this is not an easy task if you want to have a good return on it. But yes, not for this year, I do not expect that we'll be able to increase it further and have a good return on it.</p><p>ROBERT JOYCE: And just quick follow-up. On delivery, are you still confident that the sort of gross profit per order dynamics you can eventually get to parity there with the marketplace?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Yes. You hear some hesitance there in my answer. It is a tough play out there. As I said before, we have been very prudent in making sure that we still sign them up on good commission rates and that we can actually build that sustainability and have the same economics. But it requires us to be very efficient in our delivery operations. It requires us to work on additional services and so on. So I think it will take time until we would be there. We are very clear that it will be positive. But if we will be at parity, I think in many markets, but on the strong competition, then it's of course much harder in particular in the short and the midterm. Yes, that's my honest answer.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Giles Thorne of Jefferies.</p><p>GILES THORNE, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just wanted -- I wanted to start by picking up on the news that Carriage is going to be launched in Egypt where you already have an existing marketplace brand. Generally, it feels like we move towards brand rationalization rather than fragmentation, so it'd be [just] to understand why you're doing this. I'm guessing it's something to do with rolling out multivertical in that market. But it'd be interesting to hear what you have to say. Second question was just turning to Deliveroo launching in Kuwait. I don't want to ask what you think the impact will be on you. It's actually a different question. I'd be interested in your perspective on what it is about a market like Kuwait where order frequency is famously already very high that Deliveroo sees that it can come in 12 years late and be relevant. So be interested to get your perspective on that. And then lastly, I want to just come back to a question I've asked previously in this forum, which is just again, Niklas, how are you think about funding a competitor put bluntly. So this is in the context of Rappi and participating in future funding rounds. What is your thought process around putting fresh capital to work in a business that you're competing on the ground with in certain countries, your latest thinking there?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Thanks. Great questions. So on Egypt, well spotted. I think Egypt is still a fairly early market in its development. We have -- our business has been around for some time, but we still -- it's a little bit more of a marketplace business, and we -- the reason why we're so well ahead I think, in many cases, when it comes to multivertical, on logistics and so on is that we have been doing it for a long time. And that's where you see somewhere our peers, they have not and it will take them many, many years until they get to the point where we are today.</p><p>I think Otlob is probably a little bit behind overall the group in the development in its offering, and it takes that time -- it takes time to change that behavior, change that brand perception. That's one. And that's why we felt that we have to act very fast and we have to go in with our own play, which is Carriage here because they have a multivertical offering. They have a very strong product subscription, and they have great logistics, which is based on our internal system or global solution. So therefore, we decided that let's go in and make sure that we have the best offering rather than trying to take 6 months to 12 months to reshape the offering at Otlob in this case.</p><p>Now Otlob is also migrate over to Talabat, which should help the product offering as one and speed it up. But as always in these migrations, it takes a little bit of time to get things in order. We just didn't feel like we had the time. That's why we decided to go very aggressively and go in with Carriage. Long term or midterm, we're probably also going to rationalize back here to be one brand. But in the short term, we felt this is the best way to making sure that we capture the market and don't give any space to any new entrants like we did in Colombia.</p><p>In terms of Kuwait. Yes. I guess the logic will be it's a big market, and there will always be some consumers that had a bad experience or they will be -- or they just want to have another brand to try out from time to time. And if they can only capture 10% of the market, they feel like they can get a big business. And that's always possible. Like to get 10 or so percent of a market is possible, maybe even 20%. But the question is where that leads you. Sitting on a 20% position in the midterm or long term is not very attractive. But yes, if you want to grow some orders, I think this could be an easy way to get some easy orders. But if it's a sustainable strategy, I doubt it, but to be seen.</p><p>Yes, the funding of a competitor is an interesting one. We obviously feel that we have to be better than -- and we shouldn't care so much about competition. We should [do] our best. And if we do the best, and then we are going to be leading and winning. In some of those cases is also not so overlapping, so we feel like we rather want to be part of that. There is some overlapping, but we don't really care about that overlap so much. It's going to be competition from them or it's going to be competition from someone else.</p><p>And we will see long term who's the stronger in those overlapping markets, and there will be strategic considerations along the path. We see a strong benefit of actually being involved in those companies, sitting at the table, understand the best learnings, the insights, and we want to stay at that table, also sitting in a good position for any future strategic considerations. So that's why we want to make sure that we are a strong shareholder sitting at those tables. And that will also define if we are going to participate or not in future financings. Yes.</p><p>GILES THORNE: If I may, just a follow-up on that last answer. Has there been -- well, are you contractually unable to take any type of proprietary technology or know-how or personnel out of Rappi and Glovo? Is that something that you're not allowed to do by contract? And then if it isn't, have you taken any technology or people or know-how out of those businesses and put them into your controlled operations thus far?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: So these are 2 different businesses, and there is no extra clause that we are not allowed to use anything. But I think that's normally in the shareholders' agreement and confidentiality agreements and Board member agreements that when I sit in the Board of Rappi, I'm not allowed to use that knowledge, of course, in other places. That will be use of confidential data, so I will have to disregard my knowledge that I gain in those roles when I operate Delivery Hero. But yes, there is no special clause there that we, in particular, would not be bound by nonconfidentiality or such, yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Jurgen Kolb of Kepler Cheuvreux.</p><p>JURGEN KOLB, ANALYST, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: Most of my questions have been answered. One remaining really on the part of the subscription. Maybe you could elaborate a little bit in how many markets you've already introduced it, what your current experience is there and about a potential rollout to other markets.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Sure. So we've done subscription for a long time, but we were not very successful in our first situations and only recently we felt that we had a subscription offering that was very compelling and actually worthwhile for us. So yes, I don't want disclose our plans and so on globally there, but overall, we are happy with the subscription programs we have now in place. Of course, doing subscription, you have to be very careful that you don't dilute your economics, and I think you have to find the right balance between having a subscription program that increases frequency without diluting your economics. And I think that's something we have found and then we are happy with. But it's a very critical one, and we have to assess by market by market, economics by economics. And yes, I believe so far we have been happy with the latest results.</p><p>JURGEN KOLB: Would there be any chance to indicate like how big the share of subscription is in terms of your orders or any indication of one of the strongest markets maybe?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: We see a very strong uptick in usage of our subscription programs in the markets we're in because we have very loyal customer base that orders very frequently from us, and therefore, they find it beneficial to pay a subscription fee in order to have -- take away the mind space of having to think about delivery fees and other promotions that we do there, other benefits that we give in terms of [growth] preference to those users. So we have a very strong uptake there. I will not give any percentage now unfortunately.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Sarah Simon, Berenberg.</p><p>SARAH SIMON, ANALYST, JOH. BERENBERG, GOSSLER &amp; CO. KG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I've got a few questions as well, please. First one was, Emmanuel, can you update us on the cash position now given the Zomato deals and also the delivery -- sorry, the sale of the Takeaway shares. Second question, can you remind us what the Zomato valuation was in terms of when you put the $50 million in? The third one, just in terms of delivery obviously in some of the segments, it's heading out towards 30. Do you have a sort of updated -- in terms of percentage of orders that you're delivering, do you have an updated view as to where you think those markets might go? And then the final one was just so we can put it into context. Have you got any indication in terms of what percentage of GMV is coming from the multivertical stuff, i.e., what is not traditional food delivery?</p><p>EMMANUEL THOMASSIN: Well, we start with the cash position. So we don't disclose our cash position right now at the end of the first quarter. But as you can imagine, we received the proceeds of Takeaway, so we received the EUR 508 million of cash that we announced in December. This is done. We also had the [wide collar] that generated around EUR 200 million. So we have a very strong balance sheet. We didn't disclose the purchase price of Zomato, and obviously, I won't do it now. But right now we're still in a very good position cash-wise and have a very strong balance sheet. On top of that, we still have [our ACF], as you know, about [EUR 20 million, EUR 25 million.] That is still available for us. So I think we are, after this first quarter, in a very strong position in terms of growth and in terms of strong balance sheet.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: On the own delivery, 30% is what we have said would be for the year. We were at 25% in Q1. So it will increase. Partially, the increase is driven by market mix in here as well. We still see that there is a significant number of countries and cities -- sorry, cities where delivery will make less sense and have that sustainable. So therefore, we expect that there will be still also in the long term the majority being marketplace there.</p><p>In terms of percent of GMV for multivertical, we do not disclose. But as mentioned before, it's a single-digit number for the markets where we have launched it. But yes, so that will also be single digit for the group or low single digit then for the group. But -- and it will -- and the food will still be by far the largest vertical. But we want to make sure that for those frequent users they can also come to us for those needs. Yes.</p><p>SARAH SIMON: Great. And sorry, Emmanuel, can you remind us what was the Zomato, this funding round valuation?</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Right. So the $50 million that you mentioned, so we do not disclose that, but I'm very happy with the -- allowing them -- allowing us into their round, which was closed before. And I do think that it was clearly below in the future funding rounds.</p><p>OPERATOR: The last question is from Marcus Diebel of JPMorgan.</p><p>MARCUS DIEBEL, RESEARCH ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: One more question. Last -- just to follow up on the delivery with -- where there's marketplace debate where the share might go. Europe's traditionally lower in terms of delivery so for many different reasons. But also specifically for Europe, where do you see this share might go? And also across the different countries in which you operate, do you see already some initiatives at some restaurants, marketplace restaurants move into delivery? We've seen some examples of them using delivery services in peak hours. But is that a trend? Or is it certainly something that is not really happening yet? I mean previously you said it's relatively small as an impact. But has that changed? That will be my questions.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Yes. So I think it's a little bit market by market there, and it also connected strongly to regulation and certain unit economics for labor versus the average basket values. So we've seen some markets it is beneficial to use an external partner like us for doing the delivery of that restaurant. In some markets, it makes more sense to have small restaurants being the owner of their own logistics. So if you take some of the European markets, which are strongly regulated and where the difference between high income and low income is not so large, then restaurants might want to keep their own logistics there.</p><p>I think that is also the case in many places where they want to keep their independence and have built up their logistic capabilities over many, many years. They are hesitant to move to another one's logistic solution, and we also don't encourage it really. So I think that will remain them being the owner of it. But it's a little bit market by market. I don't say that there is an overall trend that they want to move away from it. It's rather new restaurants moving to delivery, and they, as -- at least as the first step, want to use an external party to help them doing that logistics but very few existing delivery restaurants that will move to a third party.</p><p>OPERATOR: There are no further questions. I hand back to the speakers to the closing words.</p><p>L. NIKLAS \u00c3\u2013STBERG: Yes. Then thank you, everyone, for your tremendous support. We are very happy to have you as shareholders. And yes, I'm very proud of what the team has been building, and I'm very grateful to be part of this amazing company. And I'm very opportunistic -- or optimistic about the future. And yes, thank you very much for your long-term support.</p><p>EMMANUEL THOMASSIN: Thank you very much.

The management of Amadeus will run you through the presentation, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I'm now pleased to hand over to you, Mr. Luis Maroto, President and CEO of Amadeus. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you.</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMADEUS IT GROUP, S.A.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our first quarter results presentation. Thank you very much again for joining us today. As always, I'm here with Ana that will walk you through the details of our financial performance, and I will focus on our most relevant developments.</p><p>Before we get started with our quarter 1 performance overview, I would like to make a few remarks on the current market context. As you know, the COVID-19 pandemic has advanced through the quarter and progressively impacted more regions. In January, the GDS industry had a good start. However, after the closing of Wuhan, we saw a decline in APAC bookings that gradually extended to all geographies as new cases were declared outside of China. By mid-February, the underlying GDS industry was trading daily at minus 10%, minus 15% rates. And our Amadeus organic PBs were performing better. There is always a delay between booking and flying. Amadeus organic PBs were trading at minus 7%, minus 10% debt rates on a daily basis relative to prior year.</p><p>In the last part of February, we saw a further deterioration to reach an underlying GDS industry decline in the minus 30%, minus 40%. In March, the deterioration continued further and the underlying GDS industry towards the end of March was trading daily at minus 80% year-on-year. During April, the underlying GDS industry has been decreasing close to minus 90% daily but not deteriorating further than that.</p><p>As many of you know, the latest IATA release, its air traffic forecast for 2020 now points to minus 48% for the full year. This is the last estimation of April 14, and this is assuming a recovery that starts in the third quarter of the year.</p><p>So the impact of COVID-19 on our business has been very severe, and we expect this to continue into the second quarter of the year. We have acted decisively as the pandemic was progressing to protect our liquidity position. By the end of February, we had started with cost saving programs impacting most of the discretionary captions, which has translated into reduced cash-out in March.</p><p>Additionally, during the second half of March, we further adopted a series of measures in response to the growing severity of the COVID-19 impact. We implemented an efficiency plan to reduce our fixed cost and CapEx by EUR 300 million on an annual basis with additional measures over those already adopted at the end of February. We canceled our complementary dividend payment and the share buyback program in relation with employee performance plans and enhance our liquidity by executing a EUR 1 billion bridge loan facility and by raising an additional EUR 1.5 billion of capital and convertible bonds in early April.</p><p>Let's now review our performance for the first quarter. In the first 3 months of the year, our travel agency bookings declined by 44.6% and our PBs 12%. This decline in volumes drove a contraction in revenue, EBITDA and adjusted profit of 27%, 41% and 57%, respectively, with revenues impacted more immediately than cost and CapEx, which have been acted upon later within the quarter, although we can see some benefits already of the action implemented in the cash outflow in March.</p><p>By segments. In Distribution, our travel agency bookings in the quarter followed the industry contraction and declined by 47%, driving a reduction in Distribution revenue by 45% in the first 3 months of the year. We enhanced our competitive position by 0.3% in the quarter. However, market changes in this type of environment are really not meaningful.</p><p>In IT solutions, our revenue declined by 0.3% in the first 3 months of 2020. This evolution resulted from negative revenue growth in Airline IT solution and positive performance delivered by our new businesses. In Airline IT, our passengers boarded declined by 12% or 11% excluding customer airlines ceasing operations.</p><p>In the first 3 months of 2020, our investment in R&amp;D grew 3% relative to last year. R&amp;D growth decelerated in March and it will likely continue to decelerate over the next quarters because as part of our cost reduction program, we have canceled more of the contracts we have with third parties with -- who provide us with temporary workforce, and we have established voluntary and paid leave for our employees.</p><p>Accordingly, we have resigned resources -- we have reassigned resources from longer-term projects to services that provide revenues in the short term. And through our most strategic efforts, we have a strong balance sheet, which allows us to continue with part of our investments. However, given the severity of the COVID-19 impact, we are being very selective on prioritizing projects.</p><p>In the first quarter of 2020, our free cash flow generation amounted to EUR 290 million, an increase of 3% relative to the same period of the year -- of '19, sorry, with leverage closing at 1.4x last 12 months EBITDA or 1.04x pro forma for our capital-raising transaction in early April.</p><p>Let's review a bit more of the details as we always do. If we move to Slide 5, we renewed or signed distribution agreements with 23 carriers during the quarter, including non-European airline, and we continued to grow our airline customer base of merchandising solutions for the travel agency channel.</p><p>Travel agency air booking industry contracted 46% in the quarter. Volumes in all regions declined at a strong double-digit rate, highly impacted by the pandemic. Asia Pac and Europe, the most affected regions, were the worst performers followed by North America, Middle East and Africa and LATAM. The industry was also impacted by a high volume of booking cancellations with an increased cancellation ratio due to the situation most notably towards the end of the quarter.</p><p>Following a more conservative criteria, we have raised our cancellation provision to reflect the percentage of cancellations in March versus the prior criteria [occurring] for the average of the last 12 months, which has impacted negatively our revenues in this segment.</p><p>Amadeus travel agency air bookings declined by 48% due to the situation that I mentioned impacting the industry. And Amadeus bookings reported negative growth in all regions driven by this overall industry contraction. Our non-air bookings decreased 15.4% caused by the overall negative impact of the pandemic on the global travel industry. However, hotel and car rental bookings reported growth in the quarter supported by customer wins.</p><p>If we move to IT Solutions. Regarding Airline IT, during the first quarter, Mauritania Airlines, Air Tahiti, Azerbaijan and STARLUX Airlines completed their migration to the Alt\u00e9a platform, whilst JSX was implemented to New Skies. Korean airline Air Premia; a new Nigerian carrier, Green Africa Airways, contracted Navitaire's New Skies passenger service, while an African carrier signed for Amadeus Revenue Accounting, Revenue Integrity, Flex Pricer and Customer Experience Management.</p><p>In the quarter, passengers boarded declined 12% driven by negative organic growth of 15.7%. The positive impact of customer implementations, including Philippines, Bangkok, Air Canada, Air Europa and FlyOne in 2019; and Azerbaijan, Mauritania, STARLUX Airlines, Air Tahiti and JSX in 2020; and a negative impact from airline customers ceasing or suspending operations, including in 2019, Germania and bmi Regional, both in February; Avianca Brasil in May; Avianca Argentina in June; Thomas Cook U.K., Aigle Azur, Adria Airways and XL Airways France, all of them in September; and Flybe, the latest one in March of this year. Excluding these airline customers ceasing or suspending operations, our passengers boarded declined 11% in the first quarter.</p><p>Regarding Airport IT, Belgrade Airport, part of the VINCI Group, signed for Alt\u00e9a DCS for ground handlers. Others such as Lyon Airport, Pristina Airport and Pulkovo Airport became new Amadeus IT customers. Our upselling effort in this segment also continue with a number of airports, such as Daytona Beach International in Florida, Baku and Almaty contracting for incremental IT technology.</p><p>If we move to hospitality space. During the quarter, we signed a multiyear agreement with 11 properties of the British chain Radisson Edwardian Hotels for Amadeus Sales and Event Management. A German lodging company, Maritim Hotelgesellschaft, contracted iHotelier for its 44 properties. Sonder contracted business intelligence, Demand360, which will be implemented on its more than 40 properties. Additionally, Extra Holidays, a subsidiary of Wyndham Destinations, chose iHotelier, Guest Management Solutions and Demand360 for 114 properties.</p><p>In terms of our performance. Hospitality revenue increased over the first 3 months of 2020, delivering double-digit growth until February. March performance, however, was impacted by COVID-19. But despite this impact, several Hospitality revenue lines still grew double digit in the quarter. Approximately 50% of Hospitality revenue is nontransactional with a particularly strong performance of transactional revenue, including GDS and CRS up to February, supported by customer wins. We can also say that nontransactional revenue from sales and catering and business intelligence grew strongly in the quarter. So as you see from my presentation that we have tried to really keep some normality. The business continues strong despite the current environment.</p><p>And now I will turn to Ana for the details of our financial performance.</p><p>ANA DE PRO GONZALO, CFO, AMADEUS IT GROUP, S.A.: Thank you, Luis. Hello, everyone. I think that Slide 9 on revenue growth we can skip as Luis has already described and explained our evolution in the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>So if we move to Page #10. In the first quarter of 2020, our EBITDA contracted by 41.3% up to EUR 350 million driven by the 27% decline we saw in revenues and the negative operating leverage.</p><p>Let me give you some additional color on our operating cost. Cost of revenue declined by 42.3% in the quarter mainly as a result of the decline in bookings volumes partially offset by an increase in variable costs from our hospitality business, which have had a positive performance in the period, as Luis has just explained. Supported by our cost-saving plan, our combined operating expenses cost line, including [personnel and other operating] expenses, decreased by 1.2%. However, due to, first, an increase in the bad debt provision associated with the COVID-19 crisis; and secondly, a lower capitalization ratio, consequence of the reassignment of resources to services, which is a noncapital R&amp;D activity, and also the reduction of some long-term programs whilst we maintain all of our operational needs; and lastly, the negative ForEx FX in the quarter, our total net fixed cost increased by 3.1% on a reported basis.</p><p>Below the EBITDA line, depreciation and amortization increased by 12.3% mostly driven by a 12.9% increase in the ordinary D&amp;A resulting from previous capitalized R&amp;D costs which has started to be amortized during the period. Our net financial expense decreased by EUR 16.7 million to EUR 4 million mainly driven by the exchange gains amounting to EUR 8.5 million in the period compared to losses of EUR 8.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. Interest expense declined by 8.9% as a consequence of a reduction in the average gross debt funding.</p><p>In the first quarter of 2020, our income tax expense amounted to EUR 34 million, 68.4% lower than in the previous year. The income tax rate for the quarter was 22%, broadly in line with the 2019 full year income tax rate and lower than the 26.5% that we had in the first quarter of 2019. This decrease was mostly driven by the recent changes in the tax regulation, especially in France, resulting in an increase in tax deductions associated with our R&amp;D. The combination of a decline in operating results and lower financial and tax expense resulted in a 57.5% decrease in our adjusted profit in the first quarter of 2020. The adjusted EPS was EUR 0.33, 57.5% lower than in the previous year.</p><p>In the first quarter of 2020, our investment in R&amp;D increased by 3% up to EUR 254 million. R&amp;D investment growth decelerated versus the previous quarters, particularly in March, driven by all of the measures that we have largely explained. As a percentage of revenue, R&amp;D investments represents 24.8% higher than the previous year due to the combined effect of our contained R&amp;D investment and our revenue decline reported in this first quarter.</p><p>So our CapEx decreased 24.9% to EUR 152 million, which represents 14.8% of revenues. The decrease in CapEx resulted from lower capitalizations from software development driven by the decline in the capitalization ratio due to the project mix explained, including amongst others a higher weight of the R&amp;D investment devoted to airline bespoke services, which has, as I have explained, no capitalization ratio; a reduction in the amount of signing bonuses paid; and thirdly, a decline in CapEx in property, plant and equipment relative to what we did last year.</p><p>In the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of EUR 290 million, 3% higher than in the previous year supported by the positive cash effect from working capital and coupled with lower CapEx and tax paid. Despite having acted upon our cost quickly, the impact in the P&amp;L will be seen later in the year, but it has started to generate cash savings during the last month of the first quarter of 2020 and should drive increasing cash savings in the coming months.</p><p>The cash flow impact from change in working capital improved by EUR 180 million versus 2019 mainly resulting for a higher net inflow from collections and payments from previous periods, coupled with a reduction in revenues and expenses in the first quarter of 2020 versus the same period of last year; secondly, payments amounting to EUR 34.3 million advanced from January 2020 to December 2019. If you remember, we explained this at year-end. Due to the scheduled changes in our accounting and payment systems during 2020 that was to happen in several countries, which was meant to interrupt the payment flow for the period, and therefore, we anticipated those payments to the last month of 2019; lower advanced payments related to customer renegotiations; and lastly, a positive impact from noncash P&amp;L items such as increase in the bad debt and booking cancellation provisions.</p><p>Our net debt amounted to EUR 2.8 billion at the end of March with a leverage raising to 1.4x our EBITDA or 1.04x pro forma for our capital-raising transactions that happened in the early 2020. As of today, our EUR 1 billion revolving credit facility executed in April 2018 and our EUR 1 billion bridge to loan facility executed in March 2020 remain undrawn.</p><p>With this, we have finished the presentation for our first quarter 2020 results, and we are ready to take any questions you may have.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) First question comes from Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>ADAM DENNIS WOOD, EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I've got 2, please. I wonder if, first of all, you could maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the Asian markets where lockdowns have begun to ease, and maybe there's some very, very gradual return to normality. Maybe first of all in terms of actual bookings and volumes. But maybe more importantly than that, in terms of the behavior of the customers and what they're doing around discussions with future products for you, around pricing negotiations.</p><p>And that kind of leads me into my second question, which is linked to that. Obviously, one of the risks to doing big tech changes in your industry is the risk of disruption to the business. So for a lot of these customers today, actually, this is potentially an opportunity to make changes. Are you seeing any interest from maybe more so on the hotel and airport side to make those types of changes? Could that accelerate things? Obviously, it's probably going to be harder on the airline side of things, but any thoughts around that would be really useful.</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: Okay. Let me try to talk a little bit about what we see today. I mean it's very, very, very difficult to really extract conclusions, okay? You read everyday news. I mean it is true that there could be some signs of positiveness, but I will not try to really tell you that the situation is over at all. I mean it's true that the reality, the airlines, despite the current situation, are keen of debating business opportunities, business recovery, how we can work together. And this is why we decided to really give you an update. And as we speak, we have debates with many customers. So the activity is there, talking and thinking about the future, as I said, despite the current situation.</p><p>I mean, we know that in some Asian markets, domestic traffic is more available. I am talking here about Korea. I'm talking about China, despite the fact we don't benefit so much. But in China, there are different reports that talk about a 40% availability in the domestic traffic. So things have started to really be more available. Every day, you read news about the airlines opening slowly in some countries. But again, it depends so much about the measures that the governments have taken and how things are coming back. So we -- I mean, in our volumes, okay, I could argue about a couple of days where we have seen slightly better volumes. But I really believe it's too early to really have a trend and share with you that, okay, the situation is -- we see an improvement. Too early. The volumes are still very negative. And again, we need to see how things evolve.</p><p>I mean I am -- just to elaborate a bit more on that, I am completely convinced myself, but this is my personal opinion, okay, that travel will come back, and we will all come back to our normal lives. And travel is part of that. So I am not expecting a drastic change in the sense that people will not come back to travel. But when and how, it's very difficult. If you read all kind of reports, and we try to follow that, and talking to our customers, it is clear that domestic traffic is supposed to be the first one to open. There will be some small regional traffic. And then, of course, the global one that is expected to take a bit more time.</p><p>We also see that -- again, and this is very, very, very early and difficult to extract conclusions. But from the bottom, there may be some improvement in the hotel area. So we see a small improvement in the sense of hotel bookings mainly in the U.S. But again, I mean, it changes so quickly that it's difficult to really believe that the recovery is there. What we see is not further deterioration, which is a good point. We saw the deterioration up to April and then more or less plateauing in very negative figures, very negative, but not going further. And what we see in some days where volumes could improve. But again, too early to really say that this is the recovery.</p><p>We expect a quite drastic -- not drastic but second quarter, as you see from IATA, they were expecting an 82% in the second quarter and then progressive recovery. So the second quarter should stay low. But how the speed of recovery will evolve, again, difficult to really say at this stage.</p><p>In terms of continuing with our projects, if I understood properly, well, all this situation in our case could be an opportunity because some of the companies are really thinking about the way they handle -- how they can variabilize their costs, if they need to do internally. So we see opportunities to really get into different areas of the business, both with airlines and with the rest of the travel industry. So we are debating again opportunities for our future to really prepare the company when the rebound will come, that I am convinced it will come. Again, what I am not convinced is when and how.</p><p>And in the case of Air Canada, I mean, we migrated to DCS. And again, I think you mentioned -- I don't know if I am covering your question about the second part. I didn't get exactly, Adam, what you referred to.</p><p>ADAM DENNIS WOOD: It was really just that normally, big changes in tech are quite difficult when companies are running at 100%. So in an environment where they're not busy, it could be an opportunity for them to think about more significant changes.</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: Yes. Okay. I got it. Yes. Yes. Yes. I mean, look, as I mentioned to you, I mean, we went ahead with the migration of Air Canada. We keep working with many of these customers. And our service business has not been so much impacted as the transaction business, which proves that the airlines are keen to really keep going. And again, a little bit surprisingly, I could say, we received RFPs from airports as we speak to really talk about opportunities. And you are right, some of them believe that this is the right time to really take some decisions and do some changes due to the low traffic. So the answer is yes.</p><p>But again, unfortunately, the only issue is that based on our transaction model, we don't see that now. But I believe we will see that, the impact of all this, in the future. So it's quite active, as I said, despite the situation, discussions with all kind of customers that we are having as we speak. And you are right. I mean in the case of [airports], I will say it's very active, the discussions we have with airports about changing their technology.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT, SENIOR MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Three questions, please. First, what major technology projects do you continue to fund so that you can emerge stronger on the other side of this crisis? Second, could you comment on the financial viability of your major airline customers in EMEA? And then third, do you expect the current crisis to accelerate the shift to OTA bookings versus travel management companies?</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: Okay. Let me try to start. And please, Ana, you can jump in. If we talk about big projects, and again, we are protecting some of our investments that we do. I mean, of course, we have commitments with our customers. So even if we have, in some cases, could be delayed, but the majority of the cases, I mean -- and I gave you the example of this year's with Air Canada. I mean the customer decided to go ahead and we went ahead with this project. So there are still migrations. We continue to develop our functionalities in the area of hotel because we have customer commitments. We keep moving and evolving our core technology with the objective to really move to the cloud at one point.</p><p>In the area of merchandising and NDC, again, we continue talking to customers. So I will say the activity in terms of customer commitments and delivery of projects is still there. Of course, in some cases, we have decided to really reduce part of the investment or, in some cases, the customers have requested to have some slowness in terms of the delivery of the projects. But the core of our priorities are protected and are there. Again, in some areas where we feel, okay, it's not really impacting our business, so we could delay. We are delaying, that's for sure. We are being much more strict about our priorities. But in terms of the customer commitments, we have the main investment in our core technology, we are still keeping that. Ana?</p><p>ANA DE PRO GONZALO: In terms of survival of airlines in EMEA, I would say that we've seen a reduced number of airline ceasing operations in 2020. So far, we've seen -- we saw more in 2019 than what we have seen in 2020. It's, I think, quite obvious that they are facing extreme difficulties in these days, but the major groups has managed either by issuing equity, by doing refinancing, by getting state aids and by using also all of the mechanisms that many countries have put in place in order to deal financially with COVID-19. They have reduced their cash-outs, securing that they have a liquidity position that allows them to survive while they also negotiate with the governments, whether it's going to be nationalized or aid or bailout or the different -- in different regions, you have different ways of having them.</p><p>So of course, it's difficult times for our customers, but I think that the largest groups have managed to be in a situation where they can continue operations, waiting to see how the evolution of the travel sector will be in the future. But so far, we had Flybe that ceased operations and a couple of other airlines which are either going for Chapter 11 or trying to restructure their function. And basically, most of them are talking with their governments and with their countries to see how they can continue in business in the longer run.</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: And when we talk about OTA, I mean, it's not that the OTAs have taken the business travel, the DMCs. I mean they deal with completely different segments. What is true is that if we see many of the last crisis, I mean leisure travel recovers first and before business. So this could be expected that the volumes in online travel agencies could come before we see the business travel coming back. But I believe, at one point, both of them will recover.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Julian Serafini from Jefferies.</p><p>JULIAN ALEXANDER SERAFINI, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I want to follow up on the initial question around passenger volumes. So when you raised capital last month, you were talking about a stress case of this minus 80% of volumes throughout the rest of the year. I think a lot of investors are trying to figure out what 2021 may look like. So can you share a little bit how you may be thinking about a potential recovery in 2021 in terms of volumes? Or is there some kind of internal case you're planning against potentially? I think it'd be interesting to dive into that subject.</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: I mean it's extremely difficult. As you can imagine, we develop different scenarios. What we wanted to make sure is that even if a very negative scenario that we don't believe will be there, we have the liquidity to really go through this cycle, and this is -- this has been our objective. That's why we have focused a lot on the cash of the company, and both from an outflow, okay, the money we are investing, and we are continuously being very selective about that as far as trying to really get the financing and the security that will allow us to go through this cycle.</p><p>In terms of volume, as I mentioned to you, we are developing different scenarios. Again, the minus 80% was on a stress case that hopefully will not be here, but we don't know. We don't know. That's the reality, and we wanted to be prepared for the worst scenario. So mainly, what we are doing is just develop different scenarios moving forward and trying to adapt, depending on how things will evolve. Again, that's everything we can do. Of course, we may have different opinions by different people. We try to really do our best based on our internal knowledge, based on all kind of reports that are available in the industry and try to see how things will evolve. I mentioned before, we expect domestic to really recover faster and then intra-regional and then more the global volumes. And based on that and based on the volumes, we develop, again, different scenarios as we speak. That's the only thing.</p><p>As I mentioned to you, my own belief is that this will recover and, at one point, fast. But probably, this will not be before we have a health solution, unless we find a different way of traveling and moving. And how people may react to that is extremely personal. But as I said, I really believe that that's more my personal view and by sharing and talking to people that the reality and coming back to our lives will come at one point. But again, probably we are today living in the worst point in the cycle because this is where mainly most of the countries are in a situation where traveling is not happening.</p><p>So we are mainly taking sources. As I mentioned to you, the most relevant source that will -- or is being used is the estimation of IATA because this has the aggregation of many airlines around the world, about how they see the evolution. This changes because they have to review that 3 or 4 times. So this may evolve. But again, we use that source. We also use different sources. And based on that, we are doing our projection. To be more concrete about 2021 today is difficult.</p><p>ANA DE PRO GONZALO: But maybe if you want, from the financial perspective, Julian, what we've done is prepare the company that even under the stress cases scenario that was to continue beyond 2020, as Luis has explained, we have enough liquidity, and we have also the flexibility within the company to even further ramp down our cost. So that is not just the cash situation but also the viability of the company if this situation lasts for longer. So we've kept all of the potential flexibility within our hands to further reduce our cost if required. And we have cash and liquidity available even if in a very stressed scenario goes beyond 2020 and lasts for the entire 2021.</p><p>So in that sense, what we've done is prepare for the worst and then making sure that we can adapt the necessary resources, moving -- as I think Luis has explained, we've shifted resources from longer-term projects to the ones that are producing more revenues, the services for airlines, adjusting in conversations with our customers. So trying to be agile and flexible to adapt to whatever the recovery shape looks like and whenever it starts while, at the same time, securing that we have liquidity to navigate through a stress case scenario for quite a long period of time. Which I think from the management perspective is the best that we can do because it is impossible for us to know when the recovery is going to happen and what kind of shape it's going to take. So we are prepared to navigate that and to adapt to the circumstances as they come.</p><p>JULIAN ALEXANDER SERAFINI: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, too. I think you talked earlier about the nontransactional revenue within the hospitality business and how that's obviously benefiting today. I mean is there a view that you would consider offering a nontransactional model as well in the Airline IT business potentially with either existing products or new products? Is that even on the table? Or is that not something you would consider doing?</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: I mean, of course, yes, the answer is yes, we consider our business models. I mean this business model has been one in my view of the logic and the success, of course, not in this scenario in the sense that, okay, as volume increases, you pay more, and when volume decreases, you pay less. So it's a variable cost, and it has worked pretty well. Of course, we were not thinking about this scenario. And when this happens, you may think, okay, about alternative models moving forward for part of our products.</p><p>I believe, overall, our current model is the right one because that, again, has a logic. In the hospitality industry, we have some of the revenues that are not coming from that and in this situation is helping us. So I will say, yes, we look into all the alternatives. I couldn't say we are going to change now. But of course, we may look. I mean, in some cases, we have volume commitments with different levels. So it's a way also to protect and to make sure that in very low volumes, you have some security on the revenue front. But the logic of having unit transaction is still there. So we may find a kind of combination moving forward, but we are not going to change now the business model.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from John King from Bank of America.</p><p>JOHN PETER KING, RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I've also got 2. Just, Ana, first of all, on the working capital, obviously strong performance in Q1. Could you repeat -- I think you gave some forward-looking comments about how that would evolve in the coming quarters. If you could repeat that or perhaps just comment on where working capital is expected to trend from here, that will be useful. And I guess related to that, are you considering using that -- essentially, given your relatively better capitalized position, are you considering using that to benefit your customers in any way?</p><p>And then the second question was a follow-up on the corporate travel agency market. I guess, at least from the outside, it looks a more labor-intensive, less IT-light business model that they have relative obviously to the OTAs. These periods sometimes precipitate some acceleration in some of those trends perhaps away from that model. I just wondered about your opinion as to how that TMC market may or may not evolve as and when we do get back to more normal in terms of corporate bookings.</p><p>ANA DE PRO GONZALO: Okay. So on the working capital, in the first quarter, we generated 100 -- it improved by EUR 180 million versus the previous year. And this was -- you have a net. So we were still having collections and payments from previous periods where that was positive, while we had a reduction in the revenues and expenses in the first quarter of 2020, which, of course, was negative. We did an advance payment in December 2019 of the payments that were due on January 2020. That was EUR 34 million because we are changing -- we migrated to a new version of SAP, all of our financing in many countries, and we expected that that was going to produce difficulties on the payments. So we advanced those on December, which, of course, then it worsened the working capital in 2019. But it improved the working capital in 2020.</p><p>Then we have lower advanced payments because of customers' renegotiations due to the COVID-19 situation, as you can imagine. We don't have many renegotiations with signing bonuses, et cetera. So that is lower than that. We have -- on the positive side, we have the fact that we have a lower EBITDA due to the provisions that we are accounting for. So we've been quite conservative on the bad debt and on the cancellation provisions that reduces our EBITDA, but it's no cash-out. So that improves the working capital. So that is what I have explained on the 2020 first quarter.</p><p>Now, we will expect in the second quarter of 2020 that the situation of the working capital deteriorates clearly versus the working capital of the second quarter in 2019. So we had in the second quarter of 2019 a reduction of around EUR 150 million versus the previous year. And the main reasons for the worsening that we are expecting is that we will have an increased deterioration on delays on the collection due to the COVID situation. We also expect a negative impact from the payments from previous periods because we pay our distribution fees and part of our incentives later than compared when we collect the bookings. So the first month of 2020 have been positive in terms of collections of bookings. And therefore, we still need to pay the incentives coming from those bookings that will happen in the second quarter.</p><p>At the same time, on the positive front, we will have a reduction in the expenses as -- all of the measures that we put in place for cost reductions started in March, as we saw the situation deteriorating. So they will have more full impact on the second quarter of 2020 versus the same period of 2019. But we still have some payments related to previous periods that will take place. So for example, the bonus for employees in -- of 2019, which was positive, will be paid in the second quarter of 2020. So there is a mix of positives and negatives as we try to preserve our cash as much as possible. But you should expect a worsening of the working capital versus 2019 in the second quarter and then as the cost measures imply. And then there's more alignment between the payments and receivables and collections from the deteriorated situation that the COVID-19 has created are more stabilized through the third and fourth quarter.</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: Yes. Just to complement, I mean, you mentioned with customers, of course, these are individual discussions with customers. I mean, in some cases, yes, you can get some agreements with the customers of delaying some collections in exchange or as part of the overall discussion of the situation of the customer and the overall business, okay? So that's, again, individual discussions based on the situation of the customer, the agreements that we have and the potential agreements we may have for the loan and the medium and long term with them.</p><p>With regards to the TMCs, I mean, again, look, the automation has been happening, as we speak, during many years. As you know, we invest in solutions for corporations and in working with the TMCs to provide better tools in managing their corporate travel. There has also been a consolidation during the last years. Many small TMCs have been acquired by bigger groups. So we could expect that this consolidation will continue, that the automation and the need to provide better solutions to the corporates will continue. But again, the business travel will be here and will recover at one point. And the TMCs are well positioned to really be the one serving their customers. And we will continue working with them and with the corporates to provide the right tools and the right solutions.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Stacy Pollard from JPMorgan.</p><p>STACY ELIZABETH POLLARD, HEAD OF SOFTWARE AND IT EQUITY RESEARCH, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Can you give us an idea of Hotel IT growth in the quarter? And just maybe a little bit overlapping, but you mentioned -- hello?</p><p>ANA DE PRO GONZALO: We can't hear you. It's a lot of -- yes.</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: Could you repeat again, if you don't mind, Stacy?</p><p>STACY ELIZABETH POLLARD: I'll try again. Apologies for the bad line. Can you give us an idea of Hotel IT growth? You mentioned also some license-based revenues in your business which were less impacted by COVID-19. Can you describe what that was? Is it stable going forward? And how much -- another question, sort of services revenue as a percentage of the whole, is that mostly stable? And maybe a follow-up.</p><p>ANA DE PRO GONZALO: Okay. So on the percentage of nontransactional revenues on the total of the group, if you take 2019, that was more or less around 20%. So that includes things like digital advertising. It includes some of the rail. It includes part of the hospitality, includes part of airports and, of course, the bespoke and the services of airline IT. So those are the main captions that produce revenues which are nontransaction-driven, and that in 2019 was more or less 20% of the total. And then on Hotel IT growth?</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: I mean, look, again, the growth was very strong at the beginning of the year. This business, as we have reported last year and this year, we were very pleased. Surprisingly, I mean, we didn't see any impact at the beginning, even when we saw already the volumes in Asia being impacted. But hotels has been impacted later. It has been impacted at the end. So we have finally seen that also, the bookings and the business in hotel was being impacted. It is true that part of our business model with hotels is not based on transactions. So it's more resilient. However, of course, the fact that it's not based on transaction doesn't mean that at the end, you need to renegotiate with some of the customers that -- I mean, that's why Ana mentioned we have increased our bad debt provision because the collection of these revenues are more difficult if the industry is impacted.</p><p>So it protects you partially in the sense that, yes, I mean, we have that right based on our contracts. It's not so much linked to the unit revenue. However, especially with small properties and with some of our customers, we need to really deal with a specific negotiation. So that's why, okay, from a revenue point of view, it gives us resilience. From a practical point of view, we need to deal with the specific financial situation of our customers in that front, too. But again, yes, if we talk about the performance, it was pretty strong. And okay, hopefully, it will come back at one point because we continue signing customers, having good traction, having good prospects. And of course, what we need is that our customers are able to really start getting customers and, therefore, continuing with the projects that we have with them.</p><p>STACY ELIZABETH POLLARD: A quick follow-up, if I may. How should we think about EBITDA margins? Do you think margins can impact these levels (technical difficulty) bankruptcies or pricing pressure?</p><p>ANA DE PRO GONZALO: I'm going try to answer to what I think you asked because the sound is really terrible, Stacy. So on EBITDA margins, during 2020, as the COVID situation evolves, it's difficult to predict how it is going to pan out. Of course, in the first quarter, we have negative operational leverage and so will -- most likely will happen in the second quarter of the year as well. And then it will depend on how the recovery may evolve in the third and fourth quarter. We will see how the cost-cutting measures that we are putting in place with the evolution of the revenues, plus the bad debt that Luis has explained, the cancellation provisions, et cetera, all of those metrics operate.</p><p>In the longer and midterm, of course, we will need to adapt to whatever the shape of the recovery will be. So we do believe that the recovery of the travel as a whole will take some time, which there are some reports that are pointing to that. We will adapt our cost structure to try to be able to maintain our operational leverage as it used to be. But today, I think that is too early to commit on any kind of margin evolution because it will depend on which products are coming faster, the volumes, which industry, which markets, and that is very difficult to forecast right now.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Michael Briest from UBS.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIEST, MD OF GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH GROUP &amp; HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple from me as well. So Luis, to you, I think John's question and your response there to Stacy as well alluded to sort of the strategic potential here. I mean presumably airlines are asking for lower pricing. They might consider sole-sourcing for GDS if they get a lower price. Travel agents will want higher incentive fees. Are you sort of mindful that you could pick up quite a lot of market share if you can give something back to the customers on pricing, on payment terms? And is that explicitly a strategy you're looking at today? Or is it that the crisis means that really, until there's some volumes coming back, there's no point in discussing the mights and maybes of changing the sort of incentive structures and market share patterns?</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: I mean, look, our objective to increase share with the customer is there. We also need to be, of course, quite prudent and careful about how to deal with the current situation, okay? So I mean, I cannot give you a definitive answer. It is our objective, as we said, is first, protect the company, get the capabilities and the liquidity, and this is what we are doing; be careful with the way we spend the money, of course, because it's our responsibility to really adapt to the current situation. But of course, if there are good opportunities with specific customers that are there, yes, we have constructive discussions. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the call and during this conversation, we have many ongoing discussions with many of our customers. So of course, our objective is to keep the future and, after this crisis, being stronger than we were before, knowing the difficulty that is going through this cycle.</p><p>So without being definitive, yes, of course, our objective is to get incremental share at one point from both airlines and travel agencies. And it could be, in some cases, what you mentioned, the fact that, okay, we can give them some specific conditions here or there, or the fact that they may question some of the things that we're doing if they can work with us, and we can support them. So there are different kind of customers, and we talk to them about the opportunities of working together, thinking about the medium term, believing that in the medium term, this will be there and we'll have opportunities of working together. And again, it's not exactly the same. There will -- some customers are much more thinking about the long term. Some other customers are struggling and trying to really think much more short-term, that there is a mix. And again, we are trying to combine the short-term needs of us, the short-term needs of our customers. We're thinking about how to be stronger when the recovery comes. So opportunities are there.</p><p>The answer is yes, in many fronts, but there are also risks because we need to see, okay, not to do the wrong things with customers that, in some cases, may struggle in the medium term, okay? But definitely, I mean, I am personally having a lot of conversations. And the teams, of course, are getting fully involved in how together in the industry and how the recovery will come and how we can be working with them in supporting their needs as soon as the recovery comes. Again, just to finish this long explanation, it's not the same. The airline industry, the hotel industry, how we can support the recovery when it comes is not the same, okay, because they may need -- they have different needs in terms of technology. Their priorities may evolve, and they want to focus in some specific areas as we speak. So all this is also giving us the input of how we can support our customers now and for the medium term.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIEST: Okay. And then, Ana, I think in terms of the EUR 300 million in savings, you said it was CapEx and OpEx. Can you just give us a bit more color between the split? And I think at the beginning, you said some staff were on short-term working and furlough. Maybe the number of staff and how important that is within the EUR 300 million will be helpful.</p><p>ANA DE PRO GONZALO: Okay. So we have not given you the disclosure of the savings between CapEx and OpEx because it also varies depending on how we reassign resources from projects to services, et cetera, et cetera. So there will be variations of what is CapEx and OpEx. So basically, the areas where we have taken action, I think we've tried to explain that is, on, of course, all of what is more discretionary kind of expenses. We have taken actions also on things that impact our employees like salary freeze, postponement of bonus payments, et cetera. We have put in place a program of voluntarily unpaid leaves. So we have not gone to furloughs in any country. That's why we are also saying that we do have capacity to further cut our cost if required by the situation, if the recovery takes longer to happen. So there is several measures, of course.</p><p>On the CapEx front, all of that is signing bonuses, investments needed because also the level of transaction has reduced on our data center, any kind of refurbishment or buildings or property, plant and equipment, all of that has been canceled. So the CapEx on that -- on those areas will also be reduced. The part that varies between OpEx and CapEx is on the capitalized R&amp;D. And there, basically, we are, as we speak with our customers, reassigning resources from one project to other projects. Some have a higher ratio of capitalization. Some have a lower ratio. And that's why it's more difficult for me to tell you. So we can tell you the gross amount. That's the EUR 300 million. And then the split between what will be CapEx and OpEx, we will see as the reassignment of resources takes place over the year.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Iv\u00c3\u00b3n Leal from BBVA.</p><p>IV\u00c3\u00b3N LEAL, CHIEF ANALYST, BBVA CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just for me, there's follow-up questions on -- the first one, Ana, on -- while you just were mentioning the EUR 300 million savings, just to be clear, nothing of that has flowed in the first quarter results, okay? Because obviously, I mean, CapEx is down EUR 50 million. So I don't know to what extent we should assume some of those EUR 300 million savings are already in the first quarter.</p><p>And the second one, you said we have ability to further cut costs if the situation of the recovery delays. What is the base case? I mean we have to assume that those EUR 300 million will be achieved in a base case where GDA is basically is falling by 50% year-on-year. Is that the base case?</p><p>And the second one, again, on the relation with the airlines. I mean we should assume that average booking fees should be revised now for some airlines. Is that what you were referring when managing your relation with your clients? I mean I guess some of them are struggling, and I don't know if actually they've already put on the table reviewing the average booking fee for going forward.</p><p>ANA DE PRO GONZALO: Yes. Okay. Let me see if I -- Iv\u00c3\u00b3n, if I can try to reply to all of the questions. Okay. On the savings, clearly, in the first quarter, there is part that has entered. That's why I was explaining that if you take our expenses prior to capitalizations and prior to ForEx, they were declining at 1.3%. So that's part of the consequence of having these plans put in place. But of course, the plans have started as the quarter was progressing. And therefore, they don't have yet full impact on the first quarter. So it will be taking more impact on the second and third quarter as we progress on the implementation.</p><p>So for example, we have reduced the number of third-party providers, of contractors. Some of them have clauses of prenotice, warnings, et cetera. So you cannot cancel all of them in one go. We are still in the first quarter having the impact of the increase in personnel and number of employees and salary review of 2019. As we have freezed the salary, that will start to have an impact from -- starting on the second quarter. So the savings will gradually ramp up throughout the year 2020 as the measures can be put in place.</p><p>In terms of additional measures, whenever we take them, we will promptly communicate them. Of course, part of those measures would theoretically impact our employees. So we need to talk on that, and we will communicate on those in due course. So for the time being, we believe that with the program that we have in place, we can cope with the actual situation. And as we see the situation evolving, we will come back to you, and we will, of course, inform you on the situation.</p><p>And now taking into account the pricing, not so much pressure on pricing because you need to bear in mind that our costs are variable. So the moment that volumes were declining, our bill to our customers were declining as well. So that's reducing the pricing right now doesn't match. And then if the recovery is gradual with volumes, but not only with volumes but also, as Luis was explaining, probably domestic recovering faster than international, that's also already implied in our pricing strategy because, if you remember, our local booking fee is lower compared to our global booking fee. So that's part -- that pricing strategy is already embedded in the actual kind of contracts that we have on the distribution part.</p><p>And then the volumes will also be impacting on the part of Airline IT. So I think that it's more the strategy of having a variable cost versus a fixed cost that probably give us more opportunities than threats in the sense that there are not so many costs that disappear on your P&amp;L when things go down, and our structure, precisely being transaction-driven, is already given back. So that's how we are supporting our customers most, by reducing the total overall amount because there is no transactions related to that.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the end of the results call. I now give back the word to Mr. Luis Maroto for the final remarks. Thank you.</p><p>LUIS MAROTO CAMINO: Well, thank you very much again for your attention. It is a difficult situation for everyone, but I am convinced we will go through it. And I would like to thank you for your support and confidence in Amadeus.

I'm the moderator for this conference. Welcome to the Bharti Airtel Limited First Quarter ended June 30th 2019 Earnings Call (Operator Instructions) Present with us on the call today is the senior leadership team of Bharti Airtel Limited.</p><p>Before I hand over the call, I must remind you that the overview and discussions today may include certain forward-looking statements that must be viewed in conjunction with the risks that we face.</p><p>I now hand over the call to our first speaker of the day, Mr. Badal Bagri. Thank you, and over to you, Mr. Bagri.</p><p>BADAL BAGRI, CFO, BHARTI AIRTEL LIMITED: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today for this earnings call to discuss our results for the first quarter ended 30th June 2019, which we announced yesterday.</p><p>Present with me on the call is today are Gopal, Nakul and Komal.</p><p>Before we proceed further into the call, I wanted to highlight that as you would be aware Airtel Africa has been admitted to the premium listing segment of the London Stock Exchange, along with the parallel admission on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Consequent to the dual listing, Airtel Africa has now assumed an independent status having its own empowered Board and management, which will be responsible to its shareholders for the performance and the governance of the company. While Airtel Africa continues to remain a subsidiary for Bharti Airtel Limited, henceforth, our earnings call will be limited to India and South Asia. Airtel Africa will conduct its own earnings call for the benefit of its investors as was done this time. The transcript of the same is available on the website, airtel.africa.com.</p><p>As you are aware, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified the leasing standard Ind AS 116, which replaces the existing standard Ind AS 17. Ind AS 116 is applicable to all companies with effect from 1st of April 2019, and our financial statement have been prepared in accordance with the same.</p><p>Under the earlier standard, operating leases were treated as expenses, whereas under Ind AS 116, all long-term leases, whether operating or finance, are required to be recorded in the balance sheet. Thus, our leasing agreements with network sites -- for network sites, bandwidth, transponders, offices, retail stores, et cetera, which were being expensed until the last quarter will now be capitalized resulting in depreciation cost and interest expense on the lease liability. This has impacted our margins and key financial ratios and therefore, they are not comparable to prior periods. However, in line with our standards of highest corporate governance, we have also provided a pro forma on the underlying financials.</p><p>Another key reporting change implemented this quarter is our DTH segment. Subsequent to the implementation of the new tariff order, the services -- service providers are responsible largely for retransmission and not in a position to control the pricing of the content being distributed. Recording only the margin earned from the broadcasters for distribution of the content is considered as revenue.</p><p>Moving on to business and performance. Let's talk about our wireless business first. The broader industry, having now consolidated to 3 large players, continues to see some semblance of stability. Continuing on the 4.3% sequential growth that we witnessed last quarter, this quarter, mobile revenues grew by 2.2%, led by our focus on quality customers, prudent tariff tweaks and up trading on account of Airtel Thanks. While we have witnessed revenue growth despite any outright tariff increase, we continue to believe that prices need to move up in the long term to ensure industry viability. You will recollect that last quarter, mobile margins benefited from certain one-offs and the underlying margins were close to 22%. Underlying EBITDA margin for the mobile segment stood at 23.2% for this quarter.</p><p>Our 4G base continues to grow, and we added almost 8.4 million customers during the quarter. With this now, we have 120 million data customers of which more than 95 million are on 4G. We do believe that this 4G handset penetration still has a significant headroom to grow and therefore, for the foreseeable future, India will be largely a 4G market. However, the pace of handset adoption has remained stagnant rather slowed down in the last few quarters due to high prices of the handset and adverse currency fluctuations impacting the cost, we are hopeful that the pace of 4G adoption will accelerate, and this mix change will be a positive catalyst for us.</p><p>Our focus on quality customers is also evident from the best-in-class operational parameter. Our ARPU are now at INR 129, with our customer base as 99% plus, and the monthly average data usage of data from the customer base is at 11.7 GB per month. Within mobile posted businesses, we also witnessed a strong performance on the back of simplified pricing architecture, our strong brand, network and the trust that customers place on us.</p><p>In order to cater to the -- this quality customer base, we are continuously realigning our strategy to win decisively in the market and be a truly differentiated player. An average Indian smartphone customer is spending approximately 4 hours on their smartphones, and devices are moving away from being pure connectivity to lifestyle. Hence, there is a need to offer something more to these customers. Airtel Thanks, our biggest initiative, allows us to be the tether of this digital lifestyle of our consumers.</p><p>While originally Airtel Thanks was launched in August 2018, it was revamped this quarter to add more value to our customers and provide a differentiated experience using technology, data and partnership. We further increased the gamut of our initiatives to include innovative offerings such as insurance, online courses from leading global academies while expanding the scope to include home broadband customers as well. With more than 140 million customers under the program and diverse customer benefits available at each tier, the program affords an ability for customers to move up the value chain, and we are beginning to see some early signs of this upgrading. All of these customer interventions need strong networks, and I'm delighted to add that we continued our quest for network excellence this quarter as well.</p><p>Talking of some noteworthy developments. We added more than 26,000 mobile broad-based band-based stations. Alongside network expansion, we also further added capacities across the network through additional sectorization and Massive MIMOs. Our VoLTE adoption of 4G smartphone continues to grow, and a very significant portion of smartphone traffic now runs on VoLTE. In line with ramping up our 4G network, we completed reforming of our 900 megahertz sector to 4G in all the 10 circles where it is liberalized. This has improved indoor coverage for our 4G customers.</p><p>Airtel became the first operator in India to shutdown 3G network layer in Kolkata. This is one of the starting points for us, the learnings from which would be used for shutdown of 3G networks in other circles. This makes the network simpler, besides ensuring better coverage and capacity for 4G customers. With the excellent network deployment, such an upgrade has been realized through software upgrades on loan, implying minimal additional investment. To cater to the exponential traffic growth, we further expanded our fiber footprint to more than 2 lakh 80,000 route kilometers with most of the sites either single hub or 2 hubs from the fiber port.</p><p>We continue to work with partners like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon for deeper and distributed content caching. This has helped us to serve our customers with significantly lower latency, helping them to have lower buffering, better gaming experience and faster transactions. Airtel has been the first operator across the globe to commercialize Google EPC, which will further help in hosting content and latency-sensitive applications at the edge, translating into superior customer experience. Our efforts have shown results. As per Ookla, Airtel has the best download speed in 16 out of 20 circles, with latency being lowest in 12 out of 20 networks compared to all other networks in May 2019.</p><p>Talking briefly about the other businesses. Continuing on the positive momentum of last quarter, homes business continues to see positive revenue momentum. Our investments in FTTH post deployment are now reaping benefits with an expansion in the base and an increase in ARPU after 10 consecutive quarters of decline. We continue to be optimistic on the overall market opportunity and focus on expansion of our fiber presence and efforts to offer superior propositions to our customers. The customer base stood at 2.34 million as at the end of 30th June 2019.</p><p>Digital TV services business continues to grow on the back of a strong customer additions and increasing upgrades to premium plans. This quarter, we added 634,000 customers, almost double of our usual run rate. The total base now stands a little over 16 million as at the end of June '19. Due to the change in reporting mechanisms as mentioned earlier, the first quarter '20 numbers are not comparable with prior periods. On an underlying basis, the business saw a 9.3% quarter-over-quarter growth in earnings.</p><p>Airtel business after marginal degrowth last quarter has reported revenues of INR 32 billion, which is a 6.8% sequential growth. Net revenues grew profit at 7.3%, sequentially. The business continues to grow, led by the demand for connectivity and solutions across the spectrum. Overall, trends in the other lines of business remain intact.</p><p>Moving on quickly to other noteworthy areas and significant events for this quarter. As mentioned previously, Airtel Africa completed its IPO this quarter. The issue received strong response from mainly high-quality investors from around the world. Airtel Africa is now the first telecom company to simultaneously list on the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange and Nigerian Stock Exchange through an IPO. Following completion of the offer, Airtel Africa is also expecting to be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE U.K. indices besides the Nigerian indices.</p><p>Moving on to M&amp;A. Following the TDSAT's order directing the DOT to take the merger on record and approval of the schemes of arrangement by Delhi and Mumbai bench of NCLT, the scheme of arrangements of the merger of Airtel with consumer mobile business of Tata has become effective from July 1st 2019. Consequently, all customer's assets, spectrum and agreed liabilities of these businesses stand merged with Airtel effective July 1st 2019. Airtel and Hughes Communications have entered into an agreement to combine their VSAT operations in India. The combined entity will benefit from the enhanced scale, improved operational efficiencies and wider market reach.</p><p>Moving on to our consolidated financials. Consolidated revenues for the quarter stood at $207 billion, up 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% on a comparable basis. Growth continues to be broad-based, all segments across India and Africa. Consolidated EBITDA of INR 85 billion during the quarter increased by 24.2% compared to INR 68 billion in the corresponding quarter last year. EBITDA margins for the quarter was at 41% as compared to 34.5% in the corresponding quarter last year. Adjusting for the Ind AS 116 impact, EBITDA for the quarter stood at $69 billion, up 1.5% year-over-year, and the consequent EBITDA margin is at 33.7 percentage points.</p><p>Depreciation and amortization expenses were at INR 68 billion versus INR 51 billion in the corresponding quarter last year, up 31.4% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of Ind AS 116 and sustained CapEx spent aimed at enhancing our 4G capacity. Net finance cost for the quarter was at INR 32 billion, higher by INR 11 billion as compared to the corresponding quarter last year. Increase is largely on account of reporting changes and higher interest on borrowings and derivative and forex losses. The resultant loss before tax exceptional and exceptional items for the quarter ended 30th June 2019 was INR 15 billion as compared to the loss of INR 3 billion in the corresponding quarter last year.</p><p>The company recognized a net exceptional loss of the INR 14 billion during the quarter, mainly on account of derivative liabilities pertaining to customary indemnities provided to a class of investors of Airtel Africa Plc, and expenses relating to its listing besides charges on account of accelerated depreciation of 3G equipment and certain other items. Net loss post exceptional items came at INR 28.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was at INR 50 billion as compared to INR 82 billion in the corresponding quarter last year.</p><p>Consolidated net debt of the company stood at INR 1,166 billion, primarily on account of increase in lease liabilities in line with Ind AS 116. On a comparable basis, consolidated net debt was INR 920 billion. The sequential decline resulted from the repayment of debt from the rights issue proceeds. The proceeds from the Africa IPO were realized in July and therefore, you will see the impact of the net debt reduction from these proceeds in second quarter of the financial year. The finance these obligation added on account of adoption of Ind AS 116 is INR 240 billion.</p><p>To sum up, the telecom industry in India continues to witness a huge expansion in data and voice. Our nonmobile business continues to expand at a healthy rate, and Africa remains on its profitable growth journey. With our superior investments, quality customer base, strong brand and innovative product portfolio, we are well poised for future growth.</p><p>With that, I hand over -- hand you over to the moderator.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Sachin Salgaonkar from Bank of America, Mumbai.</p><p>SACHIN SHRIKANT SALGAONKAR, DIRECTOR, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations for the good set of numbers. I have 2 questions. First question, in the last couple of quarters, we did see a mix bit change between your subscribers and ARPU, where the subscriber numbers were reducing and the ARPU was improving. Now with most of this entire low-end subscriber rationalization behind us, the question is could we see that trend continuing? I.e., ARPU continues to inch up and your subscriber number, more or less, grows at a relatively slower pace? So that's first question.</p><p>Second question, just wanted to understand EBITDA margin improvement levers for cellular business going forward. I understand there could be a bit of pressure on IUC in net revenue going down and perhaps a bit from Tata consolidation. But what are some positive levers we are seeing actually?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL, MD, CEO OF INDIA &amp; SOUTH ASIA AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, BHARTI AIRTEL LIMITED: Sachin, this is Gopal. Yes, we did see last quarter, which is quarter 4, an erosion of about 45 million customers and consequent bump up in ARPU. That is kind of bottomed out now. So we saw an erosion of about 1.5 million customers, INR 4 increase in ARPU. I would say that the -- as far as minimum recharge plans are concerned, whatever had to be done is now done. The intrinsic movement or improvement in ARPU will now be a function of upgrading from 2G to 4G, and our program on Airtel Thanks, which will drive some upgrading. Having said that, we are entering into a seasonal quarter, as you know. If you look back over the last few years, you'll always find quarter 2 is a seasonal dip in -- over time.</p><p>As far as the EBITDA margin is concerned, levers continue to be our -- I think the biggest lever will be revenue growth, clearly. At the same time, we are driving a strong program on water and waste, and we'll continue to do whatever it takes on -- all of the up cost items that we can look at to try and see what we can get to get efficiency out of it.</p><p>SACHIN SHRIKANT SALGAONKAR: Okay, Gopal. We do see in there clearly, your revenue appears to have bottomed out. But can we say the same thing about EBITDA that EBITDA has also bottomed out?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: I think the incremental revenue that we have generated over this quarter as well as the last quarter pretty much flowed through into EBITDA to the extent of, I would say, probably about 60-odd percent. Once you adjust for the one-off that Badal spoke about, if you recall, we had said that there's a INR 200-crore one-off in the last quarter, which, once you adjust for all of that, you'll see a flow-through EBITDA. So yes, as the revenue grows, our effort is to try and see how we can keep up cost lower than the growth of revenue.</p><p>SACHIN SHRIKANT SALGAONKAR: Got it. And one small follow-up. Do we see any residual CapEx given the fact that traffic on your network continues to rise steadily?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: No. I think this is what Badal referred in his opening comments to the fact that we are in the process of shutting down our 3G networks. We have experimented quite boldly in Calcutta to really shut off the 3G network altogether, refound the 900 megahertz, which is adding on 3G on LTE. That worked very well for us. That's given us a lot of confidence. We now have a plan to pretty much shut the 3G networks across the country by December. So you will see a lot of action in this quarter. Don't forget that we have anywhere between 10 and 15 megahertz of 2,100 band spectrum in most circles. It's a very, very good mid-band spectrum. And once you are able to get 10-megahertz going, and that see-through capacity for a period of time. So our CapEx will continue to look at deployments of new sites wherever it's required in a very smart and clever way. And the second part of the CapEx will continue to be some loading on the 2,300 band because 1,800 band is pretty much deployed all across the country.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Mr. Parag Gupta. Mumbai.</p><p>PARAG GUPTA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So Gopal, I just had 2 questions. Firstly, when I look at the 4G subscriber base across the country, I guess the focus of every telco, obviously, is to drive that part of the bucket. Just wanted to understand, based on your own 4G subscriber base, I wanted to get some understanding of how the trends are out there, primarily with respect to all of these subscribers using Airtel as a primary SIM bulk of the time for the data usage? And how do you see that trending? Like do you see people increasing data usage over a period of time from another network to yours? Or do you see that relatively consistent trend? So just trying to understand your SIM versus your competitors SIM.</p><p>And the second question I had was on Airtel Thanks. All these apps that you're now providing and including, the music app of Wynk. Could you give us some sense of what kind of usage patterns are you seeing out there? Are you seeing higher engagement times? What's the daily active user base? And how do you see that trending, which is giving you some confidence that this could lead to our ARPU upgradation over a period of time?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: So on the 4G base, we have about 95 million customers, which is what we reported in quarter 1. That's a growth of about 9 million customers. When we report this customer base, by and large, most of these customers have the 4G slot on the primary SIM because one of the things that you find on devices in India is that most devices operate -- have a data bearer only the first SIM slot. So if you're on the second SIM slot, you can fundamentally use only voice. Now when a customer buys a bundle of, let's say, INR 160, INR 170 with lots of data, chances are that he will put it on the primary slot, and that's exactly what we're seeing.</p><p>So to the second question, which is on the shifts between us and competition, that's difficult to say. I think our focus is to see what can we do to grow market share. We've had, I would say, probably 4 quarters of kind of steady market share. This quarter, our expectation is that we would pick up some market share, which will be satisfactory from our perspective given the competitive context. On Airtel Thanks, Wynk Music has done exceedingly well in this quarter. We launched the feature of actually setting a ring tone through the music app, which has actually gone very well, and that is, in a way, creating a lot of stickiness for our service. We -- I can give you a quick sense of our monthly active users. We have breached the 30 million mark. But if you take a slightly, maybe a definition of 90-day users, then that gets to a much higher number, but the monthly active user is about a 30 million mark. Airtel TV is, again, similar. And between these 2 apps, we have a base of almost 50 million customers engaged on a monthly basis. We've set up a platform at the back, I think, I referred to it some time ago, called Customer 360, which is really looking at the intelligence by plotting the usage and the understanding of this customer all through this platform of Customer 360, which is helping us to drive greater engagement and greater stickiness.</p><p>PARAG GUPTA: And Gopal, with what you're providing in Airtel Thanks today, do you think that this can keep getting richer at the same price points? Or do you think this is good enough for the prices that are currently being offered?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: I think our effort is always to raise ARPU. We do believe that the pricing today, and we've mentioned -- we made this clear over many, many quarters now. So the pricing levels in India are unsustainably low. It's -- you get, for 45 gigs of data, unlimited calling for about INR 150, which is clearly very, very low. That needs to rise. But that is a function of the competitive dynamic in the market. So yes, we will keep adding value. But we will try and clear this up so that we throw in more value as people upgrade. As we are doing this, we're also getting increasing confidence that we could also use Airtel Thanks in a way to drive other streams of revenue, such as carrier billing and perhaps some early signs of -- that is early, early ways to monetize this through advertising. But that is something that we are assessing right now. As of now, our effort will be to try and upgrade.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Mr. GV Giri from IIFL Capital, Mumbai.</p><p>G. V. GIRI, VP OF TELECOM, IIFL RESEARCH: This is a question on the derivative loss. You have some agreements with the pre-IPO investors in Africa. I just wanted to know how long does this work? Then is there a limit on the total exposure on this? And since you paid in cash terms also, is the protection correspondingly reduced? And is it dependent on the stock price? And since in July, the Airtel Africa stock has fallen a little bit more from the June closing level. Will there be another hit in 2Q? Those are my questions.</p><p>NAKUL SEHGAL, CORPORATE CFO, BHARTI AIRTEL LIMITED: GV Giri, I'll answer this question. This is Nakul. Just to give you bit brief of -- from what Badal had actually alluded to. So just to give you a background, a clutch of investors in Airtel Africa and a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel actually had entered into an agreement for investor protection. This protection is really a pursuant to customary indemnities and warranties, which is pertaining to their investment in equity shares of Airtel Africa. The arrangement to settle that you see in this quarter was part of the process to facilitate Airtel Africa's admission to the premium listing of the London Stock Exchange. And in this quarter, as you rightly pointed out, the expected charge that you see is pursuant to this derivative liabilities along with other listing expenses, which have been transparently recorded as an exceptional item in this quarter. These liabilities, you will note, are quite customary in nature because such protections are given to investors to give them comfort and which can only be crystallized as when the event occurs, which in this case, is obviously the IPO. And since the IPO has happened, some of it has been crystallized, and a large part of it is already being paid out. Some of the big items that you see is, of course, pertaining to tax demand, which includes Tanzania litigation that you would have heard out, the IPO obligations and some minority adjustments, which are now being crystallized and resolved by way of an arrangement is already recorded in the books. I hope that answers your question.</p><p>G. V. GIRI: So my question is, I think, in June end the stock closed at $0.80, and now it's $0.69 as of today. So is that movement going to trigger another payout? That was the main question.</p><p>NAKUL SEHGAL: So the amount that we've recorded is actually based on a derivative liability or a derivative financial instrument, which is based on a balance sheet date of 30th of June. And that's the best estimate of the liability that we've recorded for now.</p><p>G. V. GIRI: Yes. But if the stock moves down, is there going to be more payout in the future. So how should we even forecast this? Or is there a limit beyond which there won't be a payout?</p><p>NAKUL SEHGAL: Quite honestly, these derivative instruments run on complex pricing models, and we've used a complex pricing model to determine the amount of liability that we should record and based on which a payout has already happened as of date.</p><p>G. V. GIRI: Yes. But my question is on the future payout. I'm not really asking you for an estimate of the amount. I just want to know if the stock falls, will there be more payouts?</p><p>NAKUL SEHGAL: It's -- honestly, it's very hard to speculate and give you an amount of what is going to be the future payout. But what we've recorded is what has transparently been disclosed.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Mr. Ravi Menon from Elara Securities, Mumbai.</p><p>RAVI MENON, VP OF IT SERVICES &amp; INTERNET AND ANALYST, ELARA SECURITIES (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a good set of numbers. My first question is how many of the 140 million customers that are so worked out by Airtel Thanks have taken advantage of at least one of the offers of the program?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: And what's your second question?</p><p>RAVI MENON: The second is how long do you think it will take to completely shut down 3G. So you said December, you had covered most of the country, and what would be the likely coverage from that? And how much of the lease obligations should we say relates to 3G?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: On Airtel Thanks, we don't quite report how many customers have taken any one service. But I would say that, we have -- all of these customers on Airtel Thanks, some of them are not digitally -- most of the benefits on Airtel Thanks just -- let me just pull back. All the benefits in Airtel Thanks are delivered through a digital layer. So to that extent, it's not that 100% of them have taken it, but a very large portion have taken it. And many of them have taken actually 2 services.</p><p>On the 3G question, we are, like I said, I think, this quarter, we shut down Calcutta. We will, by September, I think, there will be another 6 or 7 circle that will get shut down. And between December and March, pretty much, the entire 3G network should be shut down.</p><p>RAVI MENON: And how much cost savings do you expect from the 3G shutdown?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: How much what?</p><p>BADAL BAGRI: Cost savings.</p><p>RAVI MENON: The cost savings?</p><p>BADAL BAGRI: Cost savings. So Ravi, the cost savings won't be enough because most of the places -- we had already migrated to SRAN. So we'll be using the same equipment to deliver 4G. So there won't be significant cost saving from a network perspective, except for the AMC and other benefit. AMC and the managed services is where we'll have some benefit.</p><p>RAVI MENON: All right. Great. So I guess there will be really no changes in lease obligations as well. Right.</p><p>BADAL BAGRI: No. Lease obligations will not have any changes. There will be marginal impact on managed services and EMCs, but they will be not large.</p><p>RAVI MENON: And one last question, if I may. You seem to have done far better compared to Vodafone Idea in terms of how you maintain your 2G subscriber base from -- through this chart. What do you think you would attribute that to? Is it because you think you have now more published coverage compared to them or better quality network? What would you say is the main reason?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: I can't speculate on what comparing ourselves to our competition. I think what we would see is that the factors that we've still lost 1.5 million customers and our effort will be how do we sort of make sure that we don't lose customers. Secondly, I think the second thing that our obsession is to see how do we get really active customers. Our VLR percentages are close to 99.6%, so our active customers are very, very strong, which means anybody who is engaged in our network is actually giving us revenue, and that's important for us.</p><p>And the third part, which is really our focus, whether it's 2G or 4G is, really how do we upgrade our customers. We're happy to lose customers who won't -- don't pay us money, which is why we did the minimum ARPU plan. And from here onwards, really how do we upgrade these customers and drive greater ARPU. I think that's really the focus. And the entire system is really geared towards looking at about 670 districts at a district level. We've identified around 244 districts that are really the most critical districts for us where the bulk of industries. Those are districts where we put a significant amount of resource, the right investment, the metrics attract at that level. So those are the parts about execution, which I think we take very seriously as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Mr. Rajiv Sharma from SBICAP Securities, Mumbai.</p><p>RAJIV SHARMA, CO-HEAD OF INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH, SBICAP SECURITIES LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a couple of questions from my side. So firstly, Gopal, we still continue to lose subscribers. Is it all related to the low-end subs, which is, which could be related to Jio Phone or weak churning because they're not paying us, or there is some movement in the high end as well?</p><p>Secondly, Jio is not offering any kind of postpaid or they don't seem to be very serious about postpaid today. Vodafone and Idea are struggling. Do you think next 2 to 3 quarters, with your Airtel Thanks, with your investments in network, we could see some spike in your postpaid additions and ARPU improvement following that?</p><p>Lastly, I just want to understand, what -- how many services like, you said, 2 services people have taken in this Airtel Thanks. How many services one will have to take for your ARPUs to improve? And currently, how much of this Airtel Thanks subscribers have resulted in ARPU improvement? Because I'm also trying to understand there are a lot of these wallets like Paytm and PhonePe, which are giving a lot of cashback and similar discount. So how do you differentiate among them? That's it.</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: So I think just to step back, when we did the minimum ARPU plans, before we did that, I think we had 320 million customers -- or was it -- 332 million customers, and our estimate was that we would have probably have lost, which is what we had kind of indicated at that time, about 65 million to 70 million customers. So to that extent, I think we have been surprised -- pleasantly surprised that we have not lost as many, and we have kind of held it now at about 281. From here on, our foot will be to try and see how do we not lose any customer and continue to see some growth. But it will be modest growth given the -- what's happening in the marketplace.</p><p>Postpaid, you're right, is an opportunity. And we have we rearchitected the pricing on postpaid. Historically, our -- going back in time over the last decade, the acquisition pricing was always lower than pricing for existing customers, which led to an arbitrage. And given the significant premium that postpaid has over prepaid, we have rearchitected pricing to fit in line with existing customers, which has led to no further downgrades. And this is the reason that you're seeing an ARPU upside. Secondly, the acquisition continues to remain as it was and is also giving us an ARPU upside on the acquisition.</p><p>Our third focus on postpaid is to see how do we actually give a better service and better experience. A lot of focus on the network to try and make sure the network quality is better, making sure that we are sort of wiring up and getting the big resident welfare associations, the big tech parks. We identified 10,000 to 12,000 buildings, over 4,000, 5,000 tech parks across the country or when I say tech parks, it's office, complexes, which are all really focused on to actually give a better network experience.</p><p>And finally, we are looking at how do we segment on our postpaid offer to deliver better value, whether it's in content, whether it's in terms of experience, no waiting at the call center, no waiting at the store and so on and so forth. So those are the reasons that we think that the postpaid business is holding up. We're not happy with the way our postpaid is. It should be much bigger. In fact, if you compare a market like Brazil, for example, you'll find postpaid is about 60%, 65% of revenues. Philippines, which is not much richer than India, is about 40%, 45%. So India should be much bigger in postpaid, and the only reason this has not yet happened is because prepaid is so underpriced when compared to postpaid.</p><p>BADAL BAGRI: I think that was -- the question was how many services one has to take to put ARPU at (inaudible).</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: No. I don't think we look at it is how many services we have to take. I think that if you look at, for example -- just to give you an example, if you look at the gold tier, where you have to spend about INR 200 or more. Then what you get access to is a lot of exclusive content through a partnership with Zee5. We also give you exclusive content on English through our partnership with HOOQ and so on. So that, in itself, is a reason to upgrade. We're also trying to look at what can we do to find more hooks to upgrade. Airtel Thanks will see a very big refresh in the next 3 to 4 months as we put those hooks in place. I don't want to talk a little bit about it because it's premature, but we're putting some very strong hooks to try and get upgrades going in the next 3 to 4 months.</p><p>RAJIV SHARMA: And as I talked about Paytm, PhonePe, so how do you differentiate with them apart from your content bundling?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: I don't think we are looking to differentiate with them. As far as, we are concerned we see them as a channel. There also distribute our recharges. They are just a wallet. In the case of Paytm, it's a wallet, or in the case of PhonePe, it's just a kind of a UPI platform, which the app sits on top of the UPI platform with an underlying bank account. So we don't see that as a competition. Think of it as a storefront. You go to that retail shop and actually recharge. You recharge on PhonePe. You might recharge on Flipkart. You might recharge on Amazon or in Paytm. These are kind of storefronters, as we see it. Some of them are wallets, but they're kind of masquerading as storefronts, which is fine. For us, we want to partner with everybody to make sure that we are getting recharges and payments through all of those. We are also focused on driving recharges and payments through our own properties, which is our own website as well as our own app, Airtel Thanks, and that is also growing smartly. By the way, when we get incremental business coming from these online platforms, you do see a reduction in cost because there is a lower channel commission online, then happens off-line because it's a distribution infrastructure with the distributor and a retailer and so on.</p><p>RAJIV SHARMA: So it will be fair to say that every quarter, INR 3 to INR 4 of ARPU at least could improve for the next 3 to 4 quarters?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: Well, I can't give you a guidance on that. So what I can tell you is that we've entered into a seasonal quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Mr. Kunal Vora from BNP Paribas, Mumbai.</p><p>KUNAL VORA, ANALYST, BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: First one is you mentioned seasonal quarter like with large portion of revenue now coming from customers on bundled plans, should we still expect the seasonal weakness in second quarter? Or it's a lead by general consumer spending slowdown? Second is can you share -- sorry. Okay, you can just go ahead.</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: Yes. It's a good question that you asked because, I mean, that is the same question that we've been asking ourselves. But we still have a very large number of customers who are outside of bundled plans. So therefore -- and also, I think what happens is that when we look at the purchase pattern, it's not necessary that every customer buys a bundle every month. We have a metric, which we track internally to look at the continuity of the bundle purchases on a monthly basis. And that number is certainly not 100%. It's lower by at least 10% to 15%. And therefore, the question is what do customers do, and I think they kind of balance their budget, so sometimes they'll buy a bundle, sometimes they might buy a basic plan. So that kind of thing happens, and that's something that we see.</p><p>KUNAL VORA: Sure, sure. So you are like -- are you indicating that the growth has like slowed down compared to the last quarter? Or are you indicating that the second leg, we should all be expecting the kind of growth that you see in this quarter?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: I'm not indicating anything. I'm just telling you that we've entered a seasonal quarter.</p><p>KUNAL VORA: Okay. Second question, can you share your longer-term plans for the Digital TV business? Can we see further consolidation in the industry and whether you're willing to commit more capital to the business?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: That business is self-funding. It -- we're committing as much capital as that business needs. It's a good, neat little business, which is growing very well, and after the recent changes in the regulatory framework, I think we've been able to pick up almost 630,000 customers net additions in last quarter, which is a very, very big increase, a lot of it coming from the cable side. So we are pleased with how that business has progressed. One of the things we are looking at is to bring in a box, which will kind of offer a full-converged entertainment as well as the capacity to deliver broadband. This will happen soon, and we're already excited that once we do that, then it's a full-converged play that we can potentially deliver across multiple space. There have been some concerns about cord cutting in the urban areas and metros. We haven't seen any evidence of that yet.</p><p>KUNAL VORA: I wanted to check really what's executing on the -- like on any plans for acquisition? Would you be willing to be a competitor in the market? There have been talks that DishTV is looking regarding Airtel-DishTV building. So just want to check on that.</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: Yes. I think those are newspaper reports, so that is something that we can't comment on.</p><p>KUNAL VORA: Sure. And lastly, just on the status of litigations that are like [global] litigations, the point of interconnect like Jio and license fees and excess spectrum charges, what's the status? And when do you see resolutions and whether you see any risk of payments.</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: The cases is in court. The hearings have been concluded. The order now is reserved. So as soon as the orders come, we'll know. And that's the -- we're talking about the AGR case.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Mr. Sanjay Chawla from JM Financial, Mumbai.</p><p>SANJAY CHAWLA, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, JM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is on your enterprise -- sorry on the CapEx front. What sort of a CapEx we should expect ex Africa and particularly in India mobile? Is INR 50 billion going to be the run rate or we see a pickup going ahead in the third and fourth's quarter? That is the first question. And second question, Gopal, just a question on the -- there's obviously a lot of talk of price hike happening in the future, which will happen. But on the construct of price hike over the long term, from an industry point of view, customers are already getting 1, 1.5 GB per day for INR 122 a month. So my question is how difficult do you think it's going to be to get subscribers to shift to, let's say, more data for more higher amounts? Or do you think we'll also have to do, basically, cut down -- basically get them to on a less for same kind of a platform where you have to cut the data allowance at INR 122 price point to get some of those guys to move up. So just wanted your thoughts on the construct of price hikes that you see over the long term.</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: On the CapEx front, we have stopped giving guidance as we mentioned in the beginning of the quarter. But we also did indicate that this is going to be a lower CapEx year than last year. Typically, we see a higher upfront CapEx the first half of the year, it tends to be higher than the second half. But by and large, the CapEx will be moderated compared to last year. So that is the first point. On the second point, I think -- I mean I'll answer the question in theory and probably then in practice. In theory, in a market like India, which is so stratified and where people -- there are the rich, the middle as well as the poor. And I'm probably oversimplifying. There are people who can easily pay INR 1,000 for a mobile telephony. And at the same time, there are people who probably can't pay you more than INR 50 to INR 70 for mobile telephony. So the problem with pricing at INR 120 for everything is that the one with the INR 1,000 will crash down there. And so somebody who is at INR 50 is not necessarily going to up to INR 120. So I think that from a theoretical perspective, the architecture on pricing must be such that it invites upgrading, which is your point about what you called it, which is less for more or more for more whatever phrase that you used. So that's the way the theory should work.</p><p>Having said that, we are where we are. We are at a situation where for INR 130, you get everything. And here, I would imagine that the elasticity, if given the amount of data that's getting consumed on the network, 11.9 GB, as Badal mentioned, people spending 4 hours a day on the mobile device. Lifting this by INR 20, INR 30, INR 40 is something that can easily be done. That said, like I said, this is a competitive situation. We're not expecting any pricing to move up. We're prepared for it to not move up even though it's unsustainable at this stage.</p><p>SANJAY CHAWLA: So you're pointing to the difficulty of raising the pricing in this market with so much stratification...</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: No. I'm not saying it's difficult to raise. I think it will go through very easily. The question is will it? And if so, when? That's the only question.</p><p>SANJAY CHAWLA: Okay. And if I could just squeeze in one little question on the depreciation expense. It seems to have gone up quite a lot. And I'm just looking at the depreciation without the 116 impact. We've seen INR 500 crore, $5 billion quarter-on-quarter increase. So what exactly is driving that this quarter? We haven't seen this type of increase ever.</p><p>NAKUL SEHGAL: Sanjay, the increase is primarily driven by the investments which we have made. Firstly, we have an average CapEx of close to INR 4,500 crores to INR 5,000 crores every quarter, and it's a proof of depreciation on account of that.</p><p>SANJAY CHAWLA: There is no accelerated depreciation or anything which is reflecting here.</p><p>NAKUL SEHGAL: No. No. Accelerated depreciation is deemed, as I pointed out earlier, Sanjay, is reflected in the exceptional items.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Mr. Pranav Kshatriya from Edelweiss, Mumbai.</p><p>PRANAV KSHATRIYA, RESEARCH ANALYST, EDELWEISS SECURITIES LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: I have just 2 very small questions. Firstly, regarding this exceptional item of 15-odd billion. So can you please tell us that what is the underlying asset of the derivatives for which this expense have been done? Second question is can you throw some color on fiber monetization where we are and how do you see it panning out?</p><p>NAKUL SEHGAL: I'll take the first part of your question, Sanjay. I think we did discuss it in a good amount of detail, but just to explain a little bit more. So there are a few items when you look at the exceptional and the indemnities, and which I have mentioned earlier. It's a tax demand, which includes Tanzania, some minority adjustments, IPO obligations and so on and so forth. And whatever was an estimate, some -- I mean most of them have been resolved by way of an arrangement and an amount for which has been determined at all. Already accounted for in the books, and most of it has been paid as well. This is what I can mention about this. Nothing further than this side. Yes, and if you have any follow-up, we can take it subsequently.</p><p>BADAL BAGRI: Pranav, as mentioned in our earlier calls, we had moved all our fiber assets to a 100% subsidiary, and we have all approvals in place right now, and that's going to be affected in this current quarter. Regarding monetization, we'll continue to reevaluate opportunities and at the right time, we may choose to see what could be the potential structure at that particular point in time. We continue to evaluate opportunities every -- which comes in front of us.</p><p>OPERATOR: The last question comes from Mr. Vivekanand Subbaraman from AMBIT Capital, Mumbai.</p><p>VIVEKANAND SUBBARAMAN, MEDIA ANALYST, AMBIT CAPITAL PRIVATE LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have 2 questions. One is you mentioned that you are shifting your 3G spectrum and reallocating it to 4G. Is it possible for you to share the proportion of spectrum that is allocated across technologies? A ballpark number is also good. And how has this changed over the last year? And where do you see this going, let's say, by March '20?</p><p>Second question is with respect to the voice customers to data ARPU or voice customers migration to data, the ARPU uplift. Last time, you had indicated that it was around 2x ARPU uplift. Is that the trend that you see even in the current quarter? Or is it any different?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: I think on the second question, yes, we do see an upgrade when somebody moves from 2G to 4G. And the increase is along the lines of what you indicated. We haven't seen any change in that. The second part is on the 3G spectrum -- I'm sorry, on the overall spectrum. I would suggest the way you should look at it is look forward, let's say, probably April 2020. We will really have only 2G and 4G. So all our spectrum will sit on 4G other than the administered spectrum, which is on 2G, and that can be easily worked out based on the spectrum holding that we have, plus a small slug of spectrum that we require to run our 2G networks, which will be anywhere between 5 and 7 to 8 megahertz. Everything else will really be sitting with the -- on the 4G band.</p><p>VIVEKANAND SUBBARAMAN: All right. So Gopal, the small slug 5 and 7 to 8 megahertz, that's in the 1,800 megahertz band, right? None of the 900?</p><p>GOPAL VITTAL: It's mostly in 1,800 band. In some circles, it's also in the 900 band where we have enough 900 bands spectrum.</p><p>OPERATOR: At this moment, I would like to hand over the call proceedings to Mr. Badal Bagri for the final remarks.</p><p>BADAL BAGRI: Thank you all for joining and look forward to talking to all of you in the coming quarters.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Welcome to Douglas Emmett's quarterly earnings call. Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>I will now turn the conference over to Stuart McElhinney, Vice President of Investor Relations for Douglas Emmett. Please go ahead.</p><p>STUART MCELHINNEY, VP OF IR, DOUGLAS EMMETT, INC.: Thank you. Joining us today on the call are Jordan Kaplan, our President and CEO; Kevin Crummy, our CIO; and Peter Seymour, our CFO. This call is being webcast live from our website and will be available for replay during the next 90 days. You can also find our earnings package at the Investor Relations section of our website. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call in the earnings package.</p><p>During the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of, assumptions made by and information currently available to us. Our actual results will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict. Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance, and some will prove to be incorrect. Therefore, our actual future results can be expected to differ from our expectations, and those differences may be material. For a more detailed description of some potential risks, please refer to our SEC filings, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Jordan.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, DOUGLAS EMMETT, INC.: Good morning, everyone. I hope you are staying safe and healthy. I know we are all focused on the current situation. Before addressing that, I want to briefly report on our first quarter results.</p><p>We had another excellent quarter. We grew our FFO by 8.5%, our AFFO by 16.4% and our same-property cash NOI by 7.7%. The straight-line value of our office leases signed during the quarter was 23% greater than the prior leases for the same space, and we made good progress on our 2 multifamily development projects.</p><p>Of course, that was the first quarter. As is true everywhere, our tenants are now struggling with the impacts of the pandemic on their business. In addition, the cities in which we operate have passed unusually punitive ordinances, prohibiting evictions and allowing rent deferral for residential, retail and office tenants regardless of financial distress. By eliminating any fees or interest and providing long payback periods, tenants essentially have the option of a free loan.</p><p>Given the current uncertainties, in our earnings package, we provided you with our April rent collections data in lieu of guidance. To date, those collections represent 87% of aggregate rent billed, with residential at 95%, office at 90% and our small retail component at 22%. We don't know whether April will prove to be a good predictor of the next few months or the remainder of the year.</p><p>While we also do not know how long the pandemic will last, over numerous cycles during the last 30 years, we have designed our operating platform, capital structure and investment strategy to weather downturns. We entered this downturn with strong cash flow and a very healthy balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had $175 million of cash on hand, an undrawn $400 million line of credit, no debt maturities before 2023, no financial covenants that could force us to issue equity at the wrong time, and 41% of our office portfolio is unencumbered. In the end, we own many of the highest quality properties in the strongest, most desirable submarkets of Los Angeles. Our diverse tenant base represents our nation's most competitive industries and limits our vulnerability to any single tenant or industry. Our markets have no meaningful new supply, so we face no overhang from new construction as we recover from this crisis.</p><p>Now I will turn the call over to Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN ANDREW CRUMMY, CIO, DOUGLAS EMMETT, INC.: Thanks, Jordan, and good morning, everyone.</p><p>On the operational front, our buildings remain open, safe and available for our tenants. We're focused on providing excellent service while instituting stringent cleaning protocols, safe distancing, face coverings in common areas and reduced elevator density. As you might expect, we're seeing low attendance at our office properties, which will likely continue at least until the lifting of the stay-at-home orders. During this time, we expect some savings from variable expenses to help offset expected declines in parking revenue.</p><p>As Jordan mentioned, the cities where we primarily operate, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, have all enacted enforcement moratoriums to cover our residential, retail and office tenants. The ordinances have some carve-outs for large tenants and generally prohibit landlords not only from evicting tenants but also from imposing any late fees or interest. Under the ordinances, tenants are required to pay back the deferred rent within 3 to 12 months after the end of the emergency.</p><p>On the capital front, construction is continuing on our 2 large multifamily development projects, although it may take a little longer under current conditions. In Honolulu, where we are developing 500 apartment units at our office conversion project, we have already pre-leased a number of units and expect to deliver them over the next few months. For our Brentwood apartment tower, we currently expect delivery of the first units to be pushed into 2022. For the moment, we have suspended work on new office repositioning projects, and acquisitions in our market seem to be on hold as buyers and sellers evaluate the new conditions. With that said, we are well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that emerge.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Stuart.</p><p>STUART MCELHINNEY: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone.</p><p>In Q1, we signed 174 office leases covering 702,000 square feet, including 184,000 square feet of new leases. Leasing spreads for the first quarter were 22.6% for straight-line rent roll-up, 9.3% for cash roll-up. As we discussed last quarter, we had a high number of expirations impact Q1 and anticipated an early dip in occupancy this year. The decline in occupancy for our total office portfolio to 90.8% was in line with our pre-COVID-19 expectations.</p><p>By late March, the pace of new leasing in our office portfolio slowed to a trickle, but we are starting to see some signs of life as tenants and brokers adjust to the new normal. We have often talked about how we make the leasing experience in our small tenant office portfolio mirror the ease and speed of that at our apartments. As a result, we were early adopters of virtual touring technology, and we are well equipped to complete the entire leasing process remotely, from tour to space planning, to electronic document execution. This experience should serve us well in the current environment and going forward.</p><p>On the multifamily side, our portfolio remained essentially fully leased at 98%. Residential new leasing activity also slowed somewhat in late March but not to the same extent as office.</p><p>I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our results.</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR, CFO, DOUGLAS EMMETT, INC.: Thanks, Stuart. Good morning, everyone.</p><p>We are pleased with our Q1 results. Compared to a year ago, in the first quarter of 2020, we increased revenues by 12.1%. We increased FFO 8.5% to $112 million or $0.55 per share. We increased AFFO 16.4% to $99 million. We increased our same-property cash NOI by 7.7%. And at only 4.1% of revenues, our G&amp;A for the first quarter remains well below that of our benchmark group.</p><p>As Jordan said, we don't know what will happen in May or in subsequent months. Many things could change even before the stay-in-place orders begin to be lifted. Many of our small tenants have applied for federal assistance, which can be forgiven if they pay their rent by June. The local governments that have authorized rent deferrals are considering excluding office tenants, which would reduce or eliminate that headwind. Leasing could start to recover as tenants come closer to the end of their existing leases. On the other hand, we could see more tenants stop paying rent if the impact to their business grows.</p><p>These uncertainties are compounded by many other critical variables on which we have little information: how long the current stay-in-place orders remain; how they are phased out; how businesses react after they are phased out; and whether there is a second pandemic wave in the fall. While in past recessions, our tenants have shown low default rates, we can't be sure what will happen this time. As a result, we have withdrawn our guidance for all of 2020.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to the operator, so we can take your questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jason Green at Evercore.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a question on the tenants who have not paid rent, do you have any insight as to how many of those tenants are experiencing real financial distress versus how many are just opportunistically seeking rent relief?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Considering -- this is Jordan. And I'm sorry our voices sound so -- don't have their normal rich timbre, but we have 5 people in a 46-person conference room spread out in respect to social distancing, and we probably would feel the microphone also needs to be 6 feet away. But anyway, the -- when it comes to the office tenants, and you know the office markets we're in and you know our credit underwriting, I think we feel pretty good about our tenants' ability to pay. It's hard to go in. I mean everyone is impacted by this. When it comes to our retail tenants, we actually have some large retail tenants that probably can pay, but you can understand why they're not. And as you saw, the residential came in around 95%.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN: Got it. I guess just one more on capital allocation. You guys announced the approval of a share repurchase program in the quarter but didn't repurchase any shares when the stock hit the mid- to low-$20 level. I guess just what was the thinking behind not repurchasing shares when it got down to that level?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, we set up that program to make sure we had that flexibility. But at the same time, we -- I don't know then or even now whether we have the right kind of visibility to know what we're facing, whether it's months, years, whatever, to know exactly what we want to do. So the first stage of what we've been doing has been kind of organizing the company, for starters, to keep it protected and running right -- run our buildings right and keep our people employed, do all that stuff right. And then the second stage is to look for opportunities. And I think we've done a good job with the first step, and we're starting to evaluate the second step.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Craig Mailman at KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I know it's a little bit early in May here but just curious what the early trends you guys are seeing, if you're on the same pace you were in April or if more people are maybe taking advantage of the moratoriums that are in place.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, we're -- right now, we're tracking about the same as April. Although it's -- in terms of business days, it's early to know where we're really going to end up in May. And I think that we are seeing some tenants are starting to get the PPP, and I think we've also been pressuring some tenants saying what you're doing is not right. And frankly, we've been talking to some of the cities and saying to them, you've put together programs that are more punitive than any of the other gateway markets in the United States. It's almost kind of you're almost asking the tenants to not pay with the way you're providing this sort of free 12-month loan. So with all of those things swirling around, juxtaposed with the fact that now it's -- now we're in our second month of COVID and stay-in-place, it's hard to know how we'll really end up.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: Okay. That's helpful. And then the big themes of work from home and easing of densification are kind of topics in the office space. I'm just curious, you guys tend to skew smaller, just your thoughts on kind of how dense your tenants got versus maybe some of the larger tech firms and whether this work-from-home could just cause some of your smaller tenants to just say, you know what, I'll just do my work at the house, if it's kind of a small company. Just kind of curious, as you guys have kind of looked through that, kind of thoughts here.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well -- okay, so the first part of your question, I -- this is very hard -- I mean, I don't -- frankly, we don't have a lot more information than you guys do. But I will say that in terms of our market, generally, our market, I do not think that our markets are built to the density that other gateway markets are built to, just right out of the gate. So we're still building out most people's space. Our space, for instance, and many others is built to 200 feet plus in terms of the build-out. And when you get to very small -- we're in about 50,000 feet. But when you get to really small tenants, those numbers are even larger. So I'm not sure for a lot of these small tenants that we've evaluated our space.</p><p>We have some areas we need to work on. I'm not sure that they're not in a relatively good position to come back even with no changes to the build-out of their space. But I think the densification that has been rolling -- that kind of rolled through the last decade, whether it be New York or Boston or the big tech floors up in San Francisco, I'm sure that they're trying to figure out how to loosen that up. Now you would just -- that, by itself, you go, wow, that could be a pretty good net positive for those markets. But I don't know if what that means is that they just say, all right, we'll keep this space, but we're going to move another group to another area, or I don't know what happens there.</p><p>The second part of your question was whether our smaller tenants are going to choose to just stay home and work. I think for most of our tenants that -- they've always been able to do that, and they like having their offices, especially our whole play here is that we're a very short commute from where they live. And I've literally been saying for decades, these guys should all move out of their houses and move into their office space because what they're spending for these houses on an imputed per foot basis, the office space is a bargain and a half. I think they like having their offices. I think they like having somewhere to work. So I don't see the fact that people have been able to work from home causing them to say, wow, now I'm just going to work from home.</p><p>I've always felt like the fact -- and when we talk to people even now, I think most people are saying, I can't wait to not be home 24/7. I want to get out of all this. I want to go back to work. And I know they have the concerns about the virus and things being clean and safe and all the rest of it, but I think it's human nature to want to be able to not be in one place all the time.</p><p>So I've always felt like that's been going off for probably 2 decades now, what technology has done in terms of people being able to work from home is to expand the workforce and people that couldn't come into an office and work or couldn't -- or for whatever they were doing, it was an efficiency thing, and it allowed the workforce to be even larger and add more people to the workforce. I don't think the part of the workforce that comes in the office, works with their colleagues, use that as part of like the way their day runs, I don't think that changes.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR US OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL REIT ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I guess just thinking about your liquidity position, and I know you're cutting back on some spending this year, can you kind of -- can you still just walk us through how you're thinking about your spending needs this year, and then to the extent you see dislocation in the market, how you think about potentially funding any investment opportunity? Or do you feel like you're not even ready for that at this point?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I'm not sure how long the list of investment opportunities is at the moment. We aren't seeing a lot come out. And by not a lot, I'm not -- I'm saying pretty much almost nothing. Probably the opportunities in front of us on the capital market side is 3 groups. It's refinancing, we are focused on that because rates, as they go down, we just always aggressively chase them. And then you have -- obviously, we put the stock buyback program in place, but I don't think we're ready to do that at the moment at least. And then you have the construction, the third-party construction, and we have chosen to continue our 2 large projects. We backed off on probably another $100 million of stuff that we can do during the year in terms of building repositionings, lobby rehabs, et cetera, to make sure that our cash position was very strong.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: So I guess, how do you think about like sources and uses this year with kind of your revised capital plan?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I think our income will be sufficient to fund our uses. If you're asking me the simple question do I think we're sort of trapped in something where we're forced to be a net borrower, I don't think we are. And I don't project that even with the fact that I think we ended up 12% off in April or something like that continuing, I think we're in plenty good shape.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. And I guess, similar with the distribution at the current level, cover everything?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, if you're asking me does the distribution cover our income, I think we're in fine shape. I think the dividend, you're talking about the public company dividend, right?</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. So yes, I think we're -- no problem there at all.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. All right. And then as you -- can you just talk about what the co-working companies are doing in your markets now? I mean have they been -- I know you don't have any, but are they paying rent? Are they -- are you hearing that they're crumbling? Just any color from the ground.</p><p>KEVIN ANDREW CRUMMY: It's kind of case -- this is Kevin, Jamie. It's kind of case by case. The -- and speaking with my peers in the marketplace, some of the larger co-working companies are paying and some of the other ones are asking for a little rent relief right now while people aren't using their offices. But we don't have very much exposure in West L.A., so it's anecdotally throughout the market. And I know that the -- WeWork has paid some landlords and not paid some other landlords just like across the country.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Emmanuel Korchman at Citi.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: If we think about the 90% collections in the office portfolio, is there any commonality, whether it be by industry or by size or by some other characteristic of the 10% that haven't paid, other than the fact that the municipalities have given them the right not to?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Frankly, if you -- and I've kind of been on the road on this with the various city councils in the cities we're working in. There is a shocking relationship between not paying and the rules surrounding the moratorium in the various cities that how well people pay or don't pay. So we -- I don't want to call out any cities, and I think they're working to fix this situation for us. But in the cities where blanket and there's literally no cost and long payback periods, we -- meaningfully, statistically meaningfully worse collections than the cities that had more restrictions, maybe you could still charge fees but certainly the payback much shorter, so the benefit of kind of having an angry landlord wasn't as much there than better pay rates. That's the one thing you can see in that last group that really stands out.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN: And then in terms of your new leasing, it looks like the leasing costs were elevated. I don't know if that had to do with mix and the base rents in that pool were higher or if it just had to do with spaces. But could you give us some color as to why those -- the new leasing costs specifically seem higher than recent trends?</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR: Yes. I mean, look, I think -- this is Peter. There's the overall rate ends up much lower, right? So we had a much lower on the renewal side. And then the new leasing, we did a small number of deals and a couple of them were at slightly higher cost, but it doesn't look like it's indicative of any kind of trend. And as a percentage of rent, the rent that we're giving is the combined blended rent. So when you take that -- when you take new leasing just over the new leasing rents, it's pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER SANDLER &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: You guys are pretty brave to all be in the same room together. So...</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: It's such a huge conference room, it's almost absurd.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Now everyone is realizing that their homes are not big enough. Two questions. First, can you just talk a little bit about Hawaii? It sounds like the state overall has been fine COVID-wise and that, hopefully, it can start to reopen. But clearly, it's going to be a while before tourism returns. So your products out there, the apartments, the office, what are you guys seeing? And is your view that tourism absolutely has to return before you can see benefits in your properties? Or do you think the local economy is sufficient enough for you guys to continue the building conversions and pushing rents and all that good stuff?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I'll tell you, first of all, if there is a group that I think has worked hard and done a good job, what I've seen happen in Hawaii, they've really jumped on it. They did well with COVID. I thought the city, city-state, county leaders, whatever that group is, they're all kind of mashed together, did a really nice job. They have 4 local banks there. They got -- because we -- for the stuff we do in Hawaii, we use local banks. We got conversations with them. They were really aggressive. Literally midnight, the first round of PPP, they made sure they got all the local companies covered and got a good chunk of money out to all of them. You saw really good engagement out of the mayor and others in terms of walking the line to what's open, not open construction. So in terms of management, I really -- maybe it's because they're all like a big family there, they all know each other. But I give them a really high grade.</p><p>So I'm hoping that -- and they're super focused on recovery and protecting their economy. Now they, for sure, have the problem of being a very tourist-dependent economy. They have construction. They have a huge chunk of military in there. They have other stuff, but tourism is a big deal. Now I know that they are working as hard as any hotel company or any airline to go how do we solve this and how do we make people feel comfortable coming back when the time is right.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, when you talk about Douglas Emmett and our resident -- our residential projects are going -- our construction is going there, and our occupancy is fine, and our pay rate is fine, all good. On our office projects, they're -- interestingly, we went into Hawaii originally, now it was 2 decades ago, with the thought that a run-up in tourism and facing Asia would be very good for that economy and then now would flow through to the office product. And that was what we do, office and residential, so that's what we did.</p><p>Hawaii is where we learned that tourism, for sure to the plus side, as tourism kept running up, we did not see it roll through to the office product. So we saw tourism -- when we went into Hawaii, I think the tourism was like $4 million to $5 million; and last year, probably $9 million, $10 million, right? So you would have said, wow, you called it right, but that did not drive much in terms of the office product. I'm not sure that, that decline will drive much in the way of the office product. But overall, having a strong economy is going to be important. And I think more than any of the other places where we operate, they are just collectively growing as a team to make sure that Hawaii, that doesn't suffer too much. So we've been very happy about that.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. And then the second question, Jordan. When you have the discussions with your local California politicians and they do the eviction moratoriums, I'm sure in their wisdom, they also put in place a real estate tax moratorium, so it offsets and doesn't put the landlord in the middle position. So when you raise that point -- well, because California is very logical and it understands how math works. So when you raise that point to the politicians, do they understand that? I mean I know that Gavin was facing that, the payment, a few weeks ago, but do they understand the ramifications and your ability to -- maybe not Doug E directly but landlords in general to withhold taxes if they're not being paid because of government mandates?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I didn't use quite the level of sarcasm that you used since I'm trying to get them to do something for me, but I did point out that essentially, when these -- the impact of these moratoriums, what it's been is to essentially -- is to shift us, shift the -- if it exists, the borrowing responsibility to us versus a tenant, and I don't know why that would be a fair shift. Now to be fair to their point, they are worried about mostly -- so most of these ordinances were designed, first of all, by non-real estate people that were -- all they were thinking about was residential. And they literally, when you talk to them, they're like, oh, yes, office.</p><p>I don't think they were really targeting office. What they were targeting was residential. And then when you talk about it, they go, \"Well, we don't want to treat our local retailers to go away because it's part of the fabric and culture of the area, right? We don't want a bunch of empty storefronts.\" And I would say, across the board, when you sit and talk to them about that and you talk about it like, look, you were really trying to protect housing, no evictions on housing, you're really trying to protect your local retailers, they have been very open-minded about making a change for the rest.</p><p>The problem is they're just inundated with problems, right, not to mention that their budgets are just destroyed now. So getting their attention, which we've been able to get, and getting the city attorneys to change and redraft these emergency ordinances, it's just a time-intensive process, and we're going through that with them, but they have not been -- they haven't been that tough on this thing. When we explained it to them and we said, look, I think you're trying to include -- they go -- well, they'll say commercial. Well, who are you saying we are covering or not? I say, well, I think you're trying to cover people who collect sales tax on a majority of their revenue. I don't think you're trying to cover hedge funds in my office building. I'm like, oh, yes, you're right, there is a difference between them. That's the first time they even started splitting retail from office.</p><p>A lot of these things only have commercial. It doesn't say retail or office. So they're sort of accepting that. I think they're going to make the right changes in that, but it's taken -- just in time, you got to think of -- I mean these things got put in place like the beginning of April. And here we are a month later, and we've gotten meetings with them, with the top -- with the mayors, council members, and they're working on it. So that's been very good.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Right. But they understand that you can't be the middleman or a lender of last resort. Like if you suffer implodes on the top, obviously, it's going to -- you shouldn't be expected to pay out at the bottom. They understand that, right?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: They haven't understood that because we're still paying all our city business taxes and fees. But as I said, I'm not putting it to them like that because I want -- we're trying to achieve this goal of getting commercial released.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from John Kim at BMO.</p><p>FRANK LEE, SENIOR ASSOCIATE, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: This is Frank Lee on with John. First question I have is do you have a sense of what percentage of your multifamily rents are currently delinquent. And can you walk us through your plans on addressing any of this?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, yes. So that -- unhappily, that 5% that did pay, and maybe this is just math but I think it's a little more than math, it seemed to be highly concentrated with tenants that pay to be in some of the nicest spaces in our buildings on the beach with rents that are very high. And certainly, they're renting that space because they have a lot of net worth, and they wanted to be looking out at the beach and walking out on the sand. And so that -- when I was looking at that listing, and I actually just took the list and ranked it by rent, like by rent, and I feel like if we -- just we're collecting from the people that paid over -- I think it was $4,000, you would collect like a ton of that money. And if someone's paying $4,000 for their apartment, they probably can afford to pay.</p><p>But those rules are set in stone. Those people just have been told flat they don't have to pay. I've told the cities -- they don't want to hear it about apartments, by the way, but I've told them, you realize that the tenants that feel they're the most financially sophisticated seem to be the ones taking the most use of these ordinances, not the -- your normal run of the mill person who's like, yes, I don't want to have my rent pile up on me, I got to live here, and they're just paying the rent. So it's the ones that kind of feel like, yes, no problem, I'll pick up the extra money and I'll pay it later, they seem to be the ones that are making up a lot of that missed money. But that will play out.</p><p>FRANK LEE: And then what's your expectation to recoup that 5%-ish of kind of lost rent from those tenants?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, it's hard to predict now. We haven't even -- we're trying to get the collection rate higher each month, and then we'll go back. And as I've said, we have -- we're pretty good at our underwriting when we lease space. We never -- in the last recession, we never had defaults. So you're talking about defaults here, not the city's allowing them not to pay but then later they pay, real defaults. I don't think our defaults ever really got over 2%. I don't think they did. They might have gotten to 3%, but I don't think they really got above 2%. Now what happens to us in a recession is we pick up vacancy and maybe rents go down, but we are really good on the default front. So if you say default on those numbers, I would expect them to be low, but time to collect seems to be stretched.</p><p>FRANK LEE: Okay. And then second question I have is, if I look at your top tenant list, did all these tenants pay April rent? I'm just curious particularly on the lease with Equinox.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: We're -- you know what, we're not -- we never really like talking about tenants, and we don't really like calling out individual tenants, and so we're not going to start today.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Dave Rodgers at Baird.</p><p>DAVID BRYAN RODGERS, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just I guess with your smaller tenants and much faster roll, the shorter lease term that you generally have versus office, I mean what are those discussions like today for the next kind of 3 to 5 months? I mean typically, I think larger deals would be done, but I think you guys do it a little bit more just-in-times. So can you give us a little bit of color on how those discussions are going and what you'd expect here in the near term on some of those near-term rolls?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. I'll give you what little I know. Maybe Stuart knows more. But smaller guys will usually feel like a lot of pressure to get their stuff done about 5 months ahead of when their lease is coming up. So in terms of having data for you on where the world is on renewals right now being a month into this, I can't say that we have a lot of data on that because there's not many people wait until the last day that they had to renew, right? So there's not a lot of data. Leasing is going. We're doing leases. Go ahead, you can fill in on this?</p><p>STUART MCELHINNEY: Yes. No, I think that's fair. I think that a lot of people are just delaying their decisions at this point, but we're still getting a decent amount of leasing done. It's definitely slowed the way down, starting to pick up. I mean we're seeing volume, we're seeing calls, all that stuff's coming back again after shutting down almost completely for a while. And like I said in my remarks, we're pretty well set up with virtual tours, and we're getting -- just trying to get the brokers' community and the tenant community used to this world.</p><p>And the brokers are definitely hungry to do deals. They're not making money when they're not doing deals. So we're seeing it start to come back. I think, like Jordan said, mostly we're seeing our tenants kind of delay their decisions for a little while, but most of our tenants tend to go maybe 6 months before they're -- before the end of their lease is our average when they're making their renewal decision.</p><p>DAVID BRYAN RODGERS: And then I guess maybe just on the rate side, Jordan, it wasn't long ago, we were talking about pushing rate and having tenants really pushing back and complaining and personal phone calls to you, et cetera. As you kind of think about this next phase in terms of where rents are on leases and where you feel comfortable pushing those or pulling those, how are those discussions going? And what's the expectation near term that you think about?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: No, we haven't had any rate discussions. I have had no rate discussions. I don't think we -- I mean, to what -- no. I don't think we've raised rates, and I don't think we've lowered rates, and I think we're doing deals. I mean there's like -- there's a measure of just like social sensitivity or something. I'd be a little nervous to raise rates. Even if the market stays very tight, I'd probably have a little breather for a little while. There's just a lot of tension out there in the world, so you don't -- certainly you don't want to do anything that could ever be viewed as aggressive or predatory or taking advantage, and I think we're going to be equally alert and aware. We operate in small -- obviously, L.A. is not a small community, but in the various markets we're in, we -- we're certainly in a period right now where it's good to have more friends than just kind put of a wall around.</p><p>DAVID BRYAN RODGERS: Okay. And then maybe a last one, if I just could, on the parking. You mentioned parking revenue. How much of that could be at risk or isn't part of or baked into some of the leases on a number basis?</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR: Yes. It's Peter. I mean we're probably at this point -- but it's hard to say how it's going to go. We're probably getting about half the parking income that we normally have. But as I said, that's on a very short time period and really hard to see where it's headed to in the next couple of months. And especially as things start to reopen, just don't know which way it's going to go.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I think they're going to -- when things reopen, I think they're going to drive, they're not going to take a bus. I mean they will want their parking spaces back. I suspect parking becomes a very short-term phenomenon of people being told to stay home.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Rick Anderson at SMBC.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON, RESEARCH ANALYST, SMBC NIKKO SECURITIES AMERICA, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I'll take that question even further. I think there should be a parking REIT in the aftermath of all this because everyone is going to be driving all around the country, in my opinion.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: That might be right.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: It hasn't come up yet, but not to pile on the regulatory silliness of California, but Prop 13, do you agree with Victor and Hudson that that's on the back burner for now for at least a while?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: I don't think back burner is the right term. Look, it's going to be on the ballot. I think that it is -- I think that we are doing a lot of work to fight it. I think it's a bad idea. And I think -- and it's polling quite poorly. For me, it's not just going to be beating it. I mean we want to really beat it so that we don't have to face it again. I mean it shows up at times from groups that are not really stakeholders in our markets, to be perfectly frank, and they are looking to raise money for their own purposes. And you don't see the state or any of the rest of them saying we think this is a good idea.</p><p>And so we want to make it clear of not just beating it but beating it enough so no one wants to waste their money or our money in the future to having to deal with that again. But I still feel if what Victor said was that he feels confident that we will beat it, I think that's reasonable. I feel pretty confident that we'll beat it and because it's polling so poorly. And Californians in general, not just for that, which is much harder to justify, but even some things for schools and otherwise, have just been saying enough is enough when it comes to taxes, they're just done. And that's unfortunate because we've put some taxes on it, were for very odd and special things during the heyday because maybe some special purpose group talked people into it, and now they're going to really need that money for the general state budget. And so I think there's going to be some shifting there, but we'll see what happens.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: Okay. Given that you have -- you're known for small tenants in terms of lease size and all that, do you feel like there's any incremental vulnerabilities to your business just in terms of small companies and perhaps less financial wherewithal in this environment that they may perhaps be more exposed to, God forbid, closing down business or that kind of thing? Or is that just not in the conversation right now?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, I don't think the fact that they're small or large plays the role that you're indicating in the impact of the economy on them, their capitalization or them closing down their business. Frankly, most of what I'm reading it's large companies closing down their businesses, not a lot of these smaller ones that are throughout our portfolio. I think that it's fair -- I think it's -- I think they're -- they have an easier time controlling their expenses, and they actually -- when you look at the capital backing them as it relates percentage-wise and all other ways to their rent obligation or all of their costs in running their companies, I think it's actually more capital backing that than some of these larger companies that we know are all over the country that have been running at -- literally like losing money every year and borrowing to support that.</p><p>So I don't think the economy -- if you would have gone back to the last recession, that we'll call it the financial [any's] recession, the bank recession, that was hard on a lot of our companies because, not because they weren't in a good position but sort of the banks stopped lending and doing stuff with all those guys and that was just hard on them, it was hard for new formation. But this doesn't seem to be that kind of recession. So I don't think they will be hit in that way. And I think that if you just look at the industries that they're in, tech, entertainment and medical research and just a lot of them, I actually think that money is going to come, more money into that, into those areas. So I'm not as worried with the small tenants.</p><p>And as I said, even the financial recession, the one that really like banks and liquidity squeeze, that happened in, what, '07, '08, '09, whatever you want, '10, we never really experienced more than 2% default. So from that perspective, I feel like we did probably better than a lot of places. And by the way, our rent, because we go into these things without new supply overhang, we don't see the same decline in rents. We have a chart that's on our website that shows that in the last recession, we -- the lowest point of rents for our company in the last recession was still 10% above the previous peak. And that cannot be said for any of the other gateway markets, except Washington D.C., which in the last recession didn't feel the impact, but in all the other markets.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Peter Abramowitz at Jefferies.</p><p>PETER DYLAN ABRAMOWITZ, EQUITY ASSOCIATE, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just want to ask you about the multifamily portfolio specifically. You've had 2 straight quarters of negative same-store revenue growth. So just in comparison, I guess, to some of the apartment peers that are in the 2% to 3% top line growth range, anything specific that's going on to your portfolio that might be a drag there?</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR: It's Peter. I don't think there's any specific trend. We've been running at really high, well over 99% for a whole bunch of up quarters. And they're small numbers in the same store, so it's -- yes, it's super sensitive. 1%, I think, is 19 or 20 units. So a little blip and it drives that number down. But at 97.5% leased, it's still an incredibly high lease rate. But early to say whether there's -- what the long-term impacts of this whole pandemic are going to be, but it's certainly going into the end of the quarter, we didn't see any specific trends.</p><p>PETER DYLAN ABRAMOWITZ: Got you. Is the lease rate going down, say, a couple of hundred basis points in the quarter, was that at all pandemic-related in March, the beginning? Because I think the building with the fire was excluded from that, if I read correctly.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: We're not seeing any of that. No, we're not seeing that as a driving force.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Daniel Ismail at Green Street Advisors.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL, SENIOR ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Great. Just following up on a previous question about parking revenue, I don't think I heard a percentage of revenues that comes from parking. Are you able to provide that?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: We don't break that out separately. I did say that it's -- we've probably collected about half what we normally do.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL: Okay. But is that like low single digits like sub-5% or somewhere higher than that?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes, no, we don't break that out. And parking and other is a line item on our income statement. So take that line item and cut it about in half.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL: All right. So the majority of that is in parking and not other sources of ancillary income.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. The majority of parking and other is parking.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL: Okay. And then, Jordan, given those -- you mentioned the restrictions on evictions, are you able to utilize security deposits and letters of credits to make up some of the shortfall and nonpayment?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: We really haven't been doing that. I think that if we can -- I think we can write that last group if I get these changes in the cities. I'm not -- in the end, of course -- look, there's nothing -- well, maybe something we just said earlier on the call, we have not forgiven any rent, okay? We haven't forgiven any rent for anybody. So this is all -- none of these collections are a function of, well, we may deal with them and we forgave some rent, so -- and I hope that when all is said and done, and I'm not going to say we're never going to forgive any rent, but if we forgive rent, it will be in exchange for some other terms in a lease or some other improvement in a lease or term or whatever the case may be.</p><p>So I don't think pulling security deposits and starting to sort of unravel a lease going kind of [DEFCON 4] on them I just don't think it's the right idea right now. We're just not there right now. I think if we get these moratoriums worked out to be less penalizing, I think a lot of these people are just going, \"I'll pay now.\" I think it's the equivalent of you don't owe your 2019 taxes until July. So now how many people paid their taxes in April because the federal government is hurting? I don't think very many, and that's what we're dealing with. It doesn't make them bad or good. They're just -- they got presented with something and they took it. So we aren't prevented from doing what you said, but I don't think we're really doing it.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Tayo Okusanya at Mizuho.</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. A couple of questions from me. The first one, the Barrington Plaza, the apartment complex, could you tell us what the latest is with that in regards to refurbishing the apartments that unfortunately did burn down and kind of what the status is with some of these pending class-action lawsuits?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Let's see. So in terms of the litigation -- I mean we're not going to discuss litigation, but as we've told you, we're insured, that unfortunately, in the world that we're in, people have a hard time not trying to take advantage of disasters. Put that to the side, if you say what's happening with the building, we're deep in the process of redoing the floors, getting the plans approved and working, I think, quite well with the city who -- which the city does not have a -- we wanted to sprinkler the buildings. We wanted sprinkler on after the first fire. And the city does not have an ordinance that kind of shakes hands properly with the fair housing department that allows you to go in and actually retrofit and sprinkler a high-rise residential building. And we've gone to them and said, look, we know you want us to have them, and we know we want to do it. And they have been really good about saying, yes, we're just going to try and figure out a way to get you there.</p><p>And so I'm pretty confident now that we're not only going to be redoing those floors, getting them done, but I think the city is really kind of in a great way come on our team to say, we're going to make provisions or a way, even though it's not in our code at the moment, where you're going to get to sprinkler these buildings. So that -- we're feeling good about that.</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: Got you. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to go back to Frank's question around tenants. He did ask about Equinox, but I'm curious what you're hearing from Morgan Stanley given some of the vocal comments the CEO did make on their earnings call about needing less office space going forward because more of the employees will be working from home.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Okay. And what's -- a quick -- I mean I've already said -- wait, who made this comment?</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: The CEO of Morgan Stanley.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Okay. And he thinks more people are going to be working from home?</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: That's what he said on their earnings call that they would be looking at having -- taking less office space going forward because of that.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Okay. I mean I don't know what those big investment banks will end up doing. They already -- they're kind of the prime group that's worked their hardest to get down to 150 feet per person, 140 feet per person. I mean we're there when we're in New York, we're visiting, and we go out onto those big trading floors, and it's certainly packed in at a level that we haven't seen before.</p><p>I can't imagine that he is going to have so many people working from home that he's going to achieve for the people working social distancing and actually also reduce their space and create that kind of proper environment, but maybe he figured out how to do that, I don't know.</p><p>But I do think that for the people that are in that position, I don't think they have any choice but to keep people working from home for a lot longer than other companies because I don't think -- just practically speaking, I don't know how they'd bring -- I mean even going every other seat, I think they have a tough time being 6 feet apart. So I mean that's going to be an outlet for them for a long time. If you say to me human nature, I watched people, I watched technology come, and everyone said, oh, technology, no one's coming into the office. Actually, office space filled up more because individuals became more productive and more people were coming into offices and working with computers there.</p><p>And then people got to a point where they said, all right, I think we're going to expand and expand the workforce and have people work from home and let a lot of people work from home. And then even the technology companies said, you know what, we've just found out we're not in love with people working from home. We want teams together. And then you saw a shift happened where they said, no, we're going to pack them into our space because we want people to even casually run across each other so that they can have creative conversations and collaborate and all the rest. So there was sort of a complete revolt towards working from home.</p><p>And now in the situation we're in, people are saying, \"Hey, what about working from home?\" Okay, I think when all is said and done, they're going to end up figuring out that, first of all, when people are working in the office, they don't want to be in a position where they're almost forced to be in a collaborative conversation all the time. They want their own space. And I also think they're going to find out that, that space needs to be more than 20 square feet, right? And I think that they'll find out that there are a lot of people that can work from home and an additive way to make them more productive. But if you're saying human nature is that people are going to say I prefer to work from home or companies are going to now switch back and go, okay, we changed our mind again and now we now like people working from home, I never saw that as a long-term trend. And I still don't think it will be a long-term trend.</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: That's helpful. One more, if you could indulge me, just around the office parking, other income line item in 1Q. Just kind of given some of the discussions, you talked about your parking trend. That line item was actually up $3 million in 1Q '20 versus 4Q '19. Could you talk a little bit about that delta and what caused that big increase?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: I don't know that answer. I see Peter starting or trying to look around his papers.</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR: I think there were some true-ups there from prior quarters. I mean it's -- quarter-to-quarter, you get variability there, but there's nothing...</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Nothing stands out. We didn't prepare for the question.</p><p>OMOTAYO TEJAMUDE OKUSANYA: So there's just some accounting true-ups in 1Q '20 on that. That's kind of it?</p><p>PETER D. SEYMOUR: Yes. And the other factor, you do have to remember we consolidated the -- one of our JVs, yes, partway through the fourth quarter. So that will contribute.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Emmanuel Korchman at Citi.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN, MD, HEAD OF THE US REAL ESTATE &amp; LODGING RESEARCH AND SENIOR REAL ESTATE ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Michael Bilerman. Where is -- where did April occupancy end up at the end of the month?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Where did which occupancy?</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: April occupancy, office.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: No. I don't think we're publishing month-to-month occupancy. And frankly, I don't know.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: I mean was it -- I mean you had negative net absorption in the first quarter which, because of your short lease duration, you're running, call it, 120 basis points of expirations every month, right? And so and you are -- Ken runs a leasing machine. I think you do like 2 to 3 leases a day historically, right, whether they're renewals or new leases just given the tenant size and the number of leases you have, the spaces. And so I'm just trying to get a sense of what occurred during April so that we understand sort of the cadence of the occupancy declines as the shelter-in-place orders still are there and just in terms of how low -- at what point will that low point settle in.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. I don't -- well, but what creates occupancy declines, and I -- literally, I do not know the exact answer to your question. But if you look at what creates occupancy decline, I don't think any of that could have happened in April. I don't think -- obviously, it's impossible they'll default in our markets. I didn't hear about -- if you're saying a person's -- right in that month of April, the person's lease came up and they moved out and we lost it, I don't think really anyone was moving. I don't think -- no one was coming, no one was going, no one was doing anything. I don't think -- even if we had the exact information of April, I don't think it would give you any indication of a trend line until you see people kind of -- the world start going again and people start making affirmative decisions about things because nobody's doing anything. I wouldn't be surprised that occupancy April 1 and occupancy April 30 is the same number. I don't think that's a trend. I just don't think anyone has been able to do anything for the last month.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: I guess what happened to all the leases that expired? You probably had like 50 or 60 leases expired during the month of April. Were all those renewed at...</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, no, because that's what I was explaining earlier at one of the earlier questions, what I said was these guys, nobody goes and renews or doesn't renew on the month of expiration. I mean I said 5 months, and then Stuart corrected me to say actually, the average for these guys is 6 months -- or not even the average, the short end. So people -- 6 months ago, those renewals happened. Now you'd go, well, people that are 6 months on from now, how come they're not feeling pressure to do their renewals? They probably are, but they're not doing anything or they did their renewal.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: Right. And what are you doing from just bringing your -- in terms of reopening and bringing people back into the office, I think about the larger landlords who have very large tenants are working hand-in-hand and providing those services to be able to bring employees back into the office in a social distanced way, right? And they'll go up to -- maybe get to 50%. I would assume with a much smaller tenant base, you're dealing with an average lease, average tenant size of about 5,000 square feet. I guess what do you need to do in those spaces to get those people back in and the cost of doing that just from a sanitation and just opening your building perspective?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: So within the suites, we're doing our cleaning, as we always have. And outside, in the common areas of the buildings, we are putting together programs to bring people in, limit the number of people going through the elevators, requiring mask, coming -- we're putting all those programs together and starting to get ready to steer them out. Actually, there's a meeting about -- another meeting about it today. I think that -- I don't think that we have -- we have similar problems, not the same problems as these huge markets with gigantic buildings, whether it be in New York or Boston or San Francisco. I mean the timing of people arriving is a little more varied here, and we don't have those colossal crunches to the elevators. I mean we have some other opportunities to lighten things up, and we're looking at all of them. And we're putting all those programs in to try and make people feel safe about coming back to work.</p><p>Now if you say in the people and offices, how many people -- how many are they bringing back, I mean that's the choice of the tenant, not us. All we are doing is creating good accommodations and notifications and cleaning and all the rest of that stuff for people coming in through the building and the lobbies and the elevators.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: How do you think sort of the Warner Center market fits into all of this and in a post-pandemic world, is better or worse for it?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: I think the short-term post-pandemic world is bad for all businesses because the economy is slowing down. And at the end of the day, the economy is the model that drives everything. And so I don't think you could say Warner Center separate from Santa Monica, separate from Beverly Hills, L.A., New York, Boston, you name it. I don't think anybody is going to escape these impacts. So everything would only be on a relevant basis. And I don't know that Warner Center will be any more or less impacted than what we would expect out of the industries that are driving the L.A. economy. But if you say is the L.A. economy going to be hit, Hawaii's economy going to be hit, yes, and all the others. I just think everyone is going to be hit.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: Right. I just know it's been a challenge for a while just in terms of getting that occupancy up, and I'm just trying to think about how the industry trends and where it's located, how that evolves post all of this.</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Well, yes. I mean we're going to try and give up as little occupancy as we can. But of course, nothing is free because then that would translate into rate. But if you say, wow, I mean, you're going and blowing, and now this hit, now what's next? Okay. I know what's next is not going and blowing. I mean we've got to like put the hat on and keeping the buildings full and let the economy recover.</p><p>MICHAEL JASON BILERMAN: Right. Just lastly on the deferrals, how long will those drag on? Is it entirely dependent on shelter-in-place? Or are there other variables in those deferrals?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Most of these cities have either said April and May or April, May and June. So they've like named the months that have the deferrals. Now if we're successful, we will get a good part of what we have in our portfolio free of that. But every major market has a moratorium on evictions, and then that moratorium comes with 4 different components. And depending on what those components are depends on how punitive or how much it's encouraging a tenant whether they needed or not to take a free loan. And that is who's covered, whether late fees or interest can be charged, whether significant documentation is needed and how many -- whether they've even said how many months past the crisis the deferral goes.</p><p>And what we've seen in most of these markets is they all have, we'll say, 2 of those components. Maybe they all have -- maybe they have, okay, everyone's covered, and you can't charge late fees. But maybe then they say, but you have to provide very good documentation. And if you don't, then you don't get the benefit of this. And by the way, once the emergency is over, it's between you and the landlord because now the rent's due the next day, okay? So you can choose 2 of the 4 things, and you probably have not created a bad situation where people are trying to get a free loan.</p><p>We're in markets where all 4 of those things exist: not very big need for documentation, just impacted by COVID; very long payout periods; everybody's covered; and no fees. Okay, that's a recipe for disaster, and that's what we're facing. And we're trying to get that changed. So we'll see with the change how long -- if they change it and they go, \"Oh, we didn't mean to include office,\" well, now we don't have that problem anymore.</p><p>OPERATOR: At this time, we show no further questions. Would you like to make any closing remarks?</p><p>JORDAN L. KAPLAN: Yes. Thank you all for joining us. And we hope that very soon in the future, we're able to meet you again in person.</p><p>OPERATOR: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.</p><p>Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.</p><p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. You may begin.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Thank you for joining our call today. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&amp;A.</p><p>These are challenging times as we manage through unprecedented events in our nation's history. We would like to offer our best wishes to all those impacted by COVID-19, their caregivers and those participating on the call today.</p><p>We reported a strong first quarter results last night, exceeding the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance by $0.07, with the results for the quarter mostly unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted in the press release, we withdrew our 2020 FFO guidance ranges. Generally, we believe providing FFO guidance and related assumptions is an important aspect of investor communications. However, in the current environment, we believe that the range of probable outcomes for Essex is too wide to be useful to investors.</p><p>Since the initial shelter-in-place order in the Bay Area was announced on March 17, the nation has experienced over 30 million unemployment claims, and economic uncertainty is as great as I have ever seen. Key variables in the government's policy response are impossible to model such as the duration of the shutdown, the possibility that a second wave of infection could occur and the effectiveness of social distancing during a phased reopening of the economy. After a prolonged debate, we made the difficult decision to withdraw our core FFO guidance.</p><p>In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics: a recap of actions taken in the past 2 months in response to the pandemic, a review of our updated estimates for rent growth in our markets as can be found on Page S-16 of the supplemental and insights into what we're seeing in the West Coast property transaction markets.</p><p>Turning to our response to the pandemic. We have been very impressed with how the Essex team has responded and adapted to the dynamic and unprecedented conditions created by COVID-19. As the scope of the pandemic became more clear in early March, we created a COVID response team comprised of senior leadership to gather information and act decisively. To maintain essential property operations, we implemented a variety of social distancing practices at each property; provided incentives and tools to push nearly all transactions online, over the phone or through the mail. We acquired and distributed PPE to our on-site staff and expanded training for safety protocols. We transitioned 5 corporate offices to work from home and implemented a virtual management process with daily contact via teleconference. In addition, we conducted weekly live video conferences that were available to all Essex employees to ensure consistent messaging and unity in a chaotic time. Communication is important during periods of uncertainty. And on March 23, we issued a press release to outline for investors, employees and residents how the company is going to assist those that are financially impacted by COVID-19, including protection from eviction and late fees, creation of payment plans and dissemination of information about governmental and community resources.</p><p>The past 2 months have required urgent responses to many complex issues, including many unknowables related to the pandemic itself, a plethora of well-intentioned but imprecise government regulations and properly balancing our obligations to stakeholders in the spirit of corporate responsibility. With that backdrop, it's essential to recognize the tireless efforts of the Essex team amid great concern for their health and safety of their families to rapidly and thoughtfully react to the crisis. Well done, team Essex.</p><p>Turning to the West Coast rental markets. We have prepared a scenario for our 2020 rent growth expectations on Slide S-16 of the supplemental that incorporate macro U.S. forecasts for GDP and job growth that are prepared by a broad spectrum of industry and Wall Street economists. While the span of forecasted outcomes is wide to an unprecedented extent, there is a common expectation that the U.S. will experience double-digit declines in second quarter GDP growth and an overall contraction in the economy in 2020, with job losses for the year estimated at around 7%.</p><p>In summary, we expect approximately 900,000 job losses or 6.6% in our West Coast metros in 2020 compared to the net addition of 207,000 jobs from our estimate last quarter. An approximate 14% reduction in estimated total housing deliveries from last quarter is not sufficient to offset the impact of negative job growth, leading to our belief that market rents overall will decline an average of 2.8% in 2020 versus last quarter's estimated 3% increase in market rents.</p><p>The extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus programs that have been implemented by the federal government have already helped stabilize capital markets and should limit the risk of financial contagion. If you consider by contrast the major stimulus programs from the Great Recession, they occurred roughly a year after the recession started. But in today's case, they were just days and weeks into the crisis and have been much larger in scope.</p><p>On Page S-16.1 of our supplemental, we highlight the impact of the $600 per week federal supplement to unemployment insurance that was part of the CARES Act. While the effectiveness of the program has been muted by processing delays at state unemployment offices, the weekly checks have started to arrive and will substantially offset the income loss for a large segment of the population that has suffered from job losses and furloughs. We highlight this program because it hasn't received much attention. Given these benefits, the income shortfalls for lower- to middle-income workers are much less severe than they would have been otherwise. And in some cases, again, at lower- and middle-income levels, some workers will receive more in unemployment benefit as compared to their compensation.</p><p>Finally, I'll turn to the apartment transaction market. Yields or cap rates for apartment transactions generally exceed interest rates on related debt, and the resulting positive leverage is a powerful force in the market. Unlike the great financial crisis, large banks have maintained relatively conservative lending standards and strong liquidity and capital positions, and interest rates have declined further since the crisis began. As an example, we recently received a quote for a 7-year Fannie Mae loan on a joint venture property with a fixed interest rate of 2.75%. We believe these factors will be sufficient to avoid widespread distress in the apartment space.</p><p>Unlike REIT stocks, private market values in terms of cap rates are generally sticky, meaning that they don't change immediately in reaction to events but rather seek to reflect the longer-term financial performance of a property. Generally speaking, many potential buyers are seeking a higher cap rate as a result of the pandemic. However, apartment owners generally have no distress, and exceptionally low interest rates provide the opportunity to improve cash flow through refinance to take advantage of record-low positive leverage. As a result of these factors, the spread between buyer and seller expectations has widened and the gap separating them is probably around 30 to 60 basis points, likely resulting in fewer apartment transactions in the near term. If our stock price was higher, we would be an aggressive buyer in this environment. Historically, periods of disruption have resulted in great opportunity for Essex. I am confident that we have the team, resources and strategy to thoughtfully act on these opportunities, consistent with our long-term track record of outperformance.</p><p>And now I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART, SENIOR EVP &amp; COO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Thank you, Mike. I would like to start by echoing Mike's sentiment and recognize our associates who are working hard to provide our customers the best service in this essential business of providing housing.</p><p>Over the past few weeks, we have seen countless demonstrations of the Essex spirit throughout our community. Our teams have shown grit and determination in the face of rapidly changing working conditions. But even more, they have shown compassion to each other and to our residents, from proactively reaching out to those in need, buying residents groceries and even obtaining and distributing personal protective equipment.</p><p>In addition, we have published resources on our website to assist residents in finding the financial assistance they may need during this time as well as created a library of resources for residents whose children are home from school or who are simply looking for productive ways to use their time during this crisis. Most residents and prospects have been understanding of the changes we needed to make at our communities and appreciative of the great efforts of our team to continue to provide exceptional service during this time. A big thank you to our E-team, our residents and the community. We are truly all in this together.</p><p>Turning to our first quarter 2020 results. We achieved 3.2% revenue growth over the prior year's quarter. The results were in line with our expectations. Although this is the Q1 call, I believe everyone is more interested in recent events post-COVID shelter-in-place orders, therefore I will be focusing on specific April metrics and recent market activity. I'll begin with general comments and move on to the markets.</p><p>As this situation is unprecedented, with numerous key variables impacting both supply and demand, my commentary on the future market expectations and conditions relies on numerous, generally positive assumptions such as the relaxation of the shelter-in-place orders in the near future, a reduction of new supply entering the market and a restart of the economy in an orderly way.</p><p>Currently, the rental market is disrupted. There is a gap between the bid/ask price for rental transactions at certain properties in the market. Rental transactions are disproportionately occurring at stabilized properties, offering 2 to 4 weeks free rent, while other properties are losing occupancy.</p><p>April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up approximately 1.5%, while financial occupancy declined 1.3% compared to the prior year's period. We are currently offering various leasing incentives, which includes 2 to 4 weeks free rent. I expect the market will move back to equilibrium in June as the shelter-in-place requirements are relaxed and we enter the summer leasing season.</p><p>Historically, during periods of reduced demand, our portfolio has benefited from people taking advantage of lower pricing and moving from the outlying areas to the core areas where our portfolio is located. I expect the same market dynamics to play out in the coming months.</p><p>Looking at operations post shelter-in-place, leasing applications in our portfolio bottomed the first week of April and have increased each week since that time. Our same-store financial occupancy decreased 1.3% in April from March. Roughly half of the decline in occupancy was due to COVID-19-related lease breaks. The remainder was related to reduced leasing velocity. This last week, we have seen activity increase dramatically. Our tours increased 47%, and our applications increased 62% over the prior 4-week period average. The initial shock appears to be over, and now the market is moving to equilibrium.</p><p>Now we will turn to April delinquencies. Delinquencies in our total portfolio on a cash basis was 5% in April compared to 33 basis points for the full first quarter of 2020. As the magnitude of this crisis became more apparent in March, we acted immediately to form a resident response team to engage with our residents in understanding their situations, identifying resources for them and partnering with them to get them back on to firm financial ground. As noted in S-15, approximately 4,600 tenants, representing 7.4% of our total portfolio, completed our online request form in April, confirming that they had been financially impacted by COVID-19 and requesting assistance. 36% of those residents paid their April rent in full. Another 36% made a partial payment averaging about 50% of their rent. And 28% were unable to pay their April rent. Residents representing 60 basis points of our portfolio requested to move out immediately, which we allowed, enabling the residents to move forward with their life and the company to potentially avoid future delinquency. Of the residents who stated they were financially impacted by COVID-19, 16% were in the food and beverage industry; 9% each in retail and personal services, which relates to fitness, massage or beautician services; and 7% each in health care, transportation, construction and professional and business services.</p><p>2.2% of our residents are delinquent, and we have been unable to contact them. However, some of them have made partial payments. Interestingly, the delinquency at the property level within a selected market had fairly large variations. Certain properties were substantially more impacted than others. I believe this disproportionate impact is the root cause of the market dislocation. I would compare it to randomly located new lease-ups aggressively attempting to increase occupancy. Owners at the highly impacted buildings with respect to occupancy and/or delinquency as well as those who are struggling to compete in this new virtual sales world are likely to be the ones aggressively offering concessions.</p><p>On to expenses. As Mike has mentioned, we have withdrawn our financial guidance. However, I want to note some expense considerations. Utility usage and related expenses will be higher due to the shelter-in-place mandates. In addition, we expect a significant ongoing increase in expenses related to personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies as well as related increased labor cost due to new cleaning protocols.</p><p>Finally, to protect our employees and residents, we have stopped performing nonemergency work orders in occupied units. We have provided residents with self-help videos and other resources to help them fix many of their own issues. However, we expect that there will be some level of pent-up work orders as conditions change.</p><p>Moving on to our operating strategy in this new environment. Our technology vision and related operating strategy that we have been executing positioned us well going into this rapid change. Our cloud-first strategy enabled a relatively smooth transition as the stay-at-home orders were implemented. We remained fully operational while rapidly transitioning to working from home. The new operating environment of social distancing requires a solid digital presence, including video tours, digital maps, self-help information and related videos as well as smartphones for FaceTime tours and other similar tours. We made the decision early on to rapidly accelerate our technology-enabled transformation, completing the implementation of our mobile maintenance app 2.0, our sales lead management system 2.0 and several other initiatives, shaving 4 to 12 months off the original rollout plans. As the restrictions are relaxed, we are positioned well for this new environment.</p><p>Our operating strategy going forward will balance occupancy and market rents, maximizing revenue. We will likely operate at a lower occupancy than we have over the past several years. We will continue to leverage our technology platform and operate consistent with the social distancing protocols by using a combination of virtual tours and live video tours, where our sales associate is either on site touring a prospect via phone, or the resident is on site and the sales associate is live answering questions and explaining various features and benefits of the particular unit and amenity. Our smart lock digital entry systems enable us to provide access to vacant units for self-tours, thus eliminating the need for agents to be on site to provide access. These were very challenging weeks for certain, but we are emerging from this challenge stronger and we are well prepared for the future.</p><p>Turning to our markets. In the Seattle market, April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up 6.1%, while financial occupancy declined 80 basis points compared to the prior year's period. Delinquency in the northern technology-driven markets were lower. In April, delinquency in our Seattle same-store portfolio was 1.8%, the lowest in our same-store portfolio.</p><p>Moving to Northern California. In the Bay Area, April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up 17 basis points, while financial occupancy declined 1.2%. Delinquencies for the same period in the Bay Area were 3.9%. Our Santa Clara County submarket had the lowest delinquency at 2%, while Alameda, San Mateo and Contra Costa County were 4.1%, 6.3% and 7.9%, respectively. Consistent with the rest of the market, our 4 Bay Area lease-ups, 500 Folsom, Station Park Green, Mylo and Patina at Midtown, had very little activity since late March, which was the result of both the construction challenges as well as reduced demand in the marketplace.</p><p>Continuing South. Southern California same-store economic rents were up 1.1% year-over-year in April 2020, while financial occupancy declined 1.6%. In the same period, our Southern California region had a higher delinquency overall in our same-store portfolio at 7.5%. Ventura and San Diego delinquency was at 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively. Orange County delinquency was 7.5%, and L.A. County delinquency was 9.4%. Our L.A. CBD and Woodland Hills submarkets were the hardest-hit at 12.1% and 13.8%, respectively. As of April 30, our same-store portfolio's physical occupancy was 94.4%, and our availability 30 days out is 6.5%.</p><p>Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Thank you, John. I'll briefly comment on our first quarter results then provide an update on our funding plans and the balance sheet.</p><p>We had a strong start to the year with first quarter same-property NOI growth of 3.9% and core FFO per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.07 and achieving a 7.7% growth compared to the same period last year. As noted in our earnings release, we have withdrawn our 2020 guidance as a result of the unprecedented uncertainty caused by the COVID pandemic. Subsequently, we have enhanced our disclosure by providing additional data on April operations and more liquidity details on Page S-15.</p><p>Turning to our funding plan for investments, stock buybacks and dividends. During the first quarter, we committed $106 million of capital towards structure finance investments at an average yield of 11.2%. The funding for these investments is expected to start around September and occur over a period of 6 to 12 months thereafter, which means our funding needs for 2020 is only about $40 million. Similarly, our development funding needs for 2020 is also de minimis at about $75 million. This represents 50% of our total development commitment shown on Page S-11. In fact, approximately 90% of the current development pipeline is expected to complete lease-up within the next year. We have begun reducing our exposure to direct development several years ago because the rate of construction costs increased at a greater pace than rent growth, ultimately compressing yields. Hence, this is consistent with the plan we have discussed on previous calls.</p><p>Moving on to funding sources. We expect to receive a total of $215 million from structured finance repayments, of which $115 million can be allocated to our investment needs noted earlier and $100 million can be allocated to fund our stock buyback. Since we have repurchased $176 million of stock, the remaining $76 million will be match-funded with cash flow from operations.</p><p>As for our dividends, during the first quarter, we raised the annual dividends by 6.5%, which represents the 26th consecutive dividend increase. We are proud of this track record, which few companies have achieved. Even though cash flow from operations may be lower than the original plan for this year, the dividend remains very secure and covered by free cash flow. With over $1 billion in liquidity, no debt maturities in 2020 and our funding commitments well covered, Essex remains in a strong financial position.</p><p>Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to the operator.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Nicholas Joseph with Citi.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike, you mentioned the transaction market and that your cost of equity isn't where you would like it to be. But if you see good external growth opportunities, either repurchasing your shares or on the acquisition market, would you execute an increased near-term leverage?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Hi, Nick. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I think at this point in time, given this incredible uncertainty, we would like to stay more leverage-neutral in terms of how we approach our different investment types. Not to say that we won't sell property in order to pursue other types of opportunities, but at this point in time, until we see greater clarity because I would say at this point in time, there are more unknowns than knowns out there given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic itself. And so we're going to remain fairly conservative when it comes to leverage for the foreseeable future.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH: And then just maybe on operations. You mentioned the concessions that you're seeing on some stabilized properties. What sort of concessions are you seeing on lease-up properties today in the different markets?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Sure. This is John. The lease-up properties, just going back to the stabilized just for a second, what we're seeing is we're seeing 2- to 4-week pretty common is where we're seeing rental transactions. And I mentioned the comment as far as dislocation because simply looking at asking rents and assuming that asking reflects the actual rent, that's what I'm getting at. It doesn't necessarily reflect that. Where the transactions are occurring is where there are some level of concessions that are going on out there. As we move from the stabilized market, and that, again, back a step, that really relates to what I see as a dislocation that's caused by the impact of some of the delinquencies hitting certain properties and not others, kind of creating many lease-ups out there. I think that will abate in the near future.</p><p>As we move to the lease-ups, the lease-up concessions are closer to 2 months, and there are some other specials that are going on. Again, the whole market just kind of expanded out from shorter concessions on lease-ups and no concessions on stabilized, to 2 to 4 weeks stabilized and basically 8 weeks on a new product across the board. Does that answer your question?</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT, VP, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Curious what your thoughts are on the collections across your markets, married with the comment you said regarding the slow rollout of unemployment benefits, and then also balancing that with some of the tenant activism that's made headlines of late.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes, I'll take that. What we're seeing, I'm going to start with an amazing event, and we're really seeing some good people that were impacted by situations outside their control, really all trying to figure it out and do the right thing. I don't want to focus on the potential of a few bad actors. The reality is we have a lot of great people that are working hard. Our resident response team is engaged with them, and we're seeing good behavior by really the majority of those people. I acknowledge there are some people we haven't connected with. But even those people, some of them have actually paid some levels of rent. They might just be a little bit shellshocked from this whole situation.</p><p>My expectation is that as the government assistance rolls out, that people will probably make as much rent payments as they can. And then again, as I mentioned, we do expect the relaxation of some of the shelter-in-place requirements and a somewhat orderly challenged, but orderly economic improvement. And so we expect to see people starting to go back to work, being able to pay rent. And for those that can't pay rent, they may end up moving out. But again, our markets that we're in benefit from this chronic undersupply. And so what we've always seen in the past is whenever there is some level of a shock, it takes some time, 1 to 3, 4 months, and we start to have people from the outside areas moving into our markets and supporting occupancy and therefore, rents. So I see -- I have a somewhat optimistic view as to how this goes, but again, I want to be very candid that where we are today, there's a little bit of dislocation going on right now.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT: That's helpful. What do you think the likelihood that you collect some of that unpaid or delinquent rent is over time as some of those benefits roll in?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Hi. This is Mike, Austin. We don't know. Honestly, that falls in the bucket of we actually have more unknowns than knowns, which is why we didn't give guidance. I think this is one of the key issues out there. And historically, as John said, we have somewhere around 30 to 40 basis points of delinquency. And it does not present an accounting issue. We just assume. Effectively, we treat it on a cash basis. And so it's a little bit different now. And fortunately, because of the timing of when all this happened, we have pretty much 3 months to work through those issues and have better information.</p><p>We know, historically, that the further you get away from the move-out date, the more difficult it is to collect. And that's just our experience over time. And so we are motivated to move pretty quickly and -- which, of course, many of these eviction prohibitions and other governmental actions prevent us from doing that. And so as John said in his prepared remarks, which I think is important here, that if someone comes to us and says, hey, I'll move out, we're going to likely let them out of their lease, which means that we're going to have a little bit more turnover, but we're going to control the unit at a time when, again, because of these eviction prohibitions, we don't have a lot of choices. So we're working through all that. It's, I think, one of the more complicated issues that we have to deal with, with respect to this whole challenging scenario.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT: That's helpful. And I know there's still a lot of uncertainty, but you guys, kind of leading into this, had preferred equity over ground-up development. I'm curious, as you think about coming out of this and how you want to be opportunistic, how are you weighing those types of investments.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. This is Mike. And Adam is here too so he may want to add something. But yes, we still like the preferred equity investment. We're not in the first loss piece. Again, we come in to those transactions at the point in time that they are beginning construction. So costs are known, financing's in place, et cetera. So we're not taking a great deal of risk upfront. And typically, those deals underwrite to somewhere in the high 4 to low 5 cap rate. And they were, of course, at the -- around the 85% loan-to-value ratio, which means our effective cap rate is somewhere in the mid-5s. So the chances of having distress at that level, I think, is incredibly unlikely. And in terms of investment policy going over -- going forward, direct versus preferred equity, I'll let Adam handle that.</p><p>ADAM W. BERRY, SENIOR VP &amp; CIO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Yes. To echo what Mike has said, we continue to aggressively pursue on the pref equity side throughout this crisis. We've underwritten deals a little more conservatively, increased interest rates commensurately with our additional cost of capital that's happened over the last month or so. And we've continued to identify deals, and we're in the process of due diligence on a number of pref equity deals.</p><p>Going forward, there are definitely development deals out there, and we'll continue to track and monitor. We -- there's some expectation that costs will come back toward us with decreased construction. We haven't seen any of it so far, and we have our finger on the pulse with a number of pref equity deals out there right now. So haven't seen a decrease in pricing, and sellers are very, very hesitant to decrease their pricing expectations. So I think the development world will take a little pause, but we continue to, like I said, aggressively pursue on the -- that side.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.</p><p>NICHOLAS PHILIP YULICO, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just want to first ask on the market rent forecast you gave, which is for market rents being down about 3% this year. Can you just give us a feel for how fast that could manifest in your portfolio in terms of a decline in new lease rates? And I guess I'm also wondering if the impact could be bigger than that on a short-run basis and you assume some sort of recovery in rates in the back half of the year. Any perspective there will be helpful.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Nick. This is Mike, and I'm sure Mr. Burkart has an opinion on this one as well. So I think what you have here is a shock to the system. So -- and anecdotally, lots of people that can't afford their apartment, potentially moving to different places and other things. So that will be the shock to the system. And then there's a recovery. The recovery is almost always people backfilling from further-out locations into areas that are closer to the jobs, and then we benefit from that over time. But this takes time to play out.</p><p>So this presumes, since we were up 3% in Q1, on S-16, last quarter and now we're at minus 2.8%, it assumes a pretty dramatic drop-off in market rents. Of course, we don't turn units. We turn units ratably throughout the year. I think part of that, because we enter what's traditionally a more seasonal period, so the fourth quarter is a little bit more challenging for us on the demand side anyway, we still have the deliveries of apartments into the markets. And so we think it will be pretty choppy going into the fourth quarter, and then we think it recovers from that point on.</p><p>So the other point I would make is John's comment about stabilized concessions. I think that stabilized concessions are assumed to continue in our economic growth forecast on Page S-16. And again, just to remind everyone what this is. This is a scenario based on macro factors, effectively supply/demand factors. When you throw them into our model for what happens with various supply/demand factors, what happens to rents, this is what we get. There's still a whole bunch of unknowns on top of this. Again, the policy issues, will there be more regulation in these markets, which we don't see. We think there's been plenty of regulation, actually, but we don't know what's going to happen with that. The cadence of move-ins and move-outs, we can't predict that. And the collection of the delinquency is another challenging subject. So that's why we decided to give this data on S-16 without giving guidance because there's a whole another level of assumptions. And we think that there's enough very large assumptions embedded in S-16 that it just didn't make sense to push it further.</p><p>NICHOLAS PHILIP YULICO: Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And then just in terms of supply, if we look, Oakland and San Jose are 2 markets that are facing some of the biggest supply deliveries in the second quarter, third quarter of this year. Is your sense that any of those projects have now been delayed in terms of timing? And then also, if you could just maybe tell us in a real-time basis what you're seeing for projects that are delivering and lease-up, I mean is it -- you mentioned 2 months earlier. Is that the norm in these markets? Is it worse than that?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. It's -- it can be worse than that. But I would focus you on the percent of supply, total supply to total stock, which is at 0.6% for the portfolio. And Northern California is a little bit higher at 0.7%. But then, again, Northern California also has more momentum. I think we believe that tech markets are the winner here. And because their business models are pretty COVID-19-resistant for the most part, not that venture capital hasn't been affected, it has a little bit and jobs haven't been affected, they have. Although when we look at, for example, the top 10 technology companies, job openings are down a little bit, but they're still very strong.</p><p>So our view is that the tech markets do better here, and we'll continue on the path of leading the West Coast markets. And obviously, that's been a key part of our investment. So I guess what I'm saying is I would be less concerned about supply in Northern California, given the strength, the overall strength of the job markets and the companies here. Probably, if we have a concern, even though it appears to be the least amount of supply, it's Southern California because it doesn't have the job drivers that Northern California and Seattle have.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.</p><p>NEIL LAWRENCE MALKIN, ANALYST, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to go back to -- I just wanted to kind of go back to the question that Austin brought up. I believe in your supplement, you've called out 2% of the delinquency is -- or 2% of the total rent is people who are not affected by COVID but haven't paid. So that's basically the moral hazard. I guess I would be interested in, if you can at all, Mike, just maybe walk through what markets you're the most concerned about. Obviously, people are talking about rent strikes. It seems like the legislature and judges have no interest of pushing through evictions anytime soon. I guess any more color on how you see that kind of playing out, when you see the eviction, I guess, the market normalizing? And how much worse could that moral hazard get as we continue to have an elevated unemployment environment for a longer period of time?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. It's a good question. And I believe you're talking about, on S-15, the 2.2% which is the percentage of units delinquent in April not requesting assistance. So I guess most of that category is people that we haven't heard from. And I think that there are really 2 components. There is the moral hazard component, those that just want to take advantage of the situation, the various laws and the reluctance of the courts to process evictions, et cetera. But I think there's another piece of that, which is people that are just overwhelmed and/or, for whatever reason, ignore their notices. So I think it's still a little bit early to tell exactly how that breaks down.</p><p>I guess, from my perspective, that's not a huge number in the scheme of things because I know when we were talking to our Board, we gave them a much larger range of delinquents. And so I think our actual experience is better than what we thought. And I was concerned that, to your point, that if you're going to give people, there's no hammer as it relates to evictions, maybe in late fees for some period of time as part of our overall program to try to help residents through this difficult period, et cetera, that there might be more of those people that just say, oh, I'm just not going to pay rent. Keep in mind that they still have a credit issue, and so there is a reason to pay rent. They still owe the money. And we still fully intend to pursue the collection effort. And we will have to approach it a bit differently, given the magnitude of it. And so -- but we're going to still push hard to collect it where we can. So this falls within one of the unknowns, and we're not sure exactly what's going to happen with that category. Fortunately, it's only 2.2%.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. Mike, let me just add. In my comments, I mentioned that those are the people that we haven't spoken with. But I also said some of them have actually paid partial payments. So to be clear, you can't look at that group and say that they're a moral hazard. I'll give you an example. One of the things we did at Essex is we -- early on, realizing the challenge that this was for so many people, we identified residents that have been challenged with us in the past. They may have had reviews that they wrote that they were upset with for whatever reason, and we reached out to them just to check and see how they were doing. The feedback we got was amazing, but what we found is many people were somewhat shellshocked. They really just weren't interacting with the public. And so we had people that were saying, wow, call me back next week. And so I think how this impacted a lot of people were some people just kind of went back into their units and just disconnected from everything, and then others were just trying to work through it. And maybe they were working, and they're connecting with other people.</p><p>So I don't associate the 2.2% as being reflective of moral hazard. I recognize there may be some of that out there. But I think people will come along, and we're seeing good behavior overall. We're hearing amazing stories. So I wouldn't associate that with moral hazard.</p><p>NEIL LAWRENCE MALKIN: All right. I appreciate the detail. Yes. Another one I have is, in terms of the H-1B visa program, I know a lot of that goes to tech. I know a lot of that goes into your markets. And so I'm just wondering if you have any sense as to what that looks like going into the summer. Is that sort of demand or occupancy that you assume now will be lost? And then the venture capital side as well, I guess, sort of like the 2 specific to the West Coast had these demand drivers. I just had questions on that.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Yes, this is Mike again. We haven't spent a lot of time on the H-1Bs, given all the other things that we're working on. Anecdotally, we have not heard -- in terms of what they're actually doing, we know that they don't qualify generally for unemployment. And therefore, to the extent they're displaced, then maybe there's a possibility that they will go home. And so that's out there. But it's just -- it's too hard to tell at this point in time. And I'm sorry, I missed the second part of your question.</p><p>NEIL LAWRENCE MALKIN: Yes. Sure. Sorry. I was just asking about venture capital. You had alluded to it.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, yes. Yes, venture capital. So yes. No, I did. I did. Yes, venture capital, I mean, it still remains strong in our markets, still above the dot-com era. The last funding by quarter last quarter was -- first quarter 2020 was $12 billion versus about $10 billion in the dot-com period, so still strong. Again, anecdotally, we're hearing that venture capital valuations are dropping pretty substantially by a big number. We also -- when we go through the WARN notices or the notices of layoffs, there are a lot of venture capital-funded companies that are on that list. So trying to figure out how to kind of continue operations at a time when valuations are not really attractive. So I would put this in the bucket of still a lot more unknowns than knowns as the venture capital world is trying to figure out what to do.</p><p>I know, in our case, we have our technology fund consortium of -- that the REITs and other multifamily owners put together. And we're seeing some pretty attractive deal flow as a result of that and lower valuations overall. And so we think it's actually a very good time to be an investor in technology at this point in time compared to the recent past.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR, MD AND HEAD OF UNITED STATES REITS, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: If I missed this, I apologize. Can you discuss May collection so far, what you're seeing?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes, you didn't miss it. This is John. They're materially consistent with April. One thing I would say is, because of when the fifth falls, things can move around a little bit, but we're right on path with April.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Okay. Great. And then I believe, Mike, in his opening remarks, talked about an expectation for a decline in market rents in 2020. I believe I heard negative 2.8%. Just given what's going on, it just -- it doesn't seem so bad to me. Again, I know it's down, and you were expecting up 3%-plus. But is that correct? And can you put that in perspective, let's say, versus what you saw during the tech crash or Great Recession, that minus -- was it minus 2.8%?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Jeff. Yes, keep in mind, this is actually published in S-16 of the supplement, where we try to give you an idea of what we think market rents are going to do on average for 2020. And so we come to 2.8%. However, keep in mind, we have 3% rent growth, market rent growth in the first quarter. So to average 2.8% for the year, we expect rents to decline pretty substantially between now and year-end.</p><p>And again, I go back to John's comments about stabilized concessions because if you give away a month free, that's actually a pretty significant reduction in market rents. And I think it's somewhere in that magnitude where we expect, again, as we're working through all the delinquents and some of them are moving out, and we've created more units than we would ordinarily have to rent and now we have to draw people into those units that we think we're going to have to provide more incentive to do that. And so that will be probably mostly in the form of a concession. But I think that's the environment for the rest of the year, and then I think John points this out too, then we probably hit equilibrium at some point in time, we would say, toward the end of the year. And then I think things can recover from that point. Does that make sense?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Yes. And can you compare that -- the minus 2.8% for the year to, let's say, what happened during the tech crash or Great Recession?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Well, overall, market rents declined in the financial crisis about 15% over a couple of years. In terms of -- but keep in mind, we don't actually realize that or realize it over time because we have leases in place. And I actually have these numbers. So in 2009, the reported revenue drop was 2.8%, and 2010 was 3.3%. So we had 2.8% -- same-property revenue dropped 2.8% in 2009, 3.3% in 2010, on an overall, about 15% reduction in market rents. And so as you can tell, I mean the reported numbers are pretty dramatically less than given leases in place compared to the market rent numbers. Does that help?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Yes. It's very helpful.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM, SENIOR REAL ESTATE ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: I was interested in the commentary about the increased tours and applications in the past 4 weeks and trying to compare that with the 140 basis points of occupancy that was lost during April. Do you think that with the increased activity, that occupancy has basically troughed already? And how do those metrics compare year-over-year?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. So the -- I definitely believe that activity troughed. It troughed in the first week of April. And the commentary that I gave related to the last week versus the April average, and it was up substantially. Our applications were up over 60%. So we saw a lot of market activity. So very good outlook going forward. What we're seeing is the market is moving toward equilibrium. We're offering some level of concessions. People are renting units. Things are going in the right direction. That's a good thing.</p><p>As it relates to year-over-year activity, we're definitely lower. It's a little harder to compare because when you look at, say, tours, we're up an infinite amount on virtual tours right now. We had no virtual tours a year ago. And so when you're trying to compare those numbers, it's a little challenging. That's why I gave away the trough, which was the first week of April and then this last week, where we are in comparison. We're continuing to see this with good leasing traffic, good activity. But overall, definitely, the market for April was, and we call it shellshocked, it was less than what it was a year ago in April, but given exact comparisons, it would be misleading.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM: Okay. So the activity is a good leading indicator. I was wondering if you could also clarify the difference between financial and physical occupancy on S-15? That's basically 100 basis points and I'm...</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. Financial occupancy relates to whether or not someone's in our unit for the full month of the period, whatever the period is, compared to our scheduled rent, whereas physical occupancy is just simply looking at the units and whether or not they're occupied. So the -- at one point in time. So our -- we quoted our physical occupancy as of April 30, which was on that day, whereas our financial occupancy for April would have been the whole month. So a little bit different.</p><p>The reason we were doing that is we're trying to give out to people, again, full transparency, give a good understanding of where we ended up because we did end up lower than where we were for the month. I will say, though, that things have picked up and is what you would expect. It's consistent with what I'm saying. We do expect occupancy to continue to pick up. I think that was probably our low point. When you think about it with traffic being in the low at the first week, that's typically going to relate to occupancy being in the low several weeks later and then all of a sudden, it picks up. So this whole thing is working out as expected consistently. And I expect our occupancy will continue to pick up going forward, which it is right now.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM: So is it fair to say that the physical occupancy is a leading indicator for the financial, and then the tours and applications are, I mean, an indicator for both?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER SANDLER &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: And I apologize for the background noise. So a few questions. First of all, I think you guys are pretty bold to let tenants do their own home repairs. I can't wait to see the photos of the aftermath. But 2 questions. So first, Mike, can you just -- you talked about the different markets, and Seattle's strongest, the Northern L.A. suburb's the weakest as far as rent collection. Can you just -- maybe I missed it, but can you just give us some color on urban versus suburban? And especially that you guys have sold down, you've been selling down your urban exposure, so just sort of curious how you're seeing your portfolio rent collections, et cetera, play out between that dynamic?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Sure, Alex. Good question. And yes, I don't want to see the drywall patch job that our residents do for sure. Let's see. The -- I think...</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. I mean I can talk about their delinquency. Yes, I'll talk to...</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Why don't you just start? Yes.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: The delinquency, first off, Alex, we are a high-service shop, so some of the self-help might literally be replacing the lightbulb. But anyway, the -- as to the delinquency, as I mentioned, we aren't really seeing a high-rise versus low-rise of rent. We're not seeing correlations as it relates to that. When I look at the -- what occurred, certain assets were impacted more than others. And when I dug deep into that, you could see the logic, like an asset that perhaps is next to a mall or one that's highly impacted by a school, and you could understand what was going on. But then when I tried to apply that fact to other assets that had similar situations, next to a mall, 10 miles away, or highly impacted by a school, the results weren't the same. It was really interesting and unique.</p><p>And what I did find, though, is that there was a submarket distinction, and that's why I brought up the submarkets. And so Downtown L.A. was highly impacted. And that's why I brought that one up specifically as was the Woodland Hills, and Woodland Hills has exposure to the entertainment industry. So we did see those types of impacts. We also saw regional impacts, less in the Pacific Northwest. And of course, there, we have a lot of assets on the Eastside, many of them are garden-style and that type of thing, really low impact. And then in the middle was the Bay Area, and in more in the South, we had greater impact. Some of it was the Disneyland effect.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. And Alex, let me pick up on that. So yes, we have sold some buildings in the downtown. MaSo, as you'll recall, was sold in Q4 of last year and 8th &amp; Hope the year before, one in Downtown San Francisco, one in Downtown L.A. And I would say, most of that motivated by some of the issues and the grittiness of the downtown and our expectation for some of the areas to be cleaned up more quickly and transition more quickly than they did.</p><p>So I think that, that continues to be a pretty significant issue here on the West Coast. And our performance has been -- it's been okay in the downtowns. It hasn't been great because of some of those factors. And so our -- we become more suburban over time. And again, with -- we want to own property in the, I would say, B- to A quality area, in areas near jobs and never too far from the major job nodes. And I would say that suburban generally has outperformed the urban here on the West Coast. I realize that, in other markets, you can have different outcomes.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. And then the second question is sort of going to that geographically. Obviously, New York, here, we've been really hit hard. But speaking to folks in the rest of the country, including out even in the Bay Area, it seems like COVID has really been much less of an impact and that there's a sense of people who want to get back to their jobs much quicker than the politicians want. So in your view, do you sense that there's this pent-up demand where people are ready to get back to their jobs, and you guys may even rebound quicker than people think just because the level of COVID is less and the people are just far ready for it because they don't have to rely on mass transit? Or do you think that it will take longer to reopen in your markets?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: It is the million-dollar question. And certainly, I don't have an answer to it. I put this definitely in the unknown category. I think that we tend to have high-income levels out here, and the people that are earning high incomes want to consume services. And the services, for the most part, restaurants and a variety of things, those services are really not open at this point in time. So I think that there is a motivation to start opening things up again.</p><p>Having said that, there -- I think the governmental entities are incredibly, let's say, conservative and concerned about surge capacity and some of the other issues that go along with it. So we're going to take it one day at a time and can't exactly predict what's there. But I totally agree with you. I think that the demand for services is building and is pretty intense out there. And so hopefully, that motivates. We've seen various different things on the news about this in terms of closing the L.A. beaches. Boy, that's a tough one, but because people want to get out and go do things. So I can't exactly tell you what's going to happen, but I definitely can feel the pressure building.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>RICHARD HILL, HEAD OF U.S. REIT EQUITY &amp; COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DEBT RESEARCH AND HEAD OF U.S. CMBS, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just wanted to follow up on the negative 2.8% macro forecast. And by the way, thank you very much for that. I'm sure it's not easy to put together right now. But I think one of the things that I'm certainly trying to understand, and I think a lot of people are trying to understand, is the cadence of that. And I'm not looking for you to give a specific guide. But maybe if you could just walk us through if you think you're going to see a deeper 2Q '20 trough and then a quicker rebound. Or is it going to be more stable but down over the course of the year? And the reason I asked the question is I think about your -- I think it was a negative 7% job growth forecast for the year, which is a little bit more severe than Morgan Stanley was projecting, which maybe suggests that you're expecting it to be delayed out but maybe not as deep in 2Q. So any color you could provide on that, that would be really helpful.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Rich. This is Mike. And I think I went through some of this previously. But the job forecast and the GDP forecast or estimates, again, we survey a wide range. We don't do any fundamental research as it relates to the macroeconomy. And as you know, there's wide dispersion of what people think is going to happen. And as we sort of triangulated all that, we got the minus 900,000, 6.6% job loss in our West Coast markets. So that's where that came from.</p><p>We don't -- again, we don't add -- we don't try to add value. We just try to report the facts as it relates to that. What this has intended to do is take those macro forces and consider what would happen with rents in a normal situation because we don't have a COVID-19 model because we've never been through this before. But in a normal situation, if you had minus 6.6% jobs -- job growth and you had about 0.9% apartment deliveries, what would happen with rents? And so that's where the 2.8% number came from in terms of our rent forecast, minus 2.8%. And again, that compares to plus 3% that we achieved in the first quarter. So in order to average minus 2.8% for the year, when you to start with 3 months of 3, yes, things get pretty ugly in the second half of the year.</p><p>We view this as more just part of the shock of -- to the system. There's been an extraordinary shock to the system. And I think John's equilibrium comment is the right one. We need to get back to equilibrium, and there will be short-term pain in order to get back to equilibrium. And best I can tell, it's going to be somewhere around 1 month free on stabilized communities, which is sort of embedded into the minus 2.8%. So that's where it comes from.</p><p>And -- but this is just our modeling. This is what happens in our rent forecasting model when you put these various pieces in. Again, it doesn't reflect a COVID-19 scenario and the extraordinary uniqueness of the situation. So it could be different. And again, this is why we didn't follow up with this and then push into guidance because there's a whole another set of assumptions that would go into that.</p><p>RICHARD HILL: Yes. Yes. And I -- that's helpful, and I recognize I'm asking a tough question. It sounds like, given the 1-month free concessions right now, and hopefully, those will burn off towards the end of the year, maybe we could assume something more than severe than the negative 4.75 that the average for the next 3 quarters would assume in 2Q and then gradually getting better because I think you had noted that you begin to inflect in 1Q '21. So I was just trying to get my hands around what does that average look like. And it sounds like it might be a little bit deeper in 2Q but then start to get better as the year progresses.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. In our model, it gets progressively worse because, again, you have seasonality that comes into the equation. Although we would say Q3 is normally our best quarter, let's say, and we're not going to get the benefit of the positive seasonality, and so maybe the negative which typically comes in the fourth quarter will be more muted. But we just don't know. So we -- the way that our model runs is it gets progressively worse, and then we'll hit bottom sometime in Q4 and then rebound from there.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman &amp; Associates.</p><p>HARDIK GOEL, VP OF RESEARCH, ZELMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES LLC: And Mike, congratulations on buying back stock. Second downturn in a row. That said, I really wanted to get your thoughts on -- you guys talked -- you guys track the labor market really well. We've gotten great commentary in the past about what job trends are like. What does your work there really tell you about not just start-up employment but employment from the big tech companies? And how would that compare to last year? Can you contextualize that?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: We can. Let's see, let me pull out a slide on the big tech companies, which I have here somewhere. But again, we -- there's a piece of it that we don't know, and that is to what extent do things open up as we -- as California and Washington open up, how many of those jobs will come back. Will it be half the restaurants that get -- that become filled given social distancing? And that's kind of our best guess, but that, of course, means that the other half don't come back immediately, and what happens with them. So this is part of the unknown with respect to that part of it. And again, I think the good thing about our markets is that we have high-income people. We generally are in the better areas. And people have the -- want to consume services, which are not there right now, but I think there's going to be a lot of pressure to bring them back. So I guess that's the first statement.</p><p>In terms of specifically, our process of tracking what's happening with the top 10 tech companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market, we have, let's see, total openings at 22,900 as of May 1, 2020. So that compares to last quarter of -- at March 27, it was about 28,000 or 29,000. So there's been about a 20% reduction there. But if you go back in time, you hit about the same level as Q4 '18 in terms of the number of open positions, so Q3, Q4 '18 in terms of the number of positions open. So I would put that in the still-strong category. And even though it's off, it's off the all-time high that we achieved last quarter. So I think still pretty compelling. Does that help?</p><p>HARDIK GOEL: And just as a follow-up to that. I think John mentioned a few times -- and that is really helpful, by the way. John mentioned a few times equilibrium pricing. And I was just wondering what do you guys see as equilibrium maybe in 2021 once we're past some of this uncertainty. Is it the economic environment stronger than 4Q '19? Or is it something where we still have a 6% unemployment rate and pricing power inherently is not as strong as the late cycle?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Again, I think this is -- goes within the category of, hey, there's been an extraordinary shock to the system and the markets are trying to find equilibrium, but they're changing as time goes on. Again, there are people that are on unemployment. Some of them will be brought back and -- to work. And some of them won't have a job, given you're probably going to chop the capacity of a restaurant in half, for example. And maybe that's made up with delivery or pickup-type services or whatever, but it's just going to be different. And I would say it's beyond our ability to really predict with any degree of certainty when it comes to what that scenario is going to look like, which -- but it will -- we will have equilibrium.</p><p>Historically, when you talk about the great financial crisis or 9/11 or the dot-com period, these periods go on for maybe 18 months and then kind of turn the corner. In this case, I think we've had all the negative part of that 18 months in 1 month. And so it's all been compressed, and then now we have the second part where we're hopefully hitting bottom and now we're recovering. So I would expect that whole process, therefore, to compress to maybe 9 months or something like that.</p><p>HARDIK GOEL: Got it. That's really helpful. And just if you would oblige me one last one. Could you give us a range of the prices in which you bought back stock? I know the average was [2 27]. And I may be reaching here, but I have to try.</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Hi. This is Angela. I think you're trying to be a troublemaker here. So let's just leave it as is. That's our average and that's what we report. Yes, I'll give you some credit for trying.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI, ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just one for me. Mike, there's been a flurry of cities to enact their own type of rent freeze measure, and I realize most of them won't really impact your portfolio at all because they abide by Costa-Hawkins. There's a few examples of cities kind of violating Costa-Hawkins right now, but again, a de minimis impact, at least from [our lands] in your portfolio. When you step back and you evaluate the legislative landscape, is there anything on your radar that would prohibit your renewal pricing power beyond your own proactive 90-day window? Is there any issues with any cities later in the year where you won't be able to push renewals?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Well, John, I know you guys tracked us pretty well, and we do, too. And there have been all kinds of proposals out there. Fortunately, most of them have not moved forward. And in California, obviously, we have AB 1482, which is statewide rent control, imposing a cap of CPI plus 5 with a cap of 10. So we're managing through that environment. Fortunately, the more aggressive proposals have not been adopted, thank goodness.</p><p>I would say the one that was most concerning, really, maybe 2 of them, one is L.A. extending the rent payment program out a year. And then there's the judicial council that essentially is not going to hear eviction cases for some period after the state of emergency is raised. So we track it, but we think that, for the most part, we're working through it. And as John said, the good news is that most of our residents have chosen a higher path of working with us to work through their situation. And again, I look at that 2% bucket that hasn't communicated with us as being probably, ultimately, good news with respect to those that aren't trying to take the maximum advantage of these various laws.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Wes, you there?</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY, VP &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Well, sorry, I forgot this whole mute function. Sorry about that. Looking at S-16, the 2.8% rent decline, have you made any adjustments to the Essex model for the CARES Act neutralizing job loss?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: No. I don't -- no, we have not. Again, this is -- take the macro inputs, job growth, GDP growth, supply, and it's straight, this is what comes out of our model if we put those factors in and again, for the marketplace. So I think the CARES Act will definitely help. That's referring to S-16.1. And the pretty great unemployment benefits that are out there, I think that helps with respect to people hopefully being able to stay in our units longer and paying rent for a longer period of time and minimizing the damage. Even if they pay a half a month, that may be okay. At least they don't accrue a balance that becomes so large that they just can't -- we just finance it. So I think it will help. It will help more on the delinquency side probably than it will on the rent side.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: Okay. And then did you comment already about retail exposure?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: No. I'm glad to hit that. Retail is a really small part of our portfolio, like 1%, 1.5%. Our retail delinquency was basically about half of the retail tenants paid what they owed. So it was roughly in line with other things I've seen in the industry. That group of retail where they're located at multifamily sites typically are relatively handing out their service providers. So when the business shuts down, they struggle. We're working with really all of them and are pretty hopeful that they will be able to reopen back up. And we also will work with them on payment plans. So -- but that group was hit hard, and we've seen that really across the industry in everything I've seen.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.</p><p>HAENDEL EMMANUEL ST. JUSTE, MD OF AMERICAS RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So Mike, I guess I was intrigued by your comments earlier on not being afraid to capitalize on the transaction markets should the right opportunities emerge. And I had flashbacks to the time around the great financial recession when you guys backed up the truck and acquired a sizable amount of newly completed or near-completion construction and lease-up type of assets. Those deals you're going to merge with BRE were instrumental in lowering your portfolio age and broadening your submarket and price point selections in your California market. So I guess I'm curious if you would be similarly interested in buying up busted condo projects or development lease-ups in size. And would you be more willing to cull from the bottom of your portfolio to fund it or perhaps use a fund structure to pursue these types of deals?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Haendel, those are great questions. I guess the difference between now and the great financial crisis, in the great financial crisis, you had mortgages being made to people that couldn't afford to pay them back. And the amount of distress within the housing sector was extraordinary, as you'll recall, which created this opportunity to buy vacant brand-new condo buildings at 50% of replacement. There is nothing even close to that out there at this time. And again, my comments in the script about record-high positive leverage. If you take a typical deal that might be a 6, let's say, 6.5 unlevered IRR with positive leverage, you're probably in the high 9s to low 10s, somewhere in that zone in terms of IRR -- levered IRR. So I think that, that is going to prevent any kind of significant distress within the markets. Of course, there are always some transactions that manage to find very aggressive lenders, and they manage to leverage our property up to 90% or more. And they're out there for sure, but they are few and far between, I would guess, at this point in time.</p><p>So in terms of our basic view of transactions, we view it as, okay, what can we do with our portfolio on a leverage-neutral basis? So what's the arbitrage ability within our portfolio? What can we sell and replace at a higher overall yield or growth rate or IRR, let's say? And how do we transact? So we're always thinking about it that way.</p><p>And so I would say that preferred equity is still pretty important to us. It's still sort of at the top of our list. And also, I would say, certainly, joint ventures, which take greater advantage than on our balance sheet, or a little bit higher leverage than the joint ventures at -- when we begin, and then, of course, that leverage drops over time but utilizes the leverage to a small extent or to some extent beyond that. So I would say those 2 things are transactions that we're looking at and are interested in. And I didn't mean to exclude Adam from this discussion because he's the expert at it. Adam, what did I miss?</p><p>ADAM W. BERRY: You nailed it all, Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Did that help, Haendel?</p><p>HAENDEL EMMANUEL ST. JUSTE: It did. It did. I appreciate that. I want to go back to an earlier question, I guess, from a different angle. Just I'm curious if you're hearing anything in terms of rent forgiveness bills being contemplated in California and Washington beyond the tenant protection on -- for the temporary ban on evictions that we've been hearing here. As I'm sure you know, New York state is kind of contemplating such a forgiveness bill. I think it's NY S1825. So I'm curious if there's anything you're hearing. And it's -- just more broadly, as a concept, does that even work? Or how would that work? Just the idea of the government stepping in and telling landlords to forgive 1, 2, 3 months free rent. So curious on maybe what you're hearing and what you're thinking on that.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Well, clearly, this is California, and so you're going to hear some of those things and there have been various proposals out there. And we don't think that they're constitutional, but that doesn't necessarily stop them from being circulated. There actually is a bill in Sacramento, AB 828, that would give the courts the right to force landlords under certain circumstances to reduce rents by 25%. We think it's unlikely. But it's out there. We think it's very unlikely. We don't think it will happen.</p><p>And again, from what we understand in all these discussions throughout the West Coast, which are mainly cities, there have been a lot of proposals, but the city attorneys have been pretty good at pointing out the legal peril with respect to that position. So they have -- those bills have not been passed. And I think at this point in time, it appears that we're beyond that period where we're getting what seems to be a new legal mandate a day. We're kind of beyond that period now, and I think we're more in the period of let's figure out how to get back to work and open up. So I think that, from a timing perspective, the time for those bills has come and gone.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for closing comments.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Please call or e-mail us with any questions or comments. And our best wishes to you and your family during this challenging time. Thank you. Good day.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Good afternoon and welcome. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2020 first quarter results. With me today are Scott Howe, our CEO; Warren Jenson, President and CFO; and Anneka Gupta, President and Head of Products.</p><p>Today's press release and this call may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a detailed description of these risks, please read the Risk Factors section of our public filings in the press release. LiveRamp undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to any of our forward-looking statements. A copy of our press release and financial schedule, including any reconciliation to non-GAAP financial measures, is available at liveramp.com. Also during the call today, we will be referring to slide deck posted on our website.</p><p>At this time, I'll turn the call over to Scott.</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, LIVERAMP HOLDINGS, INC.: Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered another solid growth quarter in Q1, building on last year's strong momentum. For the quarter, revenue was up 32% and excluding the lost revenue from Facebook, up 39%. Our subscription business grew 33% driven by our enterprise and agency channel. And Marketplace &amp; Other was up over 70% due to the continued strength of our data marketplace.</p><p>Beneath the top line, we made continued investments to drive operational excellence and innovation, fueled durable growth and further solidify our competitive position. We launched Authenticated Traffic Solution, or ATS, to power a safe and transparent way to connect advertisers with publishers; and closed our acquisition of Data Plus Math to provide the TV ecosystem with a more effective way to buy, sell and measure data-driven television. And finally, we doubled down on our commitment to you, our shareholders, buying back nearly 70 million of stock as part of our ongoing share buyback program since March 31.</p><p>During the course of our prepared remarks in today's call, you will hear the following 4 themes: number one, our business is strong and the macro trends continue to move in our direction; number two, our platform is highly defensible and our competitive moats are widening; number three, our strategic initiatives remain on track and we have a lot of conviction on our path to $1 billion; and number four, while we are pleased with our progress, we see a lot of areas in which we can do even better and are plotting a course to do just that.</p><p>The market trends propelling our business remained strong. Data is the key to great customer experiences, and our platform plays a critical role in helping customers break down data silos and navigate the growing ecosystem complexity. The use of people-based data creates greater accountability, drives higher ROI and powers more meaningful experiences for consumers. These capabilities should be available for the good of all rather than reserved for a few digital giants. We are central to ensuring an open and level-playing field for all participants. Finally, at the same time as data protection and consumer data privacy reach a tipping point, we are quickly emerging as the open and safe choice. The safe haven that enables our customers to transform data into value while honoring the privacy and preferences of the consumer.</p><p>On our last call, I shared our 3 strategic imperatives for FY '20, and I'd like to provide a brief update on each. The first key focus area for us this year involves delighting and growing our customer base, which points directly to the land and expand component of our model. We made good progress on new logo acquisition in Q1, adding over 25 net new direct customers across our different customer verticals. We ended the quarter with over 690 direct subscription customers, up from 585 a year ago, and we are proud to now serve more than 20% of the Fortune 500.</p><p>Our enterprise and agency channel, again, was strong, with several larger than average ACV deals getting signed in the quarter. For example, we signed a new deal with a large travel and tourism company to help enable more effective online targeting and measurement. This company has historically been a big direct mailer and was interested in leveraging its customer and prospect data to inform more personalized digital advertising. Since the vast majority of their bookings occur offline, they also wanted to better understand how their online spend drives offline conversions. We are distributing their data to several media platforms for targeting, site personalization and closed-loop measurement.</p><p>Another new win this quarter was with a leading fashion brand. This large, multinational retailer selected LiveRamp to help better leverage its purchase data to deliver hyper-targeted digital experiences to its customer segments. We were originally introduced to this brand through a reseller and as their data strategy became more sophisticated, they went direct with us. They are currently leveraging the Google Customer Match use case along with sending their customer segments to a variety of social and display platforms for targeting.</p><p>As we have for the last 8 years, we are always going to be transparent about what is working well and where we see opportunities for even better performance. In the quarter, net dollar retention came down from where it has trended historically. And while we signaled a decline at our last call, we're aiming higher and view this as an opportunity to generate even stronger growth, higher customer satisfaction and reduce churn. As we scale to $1 billion, upsell is going to become a more important driver of our business, so let me share our plans to strengthen this component of our growth equation.</p><p>First, we recently implemented a field strategy function inside sales to drive greater rep effectiveness and productivity. This group is tasked with improving focus on sales trading and enablement. Second, we've strengthened our selling efforts to drive greater and more advanced upsells. We formed a strategic growth team that owns and drives all advanced measurements, analytics and data lake use cases and continue to invest in subject matter experts to provide overlays for Horizon 2 and 3 growth initiatives.</p><p>And finally, we are building tighter integration and go-to-market strategies with key technology partners, agencies and consultancies. More complex use cases like advanced analytics, IDL-based data lakes and data sharing strategies require significant customer expertise. And while our more advanced clients have this expertise, many are still building it. By working with key agencies and technology partners to develop turnkey solutions, we can make it easier for our less sophisticated clients to take advantage of these more involved use cases.</p><p>A great example of this is the work we are doing with Marketing Evolution partners. Marketing Evolution provides a multitouch attribution platform that is built on IdentityLink. And by creating a very tight technical integration as well as go-to-market alignment, we are bringing a joint solution to market. This partnership and approach has proven to be really successful, and we have a pipeline of the digital partnership opportunities we are pursuing.</p><p>The second initiative is to establish LiveRamp as the trusted best and essential industry standard for connected data. The work we are doing inside our commercial and product teams to drive ubiquity of our identity and increase the extensibility of our platform directly ladders up to this effort. We invented the category of connected data and identity and believe we have a superior product. Anneka and her team have worked hard to ensure we're a leader in worldwide data stewardship and that our graph has ubiquity and redundancy that span multiple channels. But again, this is an area on which we will never rest, and we intend to continue building more automation, easier integrations and better efficacy in all of our products.</p><p>And finally, we have several initiatives underway to aggressively expand our addressable market. Our emerging business initiatives falls squarely within this effort, and we continue to be pleased with our progress across this group of growing opportunities. In the quarter, our marketplace business grew by more than 70%, excluding Facebook driven by growing global demand for ethically sourced, people-based data and a trend towards BYOD, or Bring Your Own Data. In addition, we continued to be incredibly encouraged by our TV opportunity, which grew multiples with the acquisition of Data Plus Math. The integration is underway and on track, and our role inside this ecosystem is growing in importance.</p><p>Simply put, there is no other company in the space today that is helping to power all aspects of advanced or data-driven television in the way LiveRamp has. Excluding Data Plus Math, which will be included in our results beginning in Q2, our TV business grew roughly 30% in the quarter driven by an increase in addressable TV campaign volumes and our ramping CTV business. Importantly, our bookings outlook for the remainder of the year gives us even more confidence in this business. We are seeing contract values expand as more homes become addressable, and the growing data enablement of CTV inventory presents another strong tailwind for our business.</p><p>While these efforts give us optimism for the future, we must continue to evangelize our capabilities across the entire ecosystem. There are thousands of companies who currently advertise on television, and we want all of them to be aware of how Data Plus Math can help them generate even better performance. Likewise, almost any company who is doing any marketing can generate better results by utilizing Data Store.</p><p>With that, I'll close by thanking our exceptional customers, partners and LiveRampers for their ongoing support and hard work. The market trends driving our business remain intact, and we continue to believe it is early morning for LiveRamp and our opportunity. We are off to a strong start in FY '20, and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the quarters ahead.</p><p>I'll now turn the call to Anneka to discuss our product strategy in more detail.</p><p>ANNEKA R. GUPTA, CO-PRESIDENT, LIVERAMP, INC.: Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to join today's call. As Scott mentioned, our focus inside product is to establish LiveRamp as a trusted industry standard for connected data. To do this, we have built a defensible and extensible identity and data connectivity platform for the enterprise, one that anyone and everyone in the industry can use as an integral part of their own independent technology.</p><p>In everything we do, we are an agnostic, neutral and trusted partner for the industry. We are essential to a competitive ecosystem and to enabling our customers to deliver great experiences to their customers. We help our customers and partners navigate the growing industry and regulatory complexity impacting their businesses. And we believe our unique positioning enables us to help the entire industry in 3 important areas that I'll discuss today: identity, data stewardship and innovation.</p><p>Identity may be one of the most misunderstood concepts in our industry because the term means many different things to different people. Today, there is a proliferation in unique and proprietary identifiers, including names, addresses, e-mails, first-party cookies, third-party cookies, mobile ad IDs, subscriber and user IDs, device IDs and many, many more. Within the complex landscape of fragmented identity, one thing is clear: no one company has a complete view of their own customers' preferences, and every company needs a trusted and neutral translation layer that enables identity and data to be accessed and connected across an ecosystem of participants.</p><p>This concept of connected identity is the essential role that LiveRamp fulfills for the industry. We are too often asked if we compete in identity with the very partners we actually connect. Our goal isn't to own all identity but rather to power every owner of identity to get greater value from their data. As we embed new identifiers, integration and partners into our product, our customers gain access to more capabilities to configure, manage and activate their own version of identity. At the same time, our efforts enable ecosystem interoperability and protects participants from being held captive to any single source of identity.</p><p>We're doing this in many ways. So let me highlight just a few. We've added a number of new identifiers and increased coverage in emerging addressable channels. Consumers consume content across an increasing number of medium, and our customers want to talk to these consumers in this omnichannel context wherever they are. For example, our customers can now reach over 55 million people on Connected TV, over 70 million people through our MVPD integration and over 80% of the U.S. population through our premium publisher integration. Our customers will be able to reach people across display inventory, regardless of the availability of third-party cookies or mobile advertising IDs through LiveRamp's authenticated traffic solution offering, launching at the end of August. More about this later.</p><p>Through our Smart Reach program, advertisers can broaden their identity coverage by sharing first-party identities in a permissioned and nondiscoverable context. In the last year alone, we've grown our mobile Smart Reach contribution by 350%. Off-line contribution, 19x and online contribution by more than 20%. We don't believe third party cookies are going away in the near term, as it would be hugely disruptive to the ecosystem and to competition.</p><p>That said, we are taking steps to enable addressability regardless of whatever industry shift may occur in the future. For example, in the last year, we incorporated LiveRamp's IdentityLink into the bidstream for programmatic display. IdentityLink is the only people-based, omnichannel identifier available in the bidstream. We now have billions of bid requests with an IdentityLink available on this to bid. 4 out of the top 5 SSPs are currently committed to implementing IdentityLink in the bidstream, and we have 11 DSPs live or implementing the ability to bid directly on IdentityLink. We are pleased with the progress that urge those across the ecosystem, publishers, DSPs and SSPs to collaborate together and not take the foot off the gas in future proofing their businesses.</p><p>And finally, through our Authenticated Traffic Solution, or ATS, suppliers can ensure stable relationships with their customers and monetization of their traffic. ATS enables IdentityLink to be directly tied to first-party identifiers so that publishers can own their first-party relationship with the user and effectively make their inventory addressable to advertisers. This enables publishers to build enduring business model, independent of the whims of big tech.</p><p>Beyond identity, a second area where we are well positioned to play an important role for our customers and partners is in the rapidly changing construct of data stewardship. We live in a world of complexity. The consumer protection afforded by GDPR were accompanied by regulatory complexities that impacted many businesses. And that complexity is growing, with new regulation contemplated in many additional international markets in many U.S. states and at the federal level. And data stewardship extends far beyond legislation.</p><p>For instance, any company wanting to collaborate with any other company needs to ensure control, visibility and permissioning over what data is shared, how it is used and within what limitation. Understandably, companies that want to leverage their own customer data often feel overwhelmed by how to navigate the complexity, do what's right by consumers and appropriately protect an increasingly valuable asset and source of competitive advantage data. We feel this is a tremendous tailwind for LiveRamp and have taken steps to ensure we provide value to the ecosystem as a safe, trusted choice to enable companies to operate within legal and ethical parameters.</p><p>More specifically, we are ensuring our customers and partners are ready for regulatory change. Preparing for GDPR and being responsive to new rulings and interpretations of the law has prepared us really well for tackling CCPA readiness. There are 3 key areas of focus for us as it relates to CCPA readiness. The first is policy. We are updating our privacy policies to ensure that California consumers understand and are informed about their rights under the CCPA. The second area of focus is reviewing our contracts to ensure that all parties who interact with our network are transmitting data in a privacy space-compliant manner. And the third area of focus is ensuring our product and system recognize and support core stipulation of the CCPA, like perpetuating consumer opt-outs downstream.</p><p>We're also making it easier for the ecosystem to collect and manage consumer permission. Faktor is core to this effort, and its consent management platform for CCPA is set to launch later this fall. And we continue to serve as the trusted safe haven across businesses. We are often one of the only companies that our customers trust with access to their PII. This is because time and time again, we have shown that we are ethical stewards of data and that philosophy is built into the very foundation of how we build our product.</p><p>In addition to identity and data stewardship, LiveRamp catalyzes and accelerates innovation for our entire ecosystem. Increasingly, we see our customers collaborating with one another across LiveRamp's platform to create entirely new products. And we believe that by making our product ever more modularized, we can unlock further innovation in our ecosystem.</p><p>Let me give you a couple of current examples. A neutral, data safe haven for measurement. Social media, premium publishers, search and other publisher platforms going as supported businesses need to be able to show ROI and enable granular optimization for advertisers. Without LiveRamp's data connectivity, these platforms are limited to tracking only online or mobile conversion in their ROI analysis. However, across retail today, less than 11% of sales are online.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, LiveRamp has been developing programs with publishers to bring in-store sales data from retailers safely and securely into these platforms to enable omnichannel measurement. A few years ago, we had only a handful of these programs. Today, we enable source sales measurement into over 15 platforms and have over 50 clients leveraging one or more of these programs. These programs are often packaged and sold directly by publishers as a holistic advertising and measurement product.</p><p>Modularization and seamless integration. We are currently at the tail end of our migration to Google Cloud Platform, which is a critical step in the scalability of our business. We are laying the groundwork today to execute in our API platform strategy post migration to both simplify our internal platforms and expose more functionality externally. Many customers, both brands and platforms, are building their own identity graph, and they are looking for faster and easier ways to do identity translation within their own environment.</p><p>Through our efforts to modularize and expose more external APIs, we are creating greater flexibility for our customers to develop on top of our core identity and data connectivity capability. The future of LiveRamp is bright, in part because of the amazing ecosystem of customers and partners who continue to give us feedback, hold us to ever higher standards, collaborate with us on launching new products of their own design and bring us new ideas that push the boundaries and inspire us.</p><p>Every company's building identity we see as a potential partner, not as a competitor because this opens new opportunities for us to connect and catalyze identity across the ecosystem. We see regulation as an opportunity to strengthen permissions around data collection and usage with our customers and partners. And while we will continue to drive innovation within our own product, we see an even greater opportunity to power innovation across our customer and partner ecosystem.</p><p>I'll close where I started. In everything we do, we are an agnostic, neutral and trusted partner for the ecosystem. And that's a pretty exciting place to be.</p><p>With that, I will turn the call to Warren.</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON, PRESIDENT, CFO &amp; EXECUTIVE MD OF INTERNATIONAL, LIVERAMP HOLDINGS, INC.: Thanks, Anneka, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, highlighted by our growth initiatives and continued execution against our opportunity set.</p><p>A few callouts. Our business is strong, predictable and is benefiting from multiple growth levers. Total revenue increased 32% and on a normalized basis, increased 39%. Subscription revenue increased 33% and our total company run rate is now $332 million. ARR is approximately $240 million, up more than 30% year-over-year.</p><p>While we always have more to do, our growth levers are working. Land, expand and extend is fast becoming a way of life. In the quarter, marketplace revenue was up over 70%. LiveRamp TV grew approximately 30%, and the Data Plus Math integration is going extremely well. Our B2B business was up over 50%. Dollar-based net retention was 108%. The sequential decline was driven by lower upsell, the bulk of which was driven by the lapping of a few large customer upsells and to a lesser extent, nonregrettable churn.</p><p>We are enterprise SaaS and serve the enterprise needs of the martech ecosystem. We serve many of the best brands in the world. During the quarter, we added more than 25 net new subscription customers and currently have over 200 brands and platforms using our Data Store. Subscription revenue was 83% of total revenue and has contributed more than 80% of total revenue since Q1 of 2017, the period in which we began reporting our standalone results.</p><p>Our product is differentiated and defensible. We are not a media platform and do not operate an arbitrage model. We are middleware for the customer experience economy. We provide the infrastructure from which the ecosystem delivers personalized and innovative products and services.</p><p>Operationally, we continue to tighten. In products and operations, our migration to the Google Cloud is on track, and our technical teams are working every day to drive higher levels of automation and innovation into our platform. In sales and marketing, we're standardizing and enhancing our product offerings. We are working to shorten deal cycles, improve rep productivity and increase customer ROI. And finally, in our staff functions, we have largely completed the build-out of our standalone capabilities. Taken together, along with our growing market opportunity, we are in a strong position to be profitable in FY '21.</p><p>Lastly, we continue to appropriately balance investment in our growth initiatives and acquisitions, with returning capital to our shareowners. In the quarter, we closed the Faktor acquisition and announce the acquisition of Data Plus Math. Since March 31, we have repurchased 1.4 million shares for a total consideration of $69 million. Since the inception of our program, we now have repurchased over 35 million shares for a total consideration of more than $1 billion.</p><p>In summary, while we have much to do, we believe the macro winds are squarely at our back. We are Switzerland. Our service is more important than ever in helping brands create great customer experiences. The breadth and neutrality of our services is foundational to enabling a healthy, open and competitive ecosystem.</p><p>For the remainder of my remarks, I'd like to walk through a few specifics from the quarter, remind you of our approach to capital allocation and end with an update on our FY '20 guidance.</p><p>Q1 results and activities. In the quarter, we closed the Faktor acquisition for a total consideration of approximately $5 million. We also announced the acquisition of Data Plus Math. Total purchase price was $150 million comprised of $120 million in cash and $30 million of time-based equity. The deal is now closed and should contribute approximately $5 million of revenue in FY '20 and $20 million of revenue in FY '21. Importantly, this opportunity has increased our TAM by roughly $4 billion. Finally, we implemented a new lease standard. This resulted in a $23 million gross-up in other assets and liabilities. There is no income statement impact.</p><p>Next, capital allocation. Please turn to Slide 9. Before jumping into our guidance, we wanted to spend a few minutes and once again talk about our approach to capital allocation. This is a chart we presented at our Analyst Day and more specifically, outlines how we have operated for the better part of the last 8 years.</p><p>Our priorities are straightforward. We are managing for the long term. Fund our future. This includes appropriate investments in areas like TV, our data sharing service in B2B. Also embedded in this principle is stopping things that are not working or that are noncore. Over the past 8 years, we have divested of noncore assets generating roughly $2.1 billion in after-tax proceeds. Next, we seek to take advantage of important and strategic acquisition opportunities. Since fiscal 2012, we have focused our acquisition capital on opportunities which leverage our core competencies. This is an approach we will continue to follow. And finally, we are committed to appropriately returning capital to share owners. Today, we have now returned more than $1 billion to our shareowners. While we intend to be conservative in our near-term approach, we will, just as we did this quarter, be opportunistic.</p><p>In summary, we have a long-term track record of discipline and returning capital. We have and continue to walk the talk. Our philosophy and approach to capital allocation remains unchanged.</p><p>Now our guidance. Please turn to Slide 11. As a reminder, our guidance excludes items including noncash stock comp, purchase intangible amortization and restructuring charges. In FY '20, we now expect to report revenue of between $363 million and $377 million, up between 27% and 32%. Non-GAAP operating loss of between $56 million and $76 million. This estimate now includes approximately $13 million in transition costs.</p><p>For Q2, we expect revenue of up $286 million and an operating loss of approximately $25 million, of which roughly $6 million is associated with transition spending. Further, we expect our dollar-based net retention to be roughly 105% for the remainder of the fiscal year, given the factors we have already discussed. We expect transition spending to be finished in Q2, and we are on track to complete our GCP migration before the end of September. Q2 should be the high watermark for our operating loss as we expect a meaningful margin improvement in Q3. Finally, as a reminder, other guidance assumptions including our updated revenue phasing can be found on Slides 12 and 13.</p><p>With that, let me close with a few final thoughts. We just finished a great quarter. Our business is strong, predictable and recurring. We are enterprise SaaS. We have multiple growth levers in place. Our product and services are in a sweet spot of martech and are helping to create billions of dollars in value for our customers. We have a path to profitability and ample liquidity to see us through our progression. On behalf of all LiveRampers, our transformation has only just begun.</p><p>Operator, we will now open the call to questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>DANIEL SALMON, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: For Scott and Anneka and maybe Warren as well, just because I know you spent a lot of time on this as well, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the International side of the business. We've continued to see the U.S. really power the results with the growth rate higher than the company overall. I know the International story is still an early one, but what are the sort of key checkpoints we should be looking for on that to see it accelerate?</p><p>And then Warren, a bit more specific for you. We see that you picked up the buyback, particularly in July. Obviously, you got past some milestones with some acquisitions and got visibility on it. Just curious if that contributed to the timing of picking up the pace in July. Or it's more you were saying something about the stock after a bit of a pullback. But lastly, would love to just to hear your updated thoughts on where you expect the pace of trends of the buyback to be in light of that elevation here lately.</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: Thanks Dan, this is Warren. I'm going to jump in on both the International and then the buyback. It's really been quite fascinating as we've gone through GDPR and then as we think about CCPA because I would say number one, having gone through GDPR the way we did over the past years has been incredibly beneficial. It's also been incredibly beneficial as we've even further hardened our routines internationally. So number one, this has been a big benefit to us, we believe in how we're approaching regulation in the U.S.</p><p>The second thing that I wanted to point out internationally is because of GDPR, I think we've also been incredibly innovative, and this will get to the pace of where are we focused and what -- where is International leading. And by the way, where we're leading internationally can also benefit the entirety of the company. I'd highlight 3 or 4 things that we are working on today that we think ultimately will cause us to hit the inflection point that you talked about, Dan.</p><p>Number one, what we are doing with transactional data. We have incredible partnerships with retailers, with grocers and others in both France and the U.K., that we are connecting with advertisers to where we can complete the whole entire measurement loop. This is working extremely well and will be something that we will continue to roll out across the company. So basically, connecting advertisers with actual transaction data. The second thing, which you've heard a lot about, is what we are doing on data sharing. The Carrefour platform is incredibly innovative. It has global attention. We have multiple tenants now up and running I believe on 4 -- over 4 continents.</p><p>Next, what's going on with Data Store. Obviously, overall and in terms of internationally, we had a great quarter with Data Store in marketplace. We think this will continue to benefit us internationally. And then finally, nothing per se this quarter that I wanted to talk about but you'll also see TV, I believe or we believe, become a material part of our overall International story. So a lot of things in the work -- a lot of things that are in the works, much more to come. We believe all very, very positive for us internationally.</p><p>And I guess finally, I'd put one other wrapper which also fits into our global story. Internationally, clients are turning to us for assistance. We've made a statement before that data-driven marketing is as important in Tokyo or Paris as it is in New York City, that is 100% the case.</p><p>Next, on the buyback. Just as we said in the prepared remarks, we believe we've really been walking the talk over a long period of time when it comes to capital allocation or returning capital to our shareowners. It's pretty interesting, when we were preparing that little analysis going back, when Scott started out here, we believe our market cap was somewhere around $800 million or $900 million, and we actually bought back more stock in our entire market cap since that period of time. And this quarter was another good example of that. We felt like there was an opportunity to be opportunistic. Therefore, we were in the market the way we were even after the quarter closed.</p><p>That said, we want to be consistent or we want to be appropriate and balance all of our different needs going forward. Therefore, our guidance remains the same. In the near term, we expect to be conservative in our approach just as we've outlined before. That said, depending upon the facts and circumstances, we will also, from time to time, continue to be opportunistic.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next call -- question is from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.</p><p>STEWART KIRK MATERNE, SENIOR MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a good quarter. I was wondering maybe if Anneka could weigh in or Scott could weigh in just on -- when you look at to the back half of the year, given some of the changes Google is going through and CCPA, are the types of conversations you're having with customers getting -- are they longer? Meaning, are these things creating longer sales cycles? Or are customers kind of beyond that at this point in time? I just wanted to get some color around that just as we head in the back half of the year.</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Yes. I will tell you 2 things. Number one is we've had the benefit as Warren just mentioned of living through GDPR, and all of that experience is helping us prepare clients for CCPA and a flurry of other state and international, and hopefully someday, federal legislation. Most of the companies that we work with, enterprise companies, tend to have global businesses. So they too have been through this before. And as a result, a lot of the remediation that they perhaps had to do in Europe is going to parallel what they now have to do in the U.S.</p><p>And so we look at this as a tailwind for us in so much as it's really hard for all of our clients and partners, even the most sophisticated to stay up to speed on all of the changing regulations. That's the entirety of our business. And so now more than ever, we're being asked for our perspective on what we think, where we think things are going and importantly, what our clients and partners need to do to prepare for that future.</p><p>STEWART KIRK MATERNE: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one for Warren, I'm going to sort of dovetail 2 together. Dollar-base retention you mentioned is right in line with your guidance of last quarter. What has to happen in the back half of the year to sort of do a little bit better than that 105% target? And I was just -- and actually, I just have one other follow-up, so why don't we just start there?</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: Okay. You know what I'd like to do is I think it might be helpful for everyone for me just to reconcile from, call it, last quarter we were at 114% down to the 108% because what you will find, Kirk, is that the same drivers that drove it from 114% to 108% are the same drivers that are leading us to and get you to 105%.</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Why don't you talk about reconciliation, and I'll jump in about what's next?</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: Okay. Good. So within the concept of reconciliation, what we've done is -- and ask you to put up on top of your page, 115% and then we've divided sort of the reconciliation into 3 buckets. The first one is large deals, the second one is nonregrettable churn and then third is kind of all other.</p><p>So let me start with large deals. In the year ago quarter, and remember for everybody on the phone, dollar-based net retention is about a revenue cohort from a year ago. So what clients did you have a year ago generating what subscription revenue and how did that then translate to what you did in the current quarter. So in the year ago quarter, we had 3 large deals that materially contributed to upside, we were unable to repeat that performance with those large clients. That resulted in about 4 points of the decline. The second piece was nonregrettable churn, which we've also talked about. That was 1 point and everything else amounted -- everything else was 1 point. So 4, 1 and 1, 114% to 108%.</p><p>When we talk about the back half of the year, it's really more of the same, just as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. Again, I'm reconciling from 115% to 105%, about 6 points of that is large deals, about 2 points is nonregrettable churn and another 2 points is all other. Scott?</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Yes. In terms, Kirk, of what we need to do to now increase it. The good news is there is no silver bullet here. It's all about execution. That's what sales is always about. And so it starts with the whole concept of just upselling, which is having conversations with all of our enterprise clients about what they are trying to accomplish, bringing them ideas. And those ideas and conversations then turn into product tweaks or new configurations, which then manifest themselves into our pipeline and then ultimately, into bookings. It's Sales 101.</p><p>Now as we generate those bookings, some of them you'll see in our net dollar retention. And that's going to be increases to our core subscription business, that upsell. Some of it, quite frankly, you won't see in our net dollar retention because it's going to go sit somewhere else in our P&amp;L. So the things that we're doing, the things that drove, for instance, marketplace are many times with the existing book of business but those aren't factored into net dollar retention. So things like television or Data Store, which are a result of those upsell conversations won't actually show up in that dollar retention.</p><p>The second thing that we're doing which isn't a problem per se, but it's just an opportunity is really trying to manage churn or downsell from clients more effectively. So putting in place early indicators of when a client isn't having as much success and then getting back in front of those clients and evangelizing, educating them how to use our products and technologies such that they cannot not only avoid churn but actually fall into the upsell bucket. Again, not a problem for us but definitely an opportunity. As long as churn is above 0, we're never going to be happy with it.</p><p>And then the final thing that we're doing and I referenced a lot of this in my prepared remarks are really like just core accountability and sales management basics. Things like, as we've scaled our sales force, training, ensuring that we surround our core sellers with subject matter experts that can go in and help get a client across the line when they have questions. Or just ensuring -- and Anneka gave a couple of examples of this, the whole concept of partner alignments such that we're understanding what they are trying to do and tweaking our products such that the partners' products are more effective. And that's really the translation from sales to product. So the good news is all those things are underway. And I think they're all quite manageable.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Shyam Patil from Susquehanna.</p><p>SHYAM VASANT PATIL, SENIOR ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP, LLLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: Great quarter. I had a couple of questions. First one on CTV, can you talk a little bit more about how that business is ramping for you guys here in the U.S. as well as internationally? And then, just how you're thinking about Amazon opening up Fire TV, the third-party demand and just how LiveRamp fits into that?</p><p>And then second question for you, Warren, is when you look at the subscription revenue, can you talk about just how the direct revenue portion of that has been trending? And just kind of how you're thinking about that growth going forward?</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Yes. So this is a Scott, and I'll start. In terms of television like our core television business, that's pre-Data Plus Math, grew around 30% for the quarter. And remember not all of the television efforts we do show up in television, it also draws a lot from Data Store, so some of it actually will sit there. But with the Data Plus Math acquisition, I will tell you that our expectations here really have skyrocketed. Our TAM has increased. And I really have to go back to our acquisition of LiveRamp to see clients as excited about a new offering in our portfolio as they're excited about Data Plus Math.</p><p>Virtually, all of our enterprise clients are doing some kind of television advertising, and we think that with Data Plus Math, it just makes them more effective at that television advertising. It extends what they might already be doing in search or display or e-mail, what have you. So we would expect that our television business for the remainder of the year is going to grow significantly, significantly faster than our baseline.</p><p>With respect to Amazon, 2 thoughts. Number one -- and both of them are good. Number one is, remember that we're one of the early partners of Amazon powering their DSP. We already have dozens of advertisers live with that. And our API, will -- goes live at the end of Q2 should make it even easier for advertisers to get on board there. So we have a really good relationship with Amazon. Moreover, we think that anything that drives awareness of advanced television of any sort is good for our business. Because remember, one of the things that LiveRamp does is we play across all of the elements of advanced television, whether it be connected television, OTT, data-driven linear, the full gamut. And so awareness in the industry means inquiries and opportunities for us.</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: And then let me comment on the second part. And I'm going to answer the question really 2 ways. One, I'm going to talk about both our subscription revenue and then the variable part of subscription revenue, and then the second way is I'll talk about direct versus reseller.</p><p>So in terms of the variable piece of subscription, it's trending right where we thought it would be, right around 10%, 12% so kind of 11%, and we see that holding in strong. When it comes to direct versus reseller, both are up nicely. And in fact, we were hopeful, again, over the long term, to increase our reseller relationships because we increasingly see a number of the consulting firms or others very interested in partnering with us as they do their strategic work with their global clients.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>STAN ZLOTSKY, VP, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe just to start. So very strong Q1 results which is great, but then when we look through the deck, it looks like your revenue phasing for the rest of the year shifted more towards Q4 versus Q2. And also, the full year revenue guidance didn't move up despite a very strong beat in Q1. How should we think about the -- your outlook for the rest of the year? What you baked into your forward guidance and given the phasing that you are now seeing more towards Q4? And then I have a quick follow-up.</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: Yes. I guess what I would say, first of all, obviously, we didn't change the full year. And let me come to that point first, Stan. We just think it's too early to change our full year outlook. If things change throughout the back part of the year and it warrants that we raise, we would, of course, do that. From our own internal perspective, yes, we had a solid beat materially, things have not really moved around in our own internal expectations relative to Q2, Q3 and/or Q4.</p><p>Our outlook, we continue to expect a very strong outlook for marketplace. I want to remind everybody that we are expecting a material step-up in revenue in Q3. That step-up is based about 50% of what's going on in marketplace, which we think is solid based on our current run rates and also what we expect to have happen in Q3. Our increasing subscription revenue, Q2 to Q3, is right in line with historical averages. And when we think about what we have actually committed today and in the books, well in line with historical -- well in line with historical standards.</p><p>Where we are feeling some pressure is on our subscription growth rates. And that has directly to do with the strength that we saw from these large clients in the back part of the year. That said, just as Scott did, we have a lot of growth levers, we're very optimistic about our long-term growth, but we are seeing some pressure in our subscription growth rates in the back part of the year.</p><p>STAN ZLOTSKY: Got it. And if I could just maybe go back to the discussion around the sales changes, I'm not saying -- about the adjustments that you're making as far as focusing your sales organization on net revenue retention rate. Could you maybe dive into that a little bit more, specifically around the strategy functions that you're adding about the upsell of analytics measurement, data lakes? And that's it for me.</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Yes. I'd really talked about 2 changes and let me just say, this train has left the station and it has been rolling down the tracks for several years. So don't think that there's any huge strategic shifts here. This is just normal course of business. You've heard us talk before about the importance of education and evangelization. It is very difficult as a category creator going out and talking to large clients. We have to educate them around what we do, how to utilize our capabilities effectively. And so one of the things that we realized over time is that we have to surround our kind of account quarterbacks with subject matter experts. And that's increasingly true as we add more products into our portfolio.</p><p>So we have television subject matter experts, who can accompany the account owner to a meeting and help get those conversations across the line. Likewise, we spun up a group that's really focused more on measurement because the whole concept of measurement, the creation of data lakes, that's a deep subject matter expertise that not everyone in our organization has. And so there we have kind of a one to many selling relationships. Those subject matter experts work across much smaller group, works across our entire client portfolio.</p><p>The other thing that we talked about in my prepared remarks was the construct of sales excellence team. One of the things that we did, and this isn't just in sales but really throughout our business. When we went -- when we've sold the legacy Acxiom business, we've stood up LiveRamp as a public company, we really had to focus on how do we get a spotlight on everything that matters at our business. And so relative to a year or 2 ago, we have so much granularity in how we look at all the key levers of our business, the things we are measuring and tracking, the dashboards with which we can arm our teams. And so the sales excellence group was stood up really to help manage those dashboards and work across all of the sales teams to help them interpret their results, determine what to do about it and long term just manage their bulk of businesses more effectively.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research.</p><p>VASILY KARASYOV, FOUNDER, CANNONBALL RESEARCH, LLC: I wanted to go back to Data Plus Math and had a question about that and maybe Anneka can step in here too. So my question was trying to understand exactly the service and the TAM that the company has here. It would seem, and correct me if I'm wrong and I want to understand where I'm wrong, it seems like the service that they provide has to do more with direct response advertising, TV advertising, and which would imply that it's not necessarily applicable to all of the television advertising market. And so I'm assuming I'm not understanding entirely the suite of services they provide. So if you could correct me and tell me how it works with brand advertising on television, I would really appreciate that.</p><p>SCOTT E. HOWE: Yes. I would say a couple of things on this and Anneka can jump in here. Number one is it's not just for direct response advertising. It's really beneficial for accountable advertising. And in some cases, that could mean someone saw an ad and subsequently purchased, but in other cases, it's about they see an ad and visit a website. So there are opportunities to measure things that have historically been thought of as building awareness but doing it with accountability.</p><p>The second thing that our television business allows us to do is historically, traditional television has been bought on TRPs and GRPs, broad reach measures. But what we can now do is bring all of the more granular data. The more interesting data is someone in the market to purchase on the automobile in the Northeast, that tells us something far more interesting than just simply age and gender. And so even for brand advertisers to buy with those dials, it allows them to buy with much more precision than historically has been accessible to them.</p><p>OPERATOR: My apologies. I'd like to turn the call back over to Warren Jenson for closing remarks.</p><p>WARREN C. JENSON: Let me simply conclude again by thanking everyone for joining us today. And I'll close with just a few final thoughts. Again, thank you. We just finished a great quarter. Our business is strong. It's predictable. It's recurring. We are enterprise SaaS and we are Switzerland. We're pleased to have this call today with multiple growth levers in place. Our products are -- and services are in the sweet spot of martech and helping create billions of dollars in value for our customers. The great news is we have a clear path to profitability, ample liquidity to see us through our progression. And again, thank you. Our transformation at LiveRamp has only just begun.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference call.

Starting this week, corporate earnings, revenues and management outlook will determine the future course of the stock market. Analysts are looking for a strong Q1 earnings season, mostly in response to the corporate tax cut policy signed into law last December, and robust economic growth both at home and abroad.While the highest year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be notched by energy players, materials, construction, industrial products, technology and financials are also expected to contribute handsomely. Thus, for the next few weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks from these sectors that are likely to make the most of the Q1 earnings season. </p><p>Here, we should also bear in mind that better-than-expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price, which eventually enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts.Q1 Earnings to See Double-Digit GainsInvestors are looking forward to the outset of the Q1 earnings season on Apr 12 and 13, when bigwigs like BlackRock, Inc.BLK[1], Wells Fargo ...mpany WFC[2] and JPMorgan Chase .... JPM[3] will be reporting their Q1 numbers, and for the whole of S...00 results are expected to be impressive.Total earnings for the S...00 companies are estimated to improve 16% from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 13.5% earnings growth on 8.5% revenue improvement last quarter, marking the best quarterly performance in more than six years.The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth, except for autos and conglomerates. Around 11 of these sectors are likely to come up with double-digit growth.What Will Drive Earnings?Earnings are likely to rise mostly on Trump's polices, including tax cuts and solid global economic growth. The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas.Trump's economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate remaining at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers' hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82 in the month. The United States at the same time added an average of 202,000 jobs a month in Q1, faster than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016. U.S. consumer sentiment in March, by the way, reached its highest level since 2004, courtesy of a healthy job market.The global economy too is estimated to expand at a rate of 3.1% year over year in 2018. This comes on top of a promising 3% growth rate in 2017, per the World Bank.Potential Gainers of Q1The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors, which is estimated to surge 60.3% from the same period last year on 15.6% higher revenues. Among the sub-sectors, oil and gas exploration and production; oil and gas refining and marketing; oil and gas equipment and services; and oil and gas drilling companies are positioned to report solid growth. A healthy crude pricing scenario and positive free cash flow are primarily backing the optimism.The materials sector has recently been looking up, with Q1 earnings expected to rise 41.4% on 20.2% higher revenues. Construction is likely to report the third-highest year-over-year profit growth, with Q1 earnings poised to be up 36.1% from the same period last year on 15.9% higher revenues.Earnings for the Industrial sector are set to grow 23.9% from the same period last year on 12.3% higher revenues. Firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs.Some analysts, in the meantime, are worried that investors will start to rotate out of the crowded tech sector this year and into other sectors that will benefit from the lower taxes. So far though, in spite of such uncertainty, the technology sector outperformed the broader S...00. In fact, Q1 earnings for the tech sector are poised to be up 20.7% from the same period last year on 11.4% higher revenues.High profits are also expected from financial segments as well. Total Q1 earnings for the financial sector are projected to rise 19.1% from the same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues. Banks, insurers and asset managers are all expected to report double-digit growth mostly on heightened volatility and higher interest rates (read more: Banks Set for Blockbuster Q1 Earnings: 5 Top Picks[4]).Buy These 6 Stocks for Stellar Earnings GrowthRepublican tax cut and a very strong economic backdrop looks set to deliver another round of stellar earnings growth in Q1.

With that, it's a pleasure to turn our call over to Peter Kann.</p><p>PETER KANN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, DOW JONES &amp; COMPANY INC.: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On this morning's call, I'm going to touch very briefly on some highlights of the quarter. Chris Vieth, our CFO, will take you through the financial results, and then Rich Zannino, our Chief Operating Officer, is going to elaborate with operating highlights and third-quarter outlook; and then we'll try to take any questions you may have. We, once again, are pleased to be reporting earnings per share growth, as well as lineage gains for the fourth quarter in a row. Excluding special items, we earned 41 cents per diluted share, which is up 52% from 27 cents per diluted share in the second quarter last year. We're pleased with the improved revenue and bottom-line results at all three of our business segments, and at virtually all of our products and services. And our strong operating leverage was evident once again as an 11% increase in revenue resulted in a 62% increase in operating income.</p><p>On the Electronic Publishing side, we had another strong quarter of revenue growth at Dow Jones Indexes and at Consumer Electronic Publishing. Within our Newswires businesses, we successfully integrated our recent acquisitions of Alternative Investor Group and VWD. And our community newspaper group, Ottaway continues to post strong revenue growth and profit, while maintaining one of the highest margins among its peers; and Chris and Rich are going to review those results with you in more detail very shortly. At our Print Publishing segment where revenue and profits also were up, color advertising continues to grow, up 22% in the second quarter and up 32% for the first half of 2004; and that follows strong color ad growth of 28% in 2003 and 34% in 2002. Companies continue to pay premium rates to take advantage of our high-quality color advertising to reach our attractive and unique global audience. We've also continued to attract new advertisers such as Nautica, Nordstrom, Quester, Wyndham Hotels and more.</p><p>Our popular Personal Journal section is benefiting as more and more advertisers are realizing that our readers have a strong propensity to spend on high-end consumer goods. Personal Journal ad lineage is up more than 52% in 2004 and actually is approaching the healthy ad levels in our very successful weekend Journal section. While we are seeing encouraging trends in a number of our businesses, we continue to caution that the business-to-business ad environment remains somewhat volatile. Our recent lineage trends reflect this, as we saw per issue lineage at the Journal in April and May up around 7% while June was down 3.5%; which adds up to the 3.3% increase for the quarter. This month-to-month ad volatility has been a reality for about a year now. This, in turn, has been driven by inconsistent trends across major ad categories which we see continuing into the third quarter, and even as we post some positive gains, we're well aware that ad levels remain significantly below what we consider normal preboom, prebust levels.</p><p>In the meantime, we continue to focus on product quality, on effective sales efforts and sensible investments, and operating efficiencies and cost controls; all as set out in our strategic plan, Business Now. During the quarter, we once again were recognized for the quality of our products as the \"Wall Street Journal\" was honored with a number of globe awards and Newswires won its second straight annual news provider of the year award from Inside Market Data. We also won several Cody awards as Dow Jones News Plus, a Business Now initiative won its first ever Cody and the Online Journal brought home two more. We are also pleased to announce that a few weeks ago we did reach a settlement with IAPE, that is the union that represents about 25% of our employees; which includes many of the \"The Wall Street Journal\" newspeople. This agreement has the support and endorsement of -- and endorsement of the union's bargaining committee, its executive council, and Board of Directors. It is going to go to the IAPE membership for ratification shortly -- excuse me -- [ coughing ] -- sorry--for ratification shortly.</p><p>The agreement -- the tentative agreement represents a full and-- [ coughing ] -- excuse me, a full and fair resolution of many difficult issues and that should enable all of us to devote our full attention going forward to our publications, our products and, of course, our customers. With that, I am going to hand it over to Chris for a review of financial results.</p><p>CHRIS VIETH, VP &amp; CFO, DOW JONES &amp; COMPANY INC.: Thank you, Peter and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll briefly cover the key business drivers behind our second-quarter financial results which we reported earlier today. Before special items, second quarter earnings per share were 41 cents this year, which is above the current First Call mean of 38 cents and 52% above last year's earnings of 27 cents per share. Year-to-date through June, total revenue is up 12% and EPS, before special items, were 63 cents per share and 62% above the same period of 2003 as we continue to significantly leverage our cost reductions. Total company revenue was in line with our expectations of an 11% increase for the quarter, with increased revenues at Electronic Publishing and Ottaway offsetting slightly lower-than-expected advertising revenue at Print Publishing. Lower operating expenses across the portfolio drove the improved earnings performance versus our April guidance. Second-quarter revenue increased to $438 million, including roughly 3.5% of the increase from our recent acquisitions, Stockton Technologic Partner, Alternative Investors and VWD.</p><p>Please note that this is the last quarter we will report Stockton results to you separately as an acquisition as we have now anniversaried our May 2003 purchase of the property. Second-quarter operating expenses of $382 million were up roughly 6% over last year, before special items, and better than our April guidance of an 8% increase as we continue to tightly control expenses at all business units. This included approximately 3% related to our recent acquisitions, less than 1% for increased newsprint expenses and 1% associated with the increased foreign currency costs. All other expenses were up only 2% over last year, including a $2 million charge for a small workforce reduction in circulation distribution at the Journal, part of our Business Now priority to improve circulation efficiency. Nearly offsetting this charge was a nontaxable benefit of, roughly, $1.5 million related to accounting for the Medicare Prescription Drug Act. We will save a similar amount in the second half of 2004 as a result of that change. Our second-quarter ending head count totalled about 7,150 and, excluding employees associated with our acquisitions, comparable head count was down 2% from last year's second quarter.</p><p>Looking at some other key figures. Total newsprint costs in the quarter were up a little more than 5% with consumption down 2% and our average cost per ton up about 8% versus year-ago levels. We are staying at roughly $30 per ton on the February price increase took hold by the time it was all said and done. And as we have done in the past, we also used inventory where possible to mitigate some of the impact. Our internal forecasts also anticipate a late-summer price increase that follows the path of last year's. That is it takes a few months to stick, and when it does, not at the full announced rate. Before special items, our effective tax rate was 40.9% for the quarter and is expected to come in around 41% for the year. Capital expenditures totalled $15 million in the second quarter compared with $12 million last year. We continue to tightly manage working capital and cash flow items and our cash flow and balance sheet remain strong.</p><p>After capital expenditures, dividends, investments, and all other outflows, we used $33 million of excess cash flow plus $11 million of cash to reduce our debt by another $44 million in the quarter. We closed the second-quarter 2004 with debt of $215 million, versus a debt level of $210 million in last year's second quarter and $258 million at the end of the first-quarter 2004. With a seasonally low third quarter for ad volume at the Journal, we expect our excess cash flow to be about flat in the third quarter returning sharply positive in the fourth quarter which we'll use to reduce our debt balance further. With that, I'll turn it over to Rich.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO, EVP &amp; COO, DOW JONES &amp; COMPANY INC.: Thanks, Chris. Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. In the second quarter, we posted significant gains in revenue, earnings, and margins in each of our three business segments. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of such gains. We've also posted increased advertising lineage at \"The Wall Street Journal\" for the past four consecutive quarters. As a result, revenue is up 9%, operating income is up 53%, and EPS before special items is up 52% over these past four quarters. So we're definitely seeing a payback on our Business Now initiatives, as well as a modest recovery in the B-to-B advertising environment; however, pleased as we are with this progress, it's not enough. Our Print Publishing ad volumes and, thus, our overall earnings are being constrained by the cyclically soft B-to-B ad environment and are well below what we consider normal levels. Peter noted we haven't yet gotten all cylinders firing together. And, while we can't entirely control this, we must continue to control everything else that we can as we did in the second quarter.</p><p>But before getting into these second quarter results, I would like review the terms of our tentative new labor contract IAPE, the union that represents about 1,600 of our employees; including those in news, advertising sales, technology, circulation, and administrative areas. These folks have been working without a contract since April of 2003. And after much negotiation, we've agreed to pay them wage increases of 0% in 2003, 2.5% in 2004, 3.25% in 2005, and 3.5% in 2006. Also, we will make lump sum payments totaling $2,000 to each IAPE employee. In addition, IAPE members will be subject to the company's new medical plan effective on January 1, 2005. This new plan, which other DJ employees enrolled in effective January 1, 2004, incorporates design changes aimed at reducing costs for both employees and the Company; and, for the first time, requires employees to contribute to monthly medical premiums. We believe the settlement is fair to both IAPE members and DJ shareholders. Taken together, the lump sum payments and wages increases are in line with those settled at other publishers. The new medical plan, while still very generous by competitive standards, will help slow the rapid escalation in company medical costs.</p><p>Taken together, these items enable us to continue to control costs in this still uncertain revenue environment. We'll incur one-time costs of about $4 million in the third quarter and $2 million in the fourth-quarter 2004 for the lump sum payments. After adding in an additional $1,000 payment for each non-IAPE, non-management employee to keep them whole with IAPE members. With all IAPE and non-IAPE employees now subject to the new medical plan, we expect to save nearly $9 million annually in medical and retiree health costs. And finally, the agreement is subject to a ratification vote by the IAPE membership, and we would hope to have the whole process wrapped up in the next six weeks or so. We look forward to putting this difficult episode behind us so we may refocus 100% of all of our attentions on running the business and getting back to creating, selling, and supporting great products.</p><p>And now on to our segment results. Our Print Publishing total revenue was up 8% from a year ago. Operating income more than tripled to $17 million and margins grew to 6.8%. We said that, in an improving ad environment, about 80 cents of every new dollar of Journal advertising revenue flows through to the bottom line. This flow-through was 60% in the second quarter, but adjusting for increased newsprint prices and foreign currency costs, this flow-through was 78%; very close to our 80% target. Making similar adjustments for the full year, we expect to hit our 80% target for the full year. We saw continued volatility in monthly comps at the U.S. Journal, with per issue lineage in April and May each up around 7%; in June, down 3.5%. This led to an increase of 3.3% in ad lineage at the U.S. Journal for the quarter. While we'd obviously prefer to see a more consistent trend and faster pace in lineage levels we're, nonetheless, very pleased that the Journal is outpacing its competitors and increasing its market share in this difficult B-to-B advertising environment.</p><p>As we've said in the past, and as all of you know, our fortunes can't significantly improve without a sustained turnaround in the Journal's two biggest engines, financial and technology advertising. While financial advertising has been relatively strong through the first half of 2004, unfortunately, technology advertising has been weak. Financial advertising increased 5.3% in the second quarter as strong wholesale advertising more than offset weakness in tombstone and retail financial advertising. This was the third consecutive quarter of increases in financial advertising volume and we're cautiously optimistic it will strengthen a bit in the second half, with continued strength in wholesale and improved trends in tombstone and retail ads. On the other hand technology lineage was down 28% in the quarter. During the second half of 2004, particularly in the third quarter of 2004, we're expecting technology ad spending to remain weak due to a combination of tough comps in last year's second half and cutbacks in ad budgets at many large B-to-B tech companies driven by their spotty profit growth and uncertain outlook for global technology spending.</p><p>In the Journal's general advertising category, lineage was up 15% in the second quarter on strong increases in professional services, insurance, luxury, travel, and healthcare advertising categories. Auto was down a modest 4% in the quarter; however, we expect the auto category to rebound in the second half of the year as comps ease and we see a number of new vehicles and incentive programs launch in the fall. And finally, the Journal posted an 11% increase in classified and other lineage in the quarter, driven by strong increases in real estate, recruitment and other classified advertising. Looking beyond lineage to ad revenue, we're very pleased that for the fourth consecutive quarter, ad revenue gains at the Journal significantly outpaced lineage gains. In the second quarter, we post posted a 9.5% increase in advertising revenue at the Journal on a 3.3% increase in ad lineage.</p><p>Today's Journal continues to drive positive results. The expanded color capacity in Today's Journal drove a 22% increase in color ad pages and 32% increase in color ad revenue during the quarter. We're averaging roughly 8 full color page equivalents per day out of our total color advertising capacity of up to 20 pages per day. Color pages have nearly doubled since we increased color capacity at the end of 2001. We're also using Today's Journal in our new Personal Journal section to expand consumer advertising to reduce our reliance on financial and tech advertising. Our targeted consumer categories of auto, travel, healthcare and luxury consumer goods showed lineage gains of 8% and revenue gains of 13% during the second quarter. Ad revenue in these categories is up about 24% since the end of 2001. Elsewhere in Print Publishing, at the Asian and European editions of the Journal, total advertising lineage increased 6% per issue in the quarter on strength in nearly all categories; offset by weakness in tech advertising.</p><p>And at Barron's, ad pages increased a healthy 21% in the quarter driven by very strong financial and auto advertising. Moving on now to Electronic Publishing, we continue to improve our products, profits, and industry-leading margins. Second-quarter revenue was up 20%, operating income was up 43%, and operating margins were up 370 basis points to 23.8% over the same period last year. Excluding acquisitions, revenue was up 7%, operating income was up 29%, and margins were up 430 basis points driven by strong revenue and profit performance at both Consumer Electronic Publishing and Dow Jones Indexes. At Newswires, revenue was up 21% driven by the recent acquisitions of Tech Partners, Alternative Investors, and VWD. The integration of these acquisitions is going as planned and we're on track to meet our profit projections. Revenue in Newswires core business was about flat during the second quarter.</p><p>At Consumer Electronic Publishing, second quarter revenue was up 13%, driven by a 35% increase in online advertising revenue and 4.5% increase in circulation revenue. Subscribers at the end of the second quarter was 684,000, up 2% over the second-quarter 2003, and down slightly from the first-quarter of 2004. Importantly, usage of our paid site, WSJ.com, as measured by unique visitors was up 13% during the quarter. As you may have noticed in our earnings release, we have changed our methodology for counting aggregate unique visitors to and page views at our free and paid websites. This change takes advantage of new technology to more accurately measure site usage which will help us sell more ads and improve user experience at these sites. It's more conservative, in as much as, it lowers the number of page views and unique visitors. Unfortunately, it renders year-over-year comparisons invalid as we are unable to restate prior periods. Nonetheless, we believe we continued to increase usage of our websites during the second quarter and will continue to do so going forward.</p><p>At Ottaway, second-quarter revenue was up 11%, operating income was up 17%, and operating margins were up 160 basis points to 28.7% over last year. Revenue gains were driven by the May 2003 acquisition of the Stockton Record and same property revenue growth of 6.4% which, in turn, was driven by a 5.5% increase in ad lineage in the quarter with strong auto and real estate classified lineage. Same property operating income at Ottaway was up 13% over last year's second quarter. Looking forward, ad buyers continue to make buying decisions very close to publication dates, making visibility and projections difficult. Having said this, for the third quarter, recent trends appear likely to continue. That is, we don't yet see all our main cylinders firing together. More specifically, while we expect continued gains in financial wholesale, general B-to-B, consumer and classified advertising, and expect improved trends in auto, tombstone, and financial retail advertising; much of this is likely to be offset by weakness in technology advertising, as well as in travel advertising, as we're up against very difficult post-war comps in travel ads.</p><p>By month, we expect per issue lineage comps at the Journal to be down slightly in the slow summer months of July and August, followed by a nice gain in the busier month of September, all leading to third-quarter lineage of up in the low single-digit range. Together with continued strong gains elsewhere in the portfolio this level of lineage gain would result in an 8% increase in total revenue for the third quarter. On the expense line, we'll continue to hold on to the vast majority of our cost reductions. We expect total operating expenses to be up about 6% in the third quarter. Of this, about 4% is due to expenses for our recent acquisitions, increased newsprint and foreign currency costs, and the lump sum payment related to our tentative labor contract settlement. This leaves comparable expenses up only 2% over last year. The net of all this is an EPS estimate, before special items, of about 20 cents per share for the third quarter; and this is after deducting about 3 cents per share for the lump sum payment related to our tentative labor contract. This is up from 14 cents per share last year.</p><p>In closing, in the second quarter, we improved revenue, profit and margins virtually everywhere in our portfolio. At Electronic Publishing and Ottaway, we increased our margins, which were already near the top of their peer groups, and at Print Publishing we got another strong glimpse of how highly leveraged our earnings growth is to an improving ad environment. Going forward, we'll continue to control everything we can to maximize our upside as the ad environment continues to improve. And with that we'll turn it back to the operator to open the phone lines for questions.</p><p>OPERATOR: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer section. [Caller Instructions] Thank you. Our first question for the day will come from Peter Appert of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>PETER APPERT, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Rich, apologies if you covered this in the comments, but I might have missed it. What is the organic revenue and operating income growth for the Electronic Publishing segment in the second quarter?</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Peter, we did cover it, and if you exclude acquisitions, revenue was up 7%, operating income was up 29%, and margins were up 430 basis points to 24.4%.</p><p>PETER APPERT: Right. And the primary driver of the margin gain is just the inherent operating leverage in the business model?</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Absolutely.</p><p>PETER APPERT: Okay. Anything specific in terms of price adjustments or particular units within Electronic Publishing that is driving that margin gain?</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Go ahead, Gordon.</p><p>GORDON CROVITZ, SVP, DOW JONES, &amp; PRESIDENT, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING, DOW JONES &amp; COMPANY INC.: Hi Peter, this is Gordon Crovitz. I think -- I encourage you to take a look at the leverage now that we're seeing in our online operations where the advertising increase of some 35% has continued pretty nicely. Our Dow Jones Indexes business also had very significant revenue increases and that's become a very significant margin business.</p><p>PETER APPERT: And how about -- what do you think a normalized level of margin for the Electronic Publishing business might be over the next couple of years?</p><p>GORDON CROVITZ: I think, as Rich said, we're already toward the very top of our peer group so I wouldn't want to suggest that it can go a lot higher than now. We're very focused on growing the top line while maintaining these kinds of margins.</p><p>PETER APPERT: Okay. And then last question. Rich, the Print Publishing business has been unprofitable for the last several years in the third quarter. Is the revenue momentum you're seeing currently sufficient to get you to profitability in the third quarter this year?</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: We are going to look at that, Peter. If you want to take another question, and I will come back to that one.</p><p>OPERATOR: Certainly. Our next question will come from Doug Arthur of Morgan Stanley.</p><p>DOUG ARTHUR, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Rich, specifically on tombstone advertising, why is it not better and is -- is there somewhat of a secular change here where in a more regulatory scrutinized environment, investment banks are hesitant to take out big ads announcing deals, or is this a function of deal size?</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: That's a good question, and maybe it will help to put it in some context. First of all, pure tombstones and new issue advertising represents about 5% to 6% of total \"Wall Street Journal\" lineage depending on the year. So while it's a meaningful category, it's nowhere near as large and as meaningful as some of the other financial categories or as some of the tech categories or even auto. To put it in perspective, it's about the same size as our travel and professional services advertising categories. So that -- that gives you some dimension on our exposure to tombstone advertising.</p><p>Having said that, tombstone advertising, we believe, is a function of four factors: Deal flow, and we all see that getting much stronger. Deal size, and while deals are getting bigger, most of them are still pretty small. Deal performance would be a third -- would be a third factor, and deal performance has been a bit sketchy here so far this year. I think 34 out of 100 deals that have gone off this year are underperforming their offer price, their IPO price. And then finally, there has been a moratorium, if you will, on the part of some of the major investment banks against running tombstone ads. So we think those are the four factors that are driving -- that drive tombstone advertising that are driving it in the current environment.</p><p>I have not heard anything so far, Doug, about the regulatory environment constraining banks in running tombstones. I think some of the larger banks have basically questioned the value of a tombstone ad, and we have lots of research that we share with them, and more and more now with the issuers on the value of tombstone ads and the value is significant. People look at them, they act on them. They call the banks. And they are a call to action for people to do things with the banks. So we think research supports the value of a tombstone ad.</p><p>To put some numbers -- other numbers against all of that, so far this year, there have been 100 IPOs priced. We've received tombstones on 22 of those so far. About 40 from the so-called moratorium banks, and the remaining 38, we'll get some of those, but many of them are too small and are underperforming. Again, 34 out of the 100 are underperforming so we won't get those. You know, the good news, if you will, is we see the calendar strengthening in the balance of the year. We see the banks that are doing the deals. We think we're going to see increased momentum in the back half of the year and get back into positive territory again like we were in the first quarter on tombstone advertising. Of course, nobody else is getting these tombstones; they're not going anywhere else. Journal still has 100% market share for tombstone.</p><p>And so I think there is another 200 or so deals in the pipeline for the balance of the year, and, you know, we'll get -- we'll get our share of those. But I think summing that all up, it's a relatively small category. It's not all going away. We are working hard to get as many tombstones as we can by going directly to issuers with our research and to the banks with our research; and, given the pipeline going forward, and the pipeline does have a few very large deals, not the least of which is Google going forward. So going forward, we think we will see, you know, positive comps again in the category.</p><p>CHRIS VIETH: Answering Peter Appert. This is Chris -- Peter Appert's earlier call, Print Publishing operating income was negative $11.5 million last year. We'll make significant progress against that this year and reduce it, but it will still be negative in the third quarter.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: And, of course, the U.S. Journal will be profitable in the third quarter this year as it was in the third quarter last year.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Christa Sober from Thomas Weisel Partners.</p><p>CHRISTA SOBER, ANALYST, THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS: Hi. Couple questions. First, could you remind us what color is as a percentage of total Journal. Second, you talked about low single-digit lineage in the third quarter. Obviously, we saw low single in the second quarter. Can we expect, I guess, a similar yield off of that lineage in the third quarter as we saw in the second quarter? And then finally, Gordon, could you tell us what tech spending was up online? We saw pretty strong growth from CNET yesterday and I'm just wondering if the online trends are mirroring the offline in tech spending. Thanks.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Christa, color represents about 30% of our total lineage, and it would be a higher percentage of our total revenue because color, a full-page sells at 27% premium to black and white and a half page sells at 37% premium to black and white. But we always talk lineage, so the -- it's about 30% of total Journal lineage. As far as yield, we hope to be able to -- to continue to have revenue growth in excess of lineage growth in advertising. And would hope to see -- it might not be 6% in the third quarter in terms of the spread between lineage growth and revenue growth, but we would hope it would be in the 4% to 5% range. It will depend somewhat on mix ultimately, you know the mix between classified and -- and display advertising. But color should drive it, and our new rate card should drive it, and favorable mix in some of our other categories should definitely continue to help it.</p><p>CHRIS VIETH: Christa, in terms of online advertising. As you mentioned the advertising in total increased 35%. Display advertising up 37%. Technology and financial, those two categories really dominate the online categories. And you asked particularly about technology spending. That was in line with the overall percentage increase that we saw this quarter.</p><p>CHRISTA SOBER: Great, thank you so much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Ginocchio of Deutsche Bank.</p><p>PAUL GINOCCHIO, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Sorry. Hi there. Could you give us how the yield looked in Q3, the mix of it between price and color and the components? And then also, the deceleration that happened in consumer electronic publishing in Q2 versus Q1. Where that came from? Thanks.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Paul, we had a little trouble hearing the first part of your question. Could you repeat that?</p><p>PAUL GINOCCHIO: Sure. Just wanted to get the mix of the yield -- 6% yield improvement in Q2. Can you break down that and its components?</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Between how much was driven by color versus how much was driven by rate --</p><p>PAUL GINOCCHIO: rate increase and then just, I guess, mix.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Yeah, I think--</p><p>PAUL GINOCCHIO: And relative to Q1 where it was 10.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Yeah, well in Q1, it was certainly driven more by mix, because in Q1, display advertising, I think, was actually very close to classified advertising, and in the -- and in Q2, our display advertising was up low single-digits, and our classified advertising was up 11%. So classified runs at a much lower ad rate, line rate than display. So that would explain the difference between Q1 and Q2. Just -- the heavier proportion of the mix of classified in Q2.</p><p>PAUL GINOCCHIO: Perfect. Thanks. Then the -- the deceleration of CEP, what was the driver of that from Q1 --</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Are you talking about subs there?</p><p>PAUL GINOCCHIO: No, the 13% year-on-year revenue growth in CEP in Q1--or Q2 versus the 18 in Q1.</p><p>PETER KANN: Gordon?</p><p>GORDON CROVITZ: Part of that, Paul, is the fact that the subscriber is paying the full new price increase over time obviously, a higher and higher percentage of them are doing that. Two-thirds of the revenue for the Online Journal is from subscriptions and so even as we see very large increases in advertising revenue, the subscription revenue tends to move more in line with volume.</p><p>PAUL GINOCCHIO: Rich, refresh my memory what the advertising for CEP was in Q1.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: It was in line with this quarter. In the mid-30s.</p><p>PAUL GINOCCHIO: Great, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Lauren Fine of Merrill Lynch.</p><p>LAUREN FINE, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you. I -- could we just go over the technology outlook for the second half again? I guess I'm surprised. I was under the impression that it was going to improve and I'm wondering if something has changed from earlier calls; and it sounds like maybe you are basing it, again, on some of the profit reports that had come out which would make sense. And then also, could you just give us a sense of what you were paying in newsprint per ton in the quarter and the timing of when you might have paid an increase in the quarter and what you expect to happen in the second half?</p><p>PETER KANN: Chris can take the newsprint I think.</p><p>CHRIS VIETH: Yeah, just Lauren, the newsprint price increase that was announced on February 1, it came in slowly. Some suppliers raised, you know put through the price increase on invoices right away. Others didn't. We also used inventory to buy around some of the price increases. So by the time it was all said and done at the end of the second quarter, we were up about $30 a ton. Traditionally, we have steered away from actually quoting the price per ton that we pay, but what we have said is that, you know, for the year, we expect newsprint expenses to be up about 11% over last year; and we expect, you know, newsprint price increase in the late summer to follow the trends of what they did last year, and all of that has remained constant with our guidance from the beginning of the year. So we are pretty much consistent with what our expectations are there.</p><p>LAUREN FINE: Okay.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Lauren, on your tech question. I would just like to clarify the way you started it. We actually said in the first quarter that we expected tech to be soft for the balance of the year. You might be confusing us with another large daily newspaper -- [ LAUGHTER ]</p><p>LAUREN FINE: That's possible.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Projecting it to be up in the back half of the year. But we -- our tech category includes tech and telecom in that category. We're up against pretty tough comps in the back half of last year. We were up about 13% in the back half last year. So we're up against that. We are also seeing some of the big tech guys cut back on their budgets. I mean you read in the last week or so, Microsoft saying they want to cut $1 billion in expense, and to do it without cutting head count. You know -- and my guess is they're not going to cut R&amp;D either. So I think we're up against tough comps.</p><p>People are cutting their budgets because they're not seeing the profit growth that they want to see. They are also a little bit skittish given what people have been saying lately about future plans for -- lately about future plans for capital spending on technology products. So I think they're being cautious. Having said that, we think the third quarter will be a much tougher quarter than the fourth quarter. We think we'll see an improvement in trend during the fourth quarter just based on -- on some of the RFPs that are out there and some indications we are getting from some of the big tech spenders in terms of their plans for the fourth quarter. So while we're saying the back half will be weak, it's -- we -- we're predicting it to be much weaker in the third quarter and then to come back somewhat in the fourth quarter.</p><p>LAUREN FINE: Okay. And just one last question. In terms of global ad sales across the properties. Can you give us an update on how that's going?</p><p>KAREN HOUSE, SVP, DOW JONES &amp; PUBLISHER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, DOW JONES &amp; COMPANY INC.: Lauren, this is -- excuse me, Karen House. Our global advertising revenue continues to grow.</p><p>LAUREN FINE: Would you say it is meeting your expectations?</p><p>KAREN HOUSE: It has actually exceeded budget this year. So it is exceeding our expectations.</p><p>LAUREN FINE: Great. Thank you.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: We actually saw a nice -- a nice improvement in ad yield in our International publications as well as this year driven in large part by the global rate program and the rate increase we put in this year to the global rate programs.</p><p>KAREN HOUSE: And we're growing in share in both Europe and Asia, which is obviously pleasing.</p><p>LAUREN FINE: Could you actually refresh our memory on what you raised rates on the global rate and on the U.S. Journal?</p><p>KAREN HOUSE: We raised the rate for the overseas publication 25%. What it -- what I do remember --</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: which was probably --</p><p>KAREN HOUSE: rate increase --</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: the net effect of -- we put through roughly a 5% global rate increase, but we gave -- the entire 5% we're crediting to the international pubs as it should be because they took the discount when we originally put the global rate in. So it represents about a 25% increase in ad rates for the international publications in terms of their share of that new higher global rate. And then in the U.S., we put through on the rate card a 3% rate increase, but we also made some other changes to the rate card, which we hoped and, in fact, it has materialized, would drive it higher than 3% increase in yield.</p><p>LAUREN FINE: Great, thank you.</p><p>PETER KANN: We increased the price of color premium as well.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Yeah, the color premium went from 25 to 27 on a full page and from 35 to 37 on a half page.</p><p>LAUREN FINE: Wonderful. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Super of Lehman Brothers.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: It's actually Craig Huber. Thank you. Two questions. Can you give us the annual run rate of your newsletter Business Now with the acquisitions? Second question, some of your other peers have really stepped up here recently to increase their share buybacks substantially. I was wondering what your plans are on that front given that your stock has pulled back? Thanks.</p><p>PETER KANN: Yeah, we'll let Chris take the share buyback question and then Gordon will follow on the first part.</p><p>CHRIS VIETH: Sure, Craig, with regard to share buyback. For at least the next few quarters, we'll continue to direct excess cash flow to reduce our commercial paper balance, which, as I said earlier, is now down to about $215 million. In the past, we've utilized share repurchase when conditions were right. That is, when we've had excess cash flow and debt capacity. When our shares are trading below their intrinsic value, when the return on investment in shares exceeds that of alternate uses of the capitol and when we've had board authorization to repurchase shares. All of these conditions exist today except for our debt and we're making good progress here down another $44 million in the third quarter. In the future, when all of these conditions are met, we could be back in the market again, but for now we are directing our cash to pay down our debt levels.</p><p>GORDON CROVITZ: And, Craig, on your question about newsletters. We've created a new division within Dow Jones Newswires, as a result of our acquisition of Alternate Investor and Tech Partners last year, called Financial Information Services that includes newsletters, databases and events. That'll have revenues. This year our analyzed revenues -- revenues this year in the mid-20s. I think -- might think about this more broadly which is about a third of all of revenues for Dow Jones Newswires this year will be from products or sales channels we didn't have a few years ago that are not dependent on traditional market data terminals; and this, of course, is another reason why there's a growing gap between the terminal count and revenue lines. We have the financial information services division, local language, wires around the world, local website revenues, many other sources, which is why we are no longer nearly so dependent on head count trends among our customers.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: While I have you here, Gordon, Factiva had a very healthy pickup in operating income in the quarter. Do you expect that to continue here or it it a one off?</p><p>GORDON CROVITZ: Yeah, no we're very, very pleased with the performance of Factiva and its continued success in its market. Its operating income, as you saw, more than tripled to almost $9 million. Part of that was driven by a one-time cost reduction associated with the finalization of the migration this time last year to Factiva-related products, that is the sun setting of Dow Jones interactive and business briefing products. Revenue growth has been sharp and consistent every month since that migration ended. The sales team at Factiva's been able to focus on net new installations rather than upgrades, and we have had net new installations in positive territory every month since August, 2003. So I think you will continue to see performance improvement at Factiva. I don't think we'll necessarily see operating income increases in this range every quarter. But it's a very solid business, making very strong gains in its market.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Great, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Barlow of Prudential Equity Group.</p><p>STEVE BARLOW, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL EQUITY GROUP: Thank you. Gordon, while we're on the topic and maybe it's related more to Chris, what would be the annual number for the equity line for 2004? Secondly, I believe you-- you've had a price increase on home delivery of the \"The Wall Street Journal\". I wanted to see how that is impacting your copies at this point. Thanks.</p><p>CHRIS VIETH: I think what -- what you mean is subscription price increase, right?</p><p>STEVE BARLOW: Yes. Yeah.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: That went in April 1, Steve, so too early to tell in terms of getting a reaction. But retention rates are up. Conversion rates are up. And acquisition rates are up in circulation at the -- at the Journal. So -- but it's too early to tell, yet, the impact of -- of the -- I think it was $10 price increase that went into effect on April 1.</p><p>CHRIS VIETH: As far as -- Steve, as far equity investments for the year we haven't given guidance for the fourth quarter yet, but we expect it to be, you know, modestly better than last year at this point. It will be above last year.</p><p>STEVE BARLOW: And lastly, Chris, on the stock buyback question. Where do you want your leverage to go down to? Your leverage isn't all that high to start with, and you're sort of suggesting that condition has not been met yet.</p><p>CHRIS VIETH: Yeah, that's a good question. You know, our internal target, what we are shooting for right now as far as, think about it from a debt-level perspective, is about, you know,-- we'd like to get it down to 100 million. We've had it -- last year it was down to 93 million and in years' past it had averaged around $150 million. As you saw S&amp;P dropped us a notch last quarter largely on the kind of volatility we've had in Print Publishing advertising revenues. So, you know, those credit metrics are important to us and we're going to continue to dedicate our cash flow to drive down that debt level for the near term, at least the next few quarters.</p><p>STEVE BARLOW: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will come from James Easterland of Oak Value Capital.</p><p>JAMES EASTERLAND, ANALYST, OAK VALUE CAPITAL: Thanks, my question has been answered.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will come from William Drewry of Credit Suisse First Boston.</p><p>WILLIAM DREWRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: Hi, thanks. Couple of questions. One, Rich, I don't think you covered it. On the union issue. Just wondering if there's any other contracts over the near-term, near-to-immediate term with any other unions that are up for renewal? Second question. Just wondering, if you look out for the full year based on the current trend lines, how big WSJ.com will be, this year now, in terms of revenue and any margin contribution you can speak to? And then just on the tech advertising, just to try to put it in just a bit more perspective, wondering if you could give us what your -- what your best guess is at the dollar run rate right now? Where that was, maybe a year ago, and then where that was at the peak for the -- just for the tech category or the way you look at it, maybe tech and telecom. Thank you.</p><p>PETER KANN: Bill, on the first question, no this--the IAPE contract is the, far and away, the most significant labor contract, and there aren't any others like that sitting out there open. And Gordon?</p><p>GORDON CROVITZ: In terms of the online Journal, we have had strong double-digit revenue gains so far this year. We'd expect that to continue -- to continue for the full year as well. In terms of operating income, you know we don't break it down quite that way. But I would say, you know, several million dollars' worth of operating income from the online Journal, and a margin that, as you know, has turned positive, and we think has got potential margin that may be closer in its dynamics to a traditional publishing business then necessarily to advertising driven business inasmuch as the subscription revenues continue to be a significant part of its revenue base.</p><p>WILLIAM DREWRY: Gordon, could you just compare it either in -- in dollar amount or either percentage terms to the -- to the print Journal?</p><p>GORDON CROVITZ: What, the revenue or the margin?</p><p>WILLIAM DREWRY: Just revenue -- I'm sorry just revenue.</p><p>GORDON CROVITZ: The -- the question is the percentage of revenue for the online Journal versus the print?</p><p>WILLIAM DREWRY: Yeah, or just give us the dollar volume. How much do you think it will do this year? You know, $75 million, $100 million?</p><p>GORDON CROVITZ: I think rather than giving a precise number, I would say it is in the range of the lower amount you just asked about.</p><p>WILLIAM DREWRY: Perfect. Perfect. And tech -- tech dollars?</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Yeah. If -- if technology is -- you know I -- the numbers -- the run rate of technology this year compared to where it was in 2000, which was just obviously an enormous boom year, our technology lineage is about a third of what it was in 2000. And, you know, and it is obviously below where it was and what we consider to be the normal -- the more normal year of '98. It's probably somewhere around half of what it was in 1998. Now, that's lineage. So the revenue will be a little --the spread between revenue in those years will be a little tighter, but, you know, that's the -- that's the lineage picture. We have got tremendous upside in technology lineage.</p><p>WILLIAM DREWRY: That would just be tighter because you put through price increases since the peak?</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Exactly.</p><p>WILLIAM DREWRY: Perfect. Thanks very much.</p><p>RICH ZANNINO: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, there appear to be no further questions at this time. Gentlemen, would you like to make closing comments?</p><p>PETER KANN: We just want to thank everyone who spent the last hour with us today. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation in today's Dow Jones teleconference. You may all disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ANALYSTS INTERNATIONAL: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During today's call Mic Michels will recap the financials and I will highlight a few of our accomplishments during the second quarter. I will conclude by commenting on what we see as we look forward into the second half of 2008 and discussing priorities of our business going forward. Mic?</p><p>MIC MICHELS, INTERIM CFO, ANALYSTS INTERNATIONAL: Thank you, Elmer. As we stated on our press release earlier this morning, during the second quarter of 2008 our total revenue was $82 million, down from $89.2 million in the second quarter of 2007. At the bottom line our second quarter resulted in a net loss of $984,000 or $0.04 per diluted share. This loss includes restructuring, severance, and other consulting costs of $909,000 or $0.04 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $723,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007 which included restructuring, severance, and other consulting costs of $600,000 or $0.02 per diluted share.</p><p>Year-over-year second-quarter revenue declined 8% with five percentage points of the overall decrease resulting from a decline in product sales. During the second quarter of 2008 product sales were $9.6 million compared to $14 million in the second quarter of 2007. Direct services revenue was $58.2 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to $60.4 million in the second quarter of 2007, contributing two percentage points to our overall revenue decline of 8%.</p><p>As we have reduced the placement of third parties to fulfill our largest client's staffing needs, we continue to see a corresponding decline in our sub-supplier revenue. Second-quarter sub-supplier revenue was $14.2 million compared to $14.8 million in the comparable quarter of 2007, contributing one percentage point to the overall second-quarter year-over-year decline in revenue.</p><p>Our overall gross margin was 15.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2008, which is the same as what we reported in the second quarter of 2007. Our average bill rate during the quarter of 2008 increased by nearly 1% when compared to the first quarter of 2008 and by nearly 6% when compared to the second quarter of 2007. Continued pressure in sub-supplier margins offset the rate benefit attained through the reduction of low margin product revenue, while margins generated from direct services remained stable.</p><p>At the end of the second quarter of 2008, excluding consultants billing through us as sub-suppliers and nurses billing through our medical staffing business, total company head count was 2,180, compared to 2,505 at the end of the second quarter of 2007. Billable headcount continues to represent approximately 86% of our entire staff.</p><p>Our second-quarter SG&amp;A expense, which excludes restructuring and severance charges was $12.9 million, a $1.2 million, or 8%, reduction over second-quarter expenses in 2007. The decrease in our SG&amp;A expense is the result of realized efficiencies and the centralization of our administrative functions as well as other reductions in operating costs. As we have previously discussed, our new business plan calls for us to eliminate over $6 million of SG&amp;A on an annualized basis. We expect to begin to see the benefits of these reductions in the third quarter of 2008.</p><p>Adjusting for the $909,000 of restructuring, severance, and other consulting charges in the second quarter of 2008, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $762,000 this compared to adjusted EBITDA of $644,000 during the second quarter of 2007.</p><p>From a balance sheet perspective, accounts receivable totaled $59 million at the end of the second quarter 2008, down $500,000 when compared to the end of the first quarter 2008 and down $4.3 million from the end of the second quarter of 2007. This decline is a result of lower revenue and continued improvements in our days sales outstanding. At the end of the second quarter 2008, our day sales outstanding were 67, compared to 71 in the first quarter of 2008 and a 73 days in the fourth quarter of 2007. We continue to focus our efforts on managing our DSO to as low of a level as practical.</p><p>Working capital was $23.9 million for the second quarter of 2008, was down from $24.4 million at the end of the first quarter of 2008 and $24.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. We finished the quarter with $1.3 million of outstanding debt, down from $3.5 million at the end of the first quarter and down from $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease in outstanding debt between the first and second quarters was due primarily to the timing of our biweekly payroll. The second and fourth quarters have similar payroll timing.</p><p>Our credit facility had total availability of $31.7 million at the end of the quarter leaving us with unused capacity of approximately $30.4 million. The level of available borrowings under this facility will continue to fluctuate as our receivables collateral base fluctuates. This line of credit is available for us -- for our use as growth and other business opportunities call for working capital and other investments. We believe our unused credit facility will more than adequately continue to support the operating needs of our company.</p><p>With that I will turn the call back over to Elmer.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Thanks, Mic. The first half of 2008 has been all about restructuring and refocusing the Company. We remained steadily focused on day-to-day execution of our plan to transform AIC into a value-driven IT services company. As we look at what the Company has been able to accomplish over the course of the first two quarters of 2008, we are reminded of the work that lies ahead and the challenge to build a better, more balanced business.</p><p>We have completed the majority of the planned restructuring required to get our cost structure in line with the business. We have exited some of our lowest margin and non-core lines of service. We have made important investments required to position AIC for future success. As a result of some of these changes, we expect to see a reduction of more than $60 million in annualized revenue. Our gross margin run rate, however, is expected to improve by about three to four points by the end of the year. We should begin to see the benefits of these changes in the second half of 2008.</p><p>In the first half of the year, we established a high-caliber leadership team, enhanced our sales and recruiting teams, and built out our Microsoft practices in key metro markets across the U.S. The investments we have made to date have been in our people. While we have reduced our SG&amp;A expense, we have hired many new talented people to help move this company forward.</p><p>Over 20% of our SG&amp;A staff is new since November 2007. We have provided our people with more communication and training and elicited more feedback than AIC has had in many years. We are hiring great consultants and deploying them on new projects which is critical in an industry where talent wins.</p><p>Selling more premium staffing and project-based work requires us to establish new relationships within accounts, sell a bit differently than we have in the past, and manage a longer sales cycle. In June, we held a national sales meeting for all our sales representatives and recruiting leads with a focus on adopting a more solutions-focused sales methodology, institutionalizing our sales process across the business, and educating our market facing teams on the offerings that are core to our business today and will be core to our business moving forward.</p><p>As result of that event, we are beginning to see an increase in the number of opportunities to provide premium staffing, high value-add solutions, project-oriented services, and managed teams to our clients. This transition in our business is going to take some time as we shift our attention to selling higher-margin services to new buyers within and outside of our existing accounts.</p><p>Let me now take a moment to a highlight for you a few of the noteworthy wins from second quarter of 2008. In May, we announced a new project to deploy a criminal records index for the state of Alabama's Criminal Justice Information Center. To improve the speed, breadth, depth, and quality of searching and reporting crime information across the state we partnered with the University of Alabama and VisionWare to create a new criminal records index master.</p><p>The new CRI Master aligns with Alabama's Microsoft architecture and leverages VisionWare's proven tool to create a single view of their data by matching and cleansing records from different business systems. The Alabama Criminal Justice Information Center sees a direct correlation between efficiency and effectiveness of justice and equality of crime data and chose AIC and its partners to deliver its solution.</p><p>Last week, we issued a press release announcing a win with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. AIC has been selected as the prime to lead this important project and will be working in partnership with Microsoft and RiverGlass Incorporated to deploy an intelligent Web-monitoring and analytics solution. This solution will be enabled -- will enable the Las Vegas Police Department and the Southern Nevada Counterterrorism Center to better leverage information to prevent an act of terrorism, solve a crime, identify trends, and better deploy its resources.</p><p>We continue to see expanding opportunities in the state and local government industry vertical and are well equipped to help these organizations protect the safety of the people throughout their communities and across the nation.</p><p>In the second-quarter, we also won a website enhancement project from one of the world's largest real estate networks that is seeking to better support its agents, decrease costs, and improve the effectiveness of its online presence with more up-to-date technology. We will be using Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, better known as MOSS, to create a site that is more flexible and can scale to meet the needs of more than 100,000 agents throughout the world.</p><p>Finally, we are working with a financial products company to upgrade its current IT environment so that it can scale to support the protected growth of its business. AIC analyzes and evaluated its current environment including servers, desktops, software licenses, website domain controllers. We then helped design and implement the infrastructure they would need to support their growth and future business plans. Once we have upgraded the environment, we will provide them with the hosting services to improve the availability, security, and scalability of their systems.</p><p>Before we opened the call to questions, let me close by saying we are proud of what we have accomplished over the past six months, but we still have a lot more work to do. Whereas the first half of 2008 has been about addressing the financial model of our business, the second half of 2008 will be focused on execution and delivering results. Our priorities include sales and business development, recruiting and retention, business process improvements, continued work on our core infrastructure of the company, and lastly, employee alignment around our plan for AIC.</p><p>That concludes our prepared remarks. We now have time to take any questions and would like to open up the call for Q&amp;A.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) [Ron LaGrow], [The Athena Fund]</p><p>RON LAGROW, ANALYST, THE ATHENA FUND: I just want to let you know that good work on turning the business around. Obviously now it's time to start broadening the audience and trying seeking improvement on this stock performance.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: I agree.</p><p>RON LAGROW: Thank you.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, I think that when it comes to turning the business around we have still got work to go do. But we are following our plan and when it comes to broadening the stock performance, we need to get the word out. As we continue to move forward I think that our first and highest priority has been executing on our plan and getting in touch with our shareholders.</p><p>We have picked up some new shareholders, but we are certainly a long way away from becoming irrelevant and socialized story out in the marketplace. But I think that is going to come because we are going to put some focus on it.</p><p>RON LAGROW: Good, I'm glad to hear that. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Rick D'Auteuil, Columbia Management.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL, ANALYST, COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT: Good morning. A couple of questions -- are the poor margin revenues that you have eliminated, I think you said $50 million run rate. Are you finished with -- or $60 million I guess -- are you finished with those eliminations or is there more to come on that front?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, we certainly did complete those two which were account for approximately $60 million or a little over $60 million in run rate. I think you can -- we will see additional revenue reductions as we continue to incrementally reduce our sub-supplier business. So, Rick, I think we have not seen the end of revenue reductions of poor margin business, but the surgical removing of large pieces that we had planned to do is effectively behind us.</p><p>One thing that we will not continue to do is sign up for low margin, no margin, transactions with clients who are slow to pay their bills.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Essentially the staffing industry gets stuck in these pay rolling scenarios and that's just not good business for us. There might be big clients that demand it, but we are looking for ways for us to seek ways for us to deliver value. That is not the best way for us to do that.</p><p>There are some and we continue to not pursue those very low margin staffing opportunities. However, we will continue to provide staffing services, especially with our long-standing annuity accounts. These are great clients. They have been with Analyst a long time and we will continue -- and we can make money on them and deliver value. So we will continue to do that. But the low margin stuff we are still turned to get it identified and figure out a way out of it, but the big chunks, Rick, are behind us.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay. Of the $60 million that you gave up, I think in an earlier release there was almost no contribution margin to that. Is that correct?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: In the earlier release we identified that of that $60 million in business they generated $3 million in gross margins to which nearly $2.3 million of that were operating expense directly attributed. So on $60 million we had a contribution of about $700,000 and you can imagine the cost of the company in infrastructure to support that $60 million worth of transaction business.</p><p>Frankly, we would go out and borrow money to fund those receivables, which there are additional fees as you can imagine. So that business did not contribute to the bottom line of the Company.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Has the $2.3 million in operating expenses been eliminated related to that?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Yes, it has. I think we also identified in the release that we eliminated, permanently, 30 positions in the second quarter. Those eliminations were done in late in the quarter, in June.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay and just so I understand whether I'm double counting or not. But the $6 million analyzed SG&amp;A savings, is the $2.3 million or the 30 positions eliminated is that in addition to or incorporated into the $6 million that was originally contemplated, the $6 million annualized SG&amp;A savings?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Some of it was contemplated in that and some of it is additional.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Some of that, Rick, because we carried some of that payroll through the quarter and into the beginning of the third quarter. So we will really start to see the benefits this fiscal year show up in the latter part of Q3 and into Q4.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay. Then you know at the same time of these expense cuts you have been investing in more productive revenue producing personnel. Can you give us any detail on the contribution from that and I guess the pipeline that is developing around those assets?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Yes. So the number of transactions in our pipeline has increased. I will have better information for you guys in the future as our pipeline stabilizes. In fact, we now have a managed opportunity pipeline across the entire company and this is the first time for Analysts International to have that. As it stabilizes and I feel that data has a high quality factor, then I will share it with you as a metric that you can measure like the size of our pipeline, size of our backlog. We are not there yet, Rick.</p><p>But I can tell you that, for example, one of these deals in the real estate transactions that I announced was originated, organized, sold, closed, and staffed by a team of people who are new since I have joined the Company and this is a sizable project. So that is evidence that we are getting traction.</p><p>These are complex sales. For example, also the VisionWare deal that I talked about with Alabama. This is a -- VisionWare is a fantastic tool that comes out of the United Kingdom. We were introduced to that through one of our Microsoft managed partner representatives. They worked with us together in Alabama and we sold that gig. It's also a very sizable transaction that will lead to downstream business. All of that activity is directly resulting from the investments that we have made since November.</p><p>So those deals are -- selling more complicated deals takes time. The margins on them are good and the number of transactions in our pipeline has increased. So since the meeting we had in June, one of the things that we have started to do was track new leads that directly resulted from the training that we have that we conducted in June.</p><p>So we actually have a centralized group where all new leads are going into that group and they are managed through the lifecycle, at least they are tracked through the lifecycle. So they are keeping records for us so that I can come back to you with some good, hard numbers. Right now you are just going to get me talking anecdotally about it. As we improve our tracking, I will be more -- I will be able to give you better information.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: In your release, you have separated the restructuring charges. In there you also, I think, referenced consulting costs. What are those for and are they ongoing?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: We have tried to eliminate most all of the consultants inside the business. We still have a lingering -- I'm not talking about consultants that are helping us transform the business. We had a -- unfortunately, we had to get out and hire some help to manage through our recent unsolicited proposal. I think we have talked in the past about what the expense was of that; it continued to go up through the quarter.</p><p>We had to hire some folks to help us, that and hire or at least solicit and a new Board of Directors. We have had we had Alliance Management, a consulting firm that was hired by the company prior to my coming on board. They were retained to help us on capital structure and then a number of putting our plans together. Then actually they had a guy that was really good, we kept him on to help us do our facilities restructuring and that was a very effective thing. The significant amount of those consulting activities are behind us.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay. Is the status of the CFO search?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: We put everything on pause through the shareholder meeting and then after the sales event we conducted in early June I put the process back online and pressed play. Processed, interviewed some great candidates and we are down to a very, very small group. I should have something to announce before too long. And when -- I feel good about it. As soon as we have word on that, I will make an announcement. But I think we are making good progress.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Then my last question is when will we see a clean quarter with no restructuring broken out or some of these other items broken out? Is that Q3, Q4?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, Q3 will have some of the lingering transaction, because we actually closed on those deals in the first week of July. So we have -- at this moment, I have no planned restructuring for the fourth quarter.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: By the way, I would say, Rick, part of the reason the CFO search was -- we were able to put it on pause is that Mic Michels, our interim CFO, has been doing a really good job. So he is sitting here next to me, I just wanted to comment him while he is here on the phone.</p><p>We really have and we have done -- we have got a new audit committee with some very, very strong members of the board that have done a great job along with our -- the rest of our finance team. So I know some of you are listing, thank you very much. They have done a good job, but we are going to move forward with bringing in a permanent CFO as soon as possible.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay, thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: [Craig Oestrom], [Van Clemmons]</p><p>CRAIG OESTROM, ANALYST, VAN CLEMMONS: Good morning, Mic. Good morning, Elmer. Congratulations on your continued success. I want to thank you for articulating your vision and the nuances of the improvements that are occurring at the company there and I appreciate this open dialogue.</p><p>I have two quick questions, will you share with us the value or the worth of this Symmetry sale? The second thing is how is the relationship with [Cushram], which became a shareholder and who made an offer back this winter?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Okay. So we haven't disclosed the value of this Symmetry sale. Unfortunately, I don't think we are going to. Let me just say it -- we didn't get a significant amount of money for it, but we got enough money to cover our costs. We will have a downstream pick up based on an earn out performance agreement that we have with COMSYS. But let me just -- so I'm sorry I can't give you -- I won't give you the specific numbers, Craig.</p><p>But let me just say something about COMSYS, they have been a really good partner in this thing. They have immediately jumped in and provided great quality of service to our clients. We had a handful of clients, like three clients, and these three clients acted as part of a seed in a new business that they are investing in. We are happy to be an early partner with them in that.</p><p>It's a conflict for us at inside Analysts International to be both the gatekeeper and the barbarian. We want to go down and break those (technical difficulty) and sell work. The fact is there is a conflict in that. I think I have talked about it on prior calls. COMSYS has been a really good partner. To date they have also -- we have been able to introduce them to some new opportunities at some of our clients and they have actually been working with us to get on the list as a referred vendor for some other managed services clients.</p><p>I think that the possibility that we will indeed receive downstream earn out from COMSYS is high. So we feel very -- at least early in the relationship, we feel good about the fact that we will have some upside pickup downstream from our transaction. But the size of the transaction was not material, it wasn't insignificant. But it has covered our cost and will give us some downstream bottom-line pickup because of the earn out.</p><p>The other question you had was on [Cushram] relationship. Quite honestly, I see them as a shareholder. They own a lot of stock in our Company and I get up every single day and go to work for them like I go to work for you and the rest. I don't -- other than the fact that they are a shareholder and had aggressively had an interest in a transaction, I have had no further conversations with [Cushram] since the annual shareholders meeting. But I will tell you, as long as they own our stock, I will be working for them.</p><p>CRAIG OESTROM: Again, congratulations on your success.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, thanks, Craig.</p><p>OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) [Steve Rudd], [USIP]</p><p>STEVE RUDD, ANALYST, USIP: Hi, Elmer. First, thanks for working as hard as you do. It's clear you are executing on your vision, so on that much kudos. Obviously, there is a way to go. I just want to cut through to where we are. It sounds like we are going to be a bit better in Q3 but maybe not GAAP profitable, even excluding one-time charges, which I guess there aren't going to be any at this point until Q4. Is that about right?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: I think you are -- let me refresh your question. Let me help me understand it. You are asking kind of like where we are and that we will, we may see some charges in Q3 but we don't anticipate seeing any restructuring charges in Q4?</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Right and that is just summarizing what you said earlier, but I am taking one further, one step further, saying it sounds to me like we won't be GAAP profitable, even excluding the one-time charges in Q3, but we probably should be by Q4.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, I will tell you that the number one objective of the management team, and it's written into their performance objectives and their comp plan, is to make this a profitable company on a sustainable basis. We gave guidance that we would turn profitable in the second half of this year and we are all still very focused on that. We are all incented on net profits as outlined in our comp plans that you can find on the web.</p><p>That is just part, it's a significant part of the culture of the Company. It changes the behavior of the management team and we are all tied to that nut. We all have it together. So really as the first half of this year we really wanted to do some cleanup work and I would tell you at the guidance of the Board. We had a strategy meeting with the board in January; they encouraged us to go even faster.</p><p>So where I had planned to take the full year to get some of these transactions completed, we actually completed them significantly earlier than planned. While that might be good from a cultural standpoint and from a turnaround standpoint to get a lot of that restructuring behind us so we can now refocus, it does have a bit of -- poses a challenge to the management team because there was a -- like Brittany would point out to me on a regular basis, there is a $700,000 contribution there.</p><p>But the honest truth is it was hiding or masking the good work that we have inside this business where we can do -- we are doing business at higher margins. If you look at our peer group, we are just not valued in line with what we believe our performance should indicate and it starts with profits.</p><p>Now as the second part of this year, as we look at what we are going to be doing it's really about getting out, and like I said in our priorities, developing business, selling work, retaining consultants, and gaining a greater sense of alignment with employees. Because we have got a couple thousand people, every one of those people should wake up every day caring about our company. So right after this call, here about lunchtime, we are going to have a brown bag employee call where they get to ask questions and we get to do with the issues that you guys are dealing with now.</p><p>That is really the work a head of us and that means we -- and so let's get all this restructuring behind us. Let's establish a financial model where my vision is that every month we make money. Every month we make money. I don't want to have to keep selling off and restructuring. I can't say that is gone forever. I mean we are in a business that is constantly changing and adopting to the demands in the market place, but -- and we still have some lingering clients in here that see us as a commodity staffing company.</p><p>But we can change their minds and we can sell them new work and we are. I am looking forward to it. But, so it really is a time now where we are, as a management team, we have been reflecting on what we have accomplished, but now we are setting a new game plan for what we have got to do in the next, this next second half of the year. Then we will have a new three-year plan to be published to the Board in this fall. We have a working session with the Board on strategy in the future, in October.</p><p>We are looking forward to that, because we think that at that point we will really be able to focus on where are we going with this thing and what can we expect to look like in the future. When I have that then I can give you guys some milestones or some measures to hold us accountable to.</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Right. I guess the new folks you brought on, it sounds like the higher margin business takes -- has somewhat longer lead times. We don't fully have a handle on -- we have a handle that we have more in the pipeline, not fully a handle on the probability ratios adjacent to each of those opportunities at this point --?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: No, I would say part of putting it in the pipeline is we actually do have a solution selling methodology that we are subscribing to and they do have strict probability guidelines and measurements. What takes time is salespeople adopting that methodology and being really strict about it. Anybody that has run a sales organization would know that you have all different levels of quality in those opportunities.</p><p>Some of them the dates aren't correct, the amounts aren't correct, the probabilities aren't correct. That is the art of selling; it's knowing how that opportunity is tracking through from lead to close and then on to revenue. So what I don't have a handle on yet is the total pipeline quality, but every single opportunity in our pipeline we do actually measure probability with some pretty strict observable criteria.</p><p>But it just takes time for that to become institutionalized and a way of doing business at a company, especially one where you have got this many people, over 100 people, involved in business development at this company. We had that good training session in June and we anticipate having another one in the first quarter of 2009. It's just a regular process for us.</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Okay --</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: We don't -- we are not really -- they are longer sales cycles for more complex transactions. But you know we hope to enjoy significantly better margins. We have practices within our business that are operating where the margins are in the 30s. We want to scale those businesses so that our blended margin continues to go up. You will see our margins improve as we have indicated when we get out of some of the single-digit margins.</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Okay, well you clearly are on top of it. Again we appreciate as a shareholder and where we have been accumulating, but we appreciate what you have been doing. So just keep at it, and keep reducing your sleep hours, you will be great.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Thanks a lot, Steve.</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Take care. Thank you, Elmer.</p><p>OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) [Ed Grignavicious], [TSI].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just a couple quick questions, one to follow-up with Steve. So bottom line are we saying that in the second quarter we won't be profitable? I mean in the second half of the year we won't be profitable?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Okay, so I think you are asking me will we be profitable in the second half of the year. Is that your question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Correct.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Our plan is to be profitable in the second half of the year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. A follow-up question in regards to what Rick was talking about in terms of the amount of revenue that was exited. The majority has been done. As far as the remaining, is it $10 million, is it $20 million? I just want to get a sense of what is still remaining.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: You know, I can't -- let me just take a quick look. It's hard for me to break it out right now, Ed, but I would say it could be as much as $10 million.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Alright. Then --</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: It could exceed that depending on the speed at which we address some of the problems. But there still could be a range of $10 million to $20 million inside the business that still is -- we are either going to fix it or fire it. But it's not -- and we will continue to seek ways to run the Company leaner.</p><p>Many, many, many of the cuts that we have made were very hard for our company. We have reduced over 100 people from SG&amp;A positions since I have been here. These are people we really liked. These are people we worked with. These are people, many of them have been with Analysts International for many years. Without a lot of formal process, relationships drive the way you do business. So we are rebuilding process from the front end to the back end of the business to accommodate the loss of some of these important relationships.</p><p>So I am saying to not only you, but to the employees on this call, we have an obligation to now deliver a profitable company. Those cuts were coming from our core centralized functions. You can't just, you can't cut the field and think that you are going to make this business better. It doesn't escape me for a minute that there is two drivers to shareholder value. The first one is profits. The second one is a growth.</p><p>We are not ready to get out and grow this company until we have really fixed the model. But we have got to continue to see growth in segments of our business. We know that we need to report to you and the rest of the shareholders more information about our segment performance. We are looking at ways to do that and our audit committee has also been, at the Board level, was talking to me about it.</p><p>I'm going to look for ways to give you information to hold us accountable and to know what we are actually doing inside this company. But we have still got work to do on some of that low margin business. We have got -- we want to get this restructuring business behind us. You are not going to turn this company around by cutting it. We have got to turn it on by putting power to it, so that is what the investment in sales and leadership is all about.</p><p>And so you know I think in some ways also, I will be honest with all of you, I think what might have been going a little slow incrementalizing. We have got to make some bigger bets from a business development standpoint. I want to increase my sales headcount in the field. So some of these reductions that we have made, I will look for ways to invest that money in the right places in our field organization so that we can grow this business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: As far as the economy goes, how are you guys faring? What do you see for impacts to your existing clients? Overall it still seems like the IT professional services market is doing well. I mean they are hiring. I don't see it in a significant slowdown.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Yes, I think -- that is a good -- if someone was to say, Elmer, how do you feel about the IT services economy, I would say, hey, we are hiring. But I would say demand is flat. It's not like there is any gale force winds out there where there is a revolution. It's blocking and tackling; it's staying in tight alignment with certain technologies in certain markets and finding your niches.</p><p>I wouldn't say Analysts International was much of a niche player to date, but we are seeking to find our niches. Those niches could be regional; they could be by industry and by subject matter expertise and by partner expertise. So we are seeking to find those. I think there are some good strong niches.</p><p>I will tell you something, we need to -- one of the things that I talk about being a company in balance, we have got to have a good balance between our government business and our commercial business, through our public sector and our private sector business. We have some good balance between those. We are seeking to expand in our government business, especially in those areas where the government will continue to spend money.</p><p>I tell you right now, they will continue to spend money to secure this secure the safety of the citizens of the United States. So we know that, we know that there is good funding out of the federal government. The federal government helps fund some of the local initiatives, the state initiatives. These are integrated opportunities, that is why we are going to continue to bet on them.</p><p>Later on this week, I am going to be meeting with some police officers and some chiefs of police in Southern California. California is a huge market. We have not, barely tapped it yet with this criminal justice opportunity, and so we are seeking to continue to expand. As some of the work that we are doing in that government space is a direct crossover to opportunity for us to provide services to the commercial marketplace.</p><p>A lot of big companies, utility companies, big industrial companies, have security issues every single day. They want the tools in their hands to protect their corporate assets. What we do in the integration of systems and now our ability to provide analytics to law enforcement is there is a direct opportunity to cross over and sell the type of work in the commercial space.</p><p>So I think we have got to find our niches. The economy -- it is anyone's guess what is going to happen. The big tech companies have all had pretty good earnings, but the U.S. is their weakest market. You look at IBM, IBM is a global company. Most of their performance is coming from outside of the United States. So with the dollar down, the U.S. IT labor market is pretty unattractive.</p><p>So that is why I am trying to sell, I am trying to tell my people, make sure that the work that we are focused on is work that has hard payback, not justified on soft dollars. We look for niches in areas where we can add value. Those are the things that continue to in demand.</p><p>I think some of the biggest high-volume labor are staffing clients we have. Those are getting tougher and tougher. Screwing down even tougher rules, additional discounts, reduced hours for work days, reduced rates for redeployments. That is a really, really tough market. It's a tough industry. So the biggest are looking to screw down even tighter, but there is lots of opportunity out there in the marketplace to define your niches and that is what we are trying to do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: One last question. As far as -- again, appreciate everything that you are doing, what Analyst is doing to get us to the point of profitability. What do you see as your strategy for getting institutional interest and just more of a retail market interest?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: To date we really have not -- we have kind of put the whole investor relations part of our game plan on hold. In fact, we had to redivert some of our operating budget to the unsolicited proposal from [Cushram]. With that behind us, I think that we have been getting lots of good advice from some of our Board. Some of the new Board members have hands-on experience in investor relations.</p><p>It's a high -- it was a high degree of interest in the interviews I have had with CFOs. I really want to get my CFO on board and on the ground. Then I am also interviewing, I have three IR firms as candidates to assist us with the process. But we are, I think you will see that we will increase the amount of conversation we have with those folks that provide sell-side coverage. Hopefully, somebody will come along with some interest and think that we have got a story to tell and believe in what we are saying. We have got to get somebody to pay attention to us.</p><p>Right now, I think I remember talking to one of the Analysts International shareholders early in the game and I think his quote to me was, you know, from a stock standpoint, from a market standpoint, from an investor standpoint, you guys are irrelevant. Meaning we have -- you have to almost make a reservation to buy stock in the company. Our volume is still very low. I think we are when you look at our peer group, we are valued at the lowest.</p><p>We have got to get our story out there. We have got to get -- we have got to show that we are executing to our plan. That is the most important thing that I focused on this year. But I think that we know the names of all of the folks that are providing sell-side coverage in our marketplace. I would hope that they listen to our story and keep a watch on us.</p><p>My commitment is we will continue to report progress against our plan. I think when those two things come together, we will be on the right track to building more liquidity in this -- with this stock and maybe see our enterprise value get more in line with peer group.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I appreciate your time.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Thanks, Ed.</p><p>OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) We have no further questions in the queue at this point. I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any closing or additional remarks.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, I appreciate you guys joining us on the call this morning. Thank you very much. We have had a pretty -- I can see online that we have probably the, one of the most popular calls we have had in a while. So there is quite a few of you on the line.</p><p>I want to thank you very much for your time. I want to thank the employees of Analysts International for the hard work. I look forward to talking to you all again in the future as we have -- make progress against our plan. As we -- when we have news, I will announce it to the marketplace and continue to be as open as possible with you on these calls. Thank you all very much for your time. Take care.</p><p>OPERATOR: That does conclude our conference for today.

During today's call Mic Michels will recap the financials and I will highlight a few of our accomplishments during the second quarter. I will conclude by commenting on what we see as we look forward into the second half of 2008 and discussing priorities of our business going forward. Mic?</p><p>MIC MICHELS, INTERIM CFO, ANALYSTS INTERNATIONAL: Thank you, Elmer. As we stated on our press release earlier this morning, during the second quarter of 2008 our total revenue was $82 million, down from $89.2 million in the second quarter of 2007. At the bottom line our second quarter resulted in a net loss of $984,000 or $0.04 per diluted share. This loss includes restructuring, severance, and other consulting costs of $909,000 or $0.04 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $723,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007 which included restructuring, severance, and other consulting costs of $600,000 or $0.02 per diluted share.</p><p>Year-over-year second-quarter revenue declined 8% with five percentage points of the overall decrease resulting from a decline in product sales. During the second quarter of 2008 product sales were $9.6 million compared to $14 million in the second quarter of 2007. Direct services revenue was $58.2 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to $60.4 million in the second quarter of 2007, contributing two percentage points to our overall revenue decline of 8%.</p><p>As we have reduced the placement of third parties to fulfill our largest client's staffing needs, we continue to see a corresponding decline in our sub-supplier revenue. Second-quarter sub-supplier revenue was $14.2 million compared to $14.8 million in the comparable quarter of 2007, contributing one percentage point to the overall second-quarter year-over-year decline in revenue.</p><p>Our overall gross margin was 15.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2008, which is the same as what we reported in the second quarter of 2007. Our average bill rate during the quarter of 2008 increased by nearly 1% when compared to the first quarter of 2008 and by nearly 6% when compared to the second quarter of 2007. Continued pressure in sub-supplier margins offset the rate benefit attained through the reduction of low margin product revenue, while margins generated from direct services remained stable.</p><p>At the end of the second quarter of 2008, excluding consultants billing through us as sub-suppliers and nurses billing through our medical staffing business, total company head count was 2,180, compared to 2,505 at the end of the second quarter of 2007. Billable headcount continues to represent approximately 86% of our entire staff.</p><p>Our second-quarter SG&amp;A expense, which excludes restructuring and severance charges was $12.9 million, a $1.2 million, or 8%, reduction over second-quarter expenses in 2007. The decrease in our SG&amp;A expense is the result of realized efficiencies and the centralization of our administrative functions as well as other reductions in operating costs. As we have previously discussed, our new business plan calls for us to eliminate over $6 million of SG&amp;A on an annualized basis. We expect to begin to see the benefits of these reductions in the third quarter of 2008.</p><p>Adjusting for the $909,000 of restructuring, severance, and other consulting charges in the second quarter of 2008, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $762,000 this compared to adjusted EBITDA of $644,000 during the second quarter of 2007.</p><p>From a balance sheet perspective, accounts receivable totaled $59 million at the end of the second quarter 2008, down $500,000 when compared to the end of the first quarter 2008 and down $4.3 million from the end of the second quarter of 2007. This decline is a result of lower revenue and continued improvements in our days sales outstanding. At the end of the second quarter 2008, our day sales outstanding were 67, compared to 71 in the first quarter of 2008 and a 73 days in the fourth quarter of 2007. We continue to focus our efforts on managing our DSO to as low of a level as practical.</p><p>Working capital was $23.9 million for the second quarter of 2008, was down from $24.4 million at the end of the first quarter of 2008 and $24.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. We finished the quarter with $1.3 million of outstanding debt, down from $3.5 million at the end of the first quarter and down from $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease in outstanding debt between the first and second quarters was due primarily to the timing of our biweekly payroll. The second and fourth quarters have similar payroll timing.</p><p>Our credit facility had total availability of $31.7 million at the end of the quarter leaving us with unused capacity of approximately $30.4 million. The level of available borrowings under this facility will continue to fluctuate as our receivables collateral base fluctuates. This line of credit is available for us -- for our use as growth and other business opportunities call for working capital and other investments. We believe our unused credit facility will more than adequately continue to support the operating needs of our company.</p><p>With that I will turn the call back over to Elmer.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Thanks, Mic. The first half of 2008 has been all about restructuring and refocusing the Company. We remained steadily focused on day-to-day execution of our plan to transform AIC into a value-driven IT services company. As we look at what the Company has been able to accomplish over the course of the first two quarters of 2008, we are reminded of the work that lies ahead and the challenge to build a better, more balanced business.</p><p>We have completed the majority of the planned restructuring required to get our cost structure in line with the business. We have exited some of our lowest margin and non-core lines of service. We have made important investments required to position AIC for future success. As a result of some of these changes, we expect to see a reduction of more than $60 million in annualized revenue. Our gross margin run rate, however, is expected to improve by about three to four points by the end of the year. We should begin to see the benefits of these changes in the second half of 2008.</p><p>In the first half of the year, we established a high-caliber leadership team, enhanced our sales and recruiting teams, and built out our Microsoft practices in key metro markets across the U.S. The investments we have made to date have been in our people. While we have reduced our SG&amp;A expense, we have hired many new talented people to help move this company forward.</p><p>Over 20% of our SG&amp;A staff is new since November 2007. We have provided our people with more communication and training and elicited more feedback than AIC has had in many years. We are hiring great consultants and deploying them on new projects which is critical in an industry where talent wins.</p><p>Selling more premium staffing and project-based work requires us to establish new relationships within accounts, sell a bit differently than we have in the past, and manage a longer sales cycle. In June, we held a national sales meeting for all our sales representatives and recruiting leads with a focus on adopting a more solutions-focused sales methodology, institutionalizing our sales process across the business, and educating our market facing teams on the offerings that are core to our business today and will be core to our business moving forward.</p><p>As result of that event, we are beginning to see an increase in the number of opportunities to provide premium staffing, high value-add solutions, project-oriented services, and managed teams to our clients. This transition in our business is going to take some time as we shift our attention to selling higher-margin services to new buyers within and outside of our existing accounts.</p><p>Let me now take a moment to a highlight for you a few of the noteworthy wins from second quarter of 2008. In May, we announced a new project to deploy a criminal records index for the state of Alabama's Criminal Justice Information Center. To improve the speed, breadth, depth, and quality of searching and reporting crime information across the state we partnered with the University of Alabama and VisionWare to create a new criminal records index master.</p><p>The new CRI Master aligns with Alabama's Microsoft architecture and leverages VisionWare's proven tool to create a single view of their data by matching and cleansing records from different business systems. The Alabama Criminal Justice Information Center sees a direct correlation between efficiency and effectiveness of justice and equality of crime data and chose AIC and its partners to deliver its solution.</p><p>Last week, we issued a press release announcing a win with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. AIC has been selected as the prime to lead this important project and will be working in partnership with Microsoft and RiverGlass Incorporated to deploy an intelligent Web-monitoring and analytics solution. This solution will be enabled -- will enable the Las Vegas Police Department and the Southern Nevada Counterterrorism Center to better leverage information to prevent an act of terrorism, solve a crime, identify trends, and better deploy its resources.</p><p>We continue to see expanding opportunities in the state and local government industry vertical and are well equipped to help these organizations protect the safety of the people throughout their communities and across the nation.</p><p>In the second-quarter, we also won a website enhancement project from one of the world's largest real estate networks that is seeking to better support its agents, decrease costs, and improve the effectiveness of its online presence with more up-to-date technology. We will be using Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, better known as MOSS, to create a site that is more flexible and can scale to meet the needs of more than 100,000 agents throughout the world.</p><p>Finally, we are working with a financial products company to upgrade its current IT environment so that it can scale to support the protected growth of its business. AIC analyzes and evaluated its current environment including servers, desktops, software licenses, website domain controllers. We then helped design and implement the infrastructure they would need to support their growth and future business plans. Once we have upgraded the environment, we will provide them with the hosting services to improve the availability, security, and scalability of their systems.</p><p>Before we opened the call to questions, let me close by saying we are proud of what we have accomplished over the past six months, but we still have a lot more work to do. Whereas the first half of 2008 has been about addressing the financial model of our business, the second half of 2008 will be focused on execution and delivering results. Our priorities include sales and business development, recruiting and retention, business process improvements, continued work on our core infrastructure of the company, and lastly, employee alignment around our plan for AIC.</p><p>That concludes our prepared remarks. We now have time to take any questions and would like to open up the call for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) [Ron LaGrow], [The Athena Fund]</p><p>RON LAGROW, ANALYST, THE ATHENA FUND: I just want to let you know that good work on turning the business around. Obviously now it's time to start broadening the audience and trying seeking improvement on this stock performance.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: I agree.</p><p>RON LAGROW: Thank you.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, I think that when it comes to turning the business around we have still got work to go do. But we are following our plan and when it comes to broadening the stock performance, we need to get the word out. As we continue to move forward I think that our first and highest priority has been executing on our plan and getting in touch with our shareholders.</p><p>We have picked up some new shareholders, but we are certainly a long way away from becoming irrelevant and socialized story out in the marketplace. But I think that is going to come because we are going to put some focus on it.</p><p>RON LAGROW: Good, I'm glad to hear that. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Rick D'Auteuil, Columbia Management.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL, ANALYST, COLUMBIA MANAGEMENT: Good morning. A couple of questions -- are the poor margin revenues that you have eliminated, I think you said $50 million run rate. Are you finished with -- or $60 million I guess -- are you finished with those eliminations or is there more to come on that front?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, we certainly did complete those two which were account for approximately $60 million or a little over $60 million in run rate. I think you can -- we will see additional revenue reductions as we continue to incrementally reduce our sub-supplier business. So, Rick, I think we have not seen the end of revenue reductions of poor margin business, but the surgical removing of large pieces that we had planned to do is effectively behind us.</p><p>One thing that we will not continue to do is sign up for low margin, no margin, transactions with clients who are slow to pay their bills.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Essentially the staffing industry gets stuck in these pay rolling scenarios and that's just not good business for us. There might be big clients that demand it, but we are looking for ways for us to seek ways for us to deliver value. That is not the best way for us to do that.</p><p>There are some and we continue to not pursue those very low margin staffing opportunities. However, we will continue to provide staffing services, especially with our long-standing annuity accounts. These are great clients. They have been with Analyst a long time and we will continue -- and we can make money on them and deliver value. So we will continue to do that. But the low margin stuff we are still turned to get it identified and figure out a way out of it, but the big chunks, Rick, are behind us.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay. Of the $60 million that you gave up, I think in an earlier release there was almost no contribution margin to that. Is that correct?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: In the earlier release we identified that of that $60 million in business they generated $3 million in gross margins to which nearly $2.3 million of that were operating expense directly attributed. So on $60 million we had a contribution of about $700,000 and you can imagine the cost of the company in infrastructure to support that $60 million worth of transaction business.</p><p>Frankly, we would go out and borrow money to fund those receivables, which there are additional fees as you can imagine. So that business did not contribute to the bottom line of the Company.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Has the $2.3 million in operating expenses been eliminated related to that?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Yes, it has. I think we also identified in the release that we eliminated, permanently, 30 positions in the second quarter. Those eliminations were done in late in the quarter, in June.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay and just so I understand whether I'm double counting or not. But the $6 million analyzed SG&amp;A savings, is the $2.3 million or the 30 positions eliminated is that in addition to or incorporated into the $6 million that was originally contemplated, the $6 million annualized SG&amp;A savings?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Some of it was contemplated in that and some of it is additional.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Some of that, Rick, because we carried some of that payroll through the quarter and into the beginning of the third quarter. So we will really start to see the benefits this fiscal year show up in the latter part of Q3 and into Q4.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay. Then you know at the same time of these expense cuts you have been investing in more productive revenue producing personnel. Can you give us any detail on the contribution from that and I guess the pipeline that is developing around those assets?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Yes. So the number of transactions in our pipeline has increased. I will have better information for you guys in the future as our pipeline stabilizes. In fact, we now have a managed opportunity pipeline across the entire company and this is the first time for Analysts International to have that. As it stabilizes and I feel that data has a high quality factor, then I will share it with you as a metric that you can measure like the size of our pipeline, size of our backlog. We are not there yet, Rick.</p><p>But I can tell you that, for example, one of these deals in the real estate transactions that I announced was originated, organized, sold, closed, and staffed by a team of people who are new since I have joined the Company and this is a sizable project. So that is evidence that we are getting traction.</p><p>These are complex sales. For example, also the VisionWare deal that I talked about with Alabama. This is a -- VisionWare is a fantastic tool that comes out of the United Kingdom. We were introduced to that through one of our Microsoft managed partner representatives. They worked with us together in Alabama and we sold that gig. It's also a very sizable transaction that will lead to downstream business. All of that activity is directly resulting from the investments that we have made since November.</p><p>So those deals are -- selling more complicated deals takes time. The margins on them are good and the number of transactions in our pipeline has increased. So since the meeting we had in June, one of the things that we have started to do was track new leads that directly resulted from the training that we have that we conducted in June.</p><p>So we actually have a centralized group where all new leads are going into that group and they are managed through the lifecycle, at least they are tracked through the lifecycle. So they are keeping records for us so that I can come back to you with some good, hard numbers. Right now you are just going to get me talking anecdotally about it. As we improve our tracking, I will be more -- I will be able to give you better information.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: In your release, you have separated the restructuring charges. In there you also, I think, referenced consulting costs. What are those for and are they ongoing?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: We have tried to eliminate most all of the consultants inside the business. We still have a lingering -- I'm not talking about consultants that are helping us transform the business. We had a -- unfortunately, we had to get out and hire some help to manage through our recent unsolicited proposal. I think we have talked in the past about what the expense was of that; it continued to go up through the quarter.</p><p>We had to hire some folks to help us, that and hire or at least solicit and a new Board of Directors. We have had we had Alliance Management, a consulting firm that was hired by the company prior to my coming on board. They were retained to help us on capital structure and then a number of putting our plans together. Then actually they had a guy that was really good, we kept him on to help us do our facilities restructuring and that was a very effective thing. The significant amount of those consulting activities are behind us.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay. Is the status of the CFO search?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: We put everything on pause through the shareholder meeting and then after the sales event we conducted in early June I put the process back online and pressed play. Processed, interviewed some great candidates and we are down to a very, very small group. I should have something to announce before too long. And when -- I feel good about it. As soon as we have word on that, I will make an announcement. But I think we are making good progress.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Then my last question is when will we see a clean quarter with no restructuring broken out or some of these other items broken out? Is that Q3, Q4?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, Q3 will have some of the lingering transaction, because we actually closed on those deals in the first week of July. So we have -- at this moment, I have no planned restructuring for the fourth quarter.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: By the way, I would say, Rick, part of the reason the CFO search was -- we were able to put it on pause is that Mic Michels, our interim CFO, has been doing a really good job. So he is sitting here next to me, I just wanted to comment him while he is here on the phone.</p><p>We really have and we have done -- we have got a new audit committee with some very, very strong members of the board that have done a great job along with our -- the rest of our finance team. So I know some of you are listing, thank you very much. They have done a good job, but we are going to move forward with bringing in a permanent CFO as soon as possible.</p><p>RICK D'AUTEUIL: Okay, thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: [Craig Oestrom], [Van Clemmons]</p><p>CRAIG OESTROM, ANALYST, VAN CLEMMONS: Good morning, Mic. Good morning, Elmer. Congratulations on your continued success. I want to thank you for articulating your vision and the nuances of the improvements that are occurring at the company there and I appreciate this open dialogue.</p><p>I have two quick questions, will you share with us the value or the worth of this Symmetry sale? The second thing is how is the relationship with [Cushram], which became a shareholder and who made an offer back this winter?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Okay. So we haven't disclosed the value of this Symmetry sale. Unfortunately, I don't think we are going to. Let me just say it -- we didn't get a significant amount of money for it, but we got enough money to cover our costs. We will have a downstream pick up based on an earn out performance agreement that we have with COMSYS. But let me just -- so I'm sorry I can't give you -- I won't give you the specific numbers, Craig.</p><p>But let me just say something about COMSYS, they have been a really good partner in this thing. They have immediately jumped in and provided great quality of service to our clients. We had a handful of clients, like three clients, and these three clients acted as part of a seed in a new business that they are investing in. We are happy to be an early partner with them in that.</p><p>It's a conflict for us at inside Analysts International to be both the gatekeeper and the barbarian. We want to go down and break those (technical difficulty) and sell work. The fact is there is a conflict in that. I think I have talked about it on prior calls. COMSYS has been a really good partner. To date they have also -- we have been able to introduce them to some new opportunities at some of our clients and they have actually been working with us to get on the list as a referred vendor for some other managed services clients.</p><p>I think that the possibility that we will indeed receive downstream earn out from COMSYS is high. So we feel very -- at least early in the relationship, we feel good about the fact that we will have some upside pickup downstream from our transaction. But the size of the transaction was not material, it wasn't insignificant. But it has covered our cost and will give us some downstream bottom-line pickup because of the earn out.</p><p>The other question you had was on [Cushram] relationship. Quite honestly, I see them as a shareholder. They own a lot of stock in our Company and I get up every single day and go to work for them like I go to work for you and the rest. I don't -- other than the fact that they are a shareholder and had aggressively had an interest in a transaction, I have had no further conversations with [Cushram] since the annual shareholders meeting. But I will tell you, as long as they own our stock, I will be working for them.</p><p>CRAIG OESTROM: Again, congratulations on your success.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, thanks, Craig.</p><p>OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) [Steve Rudd], [USIP]</p><p>STEVE RUDD, ANALYST, USIP: Hi, Elmer. First, thanks for working as hard as you do. It's clear you are executing on your vision, so on that much kudos. Obviously, there is a way to go. I just want to cut through to where we are. It sounds like we are going to be a bit better in Q3 but maybe not GAAP profitable, even excluding one-time charges, which I guess there aren't going to be any at this point until Q4. Is that about right?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: I think you are -- let me refresh your question. Let me help me understand it. You are asking kind of like where we are and that we will, we may see some charges in Q3 but we don't anticipate seeing any restructuring charges in Q4?</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Right and that is just summarizing what you said earlier, but I am taking one further, one step further, saying it sounds to me like we won't be GAAP profitable, even excluding the one-time charges in Q3, but we probably should be by Q4.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, I will tell you that the number one objective of the management team, and it's written into their performance objectives and their comp plan, is to make this a profitable company on a sustainable basis. We gave guidance that we would turn profitable in the second half of this year and we are all still very focused on that. We are all incented on net profits as outlined in our comp plans that you can find on the web.</p><p>That is just part, it's a significant part of the culture of the Company. It changes the behavior of the management team and we are all tied to that nut. We all have it together. So really as the first half of this year we really wanted to do some cleanup work and I would tell you at the guidance of the Board. We had a strategy meeting with the board in January; they encouraged us to go even faster.</p><p>So where I had planned to take the full year to get some of these transactions completed, we actually completed them significantly earlier than planned. While that might be good from a cultural standpoint and from a turnaround standpoint to get a lot of that restructuring behind us so we can now refocus, it does have a bit of -- poses a challenge to the management team because there was a -- like Brittany would point out to me on a regular basis, there is a $700,000 contribution there.</p><p>But the honest truth is it was hiding or masking the good work that we have inside this business where we can do -- we are doing business at higher margins. If you look at our peer group, we are just not valued in line with what we believe our performance should indicate and it starts with profits.</p><p>Now as the second part of this year, as we look at what we are going to be doing it's really about getting out, and like I said in our priorities, developing business, selling work, retaining consultants, and gaining a greater sense of alignment with employees. Because we have got a couple thousand people, every one of those people should wake up every day caring about our company. So right after this call, here about lunchtime, we are going to have a brown bag employee call where they get to ask questions and we get to do with the issues that you guys are dealing with now.</p><p>That is really the work a head of us and that means we -- and so let's get all this restructuring behind us. Let's establish a financial model where my vision is that every month we make money. Every month we make money. I don't want to have to keep selling off and restructuring. I can't say that is gone forever. I mean we are in a business that is constantly changing and adopting to the demands in the market place, but -- and we still have some lingering clients in here that see us as a commodity staffing company.</p><p>But we can change their minds and we can sell them new work and we are. I am looking forward to it. But, so it really is a time now where we are, as a management team, we have been reflecting on what we have accomplished, but now we are setting a new game plan for what we have got to do in the next, this next second half of the year. Then we will have a new three-year plan to be published to the Board in this fall. We have a working session with the Board on strategy in the future, in October.</p><p>We are looking forward to that, because we think that at that point we will really be able to focus on where are we going with this thing and what can we expect to look like in the future. When I have that then I can give you guys some milestones or some measures to hold us accountable to.</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Right. I guess the new folks you brought on, it sounds like the higher margin business takes -- has somewhat longer lead times. We don't fully have a handle on -- we have a handle that we have more in the pipeline, not fully a handle on the probability ratios adjacent to each of those opportunities at this point --?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: No, I would say part of putting it in the pipeline is we actually do have a solution selling methodology that we are subscribing to and they do have strict probability guidelines and measurements. What takes time is salespeople adopting that methodology and being really strict about it. Anybody that has run a sales organization would know that you have all different levels of quality in those opportunities.</p><p>Some of them the dates aren't correct, the amounts aren't correct, the probabilities aren't correct. That is the art of selling; it's knowing how that opportunity is tracking through from lead to close and then on to revenue. So what I don't have a handle on yet is the total pipeline quality, but every single opportunity in our pipeline we do actually measure probability with some pretty strict observable criteria.</p><p>But it just takes time for that to become institutionalized and a way of doing business at a company, especially one where you have got this many people, over 100 people, involved in business development at this company. We had that good training session in June and we anticipate having another one in the first quarter of 2009. It's just a regular process for us.</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Okay --</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: We don't -- we are not really -- they are longer sales cycles for more complex transactions. But you know we hope to enjoy significantly better margins. We have practices within our business that are operating where the margins are in the 30s. We want to scale those businesses so that our blended margin continues to go up. You will see our margins improve as we have indicated when we get out of some of the single-digit margins.</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Okay, well you clearly are on top of it. Again we appreciate as a shareholder and where we have been accumulating, but we appreciate what you have been doing. So just keep at it, and keep reducing your sleep hours, you will be great.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Thanks a lot, Steve.</p><p>STEVE RUDD: Take care. Thank you, Elmer.</p><p>OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) [Ed Grignavicious], [TSI].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just a couple quick questions, one to follow-up with Steve. So bottom line are we saying that in the second quarter we won't be profitable? I mean in the second half of the year we won't be profitable?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Okay, so I think you are asking me will we be profitable in the second half of the year. Is that your question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Correct.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Our plan is to be profitable in the second half of the year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. A follow-up question in regards to what Rick was talking about in terms of the amount of revenue that was exited. The majority has been done. As far as the remaining, is it $10 million, is it $20 million? I just want to get a sense of what is still remaining.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: You know, I can't -- let me just take a quick look. It's hard for me to break it out right now, Ed, but I would say it could be as much as $10 million.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Alright. Then --</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: It could exceed that depending on the speed at which we address some of the problems. But there still could be a range of $10 million to $20 million inside the business that still is -- we are either going to fix it or fire it. But it's not -- and we will continue to seek ways to run the Company leaner.</p><p>Many, many, many of the cuts that we have made were very hard for our company. We have reduced over 100 people from SG&amp;A positions since I have been here. These are people we really liked. These are people we worked with. These are people, many of them have been with Analysts International for many years. Without a lot of formal process, relationships drive the way you do business. So we are rebuilding process from the front end to the back end of the business to accommodate the loss of some of these important relationships.</p><p>So I am saying to not only you, but to the employees on this call, we have an obligation to now deliver a profitable company. Those cuts were coming from our core centralized functions. You can't just, you can't cut the field and think that you are going to make this business better. It doesn't escape me for a minute that there is two drivers to shareholder value. The first one is profits. The second one is a growth.</p><p>We are not ready to get out and grow this company until we have really fixed the model. But we have got to continue to see growth in segments of our business. We know that we need to report to you and the rest of the shareholders more information about our segment performance. We are looking at ways to do that and our audit committee has also been, at the Board level, was talking to me about it.</p><p>I'm going to look for ways to give you information to hold us accountable and to know what we are actually doing inside this company. But we have still got work to do on some of that low margin business. We have got -- we want to get this restructuring business behind us. You are not going to turn this company around by cutting it. We have got to turn it on by putting power to it, so that is what the investment in sales and leadership is all about.</p><p>And so you know I think in some ways also, I will be honest with all of you, I think what might have been going a little slow incrementalizing. We have got to make some bigger bets from a business development standpoint. I want to increase my sales headcount in the field. So some of these reductions that we have made, I will look for ways to invest that money in the right places in our field organization so that we can grow this business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: As far as the economy goes, how are you guys faring? What do you see for impacts to your existing clients? Overall it still seems like the IT professional services market is doing well. I mean they are hiring. I don't see it in a significant slowdown.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Yes, I think -- that is a good -- if someone was to say, Elmer, how do you feel about the IT services economy, I would say, hey, we are hiring. But I would say demand is flat. It's not like there is any gale force winds out there where there is a revolution. It's blocking and tackling; it's staying in tight alignment with certain technologies in certain markets and finding your niches.</p><p>I wouldn't say Analysts International was much of a niche player to date, but we are seeking to find our niches. Those niches could be regional; they could be by industry and by subject matter expertise and by partner expertise. So we are seeking to find those. I think there are some good strong niches.</p><p>I will tell you something, we need to -- one of the things that I talk about being a company in balance, we have got to have a good balance between our government business and our commercial business, through our public sector and our private sector business. We have some good balance between those. We are seeking to expand in our government business, especially in those areas where the government will continue to spend money.</p><p>I tell you right now, they will continue to spend money to secure this secure the safety of the citizens of the United States. So we know that, we know that there is good funding out of the federal government. The federal government helps fund some of the local initiatives, the state initiatives. These are integrated opportunities, that is why we are going to continue to bet on them.</p><p>Later on this week, I am going to be meeting with some police officers and some chiefs of police in Southern California. California is a huge market. We have not, barely tapped it yet with this criminal justice opportunity, and so we are seeking to continue to expand. As some of the work that we are doing in that government space is a direct crossover to opportunity for us to provide services to the commercial marketplace.</p><p>A lot of big companies, utility companies, big industrial companies, have security issues every single day. They want the tools in their hands to protect their corporate assets. What we do in the integration of systems and now our ability to provide analytics to law enforcement is there is a direct opportunity to cross over and sell the type of work in the commercial space.</p><p>So I think we have got to find our niches. The economy -- it is anyone's guess what is going to happen. The big tech companies have all had pretty good earnings, but the U.S. is their weakest market. You look at IBM, IBM is a global company. Most of their performance is coming from outside of the United States. So with the dollar down, the U.S. IT labor market is pretty unattractive.</p><p>So that is why I am trying to sell, I am trying to tell my people, make sure that the work that we are focused on is work that has hard payback, not justified on soft dollars. We look for niches in areas where we can add value. Those are the things that continue to in demand.</p><p>I think some of the biggest high-volume labor are staffing clients we have. Those are getting tougher and tougher. Screwing down even tougher rules, additional discounts, reduced hours for work days, reduced rates for redeployments. That is a really, really tough market. It's a tough industry. So the biggest are looking to screw down even tighter, but there is lots of opportunity out there in the marketplace to define your niches and that is what we are trying to do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: One last question. As far as -- again, appreciate everything that you are doing, what Analyst is doing to get us to the point of profitability. What do you see as your strategy for getting institutional interest and just more of a retail market interest?</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: To date we really have not -- we have kind of put the whole investor relations part of our game plan on hold. In fact, we had to redivert some of our operating budget to the unsolicited proposal from [Cushram]. With that behind us, I think that we have been getting lots of good advice from some of our Board. Some of the new Board members have hands-on experience in investor relations.</p><p>It's a high -- it was a high degree of interest in the interviews I have had with CFOs. I really want to get my CFO on board and on the ground. Then I am also interviewing, I have three IR firms as candidates to assist us with the process. But we are, I think you will see that we will increase the amount of conversation we have with those folks that provide sell-side coverage. Hopefully, somebody will come along with some interest and think that we have got a story to tell and believe in what we are saying. We have got to get somebody to pay attention to us.</p><p>Right now, I think I remember talking to one of the Analysts International shareholders early in the game and I think his quote to me was, you know, from a stock standpoint, from a market standpoint, from an investor standpoint, you guys are irrelevant. Meaning we have -- you have to almost make a reservation to buy stock in the company. Our volume is still very low. I think we are when you look at our peer group, we are valued at the lowest.</p><p>We have got to get our story out there. We have got to get -- we have got to show that we are executing to our plan. That is the most important thing that I focused on this year. But I think that we know the names of all of the folks that are providing sell-side coverage in our marketplace. I would hope that they listen to our story and keep a watch on us.</p><p>My commitment is we will continue to report progress against our plan. I think when those two things come together, we will be on the right track to building more liquidity in this -- with this stock and maybe see our enterprise value get more in line with peer group.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I appreciate your time.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Thanks, Ed.</p><p>OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) We have no further questions in the queue at this point. I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any closing or additional remarks.</p><p>ELMER BALDWIN: Well, I appreciate you guys joining us on the call this morning. Thank you very much. We have had a pretty -- I can see online that we have probably the, one of the most popular calls we have had in a while. So there is quite a few of you on the line.</p><p>I want to thank you very much for your time. I want to thank the employees of Analysts International for the hard work. I look forward to talking to you all again in the future as we have -- make progress against our plan. As we -- when we have news, I will announce it to the marketplace and continue to be as open as possible with you on these calls. Thank you all very much for your time. Take care.</p><p>OPERATOR: That does conclude our conference for today.

For the Q&amp;A session, we ask that the callers limit their questions to one to allow full broader participation. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at NYSE Euronext. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>STEPHEN DAVIDSON, IR, NYSE EURONEXT: Thank you, Chanel. Good morning and welcome to the NYSE Euronextsecond-quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Before I introduce today's speakers, let me remind you that comments on the call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These statements are based on NYSE Euronext's current expectations and involve risk and uncertainties that could cause NYSE Euronext's actual results to differ materially from those in the statements.</p><p>These forward-looking statements speak as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. Please refer to our SEC filings for a full discussion of the risk factors that may affect any forward-looking statements.</p><p>Except for any obligation to disclose material information under the federal securities laws, NYSE Euronextundertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after this conference call.</p><p>We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures during this call. These non-GAAP measures are fully reconciled in the tables attached to the text of the earnings press release that we issued earlier today.

We are incorporating slides for the call today, which are available for viewing on our website and Mike, Tom and Duncan will refer to these slides during their remarks. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER, GROUP EVP &amp; CFO, NYSE EURONEXT: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We are pleased to share our second-quarter 2011 results with you characterized by increasing revenue diversification, disciplined cost control and strong capital management.</p><p>For the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.61 per share on net revenue of $661 million, down from $0.64 per share on $654 million in net revenue in the prior-year period. You will recall that Q2 2010 trading volume benefited from a strong spike in volatility from the advent of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, as well as the flash crash in the US.</p><p>Strong non-volume-related revenues combined with the weakening of the dollar year-over-year increased our net revenue by $51 million, helping to more than offset the impact of declines in trading volume across most our venues. Of particular note, during the quarter, our technology services business increased revenue by 14% and registered operating margins of 30%.</p><p>On the expense front, we continued to show cost management discipline. Our expenses increased $12 million, or 3% to $419 million. On a constant currency and portfolio basis, our expenses declined 3% or $14 million compared to the second quarter of 2010.</p><p>Global headcount is below 3000 despite completing several smaller deals since the middle of last year, including the acquisition of Corporate Board Member and the joint venture with APX to create NYSE Blue.</p><p>With our strong free cash flow in the second quarter, we retired $200 million in commercial paper, which reduced our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.7 times, the lowest level since the merger of NYSE and Euronext. A significant contributor to our free cash flow has been the reduction in capital expenditures, which were $31 million in Q2, down from $70 million in the prior-year period.</p><p>So in summary, our results were solid year-over-year against a backdrop of an average 17% decline in trading volumes across our four primary venues.</p><p>Slide 4 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter of 2011. For the quarter, net income and EPS were below prior year, but in line with the first quarter of 2011. Second-quarter 2010 results benefited from a net $54 million pretax gain from disposal activity, principally the sale of our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India.</p><p>This quarter, we reported an $18 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, which included $12 million related to our pending business combination. Year-to-date, a total of $27 million has been spent on the pending merger.</p><p>My review of financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs, gains from disposal activities and discreet tax items.</p><p>Slide 5 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter and year-to-date. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.61, down 5% versus the prior year's $0.64 and below the $0.68 in the first quarter of 2011.</p><p>For the first half of 2011, EPS is $1.28, up 9% versus prior year. Volumes decreased dramatically last year following the second-quarter volatility. We believe this represents a favorable backdrop for second-half growth as the lower volume comparables will accompany continued strength in non-volume-based revenues.</p><p>On June 29, we closed the sale of our 52.8% stake in the NYSE Amex options business. For the quarter, we reported 100% of the profits from this business. As the transaction closed on April 1 of the second quarter, our diluted EPS for the second quarter would have been $0.02 lower. This transaction provides a facility for the partners to require us to purchase a portion of their investments at specific intervals over a five-year period. We expect to repurchase 10% of the partner's stake in the third quarter. We are extremely pleased with the performance of this venture, which has increased its marketshare from about 6% at the time we acquired American Stock Exchange to 15% at the end of Q2.</p><p>Our diluted share count increased to 263 million shares in the second quarter as a result of the issuance of approximately 340,000 shares to former Amex members in connection with the sale of a former American Stock Exchange headquarters.</p><p>Slide 6 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The US dollar weakened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the pound. For the second quarter, 49% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds and 51% in US dollars.</p><p>Currency impact on net revenue was favorable $33 million versus prior year and favorable $11 million versus the prior quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, second-quarter net revenues were down 4% and operating income declined 9% versus the second quarter of 2010.</p><p>Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listing segment were down 12% and 2% respectively and the Technology segment grew 9% versus Q2 prior year.</p><p>On slide 7, we show the positive impact of non-volume-related revenue, which reflects the increasing diversification of our model. The $18 million in incremental net revenue generated by non-volume-related activities helped dampen the impact of lower trading volumes across most of our venues.</p><p>Second-quarter 2010 trading volume benefited from much higher levels of volatility driven by the sovereign debt crisis and the flash crash. This incremental revenue came from a variety of streams including, technology services, listings and other revenues such as Corporate Board Member and NYSE Blue.</p><p>When trading volumes do return to more historical norms, we will get the full benefit of our diversification efforts, which helped us weather down volume cycles. July volumes are already showing a more favorable trend. NYSE Euronextvolumes for US options and European cash trading were each up over 15% on July 2010 levels while LIFFE CONNECT volumes were similar and only US cash was lower.</p><p>Slides 8 and 9 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Global derivative volume decreased 12% year-over-year driven primarily by declines in trading volume in European derivatives. European derivative volumes were impacted by lower equity futures, reduced risk capital and lower volatility.</p><p>Net revenues declined by 6% in the quarter. Derivatives accounted for 32% of our net revenues, 41% of our operating income in Q2. The increase in fixed operating expenses for the Derivatives segment was driven by the mitigation to the new data centers -- sorry -- the migration to the new data centers, some software upgrades being implemented this quarter and new business development spending.</p><p>The average net rate per contract for NYSE Liffe derivatives was $0.74 per contract in the second quarter compared to 64% in the second quarter of 2010, $0.69 in the first quarter of 2011. The increase versus the second quarter of last year was due to the weaker dollar. Excluding the favorable impact of currency fluctuation, capture would have been $0.67 in the current quarter. Rate per contract in US options was $0.165 per contract in the second quarter, in line with the prior year and first quarter.</p><p>Similarly, slide 10 and 11 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listing segment. Cash Trading and Listing's net revenue was $327 million in the second quarter of 2011, up 2% versus the prior-year period and in line with the first quarter of 2010. These results were achieved despite declines in US and European cash trading ADVs of 35% and 11% respectively.</p><p>Lackluster volumes were more than offset by positive currency moves and strong non-volume-related revenues, which included growth in listings revenues and new revenue streams from Corporate Board Member and NYSE Blue.</p><p>Marketshare was down slightly in Q2 for both US cash and our four European markets compared to the prior year. Marketshare for both venues, however, increased versus the prior quarter. Tape A share in the US was 35% and European cash share was 71%. Revenue capture for the US cash trended up to $0.039 for 100 shares handled for Q2, well above the $0.03 recorded in the second quarter of 2010.</p><p>Since the second quarter of 2010, we have implemented dynamic tiers based on overall US consolidated volume and removed the inversion at the highest tier on Arca. These changes, combined with higher client take fees on NYSE, Q2 rebalances for some of the larger indexes and a favorable mix have been driving higher capture rates. While we are pleased with this development, we expect second-half capture rates to soften somewhat from the Q2 levels.</p><p>Revenue capture for European cash of $0.74 increased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Including the positive impact of currency fluctuation, capture was basically flat year-over-year.</p><p>Slide 12 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $122 million in the second quarter, an increase of $15 million or 14% from Q2 prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in safety and co-location revenue and revenue growth from managed service sales from TSE, WSE and Sigma X.</p><p>Operating margin was 30% compared to 19% in the second quarter of 2010; adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%. We recently announced an agreement to acquire Metabit, a Tokyo-based provider of market access services to the Asian market. The acquisition supports our growing focus on the Asian market and strategic goal of building a global liquidity network. We expect to close this transaction around the end of August. Year-to-date revenues are running 10% above the prior-year period. We continue to target a growth rate of 15% for full year 2011.</p><p>Slide 13 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. Second-quarter operating expenses were up $12 million versus last year on a reported basis. 42% of our expenses in the second quarter were denominated in either euros or pounds. If adjusting for FX and the impact of the transaction, such as NYSE Blue JV and the acquisition of Corporate Board Member, fixed operating costs were down $14 million or 3% in the second quarter of 2010.</p><p>We continue to make good progress and are focused on efficiency and productivity improvements that will further reduce operating expenses. Year-to-date, our fixed costs are flat compared to prior year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency and changes to our portfolio, our expenses are running 4% below prior-year levels. As a result, we are confident of our ability to meet our full-year cost guidance of expenses below $1.65 billion on a constant dollar and constant portfolio basis.</p><p>For the first half of 2011, we reported costs of $834 million and if adjusting for $19 million of unfavorable FX variance versus prior-year rates and $8 million in incremental costs from the March 2011 NYSE Blue joint venture, first-half constant dollar, constant portfolio costs were $807 million.</p><p>Slide 14 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2011. The Company ended the quarter in a strong financial position, well-positioned for our combination with Deutsche Boerse. As a result of our strong free cash flow in the first half of 2011, we retired our remaining commercial paper during the quarter, leaving the Company without any short-term debt as of June 30.</p><p>In the first half, we have repaid $366 million of short-term debt. Given the extremely low borrowing costs for commercial paper, this should have a minimal impact on reported interest expense.</p><p>With the retirement of our outstanding commercial paper, our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.7 times, down from 2.2 times at the end of 2010 and the lowest level since NYSE and Euronext merged. Second-quarter capital expenditures remained low at only $31 million compared to $70 million in the prior-year quarter. Year-to-ate capital spending is $67 million. While we do expect capital spending to pick up in the second half, we are on track to be well below our full-year guidance of less than $200 million.</p><p>Last week, the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2011, which is payable on September 30. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom Callahan for an update on one of our most important new initiatives.</p><p>TOM CALLAHAN, CEO, NYSE LIFFE US, NYSE EURONEXT: Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to provide you with an update on the continued growth of our US futures platform. We have already accomplished more than any other new exchange in the US interest rate futures space in just a little over five months into the launch of our new interest rate products.</p><p>Before diving into our results to date, let me first level set the discussion with background on our strategy as shown on slide 15. NYSE LiffeUS has four core pillars of its strategy, which closely relate to the NYX corporate strategy of building a capital markets community. That strategy is based on four key objectives known internally as the code -- connect, operate, deliver, enable. These pillars strongly interrelate and it has always been our belief that without any one piece of the strategy, the others don't work.</p><p>Connect, underpinning our execution plan is a strong technology platform that leverages existing connectivity for our core Liffe clients. Having NYX systems as the cornerstone to all aspects of our exchange ensures that we bring a stable, globally distributed, high-performance platform to the market.</p><p>Operate, our strong value proposition has provided a catalyst for a variety of customers to support our new platform. This helps create a diverse liquid market with open interest that is growing virtually every day. The most difficult hurdle for any new exchange is creating a consistent base liquidity and our customers are telling us that we have accomplished that.</p><p>Deliver, NYPC delivers one of the core value propositions for NYSE Liffe US, capital efficiency via single pot margining between cash and futures. At a time when capital efficiency has never been more important, this innovation is tremendously relevant.</p><p>Enable, NYSE LiffeUS has been built through a variety of partnerships. For example, the partnership with MSCI to power our equity index futures complex, which was recently expanded with the successful migration of MSCI EAFE and MSCI emerging markets indices from another exchange, the semi-mutualized structure of the exchange whereby NYX owns NYSE LiffeUS in partnership with six sophisticated market participants, and the joint venture between DTCC and NYX, which created New York Portfolio Clearing.</p><p>Turning to slide 16, we highlight the progression of our interest rate products since launch. We launched interest rate features on our platform starting with Eurodollars on March 21, 2011. We have had strong support in our Eurodollars since launch with approximately 65,000 lots of average daily volume.</p><p>Our US Treasury futures were relaunched on July 7. ADV since our relaunch is 30,000 lots. Volume growth drivers include strong market support from a diverse set of market participants, growing open interest of 29,000 lots as of July 29. Open interest in both products is strong and is growing rapidly. Open interest for the rates complex is now over 700,000 contracts and our total exchange is rapidly approaching a million contracts with 805,000 as of July 29.</p><p>As evidenced by our growth of open interest, we have a diverse range of market participants transacting volume every day on our platform with a geographically diverse group of marketmakers, banks and end-user customers.</p><p>Lastly, on slide 17, we provide you with the five key areas that will drive our future growth. Our strategy going forward starts with building on the existing success we have had on our platform. New customers are accessing our markets regularly and we are pleased to welcome ABN AMRO and Citi as new NYPC clearing members just this week. We are excited to launch Eurodollar options in the first quarter of 2012.</p><p>We are working to expand the capital efficiencies afforded to include customers in addition to the current clearing number of house positions hopefully to go live in early 2012.</p><p>New products, we are working on a variety of innovative new product ideas. And finally, the MSCI expansion. We haven't really spent a lot of time on this asset class today, but we are optimistic about the potential for our equity index futures complex. We've successfully migrated 70,000 lots in open interest from CME to our platform in June 2011 in the emerging markets and EAFE futures. Over $3 trillion in assets under management our benchmarked to MSCI indices globally, so we are quite optimistic for the development of these futures markets. So with that, let me turn the call over to Duncan.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, </nameText></person>CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: All right, thanks a lot, Tom. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody. Greetings from London. Just doing a quick tour through Europe so we thought we would do the earnings from here today and then my team and I will be in Frankfurt tomorrow doing some work on the merger.</p><p>But before I get to the combination with DB, I did want to take a minute on slide 18 just to comment on several key developments in our segments, which I believe go a long way towards highlighting the fact that, despite the tremendous efforts that we are all engaged in on the merger, we have tried to isolate these efforts within our organization so that our business people can stay focused and continue to execute. I am personally very proud of what we have been able to accomplish in the first half of 2011 and I want to thank my colleagues for all of their hard work on behalf of all of our shareholders.</p><p>First, on the Derivatives business, you just heard from Tom with regard to how we are doing on Liffe US and NYPC and in addition, I am very pleased to note that we successfully closed the sale of the stake in our NYSE Amex options business that Mike alluded to earlier. Our partners in that venture will be integral in helping us implement new order types and market structure changes that will enhance our exchange and further grow our marketshare.</p><p>On the Cash Trading in Listings business, we continue to see growing momentum in our Listings franchise. We were number one globally for IPOs for the second consecutive quarter and I am proud that NYSE has won 55% of the technology IPOs year-to-date, up from a previous record high of 44% in 2010.</p><p>Our recent big tech wins include LinkedIn and Pandora. Additionally, year-to-date, we continue to see transfers from other exchanges with a total of eight transfers year-to-date, including Hudson Valley Holding Corp, which began trading on the NYSE today and Regency Energy Partners, which will begin trading at the NYSE on August 9. There have been no transfers going the other way so far this year.</p><p>During the quarter and late last week, we experienced several outages in our European cash markets. We have identified the root cause of these outages; we have stabilized the environment; and we are putting in place the infrastructure that will prevent these outages from occurring in the future.</p><p>Lastly, on slide 18, a bit about our Information Services and Technology Solutions business. Happy to report that we are on track for full-year revenue growth of 15% and our goal of $1 billion in revenue by 2015. We will hit this target by continually expanding our global liquidity network through our hub expansion program and acquisitions like Metabit that we announced just last week.</p><p>We will also continue to embed ourselves in the trading fabric of our clients with initiatives like our cloud launch, which creates the first capital markets community platform.</p><p>Shifting to slide 19, I wanted to spend the next couple of slides talking a bit about the merger process with Deutsche Boerse. Slide 19 focuses on where we stand with regard to integration planning. With the strong support of our shareholders behind us, we are moving beyond the votes and focusing on the various regulatory streams that we have to work through, as well as our integration planning.</p><p>On integration, we have already made some tough decisions together, which have been laid out in the business combination agreement, so the framework for operating Newco is already in place and it is very clear who is responsible for what through the closing.</p><p>Next, a key list of integration planning topics was identified early in the process and resulted in an increase in our synergy targets as we found more similarities than originally assumed. For example, we were able to find more common ground than we expected on our future IT architecture.</p><p>Already in the second quarter, we have formed a joint and dedicated integration planning team, named the senior managers in charge of running the integration planning effort and established full-fledged integration teams, including divisional experts and project support personnel. The future management team is also working to set the goals and priorities for the integration planning process until closing, so we feel very confident as a team that we have set ambitious and achievable targets.</p><p>With the overwhelming support for the transaction provided by shareholders from both companies, management attention has shifted towards receiving the requisite non-objection declarations from regulators, as well as preparing the ground for a swift and effective integration post-closing.</p><p>Lastly, while the integration teams will continue to drill down into the synergy targets, we will also begin to focus on some of the softer aspects of the integration, including setting the foundation for the harmonization of our two cultures. This is a complex cross-border deal and our goal is to create a culture of performance that matches our leadership position in the global exchange space.</p><p>Given both companies' strong and rich histories of operating in international environments, as well as the specific examples of teamwork that I have just outlined as our teams begin to work together, a good example of which was winning overwhelming approval from the shareholders of both companies, I am confident that we will be successful in integrating our cultures.</p><p>Shifting to slide 20, I wanted to spend a few minutes outlining the European commission review process and the benefits of our combination for all customers and users and the markets. Of particular focus for us is the European commission review process, which really has been ongoing for some time through pre-notification discussions after we announced our transaction and recently with our final competition filing, which we submitted in late June.</p><p>This week, the competition authorities in the EU are expected to complete the first phase of their investigation during which they have collected opinions from our peers, customers, competitors and other stakeholders. Some of the views that the commission has collected have already been disclosed publicly and it should not surprise any of us on this call that our competitors have been the most vocal about their concerns regarding our pending business combination. This was expected and we have absolute confidence that the commission will carefully consider the source of these objections.</p><p>Let's make it clear that we expect to be notified by the competition authorities later this week, that we will embark on a Phase 2 process. For our part, we continue to run a very diligent and comprehensive process in close collaboration with our colleagues at DB to respond to requests from the commission. Our deal is the right answer for the European capital markets. Putting our two companies together will create tremendous benefits for all customers and end-users in terms of capital efficiency and operational simplification and cost reduction.</p><p>Secondly, it will strengthen and improve efficiency of the EU capital markets in terms of liquidity, lower volatility and cost of capital. And it is important to note that any negative impact on competition is not significant given the global nature of derivative markets, the increasing competition between OTC and listed markets generally and in derivatives specifically and the simple well-known fact that NYX and DB1 don't really compete against one another. The only area of overlap in our current business models is in some single-named derivatives and of course, we are only two of many players in those markets.</p><p>With respect to competition issues, we don't want to front-run the regulators, but my guess is that their focus will be on what conditions may be placed on us, not how to make or break the deal. This is a process that lends itself to speculation and we understand that. Not surprisingly, a lot of the speculation has been driven by our competitors, as I mentioned earlier and much of it has focused on remedies, in particular some who have opined on whether we would be asked to dispose of certain businesses like our NYSE Liffe or Eurex derivatives franchises.</p><p>Obviously European derivatives are a critically important part of our combination providing synergies, capital efficiencies and other significant shareholder and customer benefits. And of course, as in any deal, at some point, the logic of the combination would not hold together, but we think the regulators are weighing the issues carefully and will provide a thoughtful and balanced approach.</p><p>So in short, we are giving them what they need to consider the issues presented, but we can't and won't predict the outcome of their deliberations, but we will continue to collaborate. We are confident that the benefits that our combination will provide the clients and the market overall do and will continue to resonate with regulators and we look forward to continuing our constructive discussions with the commission and the case team in Brussels. Still hopeful that we will be able to close our transaction in 2011.</p><p>Lastly, just some concluding remarks. In closing, our results for the quarter were solid and we are pleased with the progress we are making on our strategy to create a global capital markets community that will empower our clients to innovate and collaborate. As a result of our diversification efforts over the past several quarters, our business model is much better positioned to weather lackluster trading volume cycles as we saw particularly in this quarter.</p><p>We have additional drivers of growth gaining traction with interest rate futures on NYSE LiffeUS and NYPC. The clearing and post-trade businesses will continue to be a particular area of focus for us as a combined company and we have strong growth coming from our Technology segment in 2011 and beyond.</p><p>We continue to see momentum in our Listings franchise, securing the number one position in global IPOs for the second consecutive quarter and lastly, with our respective shareholder votes behind us, we are fully focused on the regulatory approval process targeting a close for our business combination with Deutsche Boerse in 2011. With that, we would be happy to open the line for your questions. Thanks for listening.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Roger Freeman.</p><p>ROGER FREEMAN, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Hi, good morning. I guess my question would be around NYSE Liffe and NYPC in total. Can you give us ballpark or quantify how much those businesses are in a negative profit position right now or in a loss position? And secondly on NYPC, can you just talk to the growing open interest versus sort of stable volumes and marketshare? What is the nature of the open interest? Is that sort of a chunky block -- block trades coming in?</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: I'll take the first part about the financials and then we will turn it over to Tom. So what we have indicated in the last couple of years is that NYSE Liffe has been in investment mode and that we have lost -- reported about a $30 million operating loss for that business. Now remember, we own 58% and we have minority partners who have 42% of that business. We don't report the profitability each quarter as the interest rate business is just starting -- it is in its infancy. I think we are doing a little better than that $30 million loss that we reported last year, but we are still in a large investment position at this stage.</p><p>TOM CALLAHAN: In terms of the growth of open interest, we said before we even launched the platform that our success would be measured as much by our growth in OI as by our volumes because we made a strategic decision back in 2009 when we designed the platform to really have capital efficiency as the centerpiece of the new exchange.</p><p>So the fact that both our partners and our customers are recognizing that and are really making a long-term commitment to the platform by moving open interest is enormously gratifying and exciting for us. We are seeing new partners coming into our market virtually every single day and as they do, the open interest, as you can see from the chart in the deck, is steadily increasing every single day.</p><p>So 800,000 lots of open interest across the exchange, 700,000 lots at NYPC for a platform that is five months old is just great progress and great early momentum and I think it validates the strategy of delivering operational and capital efficiencies through the NYPC platform.</p><p>ROGER FREEMAN: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Rich Repetto, Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>RICH REPETTO, ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL: Yes, good morning, guys. I don't want to do this, but I'll stay on the topic of NYSE Liffe here since we have Thomas. You talked about the number -- I guess the loss, Michael, but we still have -- well, here is the questions. We still have the free marketmaking or at least some liquidity providers are still free until I think '12. And then -- so I am just trying to see what type of volume do you need to break even either before '12 or once the -- is it the fee -- once you start charging fees in March of '12, that could move it or how much volume do we need? And then also this relaunch of treasury, I know there was an issue with the contract and can you just remind us -- the efficient -- are there capital efficiencies with Eurodollars, as well as we know about the treasuries?</p><p>TOM CALLAHAN: Sure. So I think there might be three questions in there, so I will try to hit them one at a time. I think what you might have been referring to in terms of the fee holiday was the first three months of NYPC where there was a fee holiday on clearing fees that went from March 21 to June 21, so that has since expired.</p><p>In terms of the profitability of the overall platform, it really comes down, as you know, to the ecosystem of different types of customers because, of course, you have marketmakers all the way to end-user customers and the thing that we have been most gratified by outside of the growth in open interest that I discussed previously was the amount of end-user customers, the non-members that are coming into our platform. We have done over 300,000 lots of customer block trades from large US asset managers. So the fact that we are seeing that kind of commitment from real end-user customers really I think is a great vote of confidence in a new platform, but, of course, in terms of the rate per contract, that helps us enormously as well.</p><p>I think the final question was around capital efficiency and the Eurodollars benefit from the capital efficiencies of NYPC, the answer is absolutely. The largest source of margin at FICC is actually their repo clearing business and repos have a very high correlation with Eurodollar contracts, so there is a terrific amount of capital efficiency there. And I think that helps explain the open interest growth that we have had.</p><p>And then in terms of the relaunch of the treasury complex, when we launched the platform on March 21, the big difference between treasury futures and Eurodollar futures is, of course, treasury futures are physically delivered. Customers wanted to see that NYPC could manage its first physical delivery. It did that successfully in June and really more than anything, that helped build confidence once we got through that period into July for customers to really start increasing their level of activity. And that is why you saw when we relaunched the platform on July 7 our volume in open interest start to increase immediately.</p><p>RICH REPETTO: I think -- you are saying that all the trades were -- all the waivers for the trades were ended in June. I think on your website it still has trade fees waived for approved marketmakers till March 21.</p><p>TOM CALLAHAN: Oh, yes. That is on the exchange side, Rich, not on the clearinghouse side. Of course, for the people who make markets in our platform and sign market-making agreements, there are fee waivers and that is very standard in the futures industry. And that will, of course, continue because you always need marketmakers. But what I was referring to in terms of the end-user customers and the early adoption that we have seen, obviously those are fee-paying customers and the more of those we get, the better the balance sheet of the business will look.</p><p>RICH REPETTO: Got it. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Alex Kramm, UBS.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM, ANALYST, UBS: Hey, good morning. Just wanted to quickly shift gears to the deal, in particular that slide where you highlight the benefits for end users. Now when I look at the reduction in capital requirements, in particular, that $3 billion, I mean looking at that and talking to some, the broker folks in the industry, it sounds like people are generally very excited about this and I think they made that case heard in their antitrust submissions.</p><p>I think the big issue is to really have confidence with some of these numbers though. So hoping to see if there will be anything else that you can provide in the future. I mean if I look at that $3 billion number, I look back what CME and CDOC did in 2004, I mean I probably can come up with a number like that myself.</p><p>So I think what people struggle with, in particular on the dealer side, is can we put portfolios together, show them to you and you can tell us, hey, this is really what we are getting, in particular given that there are different regulatory frameworks between Eurex and Liffe and other challenges, but probably will take some time to put that together. So any commentary would be great there. Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Alex, it is Duncan. I will take that one. So we certainly intend to be very transparent on that and as we get closer to closing or shortly after closing when we are talking about migration plans, combinations of clearinghouses and giving the clients a roadmap of when all that can happen, when we are one company, it will be a lot easier to go a lot deeper.</p><p>So far, obviously, we've wanted to be cautious. We came up with that number that we have quoted by doing sort of what you suggested. We went to a few big customers and we said, look, we can't really look at each other's positions right now. You know what positions you have in both places. Why don't each of us give you the data and then let's run some correlations, let's run some analyses and let's see what we come up with.</p><p>So we felt pretty good that EUR2 billion or $3 billion was a fairly good number out of the gate based on some testing that we did, but I imagine we will be able to put a much finer point to that as we get closer to the closing and into the operating as Newco. And it is a great question because it is a significant benefit to the marketplace and it is obviously in our interest to be honest about it, but also be as clear with as many as we can that that is a real savings, not an illusory one.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: So do you think, and this is the same question, so do you think there will be any opportunity to give more detail to the participants so that they can still comment or follow up in Phase 2 during the antitrust?</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Yes, I think we haven't approached it that way to date, but we can. It is a good suggestion. We have gone to several individuals and I think we would be prepared to do that under the outline of the ground rules that I just went through where we are not looking into each other's clearinghouses prematurely -- that is inappropriate -- but certainly the end-user can see that for all of their clients and do that analysis.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: All right, very good. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Patrick O'Shaughnessy, Raymond James.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES: Good morning. So in June, CME Group announced that they are going to start to offer the Euribor contract. I was wondering if you could comment on how you think you guys are currently competitively positioned to defend against that entry, as well as any implications that might have on the antitrust concerns with your merger.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: It is Duncan, Patrick. I will take that one. I will answer the second half of that first. I would think that it is -- in terms of the impact on the merger, it has been duly noted by the competition authorities in Brussels that there have been a few competitive efforts in the last few months either embarked upon or announced. So frankly, we think it is an example of, like other examples, that there is an opportunity to compete.</p><p>At the same time, we think what we have learned in NYSE Liffe US and in NYPC, as Tom went through in his material and this really gets to the first part of your question, if you are going to compete, we certainly understood we had to bring an innovative solution to the marketplace. I think listing look-alike contracts and not really adding any value from the capital efficiency point of view or whatever it might be we think are fairly easy to defend against.</p><p>So when we were trying to be an attacker in the US jurisdiction, we spent a lot of time trying to think about what more it had to be than just listing Eurodollars and treasuries. We didn't think that was much of a competitive threat to the incumbent. So I think what you saw us do was spend a lot more time on something that was innovative, not just simply list a look-alike contract and attempt to compete. Tom, would you add anything to that from your point of view with your derivatives hat on?</p><p>TOM CALLAHAN: I would tell you, I mean, of course, CME is an incredibly powerful global competitor, so we are taking the threat very, very seriously. We thought it was interesting that they chose to clear the products in Chicago, which is an inverse of when Liffe, unsuccessfully back in 2004, attempted to launch Eurodollars cleared in London and that proved to be a challenge for us at the time. So it will be interesting to see how European customers react to a Chicago cleared Euribor contract. But regardless, we are staying very close to our customers and we are taking the threat very, very seriously.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Johannes Thormann, HSBC.</p><p>JOHANNES THORMANN, ANALYST, HSBC: Good morning, everybody. Johannes from HSBC. One question concerning your balance sheet, please. You have successfully reduced your debt to EBITDA ratio. What is an appropriate level for your Company and will you continue to decrease or at which point do you think you will increase the dividend policy also in the light of the merger with Deutsche Boerse? Thank you.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: We have mentioned in the past that our current comfort zone and our targeted leverage is around 2 to 2.25 times, so the 1.7 is below the norm and expectation for our business. We have announced a special dividend, so clearly we are building balance sheet capacity so that when we complete the merger, we will have the necessary cash to pay the special dividend. So you shouldn't read into the strength of the balance sheet as being the way we would run our business necessarily on a standalone basis, but clearly it is part of the plan to do the merger and as I said, develop (multiple speakers).</p><p>JOHANNES THORMANN: Okay, understood. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Howard Chen, Credit Suisse.</p><p>HOWARD CHEN, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Congrats on the shareholder votes. Mike, just a quick one on the financials. Can you discuss the impact from the Amex transaction, assuming no changes in its profitability position? Just maybe what would have earnings been if the deal had closed at the beginning of the June quarter? Thanks.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: So I believe we mentioned that in our talking points. So we are saying had we closed the transaction April 1 instead of June 29, we would have reported a $0.02 less earnings per share, so the minority interest on the partner's portion of the profitability. So if volume stayed the same, that is what you can expect in the third quarter and going forward.</p><p>HOWARD CHEN: Great, thanks. Sorry I missed it.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: That's okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: Daniel Harris.</p><p>DANIEL HARRIS, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Hi, good morning, guys. Hey, Duncan, you talked a bit about the issues that you guys have been having with Euronext on the technology side with the sporadic outages and the index calculations. I was wondering if you could delve a little bit deeper into what that was, but more so also I think that as part of the merged entity, you are not going to be using UTP going forward. Can you talk about the decision process on that versus what the alternative is obviously with the Deutsche Boerse technology? Thanks.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Sure. I know you guys are everywhere, but you clearly know some things about our merger that we don't know yet because we didn't know that the decision had been made about UTP, but thanks for letting us know. We appreciate the heads up.</p><p>I think I am going to let Dominique, who is sitting here with me, talk about how we have diagnosed these issues, what we think the root cause was, what we have done about it, etc. and then I will have him kick it back to me and we will talk a little bit about how that may be impacting the discussion we are having around the common trading and clearing architecture, okay? So Dominique, what don't we start with you?</p><p>DOMINIQUE CERUTTI, PRESIDENT &amp; DEPUTY CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: Yes, so indeed we had on the European side full incident to be clear in June and July and we take that very seriously free of the incident and the one you are mentioning are originating in a complex accord. We made -- Mike, since you are asking, we made an update on [microcore] that was mandatory on one of our software and it has created some packet loss. We have the best expert on our camp and from the vendors to analyze that and it is this change combined with high market volume and some new behaviors enabled by the new capabilities that we are offering to members that are figuring some instability in some legacy software that we still run. So that is what happened.</p><p>I don't want to go deeper; it could be quite complex. Again, we have analyzed the situation. We have taken mitigation actions in the short term and maybe more importantly, we are running the task force and we expect results in the next 30 days to check whether or not we have other vulnerabilities in our system and make sure that we will come back to our best-of-breed stability.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: All right, and then to get to the second part of your question, I think we continue to have discussions about, as I've said to some of you before at various analyst meetings, etc., we view the common trading and clearing architecture as having many components starting with what we would call the common customer gateway, to the safety network, to the trading engines, to the backend systems, to the data dissemination tools, to the clearing platforms, etc. and we continue to have very healthy dialogue with our colleagues at DB. Some of the decisions about which pieces we will be using have already been made.</p><p>I think what we have said publicly is the system we end up using won't be UTP or what DB runs right now; it will probably be an amalgam of all of the above. But I think on some of the components, we have already made the decision. Larry, do you want to add anything to that since you are on the call too as to where we are in that decision?</p><p>LARRY LEIBOWITZ, COO, NYSE EURONEXT: No, I think that is the right way to say it. We are going through a comparing functionality. The considerations really are functionality points, pain of client migration and really that matters a lot. We don't want to put the clients through a big migration here and then ultimate cost savings. And you can be guaranteed that this is going to be a best-of-breed and no matter what, best of technologists on both sides.</p><p>The problems we have been having in Europe really are related to not only microcode, but legacy systems. It has nothing to do with UTP and really haven't colored this discussion. I think it has been a very healthy discussion, not just among the technologists, but also among the businesses because the businesses are really concerned that functionality gets preserved and that their clients are not disturbed in this process.</p><p>OPERATOR: Niamh Alexander, KBW.</p><p>NIAMH ALEXANDER, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. If I could touch on the expenses because going back, going way back, this was officially -- the second quarter was officially the end of the integration phase for Euronext and NYX. But I am just wondering if it is kind of all solid on and behind you now or if maybe there's still some data centers, old ones that need to be run off because your expense guidance was not changed, but clearly the FX is driving it higher. Just trying to get a sense of the run rate going forward and maybe opportunities to lower it from this level.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: This is Mike. It is a challenge as we, from time to time, acquire a company or the euro or dollar fluctuate. We can keep updating the guidance. Our guidance was using 2010's average exchange rates, so we reported 1, 6, 7, 8 in costs and the portfolio we had at the end of the year, we were guiding that our costs would come below $16.50. And as I indicated on the call, adjusting for all that, we were at $8.07 in the first half. So we are clearly below our guidance, in line with our guidance. As Duncan mentioned, we continue to focus on opportunities to run our business more efficiently every day.</p><p>To your question, there are still some legacy data centers and other assets that we are exiting and there is some savings that are not going to be as large as they were the last couple of years, but there are some avenues for further cost reductions related to the transition and the integration we will start to see and experience as we get down to the end of the year.</p><p>So I think maybe at the end of the third quarter, when we will have three quarters under the belt, we can give a more precise expense number, but I think rather than trying to project which way the currency is going to move and/or we just added Metabit, we might -- whether or not we make any more acquisitions, I think a fair way to do it is to report the numbers as we do today and provide the reconciliation in our deck on how we are doing against our guidance.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Just to jump in for one second here, I think it is really important that, at a certain point, it becomes hard to figure out what is an integration savings, meaning from Euronext NYSE merger and what is just continued operating your business more effectively. And we continue to believe that we can continue to cut our costs as we move forward, even had we not done this DB deal. That is part of what you do as running your company properly and we still we think we have room to run. I think we continue to do that among the backdrop of investing in some new business and making some new acquisitions.</p><p>MICHAEL GELTZEILER: Right, which is a great point, just one more follow-up on what Larry said. Our technology, our commercial technology business is not a fixed cost business. So as we aspire to have $1 billion of revenue there and we take on new managed services accounts, we are taking on costs. Our focus there is revenue growth in margin; it is not in keeping the costs fixed. So we have been able to absorb those incremental costs while continuing to bring down our overall expense base.</p><p>NIAMH ALEXANDER: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Chris Harris, Wells Fargo.</p><p>CHRIS HARRIS, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES: Great, thanks for squeezing me in here, guys. Clearly, you have had some excellent success in options with Amex remutualization and growth in maker-taker, but it looks like some of that momentum is slowing a little bit here. And just wondering if you could share with us what strategies you plan on implementing and options to kind of further your share growth? And as maybe a follow-up to that, would you ever consider selling a stake in Arca options given the success you have had at Amex?</p><p>LARRY LEIBOWITZ: So I think to jump in there, this is Larry again, first, you are seeing the effect of options being very competitive and we have a lot of competitors out there who have varying models. What you're also seeing over time is a blending towards the middle between pure maker-taker, meaning the Arca model and fewer directed flow like Amex. You see them, as the directed flow guys have adopted some functionality that looks more maker-taker like and vice versa. So we are going to continue to see that and we all push to continue to try to differentiate our platforms. We think that we have some interesting developments in the works and we are going to continue to push on those. It is a competitive market, but it is also a growing market, so that is a good position to be in.</p><p>CHRIS HARRIS: Fair enough. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&amp;A session. I would now like to turn it back over to management.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Stephen, why don't you call it a wrap since I am offsite?</p><p>STEPHEN DAVIDSON: Okay, thank you, everyone, for listening this morning and we will speak to you next quarter. Enjoy the summer.</p><p><person><nameText>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER</nameText></person>: Thanks, everybody.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation.

Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>JONATHAN CURTAIN, VP OF CORPORATE FINANCE &amp; IR, ICON PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY: Thank you, Sara. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on this call covering the quarter ended June 30, 2018. Also on the call today, we have our CEO, Dr. Steve Cutler; and our CFO, Mr. Brendan Brennan. I would like to note that this call is webcast and that there are slides available to download on our website to accompany today's call. Certain statements in today's call will be forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, and listeners are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. The company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission discuss the risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. This presentation includes selected non-GAAP financial measures. For a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the press release statement headed Consolidated Income Statements Unaudited U.S. GAAP. While non-GAAP financial measures are not superior to, or a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measures, we believe certain non-GAAP information is more useful to investors for historical comparison purposes. We will be limiting the call today to 1 hour. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand over the call to our CFO, Mr. Brendan Brennan.</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN, CFO, ICON PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY: Thank you, Jonathan. A reminder. January 1, 2018, the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 became effective for ICON. Having adopted the cumulative effect of -- effect transition method, prior comparisons have not been restated under this new standard. Instead, we feel that providing comparable Q2 '18 financial results under the previous revenue recognition standard is the best way to evaluate our performance during this transition period. Whilst the comments may incorporate the impact of ASC 606, Steve will focus his comments on our performance excluding the impact of ASC 606.</p><p>In quarter 2, we achieved strong growth business wins, excluding the impact of ASC 606, with $720 million, with cancellations of $120 million. As a result, net awards in the quarter were a new record $600 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.27x. This means our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is a very healthy 1.29x.</p><p>With the addition of these new awards, our Q2 2018 backlog, excluding the impact of ASC 606, grew to $5.2 billion representing a year-over-year increase of 16%. Our top customer represents 10.4% of this backlog, down from 11.3% at the end of quarter 2 last year. Reported revenue in quarter 2 was $641.6 million, excluding the impact of ASC 606, revenue was $473.9 million. This represents year-on-year growth of 10% or 8% on a constant currency basis and 2% on a constant dollar organic basis. Excluding the impact of ASC 606, our customer concentration with our top customer in the quarter represented 13.5% of revenue compared to 20% of revenue last year. Our top 5 customers represented [39.1%] of revenue compared to 41.2% of revenue last year. Our top 10, represented 54.2% of revenue compared to 55% of revenue last year, while our top 25 customers represented 70.2% of revenue compared to 73.4% of revenue last year.</p><p>In quarter 2, reported gross margin was 30% compared to [30.6%] in quarter 1. Excluding the impact of ASC 606, group gross margin for the quarter was 40.9%. This compared to the 41.2% last quarter and 42% in the comparable quarter last year.</p><p>Reported SG&amp;A for the quarter, was 12.6% as compared to 13% in quarter 1. Excluding the impact of 606, SG&amp;A was 17.1% of revenue. This compared to 17.5% last quarter and 18.8% in the comparable period last year. This was as a result of our continued leverage of our global business support model. In quarter 2, we reported operating income before the nonrecurring charges of 14.7% or $94.4 million. This compared to 14.8% or $91.7 million in quarter 1. Excluding the impact of ASC 606, operating income before nonrecurring charges for the quarter was $96 million and operating margin of 20.2%. This compared to 20.1% last quarter and 19.9% in the comparable quarter last year.</p><p>As reported, net interest expense for the quarter, was $2.3 million, and the effective tax rate for quarter 2 was 10%. Net income reported before nonrecurring charges was $82.9 million or 12.9%. This equated to $1.51 in diluted earnings per share before nonrecurring charges. A 6.3% increase on Q1 EPS of $1.42. Excluding the impact of ASC 606, net income before nonrecurring charges was $84.3 million, a margin of 17.8%, equating to diluted earnings per share of $1.54. This compares to earnings per share of a $1.44 last quarter and $1.31 comparable quarter last year, an increase of 17.6%.</p><p>DSO in the quarter was 49 days, which compared to 51 days last quarter and 53 days in the comparable quarter last year. Cash generated from operating activities for the quarter was $32.7 million and capital expenditure was $8.9 million. At June 30, 2018, the company had net cash of $23.9 million compared to net cash of $4.6 million at March 31, 2018, and net debt of $33.8 million at the end of June '17.</p><p>During the quarter, we took a restructuring charge of $12.5 million, as we continue to improve the efficiencies of our operating model. This restructuring plan reflected rationalization across the business to improve resource utilization and their office footprint. As a result of this, our GAAP EPS was $1.31 compared to $1.51 on a non-GAAP basis.</p><p>As a reminder, I have dealt with the new revenue standard. Steve will focus his comments on our performance, excluding the impact of ASC 606. And with all of that said, I would like to now hand over the call to Steve.</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ICON PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY: Thank you, Brendan. Fueled by strong outsourcing trends and [buoyant by] a [2 funding] environment, market fundamentals remain very positive for the CRO industry. The momentum we saw during 2017 has continued into 2018. And during quarter 2, we've again seen strong level of market demand across all of our business segments. Our backlog in the quarter grew 16% year-on-year driven by a record net business award level of $600 million. This delivered a net book-to-bill of 1.7x for the quarter or 1.29x on a trailing 12-month basis. Our backlog now stands at $5.2 billion, which gives us a firm foundation to build upon during the remainder of the year and beyond.</p><p>We continue to broaden our customer base with both new and existing biopharma companies seeking to leverage ICON's operational excellence, flexible partnership model and depth of therapeutic expertise across our global footprint. Since our foundation in 1990, we have strived to work as a trusted partner to our clients, collaborating, innovating and finding new ways to improve outcomes together.</p><p>On the P&amp;R business strategies, a deep understanding of our industry landscape, enabling us to work closely with our clients and allowing us to be competitive at a time when technology, regulations and client needs are changing. We have the global scale and flexibility to organize our resources around their requirements and adapt our delivering models as their strategy dictates and evolves.</p><p>Our accountability to successfully manage projects under a variety of integrated and flexible outsourcing models has led to new opportunities for both our full service and functional services businesses during the quarter. We are very pleased with the continued progress being made in this area on an integrated basis, with other service areas and as a standalone offering, and we believe this is becoming another differentiator for ICON in the market.</p><p>Access to patients continues to be a key challenge for the industry. ICON has developed an integrated site and patient solution that makes it easier for sites and patients to actively participate in a trial and increase the predictability and speed of enrollment and retention.</p><p>Leveraging our PMG network, which now includes the recently announced DuPage network. We are helping customers to enhance clinical trial feasibility, while also giving patients access to a broader range of care options through clinical trials. Our innovative partnership with Intel and Saama, as well as our collaborations with TriNetX, EHR4CR and most recently Practice Fusion, within the Life Science segment, continue to be used successfully in conjunction with our OneSearch data platform.</p><p>These partnerships are all helping to enhance engagement with sites, patients and healthcare providers to take significant time and cost from our customers' development programs.</p><p>We also continue to work on a series of internal projects to evaluate the potential opportunities with robotics and process automation. We believe that there are several areas in the clinical trial process which lend themselves to further efficiencies through the use of robotics process automation, starting with the digitalization of protocol, and the creation of the data capture tools as well as testing and validation of applications. We also believe there is application for robotics in the conduct of routine tasks within our global business services environment, which help us to continue to leverage our spend across these key support groups.</p><p>The consequence of our strong business development performance, means that we need to ensure we have appropriate staff members in place to cater for the ramp-up in operational activity levels. During the quarter, our headcount grew to nearly 13,650 employees, an increase in staff of over 1,300 employees year-over-year. The identification and the successful recruitment of best-in-class talent, our key is to ensuring the continued delivery of our customers' projects.</p><p>Upon joining ICON, a clear onboarding program is communicated to directly engage employees with ICON's mission, vision and values, with center on integrity, collaboration, partnership and accountability and delivery. We also focus on retention of our staff in the longer term by engaging and helping them map out their own individual career plans in our internal career hub. This provides an opportunity for each employee to create their own career framework, and how to develop their experiences, abilities and competencies over time. The result of this is that approximately 10% of our employees will be promoted within ICON each year, recognizing their performance, skills development and increased level of experience, and helping to retain them long term for the benefit of our customers.</p><p>Our approach allows us to continue to pursue our goals of attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry, ultimately driving long-term performance at an individual and company level. As recognition of this, we were proud to be including in Forbes Magazine's America's Best Large Employers List for 2018, which is a ranking by employees of the best employers across 25 industry sectors. This is a second consecutive year that ICON has been named one of the America's Best Employers. And we're also the top-ranked CRO for the second year in a row.</p><p>As a result of the ongoing execution of our strategic plans, our year-on-year revenue growth was 10%. Careful management of our cost base enabled us to expand our operating margin to 20.2%. This strong operational performance, along with an effective tax rate of 10%, allowed us to grow our earnings per share by 17.6% year-over-year to $1.54. During the quarter, we repurchased $16 million worth of shares under our share repurchase program, bringing the total repurchase value to date to $297.3 million worth of shares at an average price of $85.36. As we look forward to the end of the year, I want to take this opportunity to update our full-year guidance. We expect 2018 revenue to move from a range of $2.52 billion to $2.64 billion to a range of $2.56 billion to $2.64 billion. And earnings to move from a range of $5.91 to $6.11 to a range of $5.98 to $6.12. Before moving to Q&amp;A, I would like to thank the entire ICON team for all their hard work and commitment during the quarter. In particular, I'd like to recognize the immense contribution of Dr. Ronan Lambe, ICON's cofounder and father figure, with Dr. John Climax, who after 28 years of service, retired this week from our board. We thank Ronan for the hugely positive influence he has had on shaping ICON into the industry leader it is today and we wish him well in his retirement. Thank you, everyone. And we're now ready for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>ROBERT PATRICK JONES, VP, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUPINC., RESEARCH DIVISION: You guys have been pretty upfront that gross margins will experience some pressure as you onboard, people to handle all the new project that you've been winning. I guess, maybe, it would be helpful if you can lay out how we should think about your ability to kind of maintain the type of gross margin we saw this quarter? And then, if there's any timeline you could provide as far as when you might start to again see some leverage against the infrastructure that you are currently building?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Yes, Robert, it's Steve here. You are right, we have been upfront about the pressure on gross margin. Obviously, as we build the business, we bring in new people. There will be inevitable pressure in that area. So we're offsetting that to some extent by looking at how efficiently we are running our operations. Our startup approach to our clinical trials is under plenty of attention and scrutiny, and we're looking at how we are improving our resourcing and our process there. Also looking at how we can bring in automation in that area as well. There are various offsets, if you like, on the gross margin side of things. And of course, I think, as we said before, we're also trying to offset any pressure on gross at the SG&amp;A line. I think you can see we have been successful in doing that again this quarter. And we continue to ultimately maintain our operating margin based on some offset at the SG&amp;A line. And we believe we can continue to do that. So we see our margins at the operating level being maintained and possibly increased slightly, but we're working very hard to do both -- on both those areas.</p><p>ROBERT PATRICK JONES: And I guess, just on a follow-up to that, Steve. You mentioned SG&amp;A, you guys closed in on this goal of 17% of the 606 revenue pretty quickly, looking at the results from this quarter. Anything you would call out there as far as what drove the progress? And then, is this the type of SG&amp;A as a percent of revenue level that we should think about for the rest of the year?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I think, in terms of what drove the process, we continue to look at it very hard, we continue look at our process, we continue to offshore appropriate parts of that business where we've been able to do so. We continue to challenge our business service leaders to hold their costs tight and be as effective and efficient. And we've -- as you've said, we got to our target a little earlier than we thought. We think there's still some further upside or at least further progress to be made there over the next, probably, longer term than medium term. And I think, I referenced in my comments, robotics automation as being a particular component of that. We'll talk a bit more about that at our Analyst Day in New York in a couple of months. We believe, there is some further progress we can make in that space, albeit probably not at the same rate as we've made over the last couple of years.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will now move to our question from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan.</p><p>TYCHO W. PETERSON, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I want to start with backlog. I'm wondering if you can comment at all on [NIK's] biotech versus pharma? To what degree also fixed-price contracts are a part of that backlog?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I didn't get the second part of the question. The type of contracts, Tycho?</p><p>TYCHO W. PETERSON: Fixed-price contracts. How much of the backlog today are fixed price?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Okay. Let me start with the biotech with [Saama]. Certainly, over the last 12 months or so we've seen -- I think, we've all seen a very strong funding environment around biotech, probably unprecedented, I would say. And that can certainly continue this quarter. So biotech and midsize has certainly increased in proportion in our backlog. We still remain a very significantly large pharma CRO that continues, and that certainly continues as well as part of our strategy, but the funding environment within the biotech has pushed that part of our backlog up. In terms of fixed-price contracts, I don't quite understand what that's all about. I mean, we -- well, all of the large CRO's do fixed-price contracts, there's nothing particularly novel or new there. Our customers expect us to put a budget down and fix the price according to the expectations in the scope of that project, recruitment rates, et cetera, et cetera. Particularly, as we become and we continue to become better in terms of our processes and our feasibility, we are able to nail our colors to the mast and actually fix a price in terms of what a recruit [made his buck]. No CRO -- and I don't care what they tell you, no CRO is going to be held to a fixed price if things like drug is not available or the FDA puts a hold on the contract or the project or those sorts of things. So we all operate to fix the price where it comes to operational parameters, like recruitment and us believing we can get the patients, et cetera. But there are always limits to that fixed price. And I don't believe anybody in the industry is operating outside of those limits.</p><p>TYCHO W. PETERSON: Okay. That's helpful. Just 2 quick follow ups. Pfizer, you had a sequential increase in the overall contribution, so should we assume that this is going to continue for the remainder of the year? And then, on the hiring point, back to Bob's question, where are you in, kind of, the overall process of hiring? You said 1,300 employees over the past year. Just how far down that path are you at this?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Let me take the Pfizer once. First, we saw it as a slow -- a bit of a bounce uptick on that Pfizer revenues this quarter. We think, we're -- we've reached pretty much a steady state with Pfizer, they remain our largest customer. And we believe we're at about the regular, sort of, cadence of quarterly revenues, annual revenues in the $220 million to $270 million sort of mark, that sort of number. So I think, we're in a good place there. Certainly, we won -- from this quarter to round about slightly under a 1 book-to-bill, but I think overall last 12 months, we're at about a 1 book-to-bill. So I think we're in a good place there. In terms of hiring, as I said, 1,300 people came in, about half -- a bit more of those came in through the Mapi acquisition. So we continue to bring on board new people, as we need to, to win the work. As you can see the backlog has gone up 16% year-on-year. So I don't expect we'll be increasing necessarily 16% of that people-wise, year-on-year. But we certainly have our HR machine and recruitment machine ramped up to be able to bring those people in efficiently and effectively. That's an ongoing process. As we continue to win more work than we're burning, we expect to grow and we expect to bring the people on at about the rate of revenue post of what we're going to pursue. So that's a process that's working well. And I think, we feel, we're able to bring them on at the right time. We're not bringing them too early and having them sit around. And we're not bringing them on too late and leaving revenue on the table. That's the challenge we have as an organization. And I believe our operational people are handling that very well.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we'll move to our next question from Ross Muken of Evercore.</p><p>ROSS JORDAN MUKEN, SENIOR MD, HEAD OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY &amp; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe, just on, sort of, revenue cadence for the rest of the year and then, into next year. It feels like you had very strong bookings momentum now for some time, obviously, the backlog is growing at an elevated rate, as you spoke. We're starting to comp again some of the easier compares from last year, given some of the trials that fell off. So how are you thinking about, sort of, that burn rate and your ability to, sort of, get back to more of the normalized growth we were used to seeing from you, at least, on the [core] basis? Because it feels like we're, kind of, hitting into this inflection period, into the back half of this year and the next year where we can get back to, sort of, the top line expectations we're used to seeing, given how strong you have done from a new business perspective?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I'll have a crack at that and then Brendan might jump in as well. I think we're seeing puts and calls on the burn rate. We were $9.4 million this quarter, we were $9.4 million last quarter. So we do think we're starting to approach the [NABIR]. The pressure down already is, we continue to win as a number of our peers do oncology work, which is long, complex, long term and certainly, without any shadow of a doubt, burn slower than other trials. And that is an increasing part of our backlog, we reflect the clinical development landscape there. So that is -- that does put pressure on the burn. On the other hand, as I outlined, we're looking at how we can get better and faster and more efficient at starting our clinical trials up. The focus on our startup approach is starting to yield some benefits in terms of our operational metrics and time to get to first sight initiated. We're seeing some -- certainly, some progress there. We obviously, wherever we can, look to win work that can burn a bit faster, but to some extent, we're constrained by what's out there. So I think there are, let's say, puts and calls on that. We do think we are approaching the [NADIR]. We are looking to try to bring that up, but that's, I think, more of a longer-medium to longer-term approach.</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: Yes, Ross, I think you wanted -- the points you're making in your question there was, obviously, we've had some tough comps in the first half of the year from a revenue perspective on the, sort of, the mix really of the Pfizer and non-Pfizer book of business. As we go into the third quarter, obviously, by this time last year, in the third quarter, we were through the bococizumab cancelations. So I think the organic revenue growth that we referred to this quarter at 2% will go up fairly significantly, as we look into the back end of the year. And I suppose, what I do is, I point you towards revenue guidance for the full year, which is like in that 7% to 10% range now, as we pushed it up in this current quarter. And certainly, we'd like to be seeing [CDOs] that are certainly in that range, as we go into the next couple of quarters.</p><p>ROSS JORDAN MUKEN: That's helpful, Brendan. And maybe just, if you guys give a little color. There's a lot of strategic deal activity, a number of key renewals went on or going on. How are you thinking about the conversations for some of the larger contracts? Obviously, so much time has been spent on, sort of all the biotech businesses, given what demands look like in that environment? How would you just, kind of, characterize the conversations there? And what else is still left out there for the remainder of the year, at least that's big and chunky?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Yes, I think, we look at our performance. I think with these strategic deals, if you book it more over the longer term, what you win and what you're able to renew. Certainly, we've able to renew a number of ours. We've competed very hard, I think, in these areas and we win, I think, more than our fair share. We've been successful over the longer period of time in these deals. And they take some time to, sort of, mature. They take a little bit of time to evolve. But there's 1 or 2 them that we've won in the last 6 months that are starting to move very significantly, and certainly contributed pretty much on a new business wins perspective in this quarter, limited though, in revenue. Really the revenue takes something like 12 months, sometimes even longer to start with these -- particularly the newer strategic deals. So we're starting to see the wins come in. And we expect to see the revenue will start to burn later this year and certainly into 2019 and beyond.</p><p>These things take a little bit of time. And as I said, we believe we have good offering in the area. We're able to engage. We have a lot of experience. We've been part of the largest partnership in the industry for a number of years, that has given us some credibility and some experience in this space. We're able to bring that and bring that experience to some of these newer partnerships. We're also seeing some of the, perhaps, more midsized companies become interested in these more partnerships. And a midsized company, it may be outsourcing, of course, less in terms of dollar terms. But if you can win the vast majority of that or 1 or 2 partners in that, sort of -- you can secure yourself a very good revenue stream. So we don't just look at the top 10 or 15 companies on the partnership side of these, Ross, we're looking a bit more broadly in building partnerships, building relationships and going out proactively and approaching customers more in the top 30 to 40, who still have a substantial amount of work to outsource and a willingness, increasing willingness to do it with organizations like us. So we feel the environment there is good. I strongly feel we're competing really well, and our offering is being well received.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we'll move to our next question, which comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays.</p><p>JACK MEEHAN, VP &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Steve, I was hoping you can elaborate on the comments you made related to the expansion plans with the PMG network. And just specifically there, what are your plans regionally? Are there any partnerships you could use to expand there? And what level investment should we expect to build that out?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Yes, interestingly, Jack, we've -- we have expanded the PMG network. I mentioned the DuPage network of sites that we brought on. We have them and we've taken over that -- the clinical trials capabilities within that network without having to pay anything. It's something we've assumed responsibility for. Obviously, we've seen the costs and we assume the benefits. But it's not been something we've actually had to pay for. There are other -- there are 1 or 2 other networks in the same, sort of, state in North America. So we're looking at that. Not costing us all the money, its costing is, obviously, resource, and we're building our infrastructure and adding that and building it into the PMG network. So the expansion in the North America is really limited cost, but it's -- and it takes some time and effort, and of course, investment for us to build that out. What we want to go next is to Europe. And we've been actively looking in Europe for a network that we would be able to acquire. We've had a couple 1 or 2 false starts. We're fairly disciplined in terms of making sure we acquire an operation that has a very high quality of service, and is very well thought after or thought at -- has a good reputation. And -- so we've had a couple of -- little bit of stop-start in Europe, where we continue to look very actively today. And I think you could expect, certainly in the next 12 months, and I hope earlier than that, some progress on that front. But our site network is still very much a fundamental part of our strategy combining with our -- with the analytics and data strategy that we have around EMR in EHR records and analytics driving patients to the site. So it's fundamental to us and it's something that we feel, we can continue to develop and make progress on.</p><p>JACK MEEHAN: Great. And maybe one for Brendan. Could you just confirm that 2018 targets related to cash flow? And can you help us with the pacing going into the back half of the year? Just looks a little bit more back-half weighted than you've historically posted.</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: Yes, that's probably fair, Jack. We were kind of -- we're in that, kind of, I suppose $300 million, kind of, level of expectation on cash flow. As you guys know in the past, we do have a pretty high percentage cash conversion cycle. I would agree with you, it is more back-half related. And obviously, we'll be looking to deploy that capital, either or predominantly on our M&amp;A strategy, as I think we've outlined over the last year or so. So yes, it is definitely more back-end related. So we expect probably -- and I think we've done about 100 year-to-date, maybe just shy of that, and probably the rest in the back half.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll move toward next question, which comes from Donald Hooker of KeyBanc.</p><p>DONALD HOUGHTON HOOKER, VP AND EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: On the continued -- everyone continues to be impressed with your discipline around SG&amp;A expenses. I was just wondering, is there a risk that you guys might be somewhat underinvesting in your business? I mean, do you feel like there are areas where -- is there a risk that you are underinvesting in the business where that could come back and bite you down the road?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Donald, you've always got to balance up between the investments you make and the efficiency you are trying to get and how you leverage that investment. So is there a risk? There's always a risk, but I don't believe we are doing that. We are disciplined in the way we look at our cost. We're very focused in that area. And we have a very good group of people looking after, particularly on the global business services side of things, who are not just able to take up a challenge when it comes to being efficient and make -- maximizing the value or the spend that they have, but being open to new ideas and new ways of doing things. And then that's a state of mind that, I think, our leaders in that group have that, sort of, differentiate them, perhaps, from others. They are open to doing things differently, be it robotics or process engineering or different ways of organizing their group or different ways of doing the work that they're supposed to be doing, or different locations for those people and how that works into our overall business and how it supports our overall business. So I think I'm lucky in that we have a strong group of people, who are -- not just on the global business service, but also in the operational area, who are innovative and open to new ideas. And so I don't think we are underinvesting. I think we're appropriately spending the money that we have. We're challenging ourselves, where we need to spend it. Perhaps such things like the security, IT security side of things. We have made significant investments in that area over the last 6 to 12 months, particularly given the environment we're all in now and the threats we're under with cybersecurity. So we've made solid and very significant investments in that as we brought the Mapi organization in, we've isolated them, quarantined them, sorted them out from our -- from a security point of view and brought them into the fold. So I believe, we're spending the money appropriately. We're spending it in a way that it's maximizing the value of that money, but we are also being creative and watching our pennies.</p><p>DONALD HOUGHTON HOOKER: Great, and certainly impressive to see. So my follow-up question will be more specific. Was curious, specifically, on the recent announcement with Practice Fusion, your relationship there. Can you -- how does the economics of that relationship work? What is -- obviously, I think I understand what you guys get. But how do we think about the other side? What is practice -- what are Practice Fusion's economics and that relationship for you?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Don, I have to be absolutely honest with you, I am not absolutely familiar with the detail of the economics that are offered. We -- they are an organization that has patient records and an ability to access patient records and the database of patients. They're helping put in place electronic medical records in, I think, it's around 20,000 practices, so a large number of practices. And they used -- those practices use those electronic medical records in those practices. And we, then, are able to have access if we pay up a fee to have access to those records. These patients have all opted in, so they're not de-identified, a very important distinction, I'd have to say, between us and someone between us, relationship with some of our competitors. These patients are opted in to be contacted for clinical trial opportunities. And our late-stage group, our ICON Commercialization Group is running a couple of pilots with them. I would have to say the economics of the relationship and the pilots is probably going to be a certain way and then different to how it will work out if we industrialize this, put it that way. So we would be paying some fee to access those records. They'll be making those available to us. We'll be then, using that data or finding those patients to bring those patients into the trial. That's the way it's, sort of, broadly work. I need to -- if you need any more detail on that, I think, we'll take it off line, but that's the way it's working (inaudible)</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question now comes from Erin Wright of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>ERIN ELIZABETH WILSON WRIGHT, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Can you give us an update on Mapi? How that transaction is progressing relative to your internal expectations at this point? Did you break out the contribution as well from acquisitions of Mapi in the quarter?</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: It's Brendan here. Yes, we're pleased with the inspiration of Mapi. As you guys know, we brought it actually around this time last year and have been working hard on the integration since. We're pretty much through, 95% I would say, of the integration process at this stage. And so, we're happy with the overall performance of the business unit. At the beginning of the call, I called out there just the -- I suppose, if you like, the revenue contribution from the different elements. And I did say that the CDO revenue growth was about 2% versus a constant currency growth year-over-year of about 8%. Obviously, the [FX] and the difference coming from the Mapi organization. So a little ahead, actually in the current quarter versus last quarter. So good progress from our perspective at this stage.</p><p>ERIN ELIZABETH WILSON WRIGHT: Okay. Great. And then, on the capital deployment front, I guess. Where are the holes in your offering? Or where are you seeing opportunities in the M&amp;A pipeline. Would you focus or target more postapproval, pharmacovigilance, Asia, or I guess, you were mentioning earlier investments in site networks? I guess, where are your priorities today?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: You pretty much answered your own question. You have outlined a couple of areas there that we would certainly be looking at or we are currently looking at in terms of M&amp;A and capital deployment. It's not that we -- I think we feel we're particularly weak in those areas, but we have an ambition to be in the top echelon in each of the segments we operate in, as all companies in this space. So there are a couple of areas there, certainly, we already talked about the site network and expanding that. We fundamentally believe that is the right strategy. We're starting to get some traction with that. And so that's an area, particularly in Europe. As I said, we've broadened out, we are broadening out in the United States. Our aspects of Asia, Japan is an area I think I've mentioned before that we're looking to actively deploy capital in. And so those spreads, and then you look at some of the functional areas. Pharmacovigilance, I believe, in the industry is ripe for some consolidation. So I think there's some opportunity there to build an organization in that space. And we've got a good pharmacovigilance safety group. We're implementing some new software and applications there to really move them along. And at that point, I think, that might be a good time to look at that space. So those are the areas that we are actively looking at. We have a number of opportunities in our sites at the moment. And we expect to be able to execute on at least 1 or 2 of those within the foreseeable future, medium term, next, I'd say, 6 to 9 months.</p><p>ERIN ELIZABETH WILSON WRIGHT: And the size of those transactions, I guess, what sort of size you would be targeting? I guess it was this time last year, there was news of a potential larger acquisition, so I just, kind of, wanted to get a sense of what you were thinking?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I have to say, we -- I think, again, we've been public in terms of opportunistic on the -- on larger transactions. What we're talking about is our string of pearls strategy, which is traditionally being what we've been focused on. And those acquisitions, I think, as you probably know, range from anything, $50 million -- $30 million, $50 million, but even smaller if they're strategic. Some of the site networks aren't that big, up to $150 million, $200 million. That's the sort of range we're expecting in that, sort of -- with that sort of an approach.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from John Kreger of William Blair.</p><p>JOHN CHARLES KREGER, PARTNER &amp; HEALTHCARE SERVICES ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a question to expand on your comments on site network. What percentage of your active projects would you say you are using some sort of a site networks strategy at this point?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: John, I would have to be honest, I don't have that specific number in my head. I would estimate at about 25%, possibly up to 30% of our -- that we would be currently using [now]. Having said that, I would say, 75% of our new -- 75% of new projects would be going into that network approach. Because actively promote our site network approach for all of our new projects. And that doesn't mean every one of them is suitable or appropriate, but we certainly have a higher proportion of new projects going into that strategy or that approach that we do traditional within our backlog, so to speak.</p><p>JOHN CHARLES KREGER: Got it. Interesting. And then, you mentioned a number of, sort of, new technologies in your prepared remarks. If you, kind of, step back, do any of them stand out to you as particularly exciting in terms of a value add for you or your clients? Anything that you can call out? And even just generally, do you see bigger opportunities, sort of, externally around maybe trial design and site ID? Or more opportunity in terms of internal operational efficiency?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: That's a broad question, John. We could probably spend days talking about that. Certainly, from a technology point of view, you're aware of what we are doing from an electronic medical records and that certainly a focus for feasibility and how we find patients. That will -- we're trying a number of horses and trying a number of tracks. We believe that's the right way to go. Some more successful than others, but we certainly -- we're certainly seeing some traction in the areas we're working in and getting some benefits. And quite frankly, learning a lot, as we go along. If I look at things like robotics, and we'll talk about a bit more of this at our Analyst Day on September 10 in New York. We're hoping to have some demonstrations of some of the technology there around our robotics and automation approach, but we see some very exciting things. I get exciting about it, some people may not, around our trial master file and how we -- I was seeing a demonstration yesterday from our IT guys in terms of how we're improving the designation and categorization and filing of follow-up letters to monitoring reports. A simple thing enough, but a robot can do this in a minute. It takes -- we've calculated, it takes our people 6 minute to do it. And we have a lot of people. We handle a lot of paper across our organization with the 500 clinical trials that we have running. And so that is a material -- that can be a material impact in terms of how we, more effectively, more efficiently, file -- putting documents into files for the regulatory authorities and for the auditors to look at. And again, a relatively simple thing, but something we're processing and moving forward. And we have a number of our folks, including myself, very excited about the benefits that can bring to us. Not just in terms of reducing costs and being more efficient, but being faster and being more up-to-date for audits. Gives us a quality angle as well as an efficiency angle. So there are number of things in there. Then if we look at the adaptive trial design, and that continues to be important for us, we continue to focus on. Does -- it hasn't perhaps got the take-up and the uptick as much, as I would have liked to see in the industry, but there are several customers who are very engaged in it. Certainly some of our alliance partners are very interested in what the capabilities we have, and how we can apply those sorts of new designs to their development program. So I think on a number of fronts, be it applications, be it software, be it IT, be it process, be it statistics, we're looking at a driving forward innovation and technology and bringing those sorts of solutions and new ways of doing things to our customers.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll now to move to our next question from Sandy Draper of SunTrust.</p><p>ALEXANDER YEARLEY DRAPER, MD, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just may be a very quick question. Just thoughts on any updated thinking on stock repurchases, obviously, did a bunch last year, it sort of slowed down as you anticipated. As you build up cash, there's a balance of M&amp;A opportunities versus stock buyback. But just thinking about the last couple of years you've taken points of being aggressive, any thoughts on how you feel so softly about stock buybacks? Has that changed at all? Or is it still pretty much the same thought process?</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: It's Brandon here. I don't think fundamentally, we are shifting from where we have certainly been over the last 6 to 12 months in terms of our buyback mentality here. I think we've been very clear that our primary use of capital is going to be around the M&amp;A side of things. That's definitely what we want to do. By the end of this year, we want to see a couple of deals in the door and we're actively working towards that. In terms of the buyback program, it's not gone away. You've seen it's chunking away through the first half of the year. We did, again, continued it in Q2. I think, one of the things that we are mindful of is making sure that stock dilution that we get from exercise of the issue of shares to employees during the course of the year isn't impacting. And that's about 1 million shares a year. So that in itself is a chunk of change that is going to be used and we will continue to use. So I think that's possibly the best way to think about it in terms of our balancing, our M&amp;A portfolio and capital deployment around that, and our buyback procedures.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we move over next question from Juan Avendano of Bank of America.</p><p>JUAN ESTEBAN AVENDANO, ASSOCIATE, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: A lot of my questions have been answered, but I do have one. With regards to customer specific trends, revenue growth in your top 10 customers has picked up, particularly among customers 6 through 10. Can you tell us what's driving that or what's happening with those relationships? And then, also what was your net book-to-bill outside of your top customer?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I'll have the first one, Juan, in terms of what's driving revenue growth trends across the top 10 customers. I think, Brendan can answer your second one in terms of book-to-bills outside of that. I think, for us, we've -- one of our strategic pillars is around partnership and what we bring to a partnership. I think, as I mentioned, we have a lot of experience in this area and it's something we take very seriously in terms of where we're going with our organization. I think we've been able to bring that partnership approach to those -- I mean, the top 10 customers do tend to be our partner customers, our alliance partner customers. We've been able to wrap a solid execution and delivery around them. We dedicate specific and very competent resources to those customers. We get to know them very well. We spent time with them and we look at it in terms of very much a long-term relationship. And a number of those alliances have really moved to the next level now, and we're securing a very significant annual revenues from those customers. And it's not just within, say, our full service business, it's now broadening out across -- again, as I mentioned in my comments, across other parts of our business. And other parts of our business, our doctor IFS group is also bringing in opportunities for our full service. So there's a cross fertilization, if you like, across the various service areas and functions within the customer, within now across our company is also helping to drive the accumulation of significant revenues and broaden out the partnership and the relationship across those allied -- alliance customers. So it's -- I think it's been a very positive experience for us. And I think they are also seeing the benefits of that partnership as well. In terms of solid delivery, good operation metrics, we track the performance of those partnerships in terms of what we're doing on the day-to-day basis, how fast we are starting studies, how quickly we are completing the studies, are we on time performance wise, et cetera. Quality is a very important focus as well. With all of that, I think we gain further credibility and we build a relationship with those partners. It goes from strength to strength, it's a good news story. And obviously, we look to deploy it on as many -- on new partners as well and new customers as well. In terms of the book-to-bill, do you have that?</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: Yes. Obviously, Juan, I suppose that (inaudible) because we don't call out that number specifically anymore, because our biggest customer is now at a level that we think it is a sustainable number as we go forward. I think as Steve mentioned, we have a better one with a book-to-bill with them over the last couple of quarters. And excluding them, it's not a huge difference between what we actually would report, the 1.29 that we reported -- sorry, the [1.28 that we reported for the first half of the year. So excluding them it's about 1.31, 1.32.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will now move over next question from Justin Bowers of Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>JUSTIN BOWERS: Just wanted to follow-up on the robotics and digital strategy and some of the investments that you've made in kind of the plan going forward. I realize that these things take more than a few quarters to really affect the business. But if we were to look out, let's say, 1 to 2 to 5 years, how would you guys measure success from the broader digital strategy? Would this translate into market share gains, like an increase in burn rate, for example? And then, is that something that you are going to continue to do organically or with some of your existing big tech partners? Or is that going to include some external, kind of, organic efforts as well? And then, I have a follow-up.</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Okay. That's a pretty broad question, Justin, but in terms of our robotics and digital strategy, I think we see a number of advantages over many points or measures of success. I would say, obviously, margin -- I would probably say margin maintenance. Margins are solid now and strong. Maybe we can tick them up a little bit, but we do see the digitalization and robotics process automation really helping us to maintain margins overall and probably improve our SG&amp;A leverage spend, particularly around more routine tasks and having our people move up to more higher value tasks. So I think that's certainly 1 area of it. And then, I think, in doing so, we can make sure that our value -- the value we offer customers from a pricing point of view continues to be solid. And I think if we do that well, we should be able to take market share. That's a longer-term play but it's certainly within our strategy and it's certainly something we want to focus on. We believe -- I fundamentally believe that the clinical trial process is too clunky and too expensive and we do need to be able to -- we need to be part of the solution there in making it more efficient, more effective. And I think the robotics is just one aspect of what we can do to improve that and we have a responsibility and I think an obligation to do it. And I think if we can, we'll be very successful. I think it's a matter of reducing margins, in fact -- if anything, we'll be maintaining or possibly even improving them if we do it really well. Now we've got to execute on that, and that's always the challenge. In terms of who we partner -- our strategy at the moment is to work with different partners, particularly around the data strategy and the site in-patient EMI, EHR strategy, that's very clear. We have been very upfront with that for some time. In terms of robotics and automation I think, again, we'll be looking out who's out there. We're already doing some pilots, again we'll talk a bit more about that on September 10. But we're looking at who are the right partners and what are the right organizations and what are the right technologies. Let's just be honest here, we are fairly early in the process here. This is not something that's necessarily going to be implemented within the next quarter or 2. As I say, it's a medium- to longer-term play. But we do believe it has a fundamental role to playing in our continued success. We're embracing it, our leaders are embracing it and we believe it's going to be strong. The exact strategy into who we partnership or what sort of organizations and how we do that, is being worked out as we speak.</p><p>JUSTIN BOWERS: Got it. Thank you. The quick follow up is it sounds like -- I mean, funding has been strong all year, but it sounds like there's been kind of an improvement this last quarter. And I would say maybe even now versus the first quarter in terms of the RFP activity and the opportunities out there. Is that a fair characterization? And even a little more activity from the small to midsize?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I think that's a fair characterization. Yes, I think everyone is aware that the funding environment has been very strong. Not just this year, but certainly over the last few years, really. The public markets have been open [-ended]. We find that biotech is a well-funded and ambitious. They're like I said, 5, 10 years ago, they might have been looking to partner. Less so these days. So we find they have large programs and projects that they are ready to fund and able to fund themselves. So funding environment is great. We've seen, I would say, modest to mid-single-digit, sort of, uptick in RFP opportunities. We have a strong business development group who have been able to take advantage of that and I will win rate, if anything, has been increasing as well. So you get more opportunities and you get a stronger win rate, it adds up to a pretty solid formula from a business development point of view.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we move over next question from David Windley of Jefferies.</p><p>DAVID HOWARD WINDLEY, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: The -- perhaps intersecting with a robotics discussion, I'm wondering Steve, as you see this demand increase and I think you're pretty aggressive in adding staff. In 2Q, how do you see your sales position to service the growth? How fast do you need to be continuing to add headcount? What does the labor market look like? So how is the pool of available talent to service that or to feed that headcount add? And then how much are you able to alleviate your need to add headcount through some of this robotic and automation investment that you're making?</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Yes. Interesting question, David. Let's -- I think it's premature for me to, sort of, declare that we could alleviate our headcount requirements on the basis of robotics at the moment. We are moving on this but it's going to take a little bit of time. We are doing some pilots, and I think it will be at least a couple of quarters before I'm in the position to even answer that question or make an attempt to answering that question in terms of what impact that is going to have. I would say we are very optimistic, we can see some bright spots and some real possibilities quantifying it. I think it's way too early to do that at the moment. In terms of the labor market, it remains tight, particularly around CRAs and project managers particularly with oncology experience, as you would expect. We have a number of approaches to build our own. We have a number of graduate -- from new graduate programs, certainly in Asia. In Japan, we brought on 50 new graduates and then we trained them and we literally sit them in the office ourselves for the first 6 to 9 months and train them up and then, gradually are able to assign them to work. So that's an investment we are making. We also doing that in the United States and couple of other European -- sorry, Asian countries, particularly as well, China. So we're alleviating some of those headcount or labor market challenges through things like that, training our own resources. Our retention has been very good over the last 12 months, it's improved fairly -- not dramatically, it was always fairly good. But I think we are at an all-time high in terms of retention now. So that always helps you. If you don't lose as many people, you don't have to replace as many. I think we're in a good position in terms of the work we've got coming in and managing the just-in-time process of bringing in those resources to do the work. As I said, not leaving revenue and work on the table but not bringing it in so early that people don't have enough to do. It's a fine balance that we have to strike, but I think with the tools we have and the competent folks we have running these groups, we are able to tread that from under [mile farther].</p><p>DAVID HOWARD WINDLEY: Just thinking about the revenue base, the totality of revenue and folks I know, me included, still thinking, kind of, Pfizer and ex-Pfizer. And I know you probably want to get away from that. But I understand early -- I jumped on late, and I understand earlier in the call you said you think Pfizer has kind of normalized around, maybe, [260 or 260 to 270]. I think that number in and of itself has bounced around a fair amount as we've tried to find the bottom one, on Pfizer post-bococizumab. I guess I just would be interested in hearing your answer again on the visibility that you have to the run rate from Pfizer. And then, given a steady book-to-bill outside of that, as you described, is that ex-Pfizer book of business something that you think can still generate -- continue to generate double-digit growth? Could it even be mid-teens as it was in the first quarter? How should we think about that ex-Pfizer book of business converting out of backlog and growing going forward.</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: I'll have a crack at that and I'll get Brendan to add. In terms of Pfizer, I think as you've seen the revenues have come down over the last few quarters. I think this quarter, we actually bounced up a bit to around 60-something million dollars. And I do think -- so I do think we are looking at a steady state now, whether it's $260 million, a little higher, a little lower. I don't think it's going to be materially different to that. And I think that's a good number for us to be at. I think that's a number that they will feel comfortable with. We certainly feel comfortable in delivering at that level of work. We have a good pipeline of opportunities with them. The work we've won over the last 12 months, as I mentioned, is in about the [1.0] on the book-to-bill. So we figure that's about the right number, that's a good number for us to be at. In terms of ex-Pfizer growth, certainly, we have seen on a book-to-bill basis, very solid numbers posted and very solid revenue growth ex-Pfizer. And I do think that will start to, as Brendan said, start to really play in as we get towards the back-end of this year and into next year. I'm not sure about teens, but I would've thought high single digits, maybe low double digits is the sort of number we'd be actively looking at for 2019 and beyond. Dave, we think the work we've brought in, the quality, the backlog we brought in -- notwithstanding, a lot of it is oncology so I put that out as a little bit of a warning, but the quality of the backlog we have and we have won, particularly through our alliance partners and the newer midsized biotechs, is such that we believe we can get this moving and get to those sort of numbers. So we are optimistic and certainly very positive about the revenue growth potential for the company over the next couple of years, really. Do you want to add to that?</p><p>BRENDAN BRENNAN: The only thing that I would add to that, Dave, is just to say really quickly, we guided at the beginning of this year 12% to 14% of concentration from the customer. First quarter, we were 12%, second quarter we were 13.5%. So we are in the range. It will jump around a little bit, just like any other customer. So I think the expectation I'd say is just be careful on a quarterly basis if you're expecting absolutes. Look at it on a 12-month basis is how I would say it, and I think we'll definitely be in that or above the 14% range.</p><p>OPERATOR: As we have no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to you, gentlemen, for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.</p><p>STEVEN A. CUTLER: Thank you, operator. Quarter 2 was another very strong quarter for ICON and we look forward to building on this progress throughout 2018 as we consolidate our position as the CRO partner of choice in drug development. We look forward to talking with many of you at our Investor Day at The NASDAQ Markets Day in New York City on Monday, September 10.
