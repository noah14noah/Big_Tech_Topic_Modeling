Our first witness is David Marcus, Calibras CEO. Following his testimony, a panel of experts will share their views on Facebooks plans.</p><p>I have serious concerns with Facebooks plans to create a digital currency and digital wallet and its efforts to enlist partners that expand its reach, like Mastercard, Paypal, Visa, Uber, Lyft, and Spotify. Facebook is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that is intended to rival the U.S. dollar. This venture is slated to be based in Switzerland, which has a history as a monetary haven for criminals and shady corporations. Facebooks plans raise serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns, not only for Facebooks over 2 billion users, who will have immediate access to these products, but also for consumers, investors and the global economy.</p><p>In addition, Facebook has proposed backing Libra tokens with government currencies and government guaranteed securities, and holding them in a so-called Libra Reserve, to be governed by Facebook and its partners. Ownership of government assets on such a massive scale without proper oversight threatens to concentrate government influence in the hands of a few elites. Ultimately, if Facebooks plans come to fruition, the company and its partners will wield immense economic power that could destabilize currencies and governments.</p><p>Facebooks proposed entry into financial services is all the more troubling because it has already harmed vast numbers of people on a scale similar to Wells Fargo, and demonstrated a pattern of failing to keep consumer data private on a scale similar to Equifax. Facebook remains under a 2011 consent order from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for deceiving consumers and failing to keep consumer data private. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook provided 50 million users private data to a political consulting firm, the company will reportedly pay a record $5 billion fine to the FTC for data privacy failures. In addition, Facebook has allegedly: insecurely stored user passwords dating back to 2012; paid unsuspecting teenagers to download spyware; experienced a hack of nearly 50 million accounts; and experienced a software bug that granted third party access to 6.8 million users photos. It has also been sued by HUD and civil rights groups for violations of the Fair Housing Act in what amounts to modern day redlining. Facebook also allowed malicious Russian state actors to purchase and target ads in a campaign to influence the 2016 election.</p><p>I am also concerned about the lack of diversity in Facebooks upper ranks, and fear that if these plans go forward, women and minorities and women- and minority-owned businesses may be excluded from participating fully.</p><p>In light of these and other concerns, my colleagues and I wrote to Facebook earlier this month to call on it to cease implementation of its plans until regulators and Congress can examine the issues associated with a large technology company developing a digital currency, and take action. The Independent Community Bankers of America and others support this commonsense step.</p><p>Facebooks plans also raise larger concerns about Big Techs expansion into financial services, as it appears to inappropriately mix commerce and banking activities. So, today we will discuss a draft bill, the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which would prevent large platform utilities like Facebook from becoming financial institutions and block them from creating their own currencies.</p><p>Todays hearing is only the first step in our oversight and legislative process. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-149545183</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKV-PSP1-F11P-X4RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

The Committee also heard testimony on a draft bill, the \" Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act,\" that would (i) block large platform utilities (defined generally as online marketplaces with over $25 billion in annual revenue) from being affiliated with a financial institution (including money service businesses), and (ii) prohibit large platform utilities from offering digital assets that are designed to serve a function similar to that of money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The witnesses and the substance of their testimonies included the following:</p><p>Chris Brummer, Agnes N. Williams Research Professor Director at the Institute of International Economic Law, Georgetown University Law Center</p><p>Mr. Brummer criticized the ambiguity of a Libra white paper and the argument that the Libra coin is not a security and, therefore, not subject to securities rules and regulations. Mr. Brummer stated that the white paper failed to:</p><p> clearly state that potential users could lose money and that \"runs on the coin are possible\";confirm that users will be exposed to counterparty risk due to the potential mismanagement of reserve investments;disclose governance risks, such as how Libra coins may be negatively affected by the Libra Association's decision-making and conflicts of interest;explain how the decentralized application interface may affect the proposed \"secure, scalable, and reliable blockchain\"; andaddress the potential systemic risk of Libra.</p><p>Additionally, Mr. Brummer argued, even if Libra coins are not securities, they do have \"securities-like\" characteristics that would require them to comply with securities rules and regulations. Such characteristics include:</p><p> consumers risking capital in a common enterprise;significant information asymmetries between Libra and Facebook;operational and value-preservation control of the Libra Association;users seeking profit from coin holder participation; andsimilarities to pooled funds, which are subject to securities rules and regulations.</p><p>Katharina Pistor, Edwin B. Parker Professor of Comparative Law at Columbia Law School</p><p>Ms. Pistor stated that the Libra white paper brought to the forefront an ongoing debate about the benefits and challenges of \"fast-moving innovations in technology.\" Ms. Pistor highlighted several key takeaways, such as that:</p><p> Libra is designed to be a \"new global currency\" and a \"for-profit \"currency of currencies\"\";Libra's reserve of \"safe\" assets rely on public backstopping mechanisms for which Libra sponsors are not paying;all interests and dividends will be delivered to Libra Association and/or Libra Token investors - not holders of Libra coins;it is not clear how or when the Libra Association will move away from its current \"club-like or permissioned system to a permission-less system\";the Libra Association is accountable only to itself; andcurrent legal and regulatory frameworks are incomplete both domestically and internationally and allow both legal and digital arbitrage that will be exacerbated by Libra's introduction.</p><p>The Honorable Gary Gensler, Professor of the Practice of Global Economics and Management, MIT Sloan School of Management, Senior Advisor to the Director, MIT Media Lab, and CoDirector of MIT's Fintech @ CSAIL</p><p>Mr. Gensler warned that Libra introduces serious public policy considerations. According to Mr. Gensler, Libra Reserve is a pooled investment vehicle, which means that it should be regulated by the SEC, and the Libra Association should be registered as an investment advisor. Mr. Gensler acknowledged other arguments that Libra Reserve could be regulated as a bank, but emphasized that it should not be allowed to make loans. Additionally, Mr. Gensler highlighted the privacy and consumer protection considerations raised by Facebook's new subsidiary Calibra, which is a digital wallet. Given Facebook's recent issues with the misuse of consumer data, Mr. Gensler warned, further regulation is needed based on the \"potential to commercialize private consumer financial transaction data\" in addition to data on Facebook's vast social media and information network.</p><p>Based on these concerns, Mr. Gensler stated, he approved of the draft bill as one alternative way to both promote competition and lower potential risks posed by big tech affiliations.</p><p>Robert Weisman, President of Public Citizen</p><p>Mr. Weisman asserted that Facebook cannot be allowed to create a private global currency, and warned policymakers not to rely on Facebook's representations of how Libra and Calibra will operate. Mr. Weisman warned that:</p><p> Libra will both deepen Facebook's social media dominance and extend that dominance into global payment markets;Libra will be systemically important but will operate without the required controls to protect against systemic risk;it will be difficult to ensure customer protections are met, since Libra is a private and borderless currency;there is no historical precedent for this type of corporate surveillance;it may pose a \"fundamental threat\" to sovereign nations' ability to maintain distinct monetary policies and responses to currency crises; andfraudsters will \"rush to take advantage of Libra.\"</p><p>Mr. Weisman \"strongly endorse[d]\" the draft bill, expressing support for either a \"legislated prohibition or . . . a lengthy moratorium on privatized, global currencies.\"</p><p>Meltem Demirors, CEO of CoinShares</p><p>Ms. Demirors asked policymakers and regulators to treat Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as Libra, as \"open, permission-less technologies that will support American growth.\" Ms. Demirors stated that:</p><p> bitcoin and \"decentralized, open, permission-less cryptocurrency networks\" are beneficial and \"foster innovation, economic growth and the development of new industries\";bitcoin and Libra are fundamentally different; andregulators should continue to \"allow and encourage Bitcoin and the innovation happening here in America . . . to flourish\" and to distinguish between \"fact and marketing fiction.\"</p><p>Commentary / Steven Lofchie</p><p>One of the original concepts behind the Bank Holding Company Act (the \"BHCA\") was that if banks were allowed to get into commercial activities, they would have an undue advantage because of their access to cheaper funding than ordinary commercial businesses. With the \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act,\" the logic of the BHCA is effectively reversed: big tech would have an unfair advantage over financial companies because of their better access to data. See generally  BIS Urges Regulators to Address Emergence of Large Technology Firms in Financial Markets. In effect, access to information or data is the new killer advantage; it is what money used to be. So if a law is adopted to keep big tech out of finance, does the prohibition stop with finance?</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The announcement comes just a few weeks after Germany's antitrust regulator used its competition authority to enforce principles of data privacy and processing. On February 7, 2019, the Bundeskartellamt issued a decision against Facebook, ruling that the practice of combining user personal data from different sources by a dominant market participant violated EU data protection law. This was a noteworthy decision from a competition authority being influenced by and seeking to enforce the General Data Protection Regulation, which would otherwise be enforced by data protection authorities. The decision is not yet final, but if upheld it could have the notable impact of limiting the data footprint used to inform advertising, and may influence regulators' willingness to use competition law to buttress limitations placed on the flexibility of data collectors and processors. Please see our previous  client alert on the Facebook ruling. If this approach informs the FTC's position on competition and privacy enforcement, it could extend a trend of regulators outside the data protection sphere using broader authority as a bridge to enforce privacy issues against companies they view to have a dominant market position.</p><p>Looking ahead in the United States. The FTC made no direct mention of consumer privacy in its release announcing the Technology Task Force and instead highlighted the need to \"closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition\" as an extension of is ongoing  Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century. However, the task force will be composed of staff attorney experts in areas including online advertising, social networking, mobile operating systems and apps, and platform businesses, all of which define a sizable portion of their respective markets through consumer data. Additionally, \"The FTC's Approach to Consumer Privacy\" is scheduled as part of those hearings on April 9-10, 2019, and it will be interesting to see what role, if any, the newly created task force might have in that approach. Whether this new development will signal increased use of and reliance upon economic and cost-benefit analysis and an expansion of consumer welfare thinking at the FTC remains to be seen. However, recent calls from Congress make clear that U.S. legislators have an increasing appetite to use the tools of the FTC and competition policy in novel ways to address concerns about \"big tech.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/gigantism-facebook-google-amazon-antitrust(Rep\">https://www.rollcall.com/news/gigantism-facebook-google-amazon-antitrust(Rep</url>.

I appreciate the opportunity to open this conference on competition in the fast-changing and dynamic communications industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, my first question for you this morning is, Are you ready? That's what the famous Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi asked with the first radio broadcast over water, on May 13, 1897. After inventing what was then cutting edge radio technology here in Italy, Marconi sent that message across the Bristol Channel in England; soon after that he was sending messages across the Atlantic. Tapped out in Morse code, it said: Are you ready? This was followed by: Can you hear me? And, the reply: Yes, loud and clear. Wireless communications was born.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world, of course, has never been fully ready for the many incredible advancements radio communications have enabled. But, it has been more than eager to embrace them. For over a century, since that first radio broadcast across the Bristol Channel, the communications industry has been marked by constant innovation. It's a dynamic industry that has delivered enormous value to consumers, starting here, in the birthplace of wireless communications, to countries around the world.</p><p>Makan Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust at the United States Department of Justice, spoke in Rome a few weeks ago. He recalled the epithet that all roads lead to Rome, and the power of network effects on display in the Roman Empire. Today's conference topics are built on the power of network effects-how they deliver value to markets, and how they can hinder the competitive process.</p><p>Indeed, with the development of advanced networks and the Internet of Things, we are entering a world of ubiquitous connectivity. Instead of all roads lead to Rome, a more descriptive epithet for our time is all roads lead to everywhere and everything or, maybe, all roads lead to all roads.</p><p>The ongoing development of wireless communications that Marconi helped advance, and eventually commercialize, has forever changed our world. There are now network connections and wireless signals crisscrossing the globe. This city of Milan and my home in Washington, D.C. no longer seem quite so far apart.</p><p>In fact, I can hold up my smartphone from this podium and see if I have any text messages from distant Nigro family relatives in San Fele, Italy, or obtain critical, time sensitive information, such as a picture of the Italian Caprese avocado toast my daughter ate for breakfast today.</p><p>In the modern era, however, it is also so much more than simply sending messages. In the last century, telecommunications was one of the most important industries in every economy in the world. It was how people and businesses shared information in real time. In the next century, however, many industries will rely on telecommunications not just to communicate, but as an integral part of the services their customers' desire. Telecom is rapidly evolving from being a means of communication to providing the platform on which other industries operate.</p><p>Consider Amazon or Uber in the United States. Retail businesses and transportation services once stood beside communications providers as pillars of industry. Now, retail and transportation depend on communications not just to do business more expeditiously, but as part of the service itself. Telecom is quickly becoming inextricably intertwined with many other industries and changing the way we do business; it is restructuring entire industries.</p><p>Throughout the decades since Marconi first sent his message, we have seen that innovation and consumer welfare are best served by competition and competitive markets. When the pace of innovation is stifled by external controls, be they unnecessary regulations or monopolists, consumers suffer. That is what I would like to talk about today - our responsibility as Department of Justice officials to enforce the antitrust laws through effective law enforcement, rather than unnecessary regulation. Regulated markets tend to react more slowly to the rapid changes that are the lifeblood of dynamic industries such as communications. In contrast, by preserving competition through effective antitrust enforcement, markets and competitors are free to embrace innovation at the pace of invention, unconstrained by the reigns of a regulator.</p><p>I'll begin my remarks by talking about some general principles of antitrust enforcement and remedies in dynamic industries, before touching on a few of the key topics that will be the focus of the panels the next two days.</p><p>The United States' first federal antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was passed in 1890, seven years before Marconi sent that message asking: Are you ready? When it came to having a tool to maintain competitive markets, the country was ready-it had in place a law enforcement regime designed to protect competition and competitive markets.</p><p>We also had much to learn in those early days. The drafters of the Sherman Act did not understand key market concepts in communications like network effects and gatekeeper power, or economic concepts like HHIs and Upward Pricing Pressure. They, however, endorsed a law enforcement regime, rather than a regulatory regime, which proved wise-they lacked the depth of thinking that we do about the features of communications markets that can sometimes make them conducive to competitive problems. But, they did understand there were dangers from the misuse of corporate power, even as they were hesitant to interpose governmental authority over free enterprise. We are wrestling with the same tension today.</p><p>In resolving that tension, let us be clear about the proper role of the government in dynamic industries. We are not inventors; I know I am certainly not, which is why I am here speaking to you today. We do not develop new technologies. Nor do we provide incubators for inventors-that is what free and competitive markets do. Our job is to use law enforcement to protect those free markets and competition, to the benefit of consumers, innovators, and the economy as a whole. At our best, we protect the environment in which the modern-day Marconis have reason and opportunity to tinker, invent and invest to bring new technologies to market.</p><p>That is precisely the intuition underlying this Antitrust Division' approach to merger settlements. Mergers change market structures. The question for us is whether the change is good or bad for consumers. When anticompetitive harm results from changes in market structure, attempting to wrestle the firm to behave in a way that we think replicates a competitive outcome makes no sense, even assuming we can guess what the competitive outcome would be, or should be, absent the merger. A problem caused by a structural change requires a structural fix. It is not our job as law enforcers to use our power to approve transactions as an opportunity to step in and order the firm to adhere to certain dictates. Regulatory restrictions and dynamic markets do not mix well.</p><p>That is our guiding principle: whenever feasible, competition, as maintained through effective antitrust enforcement, is preferable to regulation. Competitive markets dynamically weigh risk and reward, support investment, and pivot to new innovation. Regulation, in contrast, is rigid and tends to be slow moving-lagging both competitive problems and new innovations. The literature describes as regulatory lag the delay between changes in market conditions or technology and the adjustment of regulations based on those factors. Particularly when attempting to regulate access to markets as a solution to a competitively problematic market structure, regulation and its resulting lags will typically mean delayed entry, expansion, or innovation.</p><p>A story from communications law history underscores the point. In the 1950s, a Texas rancher and inventor thought there should be a way to make and receive a phone call while riding a horse or tending to an oil field. So, Thomas F. Carter set out to build a device to attach to his telephone, then on AT&amp;T's monopoly network, that would use radio signals to transmit out in the field. In many ways, his invention, the Carterfone, was the first mobile phone.</p><p>AT&amp;T was then a nationwide telephone monopolist in the United States, and it sought to block the Carterfone. At the time, its equipment business, Western Electric, was vertically integrated with its telephone system, and naturally fought innovators who tried to develop new equipment.</p><p>Moreover, AT&amp;T had the assistance of FCC regulation, using a tariff filed with the FCC in 1957 to prohibit interconnection of non-AT&amp;T equipment like the Carterfone. So AT&amp;T was able to employ an FCC tariff to block the Carterfone.</p><p>Carter eventually turned to legal action. He filed suit in federal court in 1965, but that case was dismissed. So nearly a decade after first attempting to bring his invention to market, in 1966 the industry regulator, the FCC, undertook an inquiry into the effect of its own rules. Two and a half years later, the FCC issued its famous 1968 Carterfone decision, insisting that AT&amp;T permit the attachment of devices like Mr. Carter's to the telephone network.</p><p>There we see the belated benefits of regulation. Over a decade after its invention, and eleven years after AT&amp;T filed an FCC tariff prohibiting its use, Mr. Carter had won access to the markets with the assistance of the sector regulator.</p><p>The Carterfone decision is rightly celebrated for opening up the monopoly telephone system to innovative new equipment. But consider that it took Tom Carter three years to win that result through a proceeding at the FCC, eleven years after the tariff was filed. Do you see what I mean about regulatory lag? Think about all the inventors and innovators who were not so persistent and who just never bothered in the decades prior. Even as Carterfone demonstrates the benefits of regulation when it produces a competitive result, it also exemplifies its pitfalls.</p><p>Indeed, compare what Apple and Steve Jobs did as they developed the iPhone in 2007. In a competitive U.S. wireless market, he was able to find a launch partner with AT&amp;T, which sought exclusive access to the device in order to gain a competitive advantage. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>It is remarkable to think that if Apple's iPhone had followed the same path to the market that the Carterfone did, we would be looking forward to FCC action this year.</p><p>Whereas in a regulated monopoly market, the first mobile phone took over a decade to reach the market; in a competitive wireless market, the iPhone took just a few short years. How much would consumers have lost these last ten years if the iPhone had needed to seek court or FCC intervention to change the world?</p><p>The answer is too much. Particularly in dynamic and innovative markets, consumers do not deserve to pay the price of delay. That is why we believe in competitive markets unbridled by the reigns of regulation and behavioral dictates. Thus, as AAG Delrahim has said, we disfavor regulatory settlements and, instead, have a strong preference for structural settlements because they leave competitors and markets free to adapt and change with product availability and consumer demand.</p><p>Our recent settlement in connection with the Bayer/Monsanto transaction is a good example of this philosophy. Any farmer will tell you that agriculture is an incredibly innovative industry. As they have for millennia, seeds like corn and cotton are undergoing constant technological development to improve their yields. Meanwhile, seed treatments that ward off insects and disease are at the forefront of agricultural innovation.</p><p>As you know, Bayer proposed to acquire Monsanto in a $66-billion-dollar transaction. We worked with the parties to resolve all of our competition concerns with a historic divestiture. The proposed final judgment requires Bayer to divest businesses and assets valued at approximately $9 billion dollars. More importantly, none of the competitive problems, including the areas of vertical concern, were attempted to be managed using behavioral dictates.</p><p>A few features of that settlement underscore our approach in dynamic markets. First, we undertook a thorough investigation and we were ready to litigate while also coordinating across jurisdictions. Although our friends at the EC were also working on their own review, we worked closely with them to coordinate our remedies.</p><p>Most importantly, the relief we obtained is purely structural. Bayer has agreed to divest itself of all of the businesses and assets needed to fully address both our horizontal and our vertical concerns with the transaction. While there are temporary commitments in place to effectuate the divestiture, it is important to note that they are a means to support the structural relief we obtained. After those transition commitments have passed, the market structure obtained in the settlement will remain, and throughout it will remain flexible to innovation and evolution in the industry.</p><p>We have also included in the Bayer/Monsanto settlement a number of new provisions to allow for more effective enforcement of the decree. Along with enforcement provisions that have been in all of our recent settlements, we have also added a new provision regarding the interpretation of the decree, which we intend to include in all decrees going forward.</p><p>That emphasis on structural solutions to structural problems is particularly important in dynamic industries like agriculture and communications. When new technologies and modes of doing business are rapidly evolving, how can static behavioral commitments meaningfully solve competitive problems? Equally concerning, how can we write behavioral commitments that do not themselves risk hindering innovation and investment? As AAG Delrahim explained in a speech last November, regulatory remedies fall short by attempting static solutions to the realities of dynamic markets. In dynamic industries especially, antitrust remedies should preserve the flexibility of competitively structured free markets, unconstrained by regulation.</p><p>With that background in mind, let me turn to some of the specific topics we will be discussing the next two days.</p><p>First, wireless. We have come a long way from Marconi's radio and the Carterfone, and even from the introduction of the iPhone. Mobile wireless network infrastructure has become a crucial component of any advanced society.</p><p>According to GSMA, Europe and the US have the highest levels of mobile user engagement in the world. Just to give you a sense of the scope-the US has 400 million wireless subscribers; that's more subscribers than the entire US population. Meanwhile, in Europe, there are 456 million mobile subscribers-that is over 84% of the population.</p><p>Mobile wireless is critical to both economies. Wireless services alone generate $189 billion in annual revenue, and devices add to that another $84 billion. And that is just the services themselves, with trillions of dollars in commerce flowing over the networks. Millions upon millions of jobs are supported by wireless infrastructure.</p><p>Yet demand continues to grow. In tomorrow's economy, not only will each individual be connected but most consumer products will be as well. Already, a connected carbon monoxide detector can save lives by turning off a home's furnace when it senses danger. The possibilities to add value to people's lives through further device interconnectivity on the Internet of Things is enormous. As more and more devices connect and machine learning technologies provide greater uses for that connectivity, demand will likely continue to increase at an enormous rate.</p><p>Some claim that 5G technologies appear poised to meet that increasing demand; that they represent a leap forward in capabilities. We may, some argue, see speeds ten times faster than LTE, or more, alongside lower latency and greater security.</p><p>What does that mean for competition enforcement? As in medicine, first, we should do no harm. With companies and infrastructure developers rapidly innovating and testing new models, we should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forward. Free market competition provides the best means by which to test and to hone the emerging wireless networks to provide a platform for tomorrow's economy.</p><p>Just as we hope to let free market competition play out, however, we should avoid market structures that require regulatory intervention. I doubt anyone desires a return to the days of a regulated monopoly provider that can exclude new equipment like the Carterfone. Wherever the 5G evolution takes us, I hope we can agree that a competitive market, not a regulated one, is our goal. It is certainly a priority of the Antitrust Division to push for policies that promote the development of - and competition in - 5G technologies.</p><p>Another item on the agenda for this conference is big tech, and how we should be thinking about competition among large tech players and in emerging virtual markets. Indeed, these topics have been on the agenda for many events this year. People around the world are thinking hard about the development of massive online platforms and aggregators that generate tremendous network effects. How do we maintain the value they deliver to consumers at the same time as we use antitrust enforcement to police the competition in their industries?</p><p>A few key points to bear in mind. First, the Antitrust Division has active matters in this area as well. We expect a decision any day from the United States Supreme Court on our American Express case. After a lengthy trial, the district court found that American Express restrained competition on the merchant side of its platform-the market in which credit card networks compete for the business of merchants. The Supreme Court is now considering an appeal from that decision that asks what consideration should be given the other side of the platform. Whatever it decides, its ruling will likely impact how we think about antitrust enforcement for platform businesses.</p><p>We should also base enforcement decisions, as always, on evidence and sound economics. The bigness of technology companies as a general matter, or their success in delivering value to consumers, is not alone a basis for antitrust enforcement action. Competition enforcers should act only when an evidence-based assessment suggests antitrust enforcement will prevent real consumer harms. Also, there is a great deal of debate around so-called big tech, but with these relatively new business models it is important our understanding of their economics is sound. For example, some are discussing a framework of thinking about big tech in terms of platforms and aggregators; they believe whereas platforms connect users with content, aggregators connect with users directly and package content for them. If so, these models may imply different competitive incentives and market structures that may be relevant to competition analysis.</p><p>Another key point is that the consumer welfare standard is flexible enough to deal with the novel kinds of competition issues presented by online platforms. Although many of these services are zero cost to consumers in a monetary sense, they do cost consumers their time and attention, and oftentimes their data and other information about them. Revealed preferences suggest that consumers place value on their data such that its use forms a dimension of platform competition. Applying a consumer welfare standard through this lens, the antitrust laws are up to the task of analyzing platform industries.</p><p>The Antitrust Division has also prioritized competition in video delivery, as exemplified by our recent enforcement action against the vertical merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner. We expect a decision from the court tomorrow, so I will not comment on the case.</p><p>Vertical issues in telecommunications typically arise from gatekeeper power-the power to affect or control access to a market. In the case of video distribution, this concern arises as Internet disruption threatens to challenge profits that industry incumbents have long enjoyed. We have sought, in a number of past cases, to prevent the harms that arise from aligning the incumbents' incentive to delay disruptive competition with the ability to do so.</p><p>Our Bayer/Monsanto remedy addresses a version of this concern. It requires the structural divestiture of certain important Bayer seed treatment product lines to remedy the competitive harm that would result from the vertical integration of those lines with Monsanto's leading seed business. Bayer has critical seed treatments products, and so the merger would have given it the incentive and ability to raise prices that Monsanto's rival seed companies pay for those treatments, ultimately raising prices for farmers.</p><p>By requiring the divestiture of Bayer's seed treatment businesses, we eliminate the incentive and ability to increase prices to Monsanto's rivals. A behavioral remedy, in contrast, would have attempted to dictate the terms on which Bayer sells those seed treatments, even as they undergo continued development and innovation in the years to come. We chose a free market solution over a regulatory one.</p><p>An important benefit of structural settlements is that they solve, for good, the competitive problem resulting from the merger. Behavioral commitments, meanwhile, attempt temporary solutions. Many celebrated the Comcast/NBCU settlement conditions back when that merger went forward in 2011. Those conditions expire on September 1, 2018. When we wake up on September 2, the merger will be here; the final judgment will not. Presumably, either all of the adverse effects the final judgment was intended to address have been solved, or not. While I want to be clear not to comment on Comcast/NBCU, more generally, it is our concern about the or not world that compels our strong preference for structural fixes to structural problems.</p><p>The end result of these regulatory fixes, unfortunately, can be markets that simply beg for more regulation. Some have said that the answer to expiring behavioral remedies is to extend them. Instead of five or seven 7 years, maybe behavioral decrees should be ten or fifteen years, or longer; although a decree that is too long may be just as stifling as one that is too short. Others have said the answer is to impose new sector regulations to fill the gaps. All of those suggestions, however, miss the point of antitrust enforcement as a law enforcement regime. The reason we favor structural relief is because we believe competition, not human dictates, is the best vehicle for promoting consumer welfare. Using antitrust law to impose yet more regulations is counterproductive and distorts incentives to innovate.</p><p>Let me conclude by acknowledging how fortunate we are. We live in a time of tremendous potential and rapid change. As consumers, that gives us much to look forward to; as enforcers, it gives us much to think about. The reason competition enforcement has proven time and time again it is up to the challenge of fast changing markets, is that it has benefitted from a vibrant community of academics, enforcers, and practitioners, thinking through the hard issues as they arise. Now, it is time to do our part. I look forward to an interesting discussion over these next two days.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(U.S. Department of Justice)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LEIPZO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJ7-FN61-DXMS-80JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3908\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 13, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0003K1T</classCode><className>TELENT LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS238210 ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS &amp;

President Trump and Republicans face meaningful headwinds for their respective 2020 reelections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Overall, the 2018 election illuminated a country that is largely at odds with itself on the most important policy questions it faces at the federal level. The 2016 election exposed many of these fault lines, and the 2018 election realigned some of those fault lines but reinforced others. While there is bipartisan hope Congress and President Trump can tackle the big problems facing the nation, there is little clarity on which solutions actually can garner bipartisan support amongst the American public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following post-election assessment and forecast for the next two years in Washington is based on a deep dive into several interrelated questions:</p><p> What are the priorities of the 116th Congress, and how will President Trump respond to those priorities?What demographic changes do the newly elected Senators and Representatives represent?Who will be the leaders in the new Congress?Does a divided Congress mean gridlock, or is there evidence that a divided Congress can still pass major legislation?</p><p>We have a separate memo that delves into four key questions about the election results and political conditions from today forward through the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>We are available to provide more in-depth analysis of specific policy areas for those who want to have discussions on particular policy sectors or areas.</p><p>The Agenda for the 116th Congress and President Trump</p><p>The Democratic Agenda</p><p>In the 116th Congress, House Democrats will split time between (1) using their oversight powers, including the ability to subpoena, to restrain the Trump Administration, and (2) legislating on major policy priorities. On the legislative front, as we discuss below, we expect the House to focus on healthcare, environmental protections and climate change, transportation, competition and privacy, trade, education, and infrastructure development.</p><p>Investigations and Oversight</p><p>From an oversight and investigations perspective, we expect House Democrats to look into a broad range of matters, including healthcare policy, environmental compliance, foreign policy, competition and antitrust, prescription drug prices, disaster relief efforts, national security policies, and election security. Already, Democrats have announced they will request that the Internal Revenue Service turn over President Trump's tax returns. Other House Committees will want to investigate President Trump's business dealings in a variety of ways. We can expect the House Judiciary Committee to delve into the resignation details of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the constitutionality of the president appointing as Acting Attorney General an official who has not been Senate-confirmed. Democrats also have made clear they intend to compel Administration officials, such as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, to testify on a variety of ethical controversies.</p><p>Of course, there are a number of newly elected House Democrats who favor filing articles of impeachment against President Trump, but the expected House Democratic leadership team has consistently played down that possibility. We do not expect that to change unless the Mueller report demonstrates illegal coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign in the 2016 elections. If there are clear threats to the independence of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into President Trump, House Democrats may pass legislation that limits the president's ability to fire Mueller or bury the findings of his final report.</p><p>What It Means: Democrats know that a House focused on investigations and impeachments creates political risks as they set their sights on the 2020 election. Therefore, Democrats will enter the 116th Congress with an aggressive legislative agenda that prioritizes must-pass legislation and legislation that appeals directly to their base, such as immigration reform, gun reform and voting rights reform. The Democratic agenda also will place a strong emphasis on consumer protections.</p><p>Democratic Legislative Priorities</p><p>Among the first acts of each new House is passage of the chamber's rules. The new rules may restore \"Pay-Go\" rules that require new spending and tax cuts to be paid for with new revenue or budgetary cuts elsewhere.</p><p>The expected incoming House Democratic leadership team intends to pass a package of ethics and election reform legislation early in 2019. This will likely include restoring elements of the Voting Rights Act invalidated by recent Supreme Court decisions, requiring public disclosure of all donors to entities involved in political advocacy, a reversal of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision allowing political advocacy by corporations, and stricter controls over the lobbying industry. We do not expect the Senate to pass such legislation.</p><p>The recent tragic mass shootings in Pittsburgh (PA) and Thousand Oaks (CA) may create pressure for the new Democratic majority to pass gun control legislation early in 2019, even if such legislation was unlikely to move in the Senate.</p><p>What It Means: A new House majority always frontloads its legislative calendar with items that demonstrate how it differs from the prior majority. Ethics reform and broad gun control legislation was not going to happen under a Republican House, so quick passage of popular legislation on these issues are clear signals Democrats are headed in a different policy direction.</p><p>The Return of Core Democratic Policy Priorities</p><p>A Democratic House ends all serious legislative efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), though the Trump Administration will continue its work to disassemble the ACA via regulatory action. Despite this, Democrats will feel pressure to address the increasing premiums for individual health plans, while maintaining certain ACA provisions such as protecting pre-existing conditions. In addition, drug pricing will be on the top of Democrats' healthcare agenda. We expect both the House Energy and Commerce and the Oversight and Government Reform Committees to hold hearings to bring transparency to manufacturers' drug pricing systems, and for Democrats to introduce legislation that contrasts with the Trump Administration's drug pricing proposals. We also anticipate Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee to engage in oversight activity on pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance mergers. For more information on the coming Congressional agenda on healthcare, see the following publication from our teammates: Impact of the Mid-Term Elections on the Life Sciences Industry.</p><p>The new House Democratic majority will prioritize climate change policy. It is possible Democrats may use the infrastructure measure to incorporate provisions related to grid modernization and efficiency into the bill. In addition, Democrats will likely introduce a package of climate change bills and engage in oversight activities over the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) dismantling of the Obama Administration's environmental regulations. It is also possible the House will use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to try and preserve some of President Obama's environmental initiatives that President Trump is now eliminating. House Democrats know the Senate is not likely to take up these measures, but using the CRA could put Senate Republicans on the defense.</p><p>Immigration reform remains a priority for much of the Democratic base, and House Democrats will be staunch opponents of funding for President Trump's border wall. The new House majority will also look for ways to support the legal status of Dreamers.</p><p>Criminal justice reform is one area where common ground is likely to be found. We expect it to be a perhaps surprisingly early priority of both parties and the Administration. Indeed, an optimist might even hope that cooperation on that subject could prove to be a trust-building exercise for more cooperation on tougher challenges such as infrastructure financing and immigration.</p><p>What It Means: Healthcare was the top policy priority of 2018 voters and the House will deliver a consistent stream of hearings, investigations and legislation. The House will use its investigation and legislative powers to halt or slow down President Trump's deregulatory agenda in the environmental space. Further, the House will be an opposing force to President Trump's immigration actions even if major legislative solutions on this issue cannot clear Congress. On all these issues, the Democratic House will be highly visible and active compared to the last few years under Republican control of the House.</p><p>Tech Policy, Especially Privacy, Will Be Under the Microscope</p><p>Democrats in both chambers will provide oversight and legislate on privacy. Establishing national privacy standards remains a bipartisan interest, but the two parties will diverge on how stringent the standards should be. Republicans will push for a national privacy framework that preempts state laws, particularly with the California Consumer Protection Act taking effect in 2020. While Democrats also view preemption as a measure to ensure consistent consumer protection laws across states, they do not intend to concede on preemption without the inclusion of stringent consumer data privacy protection provisions. Democrats also want to give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement power over privacy issues.</p><p>We also anticipate Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to bring in tech and media companies to investigate data privacy violations and mergers. Further, House Democrats will take the liberty to increase oversight of tech industry regulators such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), particularly on net neutrality. With control of the House, Democrats may feel the pressure to work with Republicans to pass a nationwide net neutrality framework to avoid significant changes in the FCC's rules in the future.</p><p>In addition to privacy, Democrats will prioritize their legislative agenda on security. Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee intend to work with Republicans to address mounting concerns with intellectual property theft and securing the supply chain by foreign entities, especially IT companies closely tied to the Chinese government. In September, the House passed the Securing the Homeland Security Supply Chain Act, authorizing only the Homeland Security Department to ban contractors that pose a cybersecurity and national security risk. The bill has stalled in the Senate and presents an opportunity for Democrats to expand the bill's scope to a government-wide solution in the 116<sup>th</sup>Congress. In the Senate, there are questions about which Democrat will take up the mantle on supply-chain security issues, given that Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) lost her seat.</p><p>What It Means: Regardless of who won the elections, Congress is increasingly concerned with the level of control big tech companies have over the everyday lives of Americans. The new Democratic House will be proactive in looking for ways legislation and regulation can rein in the worst excesses of the tech sector's intrusions into individual privacy.</p><p>Resetting Policy on Taxes, Appropriations, Financial Services, and Trade</p><p>On the House Ways and Means Committee, Democrats will likely work to pass technical corrections to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and tax extenders that appeal to the Democratic base, such as renewable tax credits and the deduction of college tuition. Corporate tax issues will be scrutinized for potential new federal revenue. The Committee also is expected to prioritize retirement and pension reform.</p><p>Much of the appropriations process got back on track in 2018. Now, it will be critical for the seven remaining appropriations bills to be finished in the lame duck session if House Democrats want to start the Fiscal Year 2020 process on time. Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee will look to maintain the annual appropriations process and push for two-year budget agreements. As for earmarks, their return remains uncertain as there are diverse and diverging opinions on earmarks within the party.</p><p>We expect the House Financial Services Committee to conduct oversight and issue subpoenas to Trump Administration officials to testify about its reorganization of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), including limiting the Bureau's enforcement actions. We also expect more oversight hearings on enforcement actions related to the big banks. The Committee's priorities will also include Congressional actions needed for regulatory reform for the financial services industry, potential reactivation of the Export-Import Bank, GSE reform, reauthorization of both the Flood Insurance Program and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Acts, fintech oversight and cybersecurity/data breach issues. For a more comprehensive review of the policy agenda of the Financial Services sector, please see the policy briefing from some of our colleagues: Impact of the 2018 Mid-Term Elections on Financial Services Regulation.</p><p>As for trade, House Democrats will likely use their oversight authority to examine the Trump Administration's trade agenda and the adverse effects of retaliatory tariffs by other countries. While the Trump Administration is seeking to move quickly on the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, House Democrats will use their procedural tools to slow down President Trump's preferred approval timeline. President Trump cannot pass USMCA without strong support from House Democrats, giving the new House majority leverage on trade issues. Democrats may try to secure targeted concessions on Democratic priorities as a condition of supporting USMCA's passage. Both the Senate and House have procedural tools to stall the approval process for USMCA which, combined with the sheer number of new Representatives and Senators who may not yet understand trade policy, makes it challenging to predict if Congress will ultimately approve USMCA.</p><p>What It Means: Any future tax cut will be focused on the middle class, but it is more likely that there simply is no major tax code change in the near term. The financial services industry will find itself under the most scrutiny since the immediate aftermath of the 2008 banking meltdown. President Trump is going to have to negotiate on fiscal priorities for the first time, and Congressional Democrats have a great record of emerging with substantial victories on spending issues, especially on nondefense discretionary spending. The same is true with trade. There is no USMCA deal possible unless President Trump offers trade concessions or grants other legislative compromises as the price for Democratic support.</p><p>Infrastructure and Education</p><p>One of the Democrats' top legislative priorities may be passing a major infrastructure package, as both parties view this as an opportunity for bipartisanship and a way to boost job creation. Congress will need to address an anticipated shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund and reauthorize surface transportation programs expiring in the current five-year authorization under the FAST Act.</p><p>As for education, House Democrats will use their Aim Higher Act as a blueprint for a Higher Education Act reauthorization bill and have said they want to move forward with a bipartisan reauthorization process. However, Democrats will likely take hard stances on accountability measures, particularly for for-profit institutions, as well as preserving and expanding student financial aid programs to address concerns about college affordability and accessibility. Additionally, we expect a heavy dose of oversight of the Department of Education. Much of the Department's regulatory actions around Title IX, gainful employment, student loan servicers, for-profit institutions, student borrower defenses, and accessibility for students with disabilities will be under the microscope. House Democrats also will question the Department's handling of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, as the Department has failed to approve the majority of applications.</p><p>What It Means: As we discuss later, a divided Congress can achieve bipartisanship on major legislation. A major investment in infrastructure and reforms of the laws governing higher education touch pocketbook issues that affect most voters, especially swing and youth voters. These are two areas where Congressional bipartisanship, or even agreement with President Trump, could lead to major legislation becoming law.</p><p>The Republican Agenda</p><p>The split control of Congress triggered by the midterm election establishes a two-track strategic approach for Republican lawmakers in the 116th Congress. Republicans in both chambers of Congress will defend the Administration and White House on a number of fronts. In the Senate, the Republican majority has a responsibility to move Trump Administration nominees quickly through the confirmation process. Meanwhile, House Republicans serving in the minority will be tasked with the unenviable job of defending the Administrationand in many cases, industry interestsas the new Democratic majority begins to press forward with an aggressive oversight and investigation agenda that we anticipate will be wide-ranging.</p><p>First and foremost, the Senate Republican majority will need to shepherd through a forthcoming nomination to succeed Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. That contentious process will serve as a political flashpoint on the nominee's views on a range of issues. It may also be a referendum on the president's plans regarding Special Counsel Mueller and the future of his investigation. The president may also nominate Acting Administrator Wheeler to serve as the permanent Administrator of EPA. He may also need to appoint a nominee to replace Secretary Zinke at the Department of Interior who is under ethics scrutiny.</p><p>Senate Republicans will likely devote significant floor time to approving nominations at every level of the Judiciary. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed through a near-record number of nominees for the US district and appellate courts over the past two years, in addition to two new Supreme Court nominees. And that process may well play out again in the new Congress. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas could, for instance, decide to retire at the end of the current term to ensure that a Republican president can nominate a replacement while the Senate is under Republican management. Richard Nixon was the last president with three Supreme Court nominations in a single term. And while we do not anticipate other openings on the Court, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent accident is a reminder many Supreme Court openings arrive unexpectedly.</p><p>What It Means: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell knows personnel is policy, and he will focus his chamber on confirming the people needed for President Trump to transform the judicial branch in the long term, and reshape the executive branch in the near term.</p><p>Other Legislative Items</p><p>More broadly, Senate Republicans will likely continue to press ahead on major \"must pass\" legislation in the new Congress along with other high-priority policy agenda items. Transportation and infrastructure issues jump immediately to the forefront in this scenario. Another priority may be extension of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELAR), which expires in December of 2019. Senate Republicans also appear poised to lead a bipartisan effort to establish regulations to protect consumers' online privacy in our increasingly digital ecosystem. Finally, Republicans may attempt to pass new tax reform legislation focused on a middle-class tax cut ahead of the 2020 election.</p><p>We expect House Republicans to serve mostly as a messaging arm on major policy issues that will arise in the new Congress. They will serve as the loyal opposition to Democratic oversight and investigation initiatives and attempt to influence the trajectory of major \"must pass\" legislation. But ultimately, their chief objective will be thwarting what they view as objectionable legislative initiatives and efforts to derail the Administration's agenda.</p><p>Turnover in the Trump Administration</p><p>After two years operating at a frenetic pace, many Trump Administration top officials are expected to depart over the next few months. The exodus began a few weeks ago with UN Ambassador Nikki Haley stepping down. Now, after the election, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has departed and will need to be replaced. President Trump has said he was going to take the week after the election to consider further changes in his Cabinet, which is in keeping with the practices of his predecessors in the White House, who often used the post-election period to make changes in their Cabinet.</p><p>President Trump already has a turnover rate in his Cabinet and White House that is far higher than historical norms.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>See \"Trump's staff turnover is the highest of any US administration in modern history,\" Business Insider (Mar. 28, 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote> Now, there is some expectation that he is contemplating turnover for Chief of Staff (John Kelly), Defense Secretary (Jim Mattis), Homeland Security Secretary (Kirstjen Nielsen), Commerce Secretary (Wilbur Ross), and Interior Secretary (Ryan Zinke). It is possible that President Trump will seek to turn over some or all of those positions, but it is also reasonable to think that several of the existing Cabinet members who have served since the beginning of the Trump Administration will also choose to step down now.</p><p>What It Means: There's high turnover in President Trump's Cabinet, which places stress on the Senate confirmation process, and creates delays in confirming the critical sub-Cabinet officials awaiting confirmation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has used every procedural tool to slow the timeline for confirming second-level Trump Administration officials, handicapping the president's ability to take control of agencies and implement major changes that match his policy preferences. While the president now has a larger Republican majority to deal with, he will have to spend more time than he would like getting top-level officials confirmed. That leaves less time for confirming second-level officials, and less Senate floor time for actual legislation to be debated.</p><p>Confirmation of judges is a legacy item for President Trump, as these judges will be in place for decades after the president leaves office. A third Supreme Court nomination fight may be a possibility in the next two years, and could be another highly charged political battle.</p><p>Trends Among New Senators and Representatives</p><p>The 116th Senate Will Be a Young and Less Experienced Body</p><p>While there is perception that Washington is comprised of lifelong political \"swamp creatures,\" the reality is that the level of Congressional experience has been dropping in recent years.</p><p>Pending the results in Florida for Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), there will be only 15 or 16 Senators who have served more than 18 years. At least 57 Senators in 2019 will have been in the Senate less than eight years. This means they have little or no institutional memory of the bipartisan comity that used to be the hallmark of the Senate, which has been largely washed away in the last decade or so.</p><p>Forty-nine Senators in office in 2019 will have previously served in the House of Representatives and thus are familiar with the more partisan legislative customs of that chamber.</p><p>What It Means: It will be harder for the Senate to pass major legislation because there are fewer Senators who have led such legislation to the finish line. The high number of former House members in the Senate means new Senators are bringing more of the House's culture to the Senate, and are adopting fewer of the Senate's historical norms.</p><p>House Turnover Is Accelerating</p><p>This year's election resulted in the third-highest turnover rate in the House since 1974. Since 2010 was also the second-highest turnover rate in the House since 1974, you have a body where the vast majority of Members are inexperienced by historical standards.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>See \"There Was A Lot Of Turnover In The House In The 2018 Cycle,\" FiveThirtyEight (Nov. 13, 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Only 56 House Republicans were in office before 2011 when Republicans became the majority, meaning few of the rank-and-file are prepared for the stark realities of life in the minority.</p><p>Conversely, well under 50 percent of the new Democratic majority were serving in Congress the last time their party controlled the chamber.</p><p>What It Means: There are relatively few House members who have served in both the majority and minority. Some of the more progressive new Democrats elected will want rules that minimize the chances of Republicans undermining the legislative will of the new majority. But many of the Democrats elected come from districts that demand and expect bipartisan cooperation from their member, and such promises were central to their election. There is also the relatively new bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, which has offered a set of procedural reforms that would reward bipartisanship, and reset the partisan mindset of the House. It will be interesting to see if any of those reforms are implemented in the transfer of power in the House.</p><p>Continued Gains for Women in Congress</p><p>This is an election of firsts, especially for female candidates. As of November 14, a record 99 women have won a House seat (with some races still not called). In the House, 86 of those women are Democrats, and only 13 are Republicans, as many Republican women lost their House races. The Senate will have 23 or 24 women, depending on the final outcome of the Mississippi runoff at the end of November.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>See \"Record number of women elected to the House,\" CBS News (Nov. 12, 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote> In the last six years, voters have chosen the three youngest women ever elected to Congress. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) was 30 when elected in 2014, and while she was reelected, her record was broken by two Democrats in 2018. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) (age 29) is now the youngest woman ever elected, edging out Rep-elect Abby Finkenauer (D-IA), who will turn 30 the week before she will be sworn into office.</p><p>Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) is the first black female member of Congress from Massachusetts. Veronica Escobar (D-TX) and Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) are the first Latina women elected to Congress in Texas. The first two Native American females elected to Congress are Sharice Davids (D-KS) and Deb Haaland (D-NM). Similarly, the next Congress will be the first to include Muslim female Representatives after the election of Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN).</p><p>If she holds onto a very narrow lead, Young Kim (R-CA) would be the first Korean-American female elected to Congress. Nevertheless, even with Kim's potential addition, the number of Republican women in the House will be about half the number in the current Congress.</p><p>The House is likely to elect Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) Speaker of the House, again making her the only female Speaker in American history. Speaker Pelosi would be the first Speaker elected to nonconsecutive terms in that position since Sam Rayburn (D-TX) and Joseph Martin (R-MA) spent 20 years trading the Speaker's gavel between 1940 and 1961.</p><p>The next Congress will include 23 women in the Senate. Tennessee elected their first female Senator in Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Arizona did as well with Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). Appointed Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) will be in a runoff on November 27, and, if she wins, she will be the first woman to win a Congressional race in the state.</p><p>What It Means: The election of more women to Congress will result in cultural changes big and small to the House and Senate. Women in Congress will head many of the most powerful committees for the first time, such as the House Appropriations Committee, and will be key players on virtually every committee of relevance, and every debate of consequence. Women elected in Congress have generally been more collaborative on bipartisan legislation and more interested in making even incremental progress on an issue rather than holding out for a \"perfect\" legislative solution.</p><p>Veteran Influence in Congress Continues to Decline</p><p>There has been a great deal of media attention paid to the fact that Democrats recruited a number of military veterans who won election to the House or Senate, but the reality is military service amongst Senators and Representatives will continue to fall in the next Congress. The incoming class will include at least 17 freshmen Senators and Representatives. This is slightly larger than recent classes in 2016 (14), 2014 (12) and 2012 (12), but there is much more ideological balance inside this freshman class of veterans.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>See \"U.S. House freshman class includes most veterans in nearly a decade,\" Reuters (Nov. 7, 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote> Three of the freshmen veterans are women.</p><p>Overall, at least 77 veterans won election (most of them as incumbents), and there are 16 other Senators who are veterans but were not up for election in 2018.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>See \"U.S. House freshman class includes most veterans in nearly a decade,\" Reuters (Nov. 7, 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote> Nevertheless, the new Congress will have fewer veterans than the 102 that started in the current 115th Congress.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote7\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p>See \"The number of vets in Congress appears headed down again,\" Military Times (Nov. 7, 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote> By comparison, in the early 1970s, when Congress was populated largely by men who came of age in World War II, about 75 percent of the House and Senate were veterans.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote8\"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p>See \"The number of vets in Congress appears headed down again,\" Military Times (Nov. 7, 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote> Aabout half of all veterans in Congress in 2019 will be those who served after 9/11.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote9\"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>See \"The number of vets in Congress appears headed down again,\" Military Times (Nov. 7, 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote> Republican veterans in Congress are expected to outnumber Democratic veterans by about a 2-1 margin.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote10\"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p>See \"The number of vets in Congress appears headed down again,\" Military Times (Nov. 7, 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>What It Means: Veterans are usually touted as more likely to be bipartisan problem-solvers than other members of Congress, and most are staunch defenders of military spending and improving care at the VA. The continued decline of veterans in Congress means there are fewer policymakers with first-hand experience about policy decisions that affect troop deployments, strategic projection of forces, acquisition of complex military systems, and military responses to an ever-widening array of threats to the United States. It also means fewer members of Congress have first-hand understanding of the complex VA medical system and whether it is delivering cost-effective, high-quality medical care for enough of its patients. Finally, a majority of veterans now come from asymmetrical warfare environments, and that experience will shape their perspective on policy debates about military policy and military spending.</p><p>New Congressional Leaders</p><p>House Democrats</p><p>The House Democratic leadership team hopes to stay intact and withstand challenges from members of the new majority who want to see some turnover at the top. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will most likely become Speaker of the House again, with both Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (D-SC) trying to move up a rung on the leadership ladder to Majority Leader and Majority Whip, respectively. But upstart challengers loom, as reflected in Rep. Diana DeGette's (D-CO) decision to challenge Rep. Clyburn for the Majority Whip position, which could lead to a broader set of candidates contesting the top three leadership candidates. Democrats will also need to elect two additional members into the open leadership positions of Assistant Democratic Leader and Democratic Caucus Chairman (now held by Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY), who lost his primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). We expect Reps. Cheri Bustos (D-IL), David Cicilline (D-RI), Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), and Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), among others, to run for these positions.</p><p>Congressional Democrats are likely to view the coming Congress as a transitional period from one historic generation of leadership to another. In the House, the first woman elected Speaker, and the first African-American in leadership, will likely return to power, but perhaps only for two more years. A wide array of Democratsrepresenting all regions, demographics and policy perspectivesare maneuvering in advance of the full-scale leadership battle that is on the horizon when the current leadership team retires.</p><p>What It Means: The youth vote and first-time voters have spoken, and their voice will now give rise to the oldest-ever leadership team in the House, where all three top Democrats are approaching 80, and the median age of incoming committee chairs is 70. That dynamic can't hold for long, but Speaker Pelosi is likely to be very diligent in doling out high-profile legislative opportunities to allow the entering class of members to shine. It's good politics for 2020, but it also allows Speaker Pelosi to maximize her role in shaping the leadership team that ultimately replaces her.</p><p>House Democrats have made wise use of their time in the political wilderness to build a wide array of policy initiatives and experts inside their own Caucus. They may not have campaigned on those issues because it was politically more expedient to run on an \"oppose President Trump\" platform, but the party does have the pieces to begin moving legislation right away in the House. The lack of experience in the majority for House Democrats will inevitably lead to some procedural hiccups and missteps in the near-term, but the majority has the raw materials needed to move both partisan and bipartisan legislation in 2019.</p><p>House Republicans</p><p>The Republican leadership will change with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) retiring at the end of the year, and a reduction to the minority party in the House meaning there is one less leadership position to fill. The Republican conference elected Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) as the Minority Leader, Steve Scalise (R-LA) as the Minority Whip, and Liz Cheney (R-WY) as the Conference Chair (replacing the current GOP Conference chair, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers (R-WA)). The lack of more Republican women in leadership, and as Committee Ranking Members, is something the party will continue to look to address.</p><p>House Republicans face a serious brain drain in 2019 for three reasons. First, several long-serving Republicans who were committee chairs retired before the 2018 election, taking with them a generation of knowledge that stretched back to even before Republicans won the House for the first time in 1994. Many of the Republican party's biggest policy initiatives in the last 20 years stemmed from the minds of House Republicans who just retired. Second, Speaker Paul Ryan was the most influential and effective policy voice in his party, and it was his policy expertise that drove his rise to power. The Speaker's retirement is the biggest sign the Republican Party is walking away from almost 20 years of debate about how to reform the entitlements that are eating the federal budget (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security). Finally, several other Republican committee chairs, subcommittee chairs, and policy wonks were defeated in the 2018 election cycle. Republicans control the White House and the Senate, so the president and the Senate majority will set the Republican policy agenda. This covers up the fact that House Republicans have lost many of their best policy and procedural experts. Unless and until a new generation of policy experts comes forward in the House, Republicans will be heavily dependent on President Trump's agenda.</p><p>What It Means: Republicans took the House in 1994 in large part because of the Contract for America. Republicans seized the House back in 2010 in part because they had a clearly articulated vision of how they wanted to roll back some of President Obama's policy initiatives. In 2020, it is much harder for the chamber to flip if Republicans don't articulate a new policy agenda that helps them emerge from the shadow of President Trump and his policy preferences. Right now, it is not clear which House Republicans will fill that role of driving new policy ideas.</p><p>Massive Turnover on House Committees</p><p>There are many House committees that will see wholesale turnover in their membership in January. For example, the current Ways and Means Committee, which controls tax, trade and much of healthcare policy in the House, has 24 Republicans and 14 Democrats. The Democratic majority sets committee ratios and may end up with roughly the same allotment for Ways and Means as the current Congress, only with the parties flipped. Ten of the 24 Republicans on the Committee won't be in the next Congress, leaving 14 returning Republicans. It's possible then that no new Republicans are appointed to the committee. Conversely, Democrats will expect to add 10-12 seats on the Committee for their members. They have 12 of 14 current members returning to the next Congress, meaning they may have 8-10 plum committee assignments to spread amongst their caucus.</p><p>What It Means: Once final committee ratios are set, we can expect to see House Democrats add several seats for their members on every committee. Key committees like Ways and Means will have a very high number of new members learning the issues. Even still, demand to be appointed to top committees will far outpace the available supply of seats on those committees. There may be very few seats for Republicans to claim on the top-level committees.</p><p>Senate</p><p>In the Senate, we do not foresee changes in the Democratic leadership, but party term limits require a shift in Republican leadership under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) is term-limited in his current position, but he is likely to stay on the Senate Republican leadership team in some newly created capacity. Sen. John Thune (R-SD) is the new Majority Whip.</p><p>What It Means: The Senate floor in 2019 will look like blind auditions for the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. As many as eight different Senators are seriously contemplating running for president, and they will look to use Senate committee hearings and floor debates to define their platform. In some cases, the political ambitions of these Senators may conflict with Senate Minority Leader Schumer's agenda for his party in the chamber. The Senate minority will have a harder time with votes as well, since several Senators might soon favor time in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina over mundane roll call votes in Washington. One area where presidential ambitions of Democratic Senators intersects favorably with the Minority Leader's agenda is the all-out effort to slow down the process of confirming Trump Administration officials.</p><p>It's going to be harder for the Democratic Senate minority to be a blocking force on legislation, even as the party doubles down on a procedural delay strategy for presidential nominations. Look for Senator Schumer to pick his spots more carefully to ensure he has the political capital to be effective when needed most.</p><p>Can a Divided Congress Be a Productive Congress and Pass Major Legislation?</p><p>Most political commentators present divided government as a path to legislative gridlock, but recent history demonstrates that is not true. There are three recent examples of a divided federal government, and looking at the successes and failures of those three eras is interesting to review in the context of the two years to come in Washington.</p><p>Lessons Learned from the Last Three Divided Congressional Sessions</p><p>President George W. Bush's first two years featured a divided Congress (the 107th from 2001-02), where his party controlled the House but not the Senate. Nevertheless, President Bush enjoyed an extremely productive record of success. Major success included: President Bush's tax cuts package; the Patriot Act in the wake of 9/11; the creation of the Department of Homeland Security; Sarbanes-Oxley to increase regulation of the financial services industry; the authorization for use of military force against Iraq; Trade Promotion Authority to allow future presidents to negotiate better trade deals; a fundamental rewrite of primary/secondary education in the No Child Left Behind Act; the McCain-Feingold Act to regulate political spending; a farm bill; a bill to prepare and protect the nation against bioterrorism threats; the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act; and the Help America Vote Act, which was a package to upgrade state and local-level voting technology. In short, President Bush worked with a divided Congress to pass major legislation in a broad number of sectors.</p><p>President Barack Obama dealt with two consecutive Congresses where his party controlled only one chamber (112th Congress from 2011-12, and the 113th Congress from 2013-14). Like the divided Congress President Trump is about to face, President Obama's Democratic party lost the House to the opposition but retained control of the Senate. Also like President Trump following the mid-term elections, President Obama lost control of the House in the 2010 elections, after a period where the president had been able to use complete control of Congress to pass his biggest policy promises. For President Obama, those promises included the Affordable Care Act, the economic stimulus package, and the Dodd-Frank bill.</p><p>President Obama's work with the divided Congress in 2013-14 still yielded passage of some major legislative items. These items included: the Budget Control Act of 2011 (which kicked off a multiyear process to try and tame the growth of the national debt); Free Trade Agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama; the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent for the middle class; the STOCK Act to limit the potential for insider trading scandals in Congress; extending the National Flood Insurance Act; a major infrastructure package (MAP-21); several bills to improve operations at the FDA; and the Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act.</p><p>President Obama's second term also kicked off with a divided Congress where his party controlled the Senate, but Republicans controlled the House. With his biggest legislative accomplishments now three to four years old, President Obama had a harder time moving major legislation to the finish line. Some of what did pass includes: the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act; reauthorization of laws preparing the country to deal with pandemics and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) terrorism; legislation to stabilize the student loan marketplace; a farm bill reauthorization; and reauthorized funding for medical residency training at children's hospitals.</p><p>There were commonalities in the success both Presidents Bush and Obama enjoyed in facing a divided Congress. Both presidents cultivated key Congressional players in both parties, were willing to deal to get things done and had excellent White House legislative staffs handling the details of key negotiations.</p><p>What It Means: A divided Congress is not a recipe for gridlock, but it does call for a change in presidential tactics to help things move through the process. President Trump values the art of the deal over the details in those deals, and he has a good legislative staff in the White House. Those are two of the key elements Presidents Bush and Obama used to deal with a divided Congress. President Trump has used his bully pulpit to create momentum for policy changes he seeks. In an all-Republican Congress, he was successful in making progress on many of his policy priorities, and he was able to openly attack his political opponents because he often did not need their votes. Now that must change if the president wants to get things done. If the president can alter his propensity for attacking political rivals, and instead look to bridge small gaps where they exist, it is possible President Trump can also get big things done in this divided Congress.</p><p>The Volume and Success Rate of Legislation Drops Slightly in a Divided Congress</p><p>Overall, it IS harder than ever to pass a bill through Congress, regardless of its level of division. We looked at the legislative productivity in the last three Congresses where one party controlled each chamber,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote11\"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p>The three Congresses were the 107th (2001-02), 112th (2011-12), and 113th (2013-14).</p></bodyText></footnote> along with the numbers for the current Congress. In those three divided Congresses, the House of Representatives passed an average of 904 bills, while the Senate passed an average of 597 bills. Those numbers are about 25 percent less than the current House has passed, and 14 percent less than what the current Senate has done in an all-Republican Washington.</p><p>In President George W. Bush's first Congress (2001-02), he faced a divided Congress but 383 bills were signed into law. By President Barack Obama's second (2011-12) and third Congress (2013-14) he was facing also facing a divided Congress, and only 284 bills became law in 2011-12. By 2013-14, the president signed only 219 bills into law, a 43 percent reduction from 2001-02's divided Congress. For President Trump's first term, with a Congress totally controlled by his party, we've seen a rebound to 278 bills signed into law through the election, with reasonable expectations we might top 300 bills signed into law by the end of the session.</p><p>What It Means: A divided Congress creates disparate perspectives on many issues, but it does not create gridlock in and of itself. A divided Congress is likely going to pass 750-1,300 bills in the House, 550-650 bills in the Senate, and can expect to deliver 250-375 bills to the president for signature. In fact, a divided Congress can pass major legislation when both parties have political incentive to find common ground on some issues before next asking voters for support.</p><p>Outside of major legislation, a divided Congress will still pass hundreds of other bills, and a reasonable percentage of those bills will become law. At the very least, the bills that pass one chamber but not the other in a divided Congress, are often the blueprint to quickly pass similar legislation when Congress is controlled by just one party. Thus, it is a high-risk strategy for companies, coalitions, not-for-profit organizations, and associations to throttle down their advocacy efforts or sit out the process altogether because they face a divided Congress.</p><p>Trump Triangulation Coming in the Next Congress?</p><p>Some political commentators have talked about the prospect of President Trump engaging in some political triangulation with the opposing party. This is of course the exact playbook President Bill Clinton used in 1995-96 to deal with the first Republican House in decades. President Clinton revived his political fortunes by working with new House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) to pass legislation that angered portions of his Democratic base but appealed to the moderate, middle-class voters who would go on to reelect him in 1996. Major legislation included: welfare reform, the Defense of Marriage Act, tough crime laws, the line item veto, HIPAA, the Telecommunications Act (which included new decency standards), and Helms-Burton (Cuba embargo and sanctions).</p><p>What It Means: There are going to be days that President Trump makes Congressional Democrats happy and Congressional Republicans very nervous. For President Trump, many of his policy positions are flexible, as the president prefers to \"do something\" than to do nothing on a key topic. It's quite possible he will find it appealing to find common ground with Speaker Pelosi on some major items like infrastructure reform, higher-education reform and trade, even if such a deal means angering some portions of the traditional Republican base (which is not the same as the Trump base).</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

We observed that while the U.S. enforcement agencies did not appear to support a regulatory approach to platforms and the digital economy, others like the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the UK Parliament's Digital Culture, Media and Sport Committee may have a stronger appetite for proactive regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since that post, competition authorities, both U.S. and other, have intensified their focus, with activities ranging from sector-wide studies to investigations into individual tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For example, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (DOJ) recently announced a broad review of whether online tech companies have harmed consumers or otherwise reduced competition. The probe will cover leading online platforms in \"search, social media, and some retail services\" and will focus on \"practices that create or maintain structural impediments to greater competition and user benefits.\"</p><p>That DOJ announcement is part of a broader effort by the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies to address competition in the tech sector. Days later, the Attorney General met with eight State AGs who reportedly are considering opening their own investigations. The FTC launched a tech task force back in February (in addition to its recently concluded hearings on competition and consumer protection) and last month opened a formal antitrust investigation into Facebook (according to a recent press release accompanying Facebook's Q2 earnings report). Reports also have emerged of FTC information requests to third-party resellers on Amazon. Even the Antitrust subcommittee of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary has held a hearing on online platforms and market power as part of its separate investigation.</p><p>The U.S. agencies' overseas counterparts have remained just as active. In Australia, the ACCC just published the Final Report from its Digital Platforms inquiry. The inquiry focused on online search engines, social media platforms and other digital content aggregation platforms with an emphasis on Facebook and Google, and looked into the impact of digital platforms on competition in the advertising and media markets, and on advertisers, media content creators and consumers.</p><p>The final report found that Google has \"substantial market power\" in the supply of general search services and search advertising services in Australia, and that Facebook has \"substantial market power\" in the supply of social media services and display advertising services in Australia. Both companies were found to have \"substantial bargaining power\" in their dealings with news media businesses in Australia. The report cautioned that this market power could be used to damage the competitive process, though it did not look at whether these digital players have in fact misused their market power.</p><p>The report offered 23 recommendations \"aimed at addressing some of the actual and potential negative impacts of digital platforms in the media and advertising markets, and also more broadly on consumers.\" The recommendations most directly implicating competition include changing merger law to incorporate additional factors - such as the likelihood that the acquisition would result in the removal of a potential competitor from the market, and the nature and significance of assets, including data and technology, being acquired - and to require advance notice of acquisitions; and creating a new, specialist digital platforms branch within the ACCC to monitor and investigate proactively instances of potentially anticompetitive conduct by digital platforms and take action to enforce competition and consumer laws.</p><p>The report also recommended changes to Australia's Privacy Act, including expanding the definition of \"personal information\" to include technical data, strengthening notification and consent requirements and pro-consumer defaults, enabling the erasure of personal information, and introducing direct rights of action and higher penalties for breach, as well as establishing an ombudsman scheme to resolve complaints and disputes with digital platform providers. Additional recommendations focused specifically on news media (e.g. creating a code of conduct to promote fair and transparent treatment of news media by digital platforms, improving digital media literacy in schools and the communities, and offering greater funding for public broadcasters and local journalism).</p><p>Similar undertakings are in the works around the globe. The ACCC report comes just as the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced the start of a formal market study into online platforms and the UK market for digital advertising. The study will examine three potential sources of harm in digital advertising: (1) The market power of online platforms in consumer-facing markets - to what extent online platforms have market power and what impact this has on consumers; (2) Consumer control over data collection practices - whether consumers are able and willing to control how data about them is used and collected by online platforms; and (3) Competition in the supply of digital advertising in the UK - whether competition in digital advertising may be distorted by any market power held by platforms. Platforms not funded by digital advertising are expressly outside the scope of the study.</p><p>In keeping with what appears to be a greater openness toward proactive regulation than the U.S. agencies (at least historically), the discussion of potential remedies in the CMA's Statement of Scope explains that the \"current expectation is that any remedies are likely to focus on recommendations to Government for the development of an ex ante regulatory regime ... and are likely to require legislative change.\" The CMA does not believe that a \"one-off\" market investigation and intervention is \"sufficient to provide a sustainable long-term framework for the sector.\" The five main areas in which remedies may be required include: (1) increasing competition through data mobility, open standards, and open data; (2) giving consumers greater protection over data; (3) limiting platforms' ability to exercise market power; (4) improving transparency and oversight for digital advertisers and content providers; and (5) institutional reform. The CMA plans to publish an interim report with initial findings in January 2020, with a final report to follow no later than July of next year.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the EU - which recently has been fairly active in the tech sector, including last year's highly publicized Google Android decision - recently announced a formal investigation into Amazon. The investigation focuses on Amazon's role as both a platform provider (through Amazon marketplace) and a participant on that platform (through its first-party retail offerings), asking whether Amazon's use of sensitive data from independent retailers is in breach of EU competition rules. Specifically, the Commission will look into (1) the standard agreements between Amazon and marketplace sellers, which allow Amazon's retail business to analyze and use third-party seller data; and (2) the role of data (including competitively sensitive marketplace seller data) in selecting the winners of the \"Buy Box,\" which allows customers to add items directly to their shopping carts and accounts for the majority of Amazon transactions.</p><p>As we cautioned previously, with so many competition authorities weighing in on how to assess tech competition, this confluence of inquiries and investigations can pose a challenge for global enterprises operating under an international patchwork of approaches. Technology-focused, data-intensive businesses should consider seeking antitrust counsel to monitor developing competition trends and implications across jurisdictions.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The regulators highlighted a number of significant big-picture risks, particularly as to AML compliance and operations and FinTech:</p><p> AML. AML-related deficiencies \"stem from three primary causes: inadequate customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence, insufficient customer risk identification, and ineffective processes related to suspicious activity monitoring and reporting, including the timeliness and accuracy of Suspicious Activity Report filings. Talent acquisition and staff retention to manage [] compliance programs and associated operations present ongoing challenges, particularly at smaller regional and community banks.\"FinTech. \"Rapid developments in FinTech and 'big tech' firms, evolving customer preferences, and the popularity of mobile technology applications have significantly changed the way banks operate and consumers conduct their banking and financial activity. . . . [T]he pace of change and the transformative nature of technology may result in a more complex operating environment. . . .

Nonetheless, the regulator pointed to a number of significant big picture risks, particularly as to AML compliance and operational / Fintech tech. The regulator's discussion of those two risk was the most interesting, and perhaps worrisome:</p><p> AML: AML-related deficiencies stem from three primary causes: inadequate customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence, insufficient customer risk identification, and ineffective processes related to suspicious activity monitoring and reporting, including the timeliness and accuracy of Suspicious Activity Report filings. Talent acquisition and staff retention to manage compliance programs and associated operations present ongoing challenges, particularly at smaller regional and community banks.FinTech. Rapid developments in fintech and \"big tech\" firms, evolving customer preferences, and the popularity of mobile technology applications have significantly changed the way banks operate and consumers conduct their banking and financial activity. The pace of change and the transformative nature of technology may result in a more complex operating environment. . . . Changing business models or offering new products and services can, however, elevate strategic risk when pursued without appropriate corporate governance and risk management. New products, services, or technologies can result in greater reliance on third parties by some banks and a concentration of service providers by the industry as a whole.</p><p>Commentary /  Steven Lofchie</p><p>The takeaway from the OCC's regulatory comments is that the regulators expect that there is likely to be a material reduction in the number of smaller banks. They are squeezed on the expense end from compliance costs and new technology costs, and squeezed on the revenue end from competition with fintech firms and customer's disinterest in traditional banking relationships.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The discussion explores risks for SEP licensors pending the FTC v. Qualcomm decision on Fair, Reasonable, and Non-discriminatory (FRAND) SEP licensing, refusal to deal, and compliance with Standard Setting Organization (SSO) obligations. On the implementer side, the discussion walks through patent hold-up and anti-competitive patent pooling practices. Matt and Scott also briefly preview 2020 legislative efforts in the patent space.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Transcript:</p><p>Scott McKeown: Welcome to the IP(DC) podcast, a podcast covering recent D.C.-based developments in intellectual property law and related commercial developments. I'm Scott McKeown, chair of Ropes and Gray's Patent Trial and Appeal Board practice. And I'm joined, as always, by my partner, Matt Rizzolo, an IP litigator in Ropes &amp; Gray's IP litigation group, also based here in D.C. Our special guest today is our partner, Chong Park, also of the D.C. office, who specializes in antitrust, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and commercial litigation. We've invited Chong today to discuss a current C-suite hot topic, which is the roll-out of 5G cellular communication technologies and what that means for businesses hoping to leverage and license this emerging technology.</p><p>There is certainly a lot of excitement on the consumer side when you talk about a new communication technology promising 100x the performance and speed of existing 4G technologies, further fueling the networking of home, autonomous vehicle implementations and just about everything in between. But while this technology is standardized for the purpose of ensuring interoperability among the various devices, this technology is, of course, proprietary. Standard Setting Organizations (SSOs) that develop such cellular and Wi-Fi standards, cooperate with the technology innovators to select and adopt the best technology. These innovators protect their technology with patents, referred to as Standard Essential Patents (SEPs). So Chong, let me throw it over to you to start the conversation today. With such power in the hands of a small number of global corporate players, Standard Essential Patent (SEP) owners, how do we avoid abuses of such seeming monopoly power and licensing scenarios? And what have we learned from the roll-out of past standards?</p><p>Chong Park: Well, that's an interesting question, Scott. What we have learned is that until recently, both of the federal antitrust agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the DOJ were primarily worried about just that, the accumulation of power in the hands of patent holders with Standard Essential Patents. And so they were worried about the concept of \"hold-up,\" that is that once a standard is adopted that companies are locked into that particular standard. And so a patent holder who had not disclosed their patent during a process might benefit from a hold-up, which is essentially sort of a hold-up in terms of the common cops and robbers sense when they point the gun, in this case, the figurative patent at a company and said, \"Well, we have a patent. It's standard essential. You comply with a standard. Please pay up.\" Recently, however, there's been a shift at least with respect to the DOJ to a concept of the \"hold-out,\" which is a concern that really a party that might be disadvantaged would be the patent holder when individuals and companies fail to pay a reasonable license for their innovative technology. And so the DOJ recently has actually fallen more on the side of vindicating and championing the rights of patent holders versus the, what they call, \"the implementers.\"</p><p>Scott McKeown: So on the hold-up side, the victim is the implementer, and on the hold-out side, the victim would be the patent owner or the innovator?</p><p>Chong Park: That's correct. And in terms of the participation standard setting bodies, there is a concept called FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-discriminatory), which means that in connection with the actual participation, a lot of these standard setting bodies impose an obligation on the participants to make what's called a \"FRAND assurance.\" That is a promise that if their technology is adopted and incorporated into the standard being reviewed and developed, that those patent holders will then license their intellectual property on Fair, Reasonable, and Non-discriminatory terms. Now, the meaning of that and what constitutes FRAND is a subject of hot dispute, but historically, it was the case that the antitrust agencies would view a FRAND assurance or FRAND remedy as a panacea for potential abuses of intellectual property, at least with respect to antitrust violations.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: And I think part of the reason, right, is that a FRAND commitment is something that seeks to strike a balance between those competing concerns of hold-up and hold-out. You have patent holders who in exchange for making that FRAND commitment, their technology is implemented in the standard and it's, presumably, widely adopted. And then they get a reasonable return on their investment. But that royalty may not be as much as they might be able to get if it was implemented in only certain proprietary protocols, for example, by a limited number of entities.</p><p>Chong Park: And that's right. And since we're talking about 5G, harmonizing both of those competing concerns is in furtherance of innovation, technological improvement. And so underlying all of the concerns, regardless of which position the agencies may take at a given position in time, the overarching concern is to allow technological development to occur, to allow the progression of new inventions to prosper, but at the same time rewarding the innovators. But, Matt, as you're saying, at the same time, assuring that they can't take undue advantage of their intellectual property.</p><p>Scott McKeown: And while we're on the topic of undue advantage. So how do we police the hold-up and how do we police the hold-out? Maybe, Matt, you can speak to the hold-up side of things?</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: Sure. I mean, one of the things that certain government agencies, the DOJ and the PTO, for a long period of time they brought to this arena the idea that there's a bit of a heightened concern over, say, injunctive relief in the context of FRAND and covered patents. And this culminated in a policy statement in 2013 where the DOJ and the USPTO jointly put this statement out saying that in the context of a FRAND-encumbered Standard Essential Patent, there are significant concerns with a potential injunction, whether that's something that's issued by a district court or in the situation in 2013 there was a potential exclusion order being issued by the International Trade Commission. And the DOJ and the PTO said that it's not necessarily a complete bar against injunctive relief, but in effect, the default should not be injunctive relief. And that's because in those agencies' minds, at least at that time, the concerns over hold-up were really paramount. And now we've seen that shift, as Chong discussed earlier, at least with respect to the DOJ and then joined by the PTO and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), in late-2019 where they essentially repealed that earlier policy statement and said that courts and other agencies, such as the ITC, are well-equipped to decide whether injunctive relief is appropriate in any given situation and you should treat Standard Essential Patents just like you would treat any other patent. And the existence of a FRAND commitment and the patent holders behavior as well as the potential licensees' behavior, those are all just factors that come into the mix.</p><p>Chong Park: And what's interesting is that the DOJ, under Makan Delrahim, has actually taken some actions to vindicate the rights of the patent holders and what they call the innovators. And essentially, the DOJ Antitrust Division has taken a stance that contract and patent law are sufficient to vindicate the rights of patent holders and patent licensees, and to regulate that dynamic as opposed to the imposition of antitrust law. And in fact, it's publicized, but the DOJ actually initiated a couple years ago an investigation of one standard setting body with respect to essentially a sort of secret meeting-type allegations to exclude certain technologies from being considered in order to advantage those companies' IP positions.</p><p>Scott McKeown: And I want to get into that compliance end of it for those companies that are participating in the Standard Setting Organizations, but before we switch to that, Matt, what do you take from the changing position or at least the seeming-changing position of the government on this question? Is this just a matter of, perhaps, the Obama administration maybe being a bit more pro-consumer as opposed to pro-big tech, which some would argue that the current administration is leaning more in that direction? Or were they really correcting a mistake?</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: You know, I'm not sure I'd characterize it as necessarily correcting a mistake, but it is sort of a rebalancing of things. And Chong just mentioned that they take the view that patent law and contract law is sufficient. For a long time, that was sort of how things were viewed and then antitrust came into the mix over the last 10-20 years, and then it's sort of waning again and coming back to that, \"Hey, this is really a matter of contracted patent law and that's sufficient in at least the vast majority of cases.\" So I'm not sure that I would necessarily say it's correcting a mistake - more like I guess, regressing to the mean, so to speak. What's interesting is that this policy statement comes out as the ITC is actually weighing whether to issue an exclusion order in a case involving Standard Essential Patent issues, involving memory modules and the JEDEC standard. And that's something that the ITC is due to decide this spring, so it's particularly interesting that this joint statement repealing the prior statement came out now, especially given that that prior statement also came about as a result of an ITC case.</p><p>Scott McKeown: And as the U.S. has been evolving between these at least seemingly differing government positions, it seems as though stakeholders had sought out jurisdictions in other countries to, perhaps, get better treatment, whether it be for an injunction or more favorable FRAND rate. And what can either of you tell me about this trend to have these disputes being global, and one nation or one jurisdiction sort of trying to take ownership over it to the exclusion of another?</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: That's an excellent question and it's something that sort of ping-pongs back-and-forth almost by the week at this point. I mean, over the last decade we've seen a lot of back-and-forth over whether it's appropriate to seek injunctive relief on Standard Essential Patents in the United States, Germany, China, the UK, France, what have you. And often you've seen anti-suit injunctions brought where someone will say that you've improperly sought an injunction on an SEP in Germany, but there's this U.S. court that has jurisdiction over a larger FRAND dispute, and the U.S. should enjoin the party from enforcing the injunction in Germany. You've seen disputes over what is the appropriate jurisdiction, if any, to set the terms of a FRAND license. Even setting aside question of injunctive relief, what if the parties simply come to a court and say, \"Hey, figure this out for us and let us know what is a FRAND license between us?\" The UK, famously in the last couple of years has seemingly taken the mantle of that, and that's an issue that's before the high court over there. But even just in the last couple of weeks, Paris, the high court in France said, \"Paris is the logical jurisdiction because ETSI is a French entity and we're interpreting all these agreements under French law anyway, so you might as well do it in France.\" So there's a lot of warring still going on in that aspect of things.</p><p>Scott McKeown: And what if you're an implementer, your idea of FRAND is much different from the innovator's idea of FRAND, and there's a refusal to deal? This was something that seemed to come up in the Qualcomm dispute, and Chong, what's your take on where we are with refusal to deal?</p><p>Chong Park: Well, that's interesting. And that's actually something that's at dispute, as you mentioned, Scott, in the FTC v. Qualcomm case, where under U.S. antitrust law it used to be very black letter that no company has a duty to deal with a competitor. So a refusal to deal case can be brought under specific circumstances. Here, in the FTC v. Qualcomm case, it'll be interesting how the Ninth Circuit decides because it'll be sort of a ground-breaking decision with respect to the inner action of a refusal to deal in a particular SEP FRAND case. And to go back to what Matt mentioned, especially since we're talking about 5G and the global standards, this is going to be something that companies are going to have to consider on a global scale because just as they're sort of jurisdiction shopping and questions about interpretations of the applicability of, say, French law to Etsy contracts, etc., the antitrust and competition authorities across the world take different views. While there has been an increased trend into cooperation, again, companies in the 5G world are going to have to carefully analyze how their operations are going to be viewed globally vis-a-vis the agencies in particular jurisdictions.</p><p>Scott McKeown: So in addition to understanding the various dynamics and which way the political winds are blowing and what's happening in the courts, I want to spend a little bit of time on compliance because whether you're an innovator or implementer, you may be participating or on the fringes of one of these Standard Setting Organizations. And Chong, what can you tell us about ensuring that your people are playing according to the rules and the risks there?</p><p>Chong Park: Thanks, Scott. In fact, this is something that where we've had actual boots on the ground experience in terms of training company personnel with respect to appropriate behavior at standard setting body meetings. As companies understand, they can't control their participants at standard setting meetings, but it is important to have training and have guardrails and safeguards that individual participants understand. For example, let's talk on very practical terms with respect to certain guidelines that we train participants on. Not having a secret meeting with rivals where they talk about competitively sensitive information including, but not limited to, pricing of products or their intellectual property portfolio - all things, which without disclosing any confidential information, I can tell you happens. A lot of these meetings are in locations where there's plenty of opportunities for after-hours meetings, and sometimes the discussion of technical proposals and other issues take place after hours. From a practical perspective, there are rules that govern these standard setting bodies and individual participants should be trained to follow all applicable rules. Parties should not have side meetings where they in a group decide that they will exclude one or more other groups from participating and/or presenting their technical proposals. And parties should also not \"pack the votes.\" One of the seminal antitrust cases in standard setting is a Supreme Court case called Allied Tube, and in that case, the standard setting body was \"packed\" with individuals voting on a particular proposal that included secretaries and non-technical personnel. So there are additional steps we could talk about it, but when the rubber meets the road, I think it's very prudent for companies to actually have training of individuals that participate in standard setting bodies.</p><p>Scott McKeown: Thanks for the insight on compliance. But I want to get back to 5G and look at the roll-out of this technology and is this roll-out of 5G really driving the agency viewpoints here?</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: Yes, I think that it is in some respects. One of the interesting things with 5G is as opposed to prior 2G, 3G, 4G standards where you did have some foreign involvement, particularly companies such as Ericsson and Nokia, in 5G you see a lot more foreign company involvement as far as patent holdings and potentially essential patents are declared \"essential patents.\" So this is something that has to be in the mind of the agencies and seemingly is as they enforce certain policies against patent holders.</p><p>Chong Park: And, in fact, there are actually two specific examples which are current in which the DOJ has used the impending roll-out of 5G and the need to encourage that roll-out as justifications for its position in legal cases. The first one being a case that was just argued in the Ninth Circuit, the FTC v. Qualcomm case, in which the FTC won at the district court level in terms of challenging Qualcomm's licensing practices as anti-competitive. What is interesting is while the FTC brought the case and at least won at the district court level, the DOJ sought to intervene and has taken a contrary position in part based upon its view that the judge's ruling would impede the ability of 5G to be rolled out and Qualcomm as a major player in chipsets to foster that development of 5G. Interestingly enough as well, in its approval of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, the DOJ, again, referred back to the need to encourage the 5G roll-out and gave credit to the merging parties' justification that merging Sprint and T-Mobile would be the interest of a more efficient and expeditious 5G roll-out. And of course, the states disagreed and they brought suit in New York, and as we know recently, the district court judge rejected the states' arguments and ruled in favor of Sprint and T-Mobile. And again, in that case, one of the justifications that the parties put forward was, again, the expeditious and efficient roll-out of 5G.</p><p>Scott McKeown: Okay, I think we've covered the landscape here on 5G - we'll anxiously await that Qualcomm decision. But before we leave, Matt, I know we like to talk about IP legislation that's pending and developments, and maybe throw it over to you for some updates on some happenings on Capitol Hill?</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: Sure. So as we know, we've been waiting for quite some time for a bill to get introduced on patentable subject matter, under Section 101. As we've talked about before on the  podcast, it was allegedly coming soon after July 4, 2019, and we still haven't seen it. We've had some comments from Senator Tillis implying that, at least in his view, progress was unlikely in 2020, particularly given that it's an election year and Congress is busy with a whole bunch of other matters. But we had other comments from Rep Hank Johnson of Georgia who is also involved in this process, and he noted that they are still working on this issue and that work has not ceased. I guess time will tell and maybe we'll cover that in a future addition of the podcast. And I know that also Rep Johnson noted that there is Congressional fix in the works for the Arthrex issue, the appointments clause issue involving the PTAB judges, so that is also something to look to forward to, to see if and when that gets rolled out.</p><p>Scott McKeown: In my two cents, given some of the comments made by Senator Tillis, is that they're still listening but they're still hearing a lot of the same things that they heard before, which initially led to the legislation dying. So their ears are still open, but I would not expect to see anything given the election's coming up of Tillis and Coons, which essentially were driving that effort.

At the same time, Congress is looking to restore patenting options for some technical areas such as medical diagnostics, while combating patent \"ever-greening\" for blockbuster drugs and treatments. Given this storm of legal issues, this IP(DC) podcast tackles the Administration's confusing efforts to reign in drug pricing to date, while touching upon competing policies at play on the patent side of the business. In this episode, health care partner Tom Bulleit joins IP partners Scott McKeown and Matt Rizzolo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Transcript:</p><p>Scott McKeown: Welcome to the IP(DC) podcast, a podcast covering recent D.C.-based developments in intellectual property law. I'm Scott McKeown, chair of Ropes &amp; Gray's Patent Trial and Appeal Board practice. And I am joined, as always, by my partner, Matt Rizzolo, an IP litigator in Ropes &amp; Gray's IP litigation group based here in D.C. We've got an interesting show for you today that goes a bit beyond your run-of-the-mill patent-focused developments. Today, we'll explore both the business end and intellectual property aspects of biopharma.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: Did you know that prescription drug prices were too high? Well, if you didn't, you haven't been listening to President Trump. A few years ago, then-candidate Trump told us that pharmaceutical companies were \"getting away with murder,\" and he promised to take action if elected. Our partner, Tom Bulleit, who heads the health care practice in our D.C. office, is also the leader of our working group on drug pricing, and has been closely following initiatives by the administration, Congress, and the states that are looking at bringing down drug prices. We're very fortunate to be joined by him today. Tom, can you give us an overview of what's going on in this area?</p><p>Tom Bulleit: Thanks, Matt. All of this really kicked off in 2018, although candidate Trump went so far as to support the controversial idea of direct government price negotiation with manufacturers, the administration's 2017 health policy efforts were devoted mostly to the ultimately unsuccessful effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But in 2018, the administration stepped up its game, first with a Rose Garden presentation of their \"American Patients First\" strategy, called the Blueprint, to curb prescription drug prices. The Blueprint sets four priorities that have spurred various administration initiatives over the past year: improve competition, improve negotiation with drug makers, incentivize lower prices, and reduce out-of-pocket costs. The FY 2020 budget that the administration released Monday, March 11 also contains several of these ideas. And since then, the administration has released a flurry of final and proposed regulations that I'll get into.</p><p>Scott McKeown: Tom, so what exactly has the administration been doing to further these proposals?</p><p>Tom Bulleit: Well, I'll start with improving competition and improving negotiation with drug makers. First, you need to understand that there are several structural impediments to affecting drug prices with either of these. The first is that drugs covered under Medicare, either administered in physician offices under Medicare Part B, or acquired from pharmacies under Medicare Part D, have statutory protections that prevent forcing doctors or patients to choose cheaper drugs. Part B essentially covers anything a doctor thinks is medically necessary, and pays according to a statutory formula that almost all the time gives doctors a 6% markup - so as a rule, they have no incentive to choose cheaper drugs. And although Part D plans negotiate prices with drug makers, they're required to cover all of the drugs in six protected classes - without getting technical, these are drugs that treat HIV, mental illness, cancer, epilepsy, and those who've had organ transplants. That really ties the hands of plans trying to get lower prices because they can't exclude similar drugs just because they're expensive.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: Given that the Trump Administration is stuck with these coverage requirements, what has it done so far to target drug prices?</p><p>Tom Bulleit: Well, effectively, what the administration has tried to do is tinker around the edges. In May, they published a final rule called \"Modernizing Part D and Medicare Advantage to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Expenses.\" This allows Part D and Medicare Advantage plans to use step therapy and prior authorization for new starts of the protected categories, except HIV drugs; outside the protected classes, to exclude biosimilar products in the same way they can exclude drugs that have a generic equivalent. But it did not include the more impactful proposal of allowing Part D plans to exclude protected class drugs if the price increased beyond a certain threshold. Then in June, they announced that they were withdrawing a proposed rule that would have prohibited rebates, that's after the fact discounts, to health plans and pharmacy benefit managers. And it also would've created a new safe harbor for rebates that are passed through to beneficiaries at the point of sale. This was after the Congressional Budget Office showed that was not saving any money overall, and actually costing taxpayers about $177 billion over the next ten years. Then recently, they announced that a major health care overhaul will be announced in the fall. That will include the proposal for international reference pricing, which would tie Medicare Part B spending on drugs to amounts paid in foreign countries, which are generally lower. Some in Congress, and the White House is being coy on their position, want to apply that principle to Medicare Part D as well. That is something that could be really impactful, but Senate Finance Chairman Grassley is skeptical of this, and it's doubtful that it could be done by rule as opposed to by act of Congress. So while it's a big idea, it's a long way from having any effect.</p><p>FDA's taken some steps to try and improve competition from generics, issuing lists of drugs that could be subject to generic competition, and issuing guidance to make it easier for generic makers to force brand makers to provide the sample needed to reverse engineer the generic. And recently, Secretary of HHS Azar has bowed to the President's insistence that FDA authorize re-importation of drugs from Canada, though that is still in the rulemaking process. But FDA's actions likely will have only modest effects on drugs prices. It's unlikely that the Canadian government will allow the relatively small amount of prescription drugs sold to Canadian pharmacies to be diverted to the U.S. market. And there's no special reason to think that drug makers will increase the amount they sell to Canada to make up the difference. Also, the FDA approval process is only one aspect of whether a potential manufacturer of generics or biosimilars would view the market as profitable. More radical steps, such as finding a way to penalize drug companies for so-called pay-for-delay arrangements are contained in bills that Congress is currently considering, and in the President's budget, but it's doubtful that there is sufficient bipartisan consensus to enact the stronger measures.</p><p>Scott McKeown: Tom, let me ask you a little bit about the interaction with the Canadian market. Let's assume that the President is able to get some kind of legislation or rule in place that would open up the Canadian market. Would that not encourage gray market or black market goods?</p><p>Tom Bulleit: Yes, that's a really good point, Scott. One would think that it probably would, but that, of course, would undermine the premise of re-importation, which is that the drug supply chain in Canada is safe. So it's probably not in anybody's interests to have a system that encourages gray or black market importation, rather than importation that comes through the correct drug supply chain.</p><p>Scott McKeown: Just following up on that, so what has been going on to encourage lower list prices and to reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients?</p><p>Tom Bulleit: Well, the administration's early tactics in encouraging lower prices are best described as price shaming, calling out publicly the drug companies that raise their prices. The President prevailed on some drug companies to avoid any mid-year increases in 2018, but most of those companies raised their prices at the beginning of 2019. The administration issued a final regulation to require direct to consumer ads to show the list price of Medicare and Medicaid covered drugs, and Johnson &amp; Johnson recently announced that it would begin to do so. The administration seemed to think that by limiting this rule to drugs covered by Medicare, the administration could avoid the compelled speech, First Amendment concerns that drug makers raised about being required to put prices in their ads. And indeed, they did in a way - the lawsuit by pharma got the rule vacated in the trial court based on the conclusion that CMS's authority to issue regulations for the \"efficient administration of federal health care programs,\" simply didn't give the Agency regulatory authority over this issue at all. Even if the rule were to go into effect, there's little reason to think that this kind of soft pressure would lead drug makers to conclude that they should change their business models. And with the withdrawal of the proposed regulation creating a new safe harbor for pass-through rebates, the administration really has nothing going on that's likely to advance the Blueprint's fourth priority of reducing out-of-pocket costs. There has been some talk of adding the pass-through rebate to a Senate bill, and that may stand some chance of enactment.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: So you anticipated my next question: what has Congress done, if anything, that would have an effect on prescription drug prices?</p><p>Tom Bulleit: Well, in two words, nothing much, although there's been a lot of talk. The most interesting proposal, and one that may stand some chance of enactment in the fall, is called the \"Bipartisan Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act,\" that the Senate Finance Committee reported out on July the 25th. Although it's opposed by pharma, the White House has endorsed it, and Chairman Grassley has been touting this an alternative that should be palatable to conservatives. Meanwhile, Speaker Pelosi continues to negotiate a more radical bill with the White House, and one that reportedly would incorporate the international reference pricing proposal that the White House is considering for Medicare Part B, and some have speculated Medicare Part D as well. Because only the PDPRA, in my view, is likely to have enough Republican votes to get past the Senate, and it may not, it's worth mentioning a few of its provisions.</p><p>The CBO estimates it would cut Medicare expenditures by $85 billion and Medicaid by $15 billion over ten years, and would save beneficiaries $27 billion in out-of-pocket costs, so that's something. Most impactful, the bill would require rebates to Medicare for any Part B drug whose list price increased above the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI-Urban. The bill would also increase the number of drugs for which price reporting to Medicare is required. It would include drug company consumer coupons as price reductions, and it would narrow the definition of bona fide service fees that don't have to be treated as price reductions in reporting.</p><p>There are also some wonkier provisions, and the effect of all that is that the average sales price, or ASP, which is the basis on which Medicare pays for Part B drugs, should move downward, though by how much is a real question. And the flipside, of course, is that it encourages higher list prices to mute the impact.</p><p>The bill would also make a major change to the Part D benefit. Currently, this benefit has a deductible phase (consumers are out-of-pocket), an initial coverage phase (the beneficiary pays 25%), a coverage gap, which people call the donut hole (this year that's roughly out-of-pocket expenditures of $3,800 to $8,100, and in that donut hole the generic manufacturer pays 63%, the beneficiary pays 37% for generics, and brand manufacturers pay 70%, the beneficiary pays 25%, and the plan pays 5%), and a catastrophic phase (where Medicare pays 80%). The bill would cap out-of-pocket spending for consumers, eliminate the donut hole, and transfer brand name manufacturer liability for costs in the donut hole phase to the catastrophic phase. As with Part B, manufacturers would also have to pay a rebate to Medicare for price increases above the CPI-Urban.</p><p>There are a bunch of things that the bill would do for Medicaid as well, including increasing the maximum rebate that manufacturers have to pay, eliminate the pricing benefit that manufacturers currently get for having an authorized generic, and eliminate the ability of a pharmacy benefit manager to pocket any difference between the price it pays for the drug and the amount it pays the pharmacy. And in the area of price shaming, the bill would adopt the strategy adopted by many states which, in the last couple of years, have enacted laws to require drug makers to post their price increases, and in some cases a justification for the price increases.</p><p>Scott McKeown: Some other activity on the Hill recently, also designed to impact drug pricing, and we mentioned this on our last podcast, but there's been the Term Act, for example, which we discussed very briefly last time. This legislation is intended to combat what some have termed \"evergreening,\" which is the concept where drug companies obtain multiple patents on the same drug in order to extent patent protection and prevent generics from entering the market. Most notably, the Term Act would impose significant restrictions, but just on the biopharma industry - it would not touch other types of patents. In short, what the Term Act would do is flip the presumption of validity for many biopharma patents and force a disclaimer of those patents that would extend the monopoly beyond that first patent in time on a key drug.</p><p>We also mentioned earlier that drug pricing can be a bipartisan issue, and the We Paid Act is an example of that. It was introduced by Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Rick Scott of Florida, and would require companies that have received research funding from NIH and other agencies for drug-related patents to follow specific pricing restrictions for the drugs they are selling that are covered by those patents. The authors anticipate that 20% to 25% of drugs would be impacted after enactment, although this would not have retroactive effect for drugs currently on the market. And then there's also H.R. 3391, which is the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Through Improvements to Patent Litigation Act, which is quite a mouthful. That legislation would look to simplify the so-called patent dance for biosimilar patents created under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA. While the BPCIA was intended to create a streamlined assertion process, like what was done for Hatch-Waxman, many have found it to be ineffective and over complicated. Others, however, think that it's too early to tell.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: So a lot of people say that D.C. is very sleepy in the summer, but that's an awful lot of activity. On top of all that, we even saw an op-ed from the New York Times last month that called for the \"seizing of patents,\" by the federal government, through a couple of different methods. First, through an eminent domain-like statute, 28 U.S.C. 1498, which effectively allows the government, or anyone with the government's permission, to get a compulsory license at a rate of \"reasonable compensation.\" Some may recall that this provision was much discussed in the wake of the anthrax scares of the early-2000s, where many were worried about a shortage in the drug Cipro, or price gouging, that Cipro was made by Bayer, and the government used 1498 as leverage to get price concessions. The Times also in this op-ed called for the government to look at using so-called march-in rights, which is something the government has never done before. March-in rights, at a high-level, come into play where a federal government agency has provided the research funding that led to a patented invention, and they allow the funding agency either on its own initiative or at the request of a third party, to march-in, ignore the exclusivity of the patent owner, and grant additional licenses to other reasonable applicants. Here, conceivably, in the pharma context, that would be a low-cost generic.</p><p>Scott McKeown: And finally, as we discussed last episode, there's also an effort underway to redefine the law of patent subject matter eligibility - we have not seen that re-worked bill as of yet. Finally, last month, the Stronger Patents Act was reintroduced - this was a bill that's been introduced four or five times now to no effect. This may be more in the way of political theater to try to get big tech in line with the 101 effort, but that effort is playing out. But let me go back to you, Tom. I'll go back to you for the last word. Do you have any ultimate takeaways for us on the pricing issue?</p><p>Tom Bulleit: Well, probably the shortest takeaway is that almost nothing that's happened so far is likely to move the needle appreciably on drug prices or on drug out-of-pocket costs. The really big ideas that would be impactful, direct negotiation of federal health care programs with manufacturers, mandatory international reference pricing for all federal health care programs, are just unlikely to happen. There's no political support on the Republican side for direct negotiation, and precious little for international reference pricing. If the administration tries to impose international reference pricing by regulation, it'll get stuck in litigation, which I suspect will ultimately be successful in stopping it as outside CMS's demonstration authority, and small-scale demonstrations won't have any great effect. The PDPRA could have some impact, especially the increased rebates for price increases that exceed the rate of inflation, but that won't reduce prices, it'll just limit future price increases. The out-of-pocket maximum for a restructured Part B would help with what beneficiaries have to pay at the pharmacy, and that would be helpful to consumers.</p><p>Everything else, frankly, is little more than rearranging the furniture. Just a few examples:</p><p>The proposed rule to eliminate Part D rebates to plans and allow pass-through rebates to consumers would dramatically reorganize the drug supply chain to the disadvantage of pharmacy benefit managers, but there's no reason to think that it will lead to lower list prices. It might reduce out-of-pocket drug costs, but at the expense of higher premiums for those Part D plans. And there's no certainty that drug makers would seek to implement those pass-through rebates.</p><p>Step therapy and prior authorization will improve the ability of Part D plans to steer patients to lower-cost drugs, but as long as there are protected classes that must be covered, the effects are likely to be marginal.</p><p>Transparency of price increases and price shaming haven't shown any effect yet - I see no reason to think that they will.</p><p>In sum, the administration's creating a new environment where there will be lots of work for trade and professional associations, lobbyists, lawyers. Consumers might see some modest relief on point of sale cost sharing, though potentially at the expense of higher premiums. But substantially lowering drug prices, I wouldn't hold my breath.</p><p>Scott McKeown: So the saga continues. Thanks to you both for joining me, it'll certainly be interesting to see how this all shakes out in the fall and beyond. That's all the time we have for today's episode, and we hope that you're able to tune in on future episodes where we continue to discuss IP developments from the Washington D.C. perspective. So on behalf of Tom Bulleit, Matt Rizzolo, and Scott McKeown of Ropes &amp; Gray, thank you for listening.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Windy City: PTAB Pop Panel and Chevron Deference</p><p>Transcript:</p><p>Scott McKeown: Welcome to the IP(DC) podcast, a podcast covering recent D.C.-based developments in intellectual property law. I'm Scott McKeown, chair of Ropes &amp; Gray's Patent Trial and Appeal Board practice. And I'm joined, as always, by my partner, Matt Rizzolo, an IP litigator in Ropes &amp; Gray's IP litigation group, based here in D.C. We are joined today by Doug Hallward-Driemeier, head of the appellate and Supreme Court practice here at Ropes &amp; Gray. And to that end, we'll discuss the upcoming Supreme Court term as it relates to patent matters, what's going on at the Federal Circuit, and a bit of insight into ongoing legislative efforts in Congress to reform various matters, including 35 U.S.C. Section 101 - patent subject matter eligibility.</p><p>[00:49] Legislative Developments (or Lack Thereof)</p><p>So let me just kick things off with a bit of a discussion on the pending - well, it's not really pending legislation - but the effort to produce some pending legislation, especially since I boldly predicted that this legislation would be passed by the end of the year, which is very clear that that's not happening. So let me just give an update in terms of where that stands. As those that have listened to prior podcasts are well aware, this effort to reform subject matter eligibility started really around the holidays of 2018 with some closed-door sessions with various stakeholders. And then after that fact-finding was completed, we had a series of hearings back in June of 2019 with some 40+ witnesses that came before the Senate Judiciary Committee, including the former Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit, Paul Michel, two past directors of the Patent and Trademark Office, varies members of the biopharma community and law professors, all of which were throwing up their hands, saying patent subject matter eligibility determinations have become a complete crap shoot. Even Judge Michel saying he would be hard-pressed to make any sense of the current case law that's out there on 101. So there was all of this momentum in the June time frame. We had the senators running the hearing, Senators Tillis and Coons, promising us a draft bill within four weeks, right after the Fourth of July. In the interim, we had a decision come out of the Federal Circuit which basically echoed Judge Michel's comments that even they were sort of at their wits' end, trying to make heads or tails of the case law under 35 U.S.C. 101.</p><p>So there was a ton of momentum. It seemed as though the stage was set, so to speak, for this legislation to be passed relatively quickly. You have bipartisan support. You had it in the House and Senate. But then the wheels came off and it seems as though that has a lot to do with a last-minute provision that was added to the framework, that was sort of floated out there, on perhaps as we are under the hood tinkering with 35 U.S.C. 101, we would also make this change to 35 U.S.C. 112F, which is the statute that speaks to functional claiming. I think, or at least what I've been told, is that was added as perhaps a way to build consensus on the tech side, which with the idea that if we are taking what is now at least a very effective way to get out of a lawsuit relatively quickly with a summary determination under 101, if we are taking that away from tech, perhaps to get them on board with this legislation, we can throw them a bone, so to speak, of tamping down on functional claiming. But when that was put into the draft, it doesn't seem like it's moved tech at all - it seems like it's scared biopharma. Judge Michel wrote a letter to the drafters sort of arguing that this would impact every patent, and every patent would be construed a bit more narrowly. So the wheels started to come off there. There have been, since, some additional meetings with stakeholders. There's also been a judiciary hearing on a different bill, the STRONGER Patents Act, which to me is somewhat of a distraction - a little bit of political theatre perhaps trying to scare big tech into coming to the table with a, \"Hey, we could do much worse things to you. Take a look at the STRONGER Patents Act that's been languishing four or five years.\" I don't know if that's a serious threat, but that's kind of where we are right now with the effort. There's been a promise of a bill in October. Of course, again, we were promised a bill in July. So it's definitely off the fast track. And with things like the STRONGER Patents Act being rolled out, perhaps for leverage, it seems like folks are digging in for a little bit more of a long-fought process here. So that legislative effort I think will ultimately bear fruit, but it seems like there's a lot longer road ahead of us.</p><p>With so much focus over the past couple months being on the legislative effort, many of us, at least speaking for myself, have been a bit distracted as to what has been going on at the Supreme Court in terms of potentially stepping in and providing some clarity on the question of 101 jurisprudence. Doug, maybe you can comment a little bit on the petitions that are pending, what they're proposing, and what they may be able to do here, perhaps before Congress gets to the issue?</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: Thanks, Scott. I guess, first, I'll offer that I would've loved to have been one of those 40 people testifying about the application of 101 and how difficult that is, because certainly, as an advocate who's argued either side in many cases, you can see that there's precedent involving even a very similar technology that comes out opposite directions. And you know, I don't want to say that that's just panel dependent, but I think it illustrates the difficulty that the Federal Circuit is having in their desire for greater instruction, whether that instruction comes, as you suggest, maybe from Congress or from the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court has indicated some continuing interest in 101 issues. It's recently asked for the views of the solicitor general on two petitions for cert involving section 101. Although, I don't know that those two cases at least offer the ability to give the complete guidance that the parties or Federal Circuit might want.</p><p>[back to top]</p><p>Supreme Court Preview</p><p>[06:58] Berkheimer and Hikma: Section 101 Cert Petitions</p><p>Why don't we start with the Berkheimer petition in which the Court has asked for the solicitor general's views. That doesn't really involve the scope of 101, but rather the process by which 101 issues are decided. The issue presented is whether patent eligibility is a question of law to be decided by the court on the basis of the scope of the claims, or a question of fact for the jury, based on the state of the art at the time of the patent. That's, of course, a critically important issue for the parties to the extent that that is a question of fact that's going to be decided by the jury, or even by the court on summary judgment motions - it means that it's going to be pushed much farther back in the process. And so the pressure on the defendant to settle early is going to be greater. The likelihood of their getting out of the case early on, on a 101 motion, as happened in many instances shortly after some of the Supreme Court's precedential decisions there is going to be significantly diminished. So I think that that is an important question of great practical significance, even if it is not going to resolve one way or the other who wins those questions.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: And I point out that we are actually already seeing that type of thing play out in district courts. Just this past week in the Eastern District of Texas, there was a case, PPS Data v. Jack Henry &amp; Associates, where Judge Gilstrap sent the question of 101, or at least the second step of the Alice test, to the jury. And the jury found in that case that the claims at issue were invalid under 101. The question of whether the claims were well understood, routine or conventional at the time, was specifically sent to the jury. So I'm sure we'll see more of that as we go on, but we'll see what the Supreme Court comes up with.</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: It's an interesting question for practitioners, right? I think many have felt that the jury in the Eastern District of Texas was a very plaintiff-friendly place to litigate. But query whether that question as posed to the jury, which may be a little more susceptible to some hindsight thinking, is actually a forum that could ultimately favor defendants. Of course, we'll have to see because there aren't a lot of, you know, instances where juries have been asked that question, so I don't think we can generalize from one verdict, but it's an interesting question.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: So you mentioned that there were a couple of cases at the Supreme Court on 101. What's the other one?</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: So the other is the Hikma v. Vanda case, which is one that comes out of the life sciences area. There, the question presented is \"whether patents that claim a method of medically treating a patient automatically satisfies Section 101 of the Patent Act, even though they apply a natural law using only routine and conventional steps.\" Now, there, I'm quoting from the question presented. You know, notably, on the question presented page of the response brief, the opposition brief, Vanda says that question simply isn't presented here because that's not what the Federal Circuit did. But it does, obviously, tee up a question for how the Mayo standard is applied to patents that claim a method of treatment, not diagnosis.</p><p>[back to top]</p><p>[10:55] Click-to-Call: Reviewability of PTAB Time-Bar Decisions</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: As far as merits cases, there are a couple on the Supreme Court's docket for this term that concern patents. That's right?</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: Yes, there are two patent cases on which the Court has already granted cert. One of those comes out of the AIA and the IPR system that was set up with the PTAB, and it really is a question that follows from the Cuozzo decision a couple of years ago. In the AIA, Congress specified that the determination to institute by the director is not subject to review on appeal. And of course, courts being courts don't like to see their ability to exercise judicial review curtailed, and the Federal Circuit has taken a very narrow view of that. In the Cuozzo decision a couple years ago, the Supreme Court said, \"No, Congress meant that, at least with respect to that determination in 314(a) of whether there's a reasonable likelihood that the Board would find that the patent was invalid, and other closely related questions.\" Pretty much immediately after that, the Federal Circuit said, \"Well, closely related questions is really that question in 314(a), and virtually every other question is one that they think goes to the PTAB's jurisdiction, and therefore is subject to review on appeal.\"</p><p>The issue in the Click-to-Call case on which the Court has granted cert is whether the time bar in 315(b), which says that an IPR cannot be instituted if the petition is filed more than a year after the petitioner has been served with a complaint on that patent, is a determination as part of the institution decision that is subject to appellate review when the final written decision issues and ultimately comes up to the Federal Circuit. And you know, interestingly, the substance of that issue is not before the Court. In fact, on the substance, the Board itself has gone both directions here - has reversed itself. The Supreme Court said, \"We don't want to look at that, but we do want to look at that question of what issues are open to the Federal Circuit to review on appeal from the final written decision, even though they're really part of that initial decision, whether or not to institute.\"</p><p>One thing I found fascinating in this is that there's an amicus brief filed by the PTAB Bar Association that says, \"Look, we've got members who have all kinds of interests here, but what we want to make sure is that the Court understands that this issue isn't just related to 315(b) and the facts of this case, which involve a complaint that was filed and then voluntarily withdrawn under Rule 41(a) - does that count as service or not?\" This issue comes up in all kinds of permutations, and they only talk about the permutations in IPR. Of course, one of the big questions that the Federal Circuit has asserted authority to review is whether a patent is a covered business method patent, which is part of the decision to institute in a CBM. So I think that amicus is actually very helpful to the Court, to see the full breadth of how its decision might impact proceedings and what the Federal Circuit is going to be looking at.</p><p>Scott McKeown: I would agree, and I think that amicus in particular was written to the conservative end of the Court to say, \"Hey, just so you know, you would be giving this agency final word on all of these other things that you may not be thinking about, so if your concern here is the expansion of administrative power, then perhaps you need to consider the big picture here.\" Because it is interesting that, I think ultimately, what the Court... I mean, who knows why/what they found interesting, but it seems part of it was, \"Well, we sort of left it open a little bit in Cuozzo when we used this word, 'shenanigans' and we didn't tell you exactly what was appealable and what wasn't, and then maybe in the Sass decision we said something slightly different.\" And since then, the Federal Circuit has sort of opened the door to a number of things, so maybe that was part of the interest in sort of clarifying some things that were going on. But you know, secondarily, I think that the amicus filing is a good way to let the Court know that there's a lot more going on here.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: Doug, having worked in the SG's office, what do you make of the government's apparent about-face in this case? The government originally came in and said, \"Cert should be denied,\" but then at the merit stage, the government supported the petitioner.</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: Well, those are two very distinct questions: One, whether they want the Supreme Court to get involved; but secondly, if the Court is going to be deciding, you know, how do they want the Court to decide this. I think probably one of the things that went into the recommendation against taking cert was the fact that on the underlying substantive question about how 315(b) applied to the situations of a voluntary dismissal, the Board was in the process of changing its views, and they probably didn't think that was a great context in which to have the Court looking at these issues. But now that it is focused on the question of appellate jurisdiction, you know, then the SG wants to make sure they get it right. Of course, the SG's views on that don't always align perfectly with those of the PTO. But here, I think they do because the solicitor general is saying to the Supreme Court, \"Congress meant what it said in 314 when it said that this institution decision is just part of starting a process. And it's supposed to be a process that's efficient. And it's the height of inefficiency to go through a process in which the administrative agency that first issued the patent has gone back and looked at it more carefully, now with three heads rather than with one, with the benefit of presentation of argument on the other side, and it's concluded, as here, that a patent is invalid. Note that the decision on the merits that the patent is invalid is no longer subject to debate. And now, the argument is that we're going to have to throw all of that out and now we're going to go back to presuming this patent is valid, and the clear and convincing evidence that would apply in district court.\" And I think the solicitor general is standing up for the PTO and saying, \"Look, once we've done all of that work, let's not set it aside when Congress has said, 'Look, that's just about the beginning. You, Federal Circuit, focus on the merits in the final written decision.'\"</p><p>[back to top]</p><p>[18:32] NantKwest: PTO Attorneys' Fees</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: So Click-to-Call will be argued December 9th and it'll be worth keeping an eye on. I'm sure a lot of the eyes of PTAB practitioners around the country will be on the Supreme Court that day. Doug, what else is on the Supreme Court's docket for this term regarding patent cases?</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: There is another case involving patents that the Court did grant review in, although, I would forgive most of our listeners if it has slipped their notice because it involves a pretty arcane issue - it's called Peter v. NantKwest. And the issue involved is whether when a patent applicant has been unsuccessful - of course, they have the ability to take review of that up through the administrative process, ultimately the Federal Circuit and direct appeal, or they can file an action in district court under 35 U.S.C. 145 in which they have the ability to develop a factual record that might be different from the one that was before the patent examiner. But one of the counterweights to that is that Section 145 says that the applicant has to pay the expenses of that proceeding. So the issue here presented to the Supreme Court is whether the expenses include the cost of the employees at the PTO that were involved in litigating and defending the examiner's decision. And the government is arguing that that is clearly an expense of the process, and Congress has said that the PTO should not bear that cost - it should be the patent applicant who forced the government to incur it. Whereas, pretty uniformly, the rest of the patent environment, including here the ABA, which doesn't usually weigh in in the Supreme Court on patent issues because it has members that are kind of on both sides of that, said \"No, here Congress is writing against the backdrop of the American rule on fee shifting, and that Congress has to speak very clearly when attorneys' fees are going to be shifted to the other party. And here, the reference to expenses is not one that one would expect includes effectively the attorneys' fees of the other side.\"</p><p>Scott McKeown: I would just add before we move on that that aspect of 145 is no longer a possibility - that was legislated away. So for the patents that are being filed now, applicants would not be able to go to the district court. And I suspect the reason that the government has decided to go this route, in terms of asking for expenses, is this is a terrible drain on the solicitor's office when these cases go into district court and there's discovery. So I think it's a little bit of an effort to, at least for those patents or applications, I should say that are still eligible for this, just so you know, everyone out there in the public, you may end up footing the bill. So that's what this is really about, and so it's an interesting debate from an academic perspective. But I think in terms of practice, no matter which way this goes, there's only a small pool of applicants that would still be able to take advantage of it.</p><p>[back to top]</p><p>[22:09] Regents of University of Minnesota: Sovereign Immunity Cert Petition</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: And that case will be argued October 7th. And before we move on from the Supreme Court to the Federal Circuit, I want to note an interesting issue at the intersection of sovereign immunity and patents. As some of you listening may recall, there have been a number of instances of patent owners raising sovereign immunity as a defense to IPR proceedings at the PTAB, and unsuccessfully raising that defense. There was a case involving the St. Regis Mohawk tribe and that case percolated through the Federal Circuit up to the Supreme Court. Cert was denied earlier this year and the courts had found that sovereign immunity could not be asserted, based on tribal immunity. Well, the cert petition that was filed this past week was filed by the University of Minnesota, which had asserted sovereign immunity based on state sovereign immunity. And that is an issue that has been raised multiple times by not just the University of Minnesota but others, including the University of Maryland, at the PTAB. The rulings on this issue have differed in their reasoning at the PTAB and at the Federal Circuit. But the Federal Circuit ultimately found, earlier this year, that sovereign immunity based on state sovereign immunity does not apply to PTAB proceedings, relying heavily on the tribal immunity rulings that it had previously issued. So that's something to keep an eye out for as the Supreme Court term rolls on. I am sure that there'll be amicus briefs and other briefings filed.</p><p>Scott McKeown: Before we move on from sovereign immunity, Doug, let me ask you this question: Given the Supreme Court has already denied cert to the tribes, what is it that may catch their attention with this state-based cert? Because at least at the Federal Circuit, when the states came up after the tribal argument, the question posed to them is, \"Well, why would we decide this differently.\" It seems like this is the same issue for both entities.</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: Well, of course, it's possible that it won't get any more traction, but I think it is fair to say that the Supreme Court does take petitions by state solicitors general very seriously. It's also probably true that state universities are some of the most active participants in the patent system, and so they may see this as just having a more significant impact on the patent system, generally. I guess what I would note is that if the state's assertion of sovereign immunity from the PTAB were to be upheld, then I do imagine that we would see the tribes coming back to the Federal Circuit and saying that they, likewise, would benefit from that ruling by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: I think it also could pose an interesting issue for the U.S. government as they consider any sort of response to the cert petition, given that we've seen just in the last month or so some IPR petitions filed against patents owned by the U.S. government. And you could certainly see some sovereign immunity issues potentially coming into play there as well.</p><p>[back to top]</p><p>Federal Circuit Update</p><p>[25:33] AVX / General Electric: PTAB and Competitor Appellate Standing</p><p>So why don't we move on to some of the issues that are percolating at the Federal Circuit, some of the rulings that have come out over the last few months? Scott, as a PTAB practitioner, I'm sure you have a lot of interest in the several rulings that have come out regarding whether unsuccessful petitioners are able to appeal adverse file written decisions to the Federal Circuit. Do you want to talk a little bit about some of those?</p><p>Scott McKeown: Sure. So what we're talking about here is, once through the PTAB, because anyone can file a petition at the PTAB - there's no Article III standing or anything akin to Article III standing, it's just a statutory right - but once you get through the administrative trial and then, as an appellant, you're trying to get before the Federal Circuit, what we've seen a lot of interest in from the Federal Circuit as of late is, \"Well, where is your standing for these disputes that are not the traditional alternative to litigation?\" Where perhaps someone is trying to clear the landscape, so to speak, before they go into a certain technology field, they're aware of some patents, or perhaps they've filed some petitions because their customers are being targeted in infringement suits, the question becomes, \"Well, petitioner, whether you're a supplier or whether you're just concerned about some patents that are out there, where is your Article III standing?\" And so a lot of appellants have struggled with this - this is an issue that has come up for the first time on appeal. We have declarations being submitted that weren't before the Board, so you almost have the Federal Circuit sort of acting as a fact finder in the first instance on these questions. And a number of appellants have found if they don't have the equivalent of DJ standing, for example, that their appeal is dismissed. And so there's been a couple cases recently where there's been another twist to that fact pattern where this competitor standing concept has been brought up, this argument that the government has given a right to a competitor and this right was improvidently granted, and therefore there is some harm that flows from that. And the first case was the AVX v. Presidio case, and Matt, I don't know if you have any insights into what particularly went on there?</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: Sure. So this is a case that came down on May 13th. And as you mentioned, these are two companies that are competitors to each other, and that really is something that's a little bit different than a lot of the traditional fact patterns that arose in the context of these cases. We saw a lot of the entities that had challenging patents as part of their business, I think RPX or Unified Patents, for example, where that could come into play. And in fact, we've actually seen this issue go all the way to cert petitions at the Supreme Court. There was one involving RPX, in fact, where cert was denied earlier this year. And then stepping back to AVX, I mean, there were a couple of issues that were raised and ultimately rejected by the Federal Circuit. I mean, one of them was that if the petitioner was unsuccessful in a final written decision, as it was here, the estoppel provisions would kick in, so in the future that petitioner would be estopped from challenging that patent in a future proceeding. And here, AVX said, \"We are injured as a result of this estoppel provision.\" And the Federal Circuit rejected that, and there were a couple of interesting things here. First of all, they said that estoppel doesn't necessarily create an injury in fact. But even setting that aside, the Federal Circuit said that, \"Under these facts, where you can't actually seek an appeal of a final written decision, there isn't any holding from the Federal Circuit that that statutory estoppel would apply in the future.\" So that's something that will be interesting to see how it plays out.</p><p>Scott McKeown: I found that particular line of argument a little bit confusing because, at least as the statute is written and certainly - and I'm talking about the estoppel statute and how it was previously written under inter partes reexamination - estoppel was specifically modified in the AIA to apply at the time of the final written decision. So the estoppel attaches at the time of the final written decision and there's nothing in the statute that states that that would be subject to appeal. Obviously it would be if it's reversed, but with that legislative history of changing it from the previous form of the statute and reexamination to moving the estoppel up, so to speak, at the time of the final written decision, I think you'd be hard pressed to argue that somehow the estoppel doesn't attach because you weren't able to appeal.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: Yes, the Court there was looking toward whether the statutory estoppel incorporated traditional principles of collateral estoppel. So we'll see how that eventually plays out in future cases, I suppose. One other argument that was raised in the AVX case was whether AVX had plans or was currently engaging in activity that could arguably be covered by the patents. And here, the Federal Circuit said, \"No, there was evidence that AVX had at least non-speculative plans to engage in conduct covered by the patent, so therefore, no Article III standing for the appeal.\" I note that there was no en banc petition filed in this case, so that was that as far as the AVX case goes.</p><p>But there was another case more recently. The opinion was in early July and there actually has been an en banc petition filed. And this is the General Electric v. United Technologies case. Very similar fact pattern as AVX. A couple of competitors in the airplane engine space. And in this case, just as in AVX, there was no evidence that GE practiced or, in fact, intended to practice the patent at issue. What GE claimed was that it had economic harm because it was forced to design around the patent that it was challenging, and that, it claimed, was enough to constitute an injury in fact that would give it standing to appeal. The Federal Circuit rejected that - they said, \"Broad claims of economic losses stemming from efforts to design around a patent is not enough. You need to actually have concrete non-speculative plans to create a product that would potentially be infringing.\" One thing that's interesting about the GE case is that Judge Hughes penned a concurrence where he agreed with the result under the precedent, but said, \"Look, the precedent here is too rigid. These competitor standing cases, we need some further guidance from the Supreme Court potentially.\"</p><p>Scott McKeown: I thought Judge Hughes's concurrence was especially compelling because it sort of pointed to a problem that the Federal Circuit seems to have when it deals with matters of administrative law or agency law and focusing too much on, \"Well, we're the patent court. We're the patent experts. We see things a little bit differently.\" And they don't always appear to credit what's going on at other agencies. And I think Judge Hughes really laid that out that, \"Look, you're looking for specific standing here that's particular to patents. Nobody else does that.\" And the facts here, I think, for GE are pretty compelling when you talk about billion dollar markets with 20-year development cycles for some of these engines. You can't expect a company that's in that space to go into some new engine or new technology without addressing the patent issues. So when I saw that concurrence, I was encouraged that this would go to en banc, and it seems to me that the facts are here to really push back on what the majority did here and really looking at this as being a patent-specific type of standing. And there's also administrative law out there with respect to standing that basically states that, \"Well, the Article III standing is a bit more attenuated when you're coming out of an agency.\" And I've never seen the Federal Circuit really tackle that either, so this will be an interesting dispute to watch going forward.</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: I think Judge Hughes's concurring opinion is almost written for the Supreme Court. We know that the Supreme Court has really reacted not well to what it perceives as kind of patent exceptionalism at the Federal Circuit, where for a while the Court seemed to think that the general rules of practice or, you know, such as whether the standard for reviewing facts and the like applied equally in the patent context as other contexts. And so I think Judge Hughes is really keying in on a theme that will have some resonance with the Supreme Court if it gets there.</p><p>[back to top]</p><p>[35:27] Papst Licensing and Collateral Estoppel Developments</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: One of the other issues that we've seen pop up a lot at the Federal Circuit over the last few months is the issue of collateral estoppel, both as to district court proceedings and IPR proceedings. And Doug, I know you were involved in a case where that was a major issue. Do you want to speak a bit about that?</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: Yes. Earlier this year, in May, the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Papst Licensing v. Samsung. This was one of a number of co-pending appeals from a series of IPR proceedings that had challenged several patents in a family with overlapping claims on the basis of several different combinations of prior art. And Papst had lost pretty much across the board in these IPR proceedings, or at least there had been sufficient prior art found to render obvious each of the claims even though the petitioners hadn't been successful on all of their prior art. And Papst had filed appeals from all of these, but then, on the eve of argument, it dismissed several of the appeals. And immediately following that, there was a flurry of briefing about the collateral estoppel effects of those dismissals because really due to the overlapping nature of the patents, the Board's construction of claims in those cases and its reading of how the prior art read on those claims or those limitations, really also applied to the appeals that Papst was trying to continue to pursue. And we represented another party in one of these appeals, along with Samsung, briefs explaining that Papst simply could not succeed on its appeals in light of the subsidiary findings in those other IPR proceedings that had now become final in light of the dismissal of the appeals, and there was no chance that they would be reversed by the Federal Circuit. And the Federal Circuit agreed with us and held in favor of Samsung on the alternative, because they also found for Samsung on the merits. But an alternative basis for that holding was that the Board's decision and subsidiary findings in terms of what the prior art taught and that it taught those limitations was binding, and that in light of that, Papst just simply couldn't succeed in its appeals. And I think that this is going to have some really significant practical impact on these. You know, in many instances, we see series of IPRs being filed by co-defendants in these massive litigations, and it may lead the patent owner to proceed with all of their appeals. Certainly, people need to be thinking about the collateral consequences if they're not going to proceed to appeal from an adverse ruling at the PTAB.</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: And it seems to me that this also has a significant effect on parties who might be asserting related patents or patent families where there are overlapping claim limitations. I mean, am I correct that in the Papst case, some of those IPRs, they weren't necessarily the same patents, right? There were just similar limitations?</p><p>Doug Hallward-Driemeier: I think that it was significant that in that case the specification was identical across these patents, and therefore there was really very little argument that Papst could make that the limitations meant different things in the different patents.</p><p>Scott McKeown: We've also seen interest in collateral estoppel on the district court side when a couple of claims survive the PTAB process, but then when you get back to district court it looks like it's a feature that was embedded in another claim that had been cancelled. And there was at least one case with Intellectual Ventures where a dependent claim had survived. The district court looked at the art in some of the statements that went into the PTAB fact finding as to that particular feature, and under that Ohio Willow Wood case basically said, \"You know, this claim is effectively dead as well.\"</p><p>Matt Rizzolo: So I will say one caveat on the collateral estoppel front, you mentioned parties might proceed to appeal with all of a bunch of different IPRs. There was a case from the Federal Circuit recently, the Power Integrations v. ON Semiconductor case, where the Federal Circuit did not apply collateral estoppel in part because it found that there the patent owner did not have a sufficient incentive to appeal one IPR finding. And I believe in that case it was because that patent that had been challenged was found to be not infringed in the underlying district court litigation anyway, so there was no real incentive for them to do so. So there are sometimes outs in that collateral estoppel analysis.</p><p>[back to top]</p><p>[41:21] Facebook v. Windy City: PTAB Pop Panel and Chevron Deference</p><p>Before we wrap up, I know there was an interesting brief filed in a pending Federal Circuit case this week by the PTO. Scott, you want to take a shot at that?</p><p>Scott McKeown: Sure. That's Facebook v. Windy City, which was a question about statutory interpretation on issue joinder, in other words, the idea of a party filing a petition and for one reason or another, realizing that they need to add a claim and the case has already been instituted - maybe they're outside of their one-year window; they can't file a second petition. So under 315(c), they would file a motion to join their own proceeding to join this issue. And it's been debated back and forth at the PTAB for years. This issue was the cause of the stacking of panels years ago to try to get some kind of consistency on this question. And at oral argument, the government had not participated in this appeal and it seemed as though the panel at the Federal Circuit was not in favor of this interpretation. And they have since asked for the views of the PTO, and that brief was filed two days ago. And the question posed to the PTO was, \"Well, it looks like you've got this precedential opinion that came out of this new precedential opinion panel on this question. What should we do with it? Should we give it Chevron deference? You know, where does it fall in terms of authority relative to the Federal Circuit?\" And I think ultimately, at least given the back and forth from the earlier argument, I think the Federal Circuit probably just finds that the statute is clear on its face and they don't necessarily need to even reach how much deference to give this decision. But that's not to say that others on the Court, particularly Judge Moore, I think have looked at this question before in the Aqua Products decision and found that the substantive rulemaking authority that was given to the Board, or I should say, the PTO under the AIA, was for regulations only. And that making, or I should say, providing guidance through adjudication, was a little bit different than the power that was conveyed to the agency. And perhaps without the traditional notice and comment rulemaking, it shouldn't be given deference. But I think at a high level, the issue will be dodged given that the statute will be determined to be clear. But the government is very interested in protecting this new concept, this new precedential opinion panel. I think my view of that brief is that they are correct that you should be able to get some deference from those decisions, but it may depend upon the issue that's addressed in those decisions. Is it a major issue? Is it a small gap? There seems to be some discussion in other agency decisions about perhaps that being a meaningful distinction. So we'll have to wait and see, but at a high level I think issue joinder will be shot down at the PTAB, but there's an interesting footnote in the solicitor's brief that perhaps you might be able to accomplish the same thing under the supplemental information rule. So as a practitioner, I'm more interested in that, but we'll look to see if there's any concurrence or dissents that discuss the Chevron deference given the precedential opinion panel's decisions on this point.</p><p>So with that, we've been going a while. Thanks to our listeners for sticking with us. We'll wrap up here and look forward to speaking with you on the next edition. So I want to thank Doug Hallward-Driemeier for joining us today. And as always, Matt and I will talk to you on the next one. Thank you.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

As societies continue to reshape themselves into digital economies, there has been a surge in the dependence of individuals, organizations, and governments on digital infrastructure. Whilst cyberspace has profoundly altered human life, and presented significant new opportunities, it has also blurred the lines between digital and 'tangible' citizenships of individuals, consequently leading to states legislating on issues pertaining to cyberspace law, such as, but not limited to, intellectual property, cybercrimes, fraud, identity theft, e-commerce, freedom of expression, and privacy concerns.</p><p>The ubiquitous and decentralized nature of the internet has led to issues in areas of policing free speech, hate speech, and privacy intrusions for governments, leaving governments and judiciaries to carry out a balancing act among citizens' digital rights. The aforementioned factors dictating the practice of cyberspace law have had a profound effect on enforcing political boundaries on the users of ICTs. Government cyberspace regulators have moved to establish safeguards to curtail cybercrime. This has given flexibility to states to exercise confidentiality over their affairs, while also preserving a great deal of freedom to information, a provision that ought to be provided to citizens of democracies and high-ranking countries on the Human Development Index (HDI). </p><p>The following article will seek to elucidate the complicated relationship that exists between nations, their citizens, and non-state actors (particularly, commercial parties), and the legal and political issues pertaining to this tri-partite association with regards to cyberspace.</p><p>State Sovereignty &amp; Confidentiality in Cyberspace</p><p>Although sovereignty over cyberspace may seem to be a vague concept and given the open nature of cyberspace today, states still exercise a great deal of privacy and caution while operating with large amounts of confidential data over the internet due to the omnipresent threats from non-state actors (hacktivist groups) and other nations. This has often come into clash with the states' citizens own rights and desire for transparency with regards to government dealings. The aforementioned provision has been realized in many forms across democracies. Notable examples of the same include the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 1967 within the United States of America (USA), which entails the partial disclosure of information (upon request) from agencies of the USA Federal Government, unless the said request contradicts interests such as law enforcement, personal privacy, and/or national security, and the Right to Information Act (RTI) 2005, which empowers any citizen of India to request information from a 'public authority'.</p><p>Such pieces of legislation were conceived at a time when ICTs were not commonplace and/or accessible to a large proportion of the population.</p><p>A landmark case about the FOIA 1967 was the case of Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press [489 U.S. 749.1988], which was ruled at the US Supreme Court. At the Court of First Instance, it pertained to a request from a group of journalists, who sought that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Justice (DOJ) (agencies of Federal Government) release criminal records of four brothers who had entered into dealings concerning defense contracts with a corrupt Congressman. The DOJ withheld the criminal records of three of the brothers, and only released the records of one, who was deceased at the time. At the Supreme Court, it was held unanimously by the judges that under Exemption 7 (c) of the FOIA 1967, which states that the information held by the federal agencies did not reveal anything 'how' the government operates, the agencies in question were not obliged to disclose that information. Thus, this case set a precedent, that in the event a reporter requests information under the FOIA 1967 that does not seek to reveal any information concerning governmental activities, it does not constitute 'public interest', and rather is thus only pertaining to 'private matters'. This is an excellent case which throws light on the balancing exercise needed between public interest, the confidentiality of the state's dealings, and privacy intrusion.</p><p>However, from a legal perspective, it is important to note that such legislation will need to evolve to encompass cyberspace. Taking an example from the FOIA 1967, it was reported that one in six individuals is unable to access their desired public information via the act. The quality of the search results and requests under this act have also been put into question, with questions being raised by inquirers about the integrity of the results being provided.

Governments are tasked with keeping up with rapid advancements in technology, whilst simultaneously balancing the competing interests of privacy and freedom. </p><p>Commercial Parties and Political Influence in Cyberspace</p><p>A great deal of influence today is exercised by commercial parties in cyberspace. Recently, a lawsuit was filed against Google at the US District Court in California by 2020 US Presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard, who claims that her Google Ads account was temporarily suspended intentionally, at a time right after the Democratic Party's debate in June 2019, particularly at a time when her campaign experienced a spike in search interest online. The claimant in the suit Tulsi Now, Inc. v. Google, LLC [Case number 2:19-cv-06444, California] filed complaints about, inter alia, violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the USA, and is claiming damages of USD 50 million.</p><p>Nonetheless, a more worrying issue is that of competition law and privacy intrusions on the part of commercial parties over ICTs. In July 2019, the US DOJ launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into the big tech companies, off the back of years of claims of monopolization, and compromising users' privacy on cyberspace. The claims pertaining to the monopolization of the market have reached such an extent, that the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has dabbled with the notion of splitting up the big tech companies.</p><p>From a legal perspective, the collection action lawsuit of Richard Lloyd v Google, LLC [(2019) EWCA Civ 1599. Case No: HQ17M01913] at the England and Wales High Court (EWHC) in the year 2018 reiterated the scope of technology companies. The claimant, Richard Lloyd, applied for a request to serve proceedings to Google LLC (based in California, USA) from England, which was obviously out of the jurisdiction of the respondent. The claimant had asserted that section 4(4) of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA 1998) (an act of Parliament in the United Kingdom) (supplanted by the Data Protection Act 2018, which complements the EU's landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018) was being violated by Google LLC by means of sale of browser-generated information of iPhone users to advertisement organizations. Such information was thought to have included sensitive data, such as, but not limited to, the user's political views, geographical location, and financial condition. Being a collective action suit, the claimant had also sought to represent other individuals who were affected by this in England &amp; Wales.</p><p>The application was refused by the presiding judge on the basis of the outcome of three legal tests:</p><p> the question of England being the appropriable jurisdiction for the claim, which was ruled to be apt, but the judge saw no reason as to why the claims were to be brought to the USA;the question of the jurisdictional gateway that was sought for recourse, and the claimant had relied upon the notion in tort that the damage sustained, and the acts committed to creating the damage were exclusively within the same jurisdiction, to which the judge had stated the court could see no \"damage\" to the right of autonomy to the claimant through the non-consensual use of personal data by Google LLC; andthe question of the feasibility of the prospect of success the collective class, to which the court had ruled that the consequences of the actions of respondent were not uniform across the entire class, and that even if the class were hypothetically defined, several insurmountable practical challenges would arise from the same.</p><p>The results from the tests above rendered the case shut, thus establishing the supremacy of cyberspace operators in late 2018, before their unforeseen antitrust probe in 2019. This case truly highlights the hollow nature of privacy safeguards against exploitation from cyberspace operators in a leading jurisdiction of the world, prior to the enactment of GDPR in 2018. However, still in many jurisdictions today, it is the commercial parties who dictate the political narrative, both on a macro as well as the micro scale.</p><p>Partisan Politics by States in Cyberspace</p><p>Perhaps the most recurrent acts of partisan politics on cyberspace are carried out by states (instead of the heads of states) themselves. Passive means of doing so include creating obstacles to access to cyberspace and ICT infrastructure, and/or placing restrictions on certain types of content that may be accessed over the internet. Active means, however, entail the direct violations of the rights of users and include acts of surveillance, invasion of privacy, the carrying out of consequential repercussions for online activities by means such as, but not limited, to censorship, imprisonment, and harassment. </p><p>In conclusion, as cyberspace continues to reshape the boundaries of political activity across the world, it is the legal sphere which serves as a deterrent to ensure the mutual exclusivity of partisan politics and civil liberty within cyberspace.       </p><p>As Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) continue to suffuse through every aspect of human life in the twenty-first century, they have skewed the perceptions of citizens, and the outlook of jurisdictions worldwide. As societies continue to reshape themselves into digital economies, there has been a surge in the dependence of individuals, organizations, and governments on digital infrastructure. Whilst cyberspace has profoundly altered human life, and presented significant new opportunities, it has also blurred the lines between digital and 'tangible' citizenships of individuals, consequently leading to states legislating on issues pertaining to cyberspace law, such as, but not limited to, intellectual property, cybercrimes, fraud, identity theft, e-commerce, freedom of expression, and privacy concerns.</p><p>The ubiquitous and decentralized nature of the internet has led to issues in areas of policing free speech, hate speech, and privacy intrusions for governments, leaving governments and judiciaries to carry out a balancing act among citizens' digital rights. The aforementioned factors dictating the practice of cyberspace law have had a profound effect on enforcing political boundaries on the users of ICTs. Government cyberspace regulators have moved to establish safeguards to curtail cybercrime. This has given flexibility to states to exercise confidentiality over their affairs, while also preserving a great deal of freedom to information, a provision that ought to be provided to citizens of democracies and high-ranking countries on the Human Development Index (HDI). </p><p>The following article will seek to elucidate the complicated relationship that exists between nations, their citizens, and non-state actors (particularly, commercial parties), and the legal and political issues pertaining to this tri-partite association with regards to cyberspace.</p><p>State Sovereignty &amp; Confidentiality in Cyberspace</p><p>Although sovereignty over cyberspace may seem to be a vague concept and given the open nature of cyberspace today, states still exercise a great deal of privacy and caution while operating with large amounts of confidential data over the internet due to the omnipresent threats from non-state actors (hacktivist groups) and other nations. This has often come into clash with the states' citizens own rights and desire for transparency with regards to government dealings. The aforementioned provision has been realized in many forms across democracies. Notable examples of the same include the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 1967 within the United States of America (USA), which entails the partial disclosure of information (upon request) from agencies of the USA Federal Government, unless the said request contradicts interests such as law enforcement, personal privacy, and/or national security, and the Right to Information Act (RTI) 2005, which empowers any citizen of India to request information from a 'public authority'.</p><p>Such pieces of legislation were conceived at a time when ICTs were not commonplace and/or accessible to a large proportion of the population.</p><p>A landmark case about the FOIA 1967 was the case of Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press [489 U.S. 749.1988], which was ruled at the US Supreme Court. At the Court of First Instance, it pertained to a request from a group of journalists, who sought that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Justice (DOJ) (agencies of Federal Government) release criminal records of four brothers who had entered into dealings concerning defense contracts with a corrupt Congressman. The DOJ withheld the criminal records of three of the brothers, and only released the records of one, who was deceased at the time. At the Supreme Court, it was held unanimously by the judges that under Exemption 7 (c) of the FOIA 1967, which states that the information held by the federal agencies did not reveal anything 'how' the government operates, the agencies in question were not obliged to disclose that information. Thus, this case set a precedent, that in the event a reporter requests information under the FOIA 1967 that does not seek to reveal any information concerning governmental activities, it does not constitute 'public interest', and rather is thus only pertaining to 'private matters'. This is an excellent case which throws light on the balancing exercise needed between public interest, the confidentiality of the state's dealings, and privacy intrusion.</p><p>However, from a legal perspective, it is important to note that such legislation will need to evolve to encompass cyberspace. Taking an example from the FOIA 1967, it was reported that one in six individuals is unable to access their desired public information via the act. The quality of the search results and requests under this act have also been put into question, with questions being raised by inquirers about the integrity of the results being provided. The challenges to extend this legislation onto digital infrastructure are thus quite clear. Governments are tasked with keeping up with rapid advancements in technology, whilst simultaneously balancing the competing interests of privacy and freedom. </p><p>Commercial Parties and Political Influence in Cyberspace</p><p>A great deal of influence today is exercised by commercial parties in cyberspace.

Data is solidly entrenched as a key asset in our economy, and as a result, the issues around it demanded a significant level of attention.</p><p> Clearly, privacy and data security-related data issues were dominant in 2019. The GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulations garnered much consideration and resources, and with GDPR enforcement ongoing and CCPA enforcement right around the corner, the coming year will be an important one to watch. As data generation and collection technologies continued to evolve, privacy issues evolved as well. In 2019, we saw many novel issues involving  mobile,  biometric and connected car Facial recognition technology  generated a fair amount of litigation, and presented concerns regarding the possibility of intrusive governmental surveillance (prompting some municipalities, such as San Francisco, to ban its use by government agencies).Because data has proven to be so valuable, innovators continue to develop new and sometimes controversial technological approaches to collecting data. The legal issues abound. For example, in the past year, we have been advising on the implications of an  ongoing dispute between the City Attorney of Los Angeles and an app operator over geolocation data collection, as well as a  settlement between the FTC and a personal email management service over access to \"e-receipt\" data. We have entertained multiple questions from clients about the unsettled legal terrain surrounding web scraping and have been closely following developments in this area, including the  blockbuster hiQ Ninth Circuit ruling from earlier this year. As usual, the pace of technological innovation has outpaced the ability for the law to keep up.Data security is now regularly a boardroom and courtroom issue, with data breaches, phishing, ransomware attacks and identity theft (and cyberinsurance) the norm. Meanwhile, consumers are experiencing deeper and deeper \"breach fatigue\" with every breach notice they receive. While the U.S. government has not yet been able to put into place general national data security legislation, states and certain regulators are acting to compel data collectors to take reasonable measures to protect consumer information (e.g.,  New York's newly-enacted SHIELD Act) and IoT device manufacturers to equip connected devices with certain security features appropriate to the nature and function of the devices secure (e.g., California's IoT security law, which becomes effective January 1, 2020). Class actions over data breaches and security lapses are filed regularly, with mixed results.Many organizations have focused on the opportunistic issues associated with new and emerging sources of data. They seek to use \"big data\" - either sourced externally or generated internally - to advance their operations. They are focused on understanding the sources of the data and their lawful rights to use such data. They are examining new revenue opportunities offered by the data, including the expansion of existing lines, the identification of customer trends or the creation of new businesses (including licensing anonymized data to others).Moreover, data was a key asset in many corporate transactions in 2019. Across the board in M&amp;A, private equity, capital markets, finance and some real estate transactions, data was the subject of key deal points, sometimes intensive diligence, and often difficult negotiations. Consumer data has even become a national security issue, as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), expanded under a 2018 law, began to scrutinize more and more technology deals involving foreign investment, including those involving sensitive personal data.For more information about developments over the past year on data-related issues, and to keep abreast on new developments in the future, you may want to subscribe to Proskauer's privacy blog,  privacylaw.proskauer.com. You may also want to review our Practical Law article \"Trends in Privacy and Data Security:2018\" and get a hold of our update that will publish in winter 2020.</p><p>I am not going out on a limb in saying that 2020 and beyond promise many interesting developments in \"big data,\" privacy and data security.</p><p>Social Media under Fire</p><p>Social media platforms experienced an interesting year. The power of the medium came into even clearer focus, and not necessarily in the most flattering light. In addition to privacy issues, fake news, hate speech, bullying, political interference, revenge porn, defamation and other problems came to light. Executives of the major platforms have been on the hot seat in Washington, and there is clearly bipartisan unease with the influence of social media in our society. Many believe that the status quo cannot continue. Social media platforms are working to build self-regulatory systems to address these thorny issues, but the work continues. Still, amidst the bluster and criticism, it remains to be seen whether the calls to \"break up\" the big tech companies will come to pass or whether Congress's ongoing debate of comprehensive data privacy reform will lead to legislation that would alter the basic practices of the major technology platforms (and in turn, many of the data collection and sharing done by today's businesses). We have been working with clients, advising them of their rights and obligations as platforms, as contributors to platforms, and in a number of other ways in which they may have a connection to such platforms or the content or advertising appearing on such platforms.</p><p>What does 2020 hold? Will Washington's withering criticism of the tech world translate into any tangible legislation or regulatory efforts? Will Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - the law that underpins user generated content on social media and generally the availability of user generated content on the internet and apps - be curtailed? Will platforms be asked to accept more responsibility for third party content appearing on their services?</p><p>While these issues are playing out in the context of the largest social media platforms, any legislative solutions to these problems could in fact extend to others that do not have the same level of compliance resources available. Unless a legislative solution includes some type of \"size of person\" test or room to adapt technical safeguards to the nature and scope of a business's activities or sensitivity of the personal information collected, smaller providers could be shouldered with a difficult and potentially expensive compliance burden. Thus, it remains to see how the focus on social media and any attempt to solve the issues it presents may affect online communications more generally.</p><p>Quantum Leaps</p><p>Following the momentum of the passage of the National Quantum Initiative at the close of 2018, a significant level of resources has been invested into quantum computing in 2019. This bubble of activity culminated in Google announcing a major milestone in quantum computing. Interestingly, IBM suggests that it wasn't quite as significant as Google claimed. In any case, the  development of quantum computing in the U.S. has progressed a great deal in 2019, and many organizations will continue to focus on it as a priority in 2020.</p><p> Reports state that China has dedicated billions to build a Chinese national laboratory for quantum computing, among other related R&amp;D products, a development that has gotten the attention of Congress and the Pentagon. This may be the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century's great technological race.What is at stake? The implications are huge. It is expected that ultimately, quantum computers will be able to solve complex computations exponentially faster - as much as 100 million times faster  than classic computers. The opportunities this could present are staggering. As are the risks and dangers. For example, for all its benefits, the same technology could quickly crack the digital security that protects online banking and shopping and secure online communications.Many organizations are concerned about the advent of quantum computing. But given that it will be a reality in the future, what should you be thinking about now? While not a real threat for 2020 or the near-term thereafter, it would be wise to think about it if one is anticipating investing in long-term infrastructure solutions. Will quantum computing render the investment obsolete? Or, will quantum computing present a security threat to that infrastructure? It is not too early to think about these issues, and for example, technologists have been hard at work developing quantum-proof blockchain protocols. It would at least be prudent to understand the long-term roadmap of technology suppliers to see if they have even thought about quantum computing, and if so, to see to how they see quantum computing impacting their solutions and services.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence</p><p>We have seen significant level of deployment in the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning landscape this past year. According to the Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2019, AI adoption by organizations (of at least one function or business unit) is increasing globally. Many businesses across many industries are deploying some level of AI into their businesses. However, the same report notes that many companies employing AI solutions might not be taking steps to mitigate the risks from AI, beyond cybersecurity. We have advised clients on those risks, and in certain cases have been able to apportion exposure amongst multiple parties involved in the implementation. In addition, we have also seen the beginning of regulation in AI, such as California's chatbot law, New York's recent passage of a law (S.2302) prohibiting consumer reporting agencies and lenders from using the credit scores of people in a consumer's social network to determine that individual's credit worthiness, or the efforts of a number of regulators to regulate the use of AI in hiring decisions.</p><p>We expect 2020 to be a year of increased adoption of AI, coupled with an increasing sense of apprehension about the technology. There is a growing concern that AI and related technologies will continue to be \"weaponized\" in the coming year, as the public and the government express concern over \"deepfakes\" (including the use of voice deepfakes of CEOs to commit fraud). And, of course, the warnings of people like Elon Musk and Bill Gates, as they discuss AI, cannot be ignored.</p><p>Blockchain</p><p>We have been very busy in 2019 helping clients learn about blockchain technologies, including issues related to smart contracts and cryptocurrency. 2019 was largely characterized by pilots, trials, tests and other limited applications of blockchain in enterprise and infrastructure applications as well as a significant level of activity in tokenization of assets, cryptocurrency investments, and the building of businesses related to the trading and custody of digital assets. Our blog, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.blockchainandthelaw.iokeepsreaders\">www.blockchainandthelaw.iokeepsreaders</url> abreast of key new developments and we hope our readers have found our published articles on blockchain and smart contracts helpful.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2020, regulators such as the SEC, FinCEN, IRS and CFTC are still watching the cryptocurrency space closely. Gone are the days of ill-fated \"initial coin offerings\" and today, security token offerings, made in compliance with the securities laws, are increasingly common. Regulators are beginning to be more receptive to cryptocurrency, as exemplified by the New York State Department of Financial Services revisiting of the oft-maligned \"bitlicense\" requirement in New York.</p><p>Beyond virtual currency, I believe some of the most exciting developments of blockchain solutions in 2020 will be in supply chain management and other infrastructure uses of blockchain. 2019 was characterized by experimentation and trial. We have seen many successes and some slower starts. In 2020, we expect to see an increase in adoption. Of course, the challenge for businesses is to really understand whether blockchain is an appropriate solution for the particular need. Contrary to some of the hype out there, blockchain is not the right fit for every technology need, and there are many circumstances where a traditional client-server model is the preferred approach. For help in evaluating whether blockchain is in fact a potential fit for a technology need, this article may be helpful.</p><p>Other 2020 Developments</p><p>Interestingly, one of the companies that has served as a form of leading indicator in the adoption of emerging technologies is Walmart. Walmart was one of the first major companies to embrace supply use of blockchain, so what is Walmart looking at for 2020? A recent Wall Street Journal article discusses its interest and investment in 5G communications and edge computing. We too have been assisting clients in those areas, and expect them to be active areas of activity in 2020.</p><p>Edge computing, which is related to \"fog\" computing, which is, in turn, related to cloud computing, is simply put, the idea of storing and processing information at the point of capture, rather than communicating that information to the cloud or a central data processing location for storage and processing. According to the WSJ article, Walmart plans on building edge computing capability for other businesses to hire (following to some degree Amazon's model for AWS). The article also talks about Walmart's interest in 5G technology, which would work hand-in-hand with its edge computing network.</p><p>Our experience with clients suggest that Walmart may be onto something. Edge and fog computing, 5G and the growth of the \"Internet of Things\" are converging and will offer the ability for businesses to be faster, cheaper and more profitable. Of course this convergence also will tie back to the issues we discussed earlier, such as data, privacy and data security, artificial intelligence and machine learning. In general, this convergence will increase even more the technical abilities to process and use data (which would conceivably require regulation that would feature privacy and data security protections that are consumer-friendly, yet balanced so they do not stifle the economic and technological benefits of 5G).</p><p>This past year has presented a host of fascinating technology-based legal issues, and 2020 promises to hold more of the same.

EDT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please sit down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to thank you all for being here - a very special day, a very important day. Many of you are friends, and many of you are friends that I don't know what you look like, but I know what you sound like - (laughter) - which, I guess, is probably more important. Right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I want to thank you. And it's a terrific - it's a terrific day to be together. And, if you look, you're in a very famous place. We all work very hard. And I don't know if you call it influence, I don't know if you call it power, but whatever it is, we're in the White House. And we're going to stay in the White, and we're going to get our agenda done and completed beautifully. (Applause.)</p><p>So I'm thrilled to welcome you here. And we're all working very hard. And I don't know if you know, but we just did 27,000 on the Dow. That's the highest in history. We're up a couple of hundred points today. (Applause.) The highest in history - for those of you that like the stock market.</p><p>But the stock market means jobs. I view it as jobs, and I view it as 401(k)s. A lot of people say, Oh, the rich people are getting rich. But if you look at the numbers, the greatest impact, proportionately, is blue-collar workers in what's happened, in this miracle that's happening. (Applause.)</p><p>And people with 401(k)s, they're up 72 percent and 67 percent. And the wife or the husband - whoever is responsible - the other one says, You're a genius. You're a great financial investor. (Laughter.) Darling, you're up 77 percent this year. (Laughter.)</p><p>So a lot of good things happened. A lot of people are happy. And I think, really, everybody is happy; some people just aren't willing to admit it. Does that make sense? (Laughter.)</p><p>So this is a historic day. Never before have so many online journalists and influencers - and that's exactly what you are; you're journalists and you're influencers - come together in this building to discuss the future of social media.</p><p>Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation. You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the American people. And that's what you're doing - you're going right to the people.</p><p>Possibly, we wouldn't be here right now. I asked somebody, What do you think I'd do without social media? Would I be here? Because I said, I think so. (Laughter.) But they weren't so sure. (Laughter.) I have to say that; you know that. I'm not sure I believe that, but I have to say it.</p><p>But you communicate directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake-news filter. It's very simple. Together, you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far - not even close.</p><p>We're delighted to be joined at this summit by someone you know very well: our Senior Advisor for Digital Strategy and somebody that's been working for me for a long time, for many years, Dan Scavino. Where is Dan? (Applause.) Stand up. Come here. Great job.</p><p>So, long before we were even doing this, he was at a club - running a club and other businesses. And he was okay at doing it. (Laughter.) Not the greatest. I wouldn't say the greatest. (Laughter.) But you know what he was great at? He was always looking at his computer screen. I said, That guy is incredible.</p><p>So, right at the beginning, I said, That's the man. And there was nobody better at that. And I think Hillary had 28 people and I had Dan. (Laughter.) Right? (Applause.) I had my Dan. And he works about 28 hours a day, and he works very hard. But he doesn't work - I mean, he loves it. He loves it.</p><p>And his imagination and, really, working with all of you and many of you - he'll come up with ideas and you'll come up with ideas. And he'll run into my office. He said, You got to see this.</p><p>And a lot of times, I'll go out and I'll spend a lot of money on a concept. I'll say, Here's a concept. Come up with this. And we'll hire these companies, and they want a lot of money. And they come back - it just happened the other day, right? I said, That's terrible. These guys have no talent. (Laughter.) The people that have the talent are the people that we deal with. And it's true.</p><p>And some of you are extraordinary. I can't say everybody, but - (laughter). No, but some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable. (Laughter and applause.) True. Unbelievable.</p><p>So I'm going to go back to the basics of Washington. I'm going to introduce some of my Secretaries. Steve Mnuchin. Steve? Where's Steve? Steve has done a fantastic job. (Applause.)</p><p>Wilbur Ross. Wilbur? We have a meeting - (applause) - in a little while, on the census and citizenship. Can you believe: Are you a citizen of the United States of America? Sir, you can't ask that question. (Laughter.) Why? Because the court said you can't.</p><p>We have three very unfriendly courts. They fight us all the way. The judges don't like us too much, I guess. But think of that, Herman. Think of that question: Are you a citizen?</p><p>We spend - this is another thing that's so crazy: $20 billion on a census - $20 billion. They spend $20 billion. I said, 20 billion what? (Laughter.) Twenty billion dollars on a census.</p><p>They go through houses - they go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. How many toilets do they have? How many desks do they have? How many beds? What's their roof made of? (Laughter.) The only thing we can't ask is, Are you a citizen of the United States? (Laughter and applause.) No, isn't it the craziest thing? Twenty billion. (Applause.) Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing, Charlie.</p><p>Also, David Bernhardt, great job you're doing - Interiors. (Applause.) He's the largest landlord in the United States. When my friends tell me how big they are, they - I just bought another building. Big deal, Kevin, right? They bought another building. Then I look at David Bernhardt; he controls half of the United States. (Laughter.) Department of Interior. There's a lot of land - a lot of beautiful land - that we're taking good care of, David. Right?</p><p>Acting Director Russ Vought. Russ, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) We're working on our budget. (Applause.)</p><p>Along with some of the great members of Congress and a wonderful friend of mine who's my Leader, right? He's my Leader. I tell him that to his face because it makes him feel good. I don't know if I believe that, Marsha. (Laughter.) But, Kevin - stand up, Kevin. Kevin McCarthy, everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great state of Tennessee. We campaigned together. (Applause.) And she did - we can say it now: She ran against the most popular Democrat in the last 50 years. He really was great. A good man, right? THE PRESIDENT: And governor for quite a long time - eight years. And she just didn't stop.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: I beat him by 12 points.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Twelve points. (Applause.) She was down by 10, and she won by 12. That's right. She was down by 10, and she won by 12. And she wouldn't stop. They just - every day, Where is she? She's here. She's there. Fantastic job you did. We're proud of you.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: Thank you (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, honey. That's great. It was just - honestly, working with people that know what they're doing, it's fun. That was fun. And you know what you're doing.</p><p>Representative Dan Crenshaw, who is very good at this, by the way, Dan. (Applause.) Very good at this. Really good. Thank you. It's great to have you in the party. And you have more courage than I do, Dan. Okay? That courage of yours is incredible. Thank you very much. Great job.</p><p>A friend of mine, and a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future, I'd say - I hear a lot of very positive things - Liz Cheney. Liz, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.</p><p>And, you know, I pardoned somebody named Scooter Libby. A lot of you don't know who Scooter Libby is. Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly. And Liz was right on the forefront of that one. And I said, What do you think, Liz? And you said, Absolutely. He deserves it. And it's been a very popular pardon. He was treated very, very brutally and unfairly. So, thank you for that - for that help.</p><p>Matt Gaetz. Where's Matt? Where's Matt? Stand up, Matt. (Applause.) Boy, a great defender. He gets on television, and he's like - it doesn't stop. And he's smart, and he's good, and he loves Florida, and he loves his people, and he's a hard worker. And, Matt, thank you very much. I really appreciate it very much.</p><p>And Mike Johnson. Mike, thank you. (Applause.) Great job, Mike.</p><p>And I want to thank a man who I said, a long time ago, when we said, Let's do it - because Josh Hawley is special. He is somebody that - I said, Josh, you got to run. Well, I don't know. You know, he had a good set-up - pretty well, right? You weren't going anywhere. He could do whatever he wanted in his great state.</p><p>And I said, I'm telling you, you can do it. And she turned out - she's a tough candidate. Whether you like her or you don't like her, she's tough. Right? And by the end of that, that was incredible. That was a hell of a race and he won. And he's young and he's brilliant. And I'm going to ask him to come up and say a few words, if you don't mind, about what we're doing. And come on up right now. I think it would be a good time, right? (Applause.)</p><p>SENATOR HAWLEY: Thank you. Well, first of all, can we just give another round of applause to the President of the United States for his leadership on this issue? (Applause.)</p><p>You know, the media - the media says - the establishment media, the fake media - they say, Oh, there's no censorship in social media. That's all made up. That's all fake. You and I know that that's not true. You and I know the truth is that the social media giants would love to shut us down. They would love to shut us up. They would love to shut him up more than anything else. And we can't let them. And that's why we need to step up now.</p><p>And I think we need to say to them, Here's the deal. Google, Facebook, Twitter - they've gotten these special deals from government. They've gotten a special giveaway from government. They're treated unlike anybody else. If they want to keep their special deal, here's the bargain: They have to quit discriminating against conservatives. Do you agree with that? No more! (Applause.) No more discrimination. It's that simple. (Applause.) That's all we're asking for.</p><p>They ought to abide by the same principles of free speech and the First Amendment that this country embraces, that we love and call our own. And I don't think it's too much to ask for these huge tech platforms - who've gotten rich off our information, right? Off of our data, off of everything we've given them - they've gotten rich off of it. They've gotten rich off their special privileges from government. If they want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate. They shouldn't censor. They shouldn't shut us down.</p><p>I want to thank the President again for his incredible leadership. Thank you for allowing me to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, you know, Josh is doing - right now, he's doing some very important legislation because we have to do something about what's happening. I never hear about the other side. I can tell you - I think I'm pretty good at getting out a message, but, technologically, I would think I'm okay. Just okay. But I'll tell you, a lot of bad things are happening.</p><p>I have people come up to me, Sir, we want to follow you. They don't let us on. And it was so different than it was even six, seven months ago. I was picking up unbelievable amounts of people. And I'm hotter now than I was then, okay? Because, you know, you also cool off, right? But much hotter. (Laughter.) Especially with a nice, new stock market like it is, right?</p><p>But, no, I'm hotter now. And I go to Dan, and I say, Hey, what's going on here? It used to take me a short number of days to pick up 100,000 people. I'm not complaining; we're like 60-some-odd million. But then we have five different sites. We have another site with 25 million. We have another site with 10 or 12. Then we have Facebook. Then we have Instagram. We have a lot - you know, a lot of people - way, way over 100 million.</p><p>But I used to pick them up, and I - when I say used to, I'm talking about a few months ago. I was picking them up 100,000 people every - very short period of time. Now it's, I would say, 10 times as long.</p><p>And I noticed things happening when I put out something - a good one - that people like. (Laughter.) Right? A good tweet. It goes up. It used to go up - it would say 7,000, 7,008, 7,017, 7,024, 7,032, 7,044. (Laughter.) Right? Now it goes 7,000, 7,008, 6,998.</p><p>Then they go, 7,009, 6,074. I say, What's going on? It never did that before. It goes up, and then they take it down, and then it goes up. I never had that. Does anyone know what I'm talking about with this?</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I never had that before. I used to watch it. It would be like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty. (Laughter and applause.) Like when I said - remember I said somebody was spying on me? That thing was like a rocket. I got a call two minutes later. Did you say that? I said, Yeah, I said that. Well, it's exploding. (Laughter.) It's exploding. I turned out to be right. I turned out to be right. And we turn out to be right about lot of things. (Applause.)</p><p>But I never had it. I'm just saying from - you know, from the standpoint of a - of somebody that maybe has used social media better than anybody, Josh, because I became President. I'm sure I could have done it, as we said, much - I would have - there's no question I would have done it either way.</p><p>I said to Mark Burnett the other day - I said, So, The Apprentice... Had I never done The Apprentice - because it was a tremendous hit for 12 seasons. I said, Had I never done The Apprentice, would I be President? He said, Maybe not. And I said, I think I would have. But I'm always going to say that. (Laughter.) I'm always going to say it. But it was a great show.</p><p>But with social media - so I've never seen it before where I go up and then come down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Now, ultimately, you get - but it goes very slowly. But I've never seen where it's subtracted. And I really believe people are - they're taking it up as it goes up. And it - sometimes it comes down substantially.</p><p>A number of months ago, I was at a certain number - you know, many millions - and then all of a sudden, I was down over a million. And then I came down - I said, What's going on? And you checked, Dan, and you said, They say they're doing adjustments. They say they don't like some of the people.</p><p>And I don't have the fake people. You know, a lot of people buy people. I don't want to do that because, first of all, if I did it, it's a front page story all over the place. (Laughter.) but I know a lot of people - there's no question about it, because I see some numbers that are phony numbers where they have these, you know, many, many millions of followers. And I say, There's no way because nobody has any interest in these people. (Laughter.) There's - they have no -</p><p>Now, Herman Cain, they have interest in, okay? (Applause.) But they have no interest in these people. They're playing games. They're playing games.</p><p>James Woods. I don't know James, but he's an interesting guy and he's a conservative guy. And he is a straight shooter. He's tough. But when they want to take him off - and other people like him; many in this room, some in this room - it's a very, very bad - it's a very bad thing.</p><p>So I have many millions of followers across various accounts. And together, everyone in this room, we reach over a half a billion followers. And I think that's probably a low number. Because one of the things I get that's a little benefit - I'll go, Watch. Like, I did Golan Heights. I gave Israel the - the real credit over - and, you know, Golan Heights in Israel. Very important.</p><p>But I gave representation, in the strongest form, of the Golan Heights - Israel. And I talked about it in a little quick tweet. They've been looking at it - for 52 years, they've been trying to get it. They couldn't get it. They'd have many summits where people would fly in, talk about the Golan Heights, and then fly out. This went on many, many summits. It's about a 52-year period. I said, What happened? They said, Nothing. They'd fly in. They'd fly out. Some had beautiful planes. Some didn't. Some probably didn't get there by plane. But they'd have many summits.</p><p>said, Watch, I'm going to do this. And I said, We recognize the Golan Heights as being part of Israel. It was a big thing. I go, Watch this. Boom. I press it and, within two seconds, We have breaking news. John Roberts of Fox was over, and he said, We have breaking news. Please, break it up. Doesn't matter what they're talking about, John, does it? He breaks it up.</p><p>Now, that's Twitter. That's social media. I call Twitter a typewriter. That's what I really call Twitter, because it goes onto Facebook automatically and it goes onto Instagram. And it goes onto television - more so Fox than it does CNN. If it's something bad, they'll put it on. (Laughter.)</p><p>If I have a spelling deal, they will put it on. (Laughter.) It's - Donald Trump spelled the word 'the' wrong. You know? (Laughter.) He doesn't know how to spell, 'the.' He spelled it 'T-H-I.' (Laughter.) You know, I couldn't care - any kind of a punctuation mistake, they put it on. So I'm very, very careful. I really - I'm actually a good speller. But everyone said, The fingers aren't as good as the brain. (Laughter.)</p><p>But - but it is true. And it's - it's incredible what it does. I put out a social media statement. And I was telling Kellyanne the other day, I said, you know, I used to put out like a press release, right? And people would pick it up, sort of, you know, in the next day, two days. They'd find it sitting on a desk. If I put out - we hardly do press releases anymore because if I put out, on social media, a statement - like I'm going to in a little while on something totally unrelated, but a very important statement. Now they're going crazy. What it is? Tell me what it is. Watch. (Laughter.) But it's very important.</p><p>But if I put that out in a press release, I'm telling you, Kevin, people don't pick it up. It's me - same. If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion. Fox, CNN, crazy MSNBC - they're stone-cold crazy. (Laughter.) I made them a lot of money with The Apprentice. And I gave them a top show when they were dying on NBC. But they don't like me too much. They wanted a big extension. They used Arnold Schwarzenegger instead - a big movie star. You know what? He died. He died. (Laughter.) I was there 12 - 12 years, 14 seasons. And then they pick a movie actor and he dies on us. (Laughter.)</p><p>You know, I own that with Mark Burnett and some people. And I said - they said, Would you rather have him had been like this tremendous massive success? You own it, so you benefit, financially. Or would you rather have him die? So they just say, You did it for 14 seasons, 12 years. I said, I think I'd rather him die at it. (Laughter.) That means you don't need the money. I'd rather have him die at it. Anyway.</p><p>But with amazing creativity and determination, you're bypassing the corrupt establishment - and it is corrupt - and you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media - which not all of it, but much of it is far greater percentages than anyone would understand. As the cameras start to go off. There go the red lights. Look, boom. I can always tell. (Laughter.)</p><p>I can always tell. Like, when I talk about - and I'll be in the stadium. The red lights are all on. Everyone has got - and then we start talking about, like, the media - how dishonest it is, how corrupt it is, how fake it is. And you see lights going off. (Laughter.) Lights immediately go off. And, usually, they don't come back. They say, This guy is impossible. (Laughter.)</p><p>But I want to just say it because you people have a lot of courage. To each and every one of you, I say: Thank you very much, on behalf of a nation. Thank you very much. It's very important what you're doing. You're getting the - you're getting, in many cases, the honest word out - not in all cases, but in many cases.</p><p>When historians look back at this time, they will see that many of the biggest news stories of our era were totally ignored. I - I can tell you that I deal with the media, and the spin they put on it - or sometimes they'll leave it out, and then if there's something slightly negative, they'll make it, you know, headline news. They'll put it down as headline news. Or even covered up by the media - they were broken up by citizens.</p><p>And you'll take a look at what's happening, and you see stories that should be phenomenal, big, beautiful stories and it turns out that they don't get covered. We did something yesterday on kidney and kidney dialysis, and there's a tremendous number of people with problems with kidneys. And it was Secretary Azar - it was a big, big important thing. It got very little coverage. You know, very positive - what we did is such - such a great thing.</p><p>I don't care. We don't have to get the - hey, it's good for our nation. It's good for people to read about it and see the strides that we've made and what we're doing. But that doesn't get covered and it should get covered. And it doesn't get covered for a reason because they don't want to give that to a conservative. They don't want to let that happen.</p><p>Now, if somebody else were in this position - such as the previous administration - they'd make that headline news all over the place, what we did yesterday. But when we're doing it, they give very little credit to that.</p><p>But anything bad that happens - I always say, They can take bad and make it horrible. They can take a good story and make it sort of bad. And they can take a great, great story and make it anywhere from good to slightly bad. (Laughter.) It's incredible what they can do.</p><p>I say I haven't had a good story in two and a half years. I used to get great press. Steve Mnuchin knows. He said, Man, you get the greatest press. Until I got elected. (Laughter.) Then it stopped. But I used to get the greatest press - possibly one of the reasons I'm here.</p><p>But we're getting the word out, and we get it out in a different way. I didn't think we'd have to - Charlie, I didn't think it would be this tough and -</p><p>By the way, two very special people - I have to say hello to them. Because my wife said, I see these two beautiful women - African American, incredible women - that are on television. They are unbelievable. This is two years ago. She was before her time. They have no idea who I'm talking about. (Laughter.) She was - our First Lady said, You have to see these women. They're incredible. They're genius. And they like you. I said, I want to see them. (Laughter.) And I liked them. I loved them, actually. I loved them. Come. Come. (Applause.)</p><p>I don't want them to fall, because it'll be a major story. (Laughter.)</p><p>So, when the historians look back, they're going to see something very important took place right here. Before today, it took place. It started taking place a number of years ago, and it's something that nobody ever thought would happen.</p><p>Free speech is a bedrock of American life. Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected. And I want you to know that we will always have your back. We're fighting for you very hard. We're going to be calling a big meeting of the companies for - in a week or two. They have to be here.</p><p>And Josh is really leading a very strong group of people. This isn't just Josh. This is you leading a tremendous group, and they feel equally as strongly as you because they see the unfairness of what's happening.</p><p>And remember: We won. We have a bigger voice than anybody. But we don't get covered fairly. Can you imagine if we were covered fairly? We had our best polls, like, yesterday, they were telling me. I said, Could you imagine if I actually got good press instead of - even fair press. I don't want good; I want fair. Can you imagine what those numbers would be? They make up stories - you know, the Russian hoax. I call it the Russian hoax - the witch hunt. All bad publicity, and yet we're doing great in the polls.</p><p>So people understand it. The public is very smart. But we're getting the word out about so many things - not just that - about so many things.</p><p>And maybe the most important thing about how great our country is doing. Jobs - now more people working today than ever in the history of our country. Ever in the history of our country - think of that. Unemployment are the best numbers in 51 years. For African American, the best numbers in our history - in our history, Herman, right? (Applause.) Including you. And you're making a lot, I hope.</p><p>But Hispanic American - best numbers in history. (Applause.) Right? Stand up. And I like your dresses, by the way, very much. No, not you, sir. You. (Laughter.) Thank you. I saw you the other day. Fantastic job.</p><p>But Hispanic American - the best in history. Asian American - the best in history. Women - I think, Kellyanne - the best in 75 years. The best in - best unemployment numbers in 75 years. What we're doing - it's nothing like this has been done.</p><p>Our military is now strong. When I took it over, it was depleted. We had planes that were so old they didn't fly. They'd have to go to the desert to get parts. When we took it over, it was not a good situation. We got $700 billion, and then $716 billion. And we're going to be asking for another one this year. And it's all manufactured in the United States. We make it ourselves. And that's always good, because that's jobs. Now, in this case, jobs aren't important compared military defense, but we make the best planes and rockets and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nothing like it. And we're doing something that's incredible.</p><p>So, our military is strong. Our - our country is really powerful and really strong. Never been like this.</p><p>Whoops. How did a fly get into the White House? (Laughter.) I don't like that. I don't like flies. I don't like flies. (Laughter.)</p><p>So I just want to tell you, just in finishing up, we had a terrible bias. We have censorship like nobody has any understanding or nobody can believe. When you see the Google executives together, and one of their executives decides to put it on the phone - right? That's right. Thank you. Oh, there he is. Stand up, please. Stand up. (Applause.) How good - what a great job. Somebody said he's controversial. I said, He's not controversial. He's truthful. He's truthful. (Applause.) That was a great job. That was one of many. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic.</p><p>So, you know, they're playing with - with a lot of minds and they're playing unfairly. And the funny thing is that, in theory, they shouldn't be liking the other side. They shouldn't be liking the other side. They should be, really, liking our side, because we're the ones that want freedom far more.</p><p>You see what's happening up in the debate stand. You see what they're doing to each other. You're seeing the hatred that they have up there. And it's a very different philosophy. It's a very different thought.</p><p>And I'll say this: The election that's coming up is, I think - and, you know, we talk 2016, and I would say maybe that's the most important, and certainly I said it. But what we're really fighting for - there has never been a difference of this candidate, our candidate, your candidate against whoever it may be. There will never be anything like that hopefully again, because what they're looking at is pure socialism or worse than socialism. You know, there's a word called communism, too. There's a word called - they don't like to use it. Very rarely do you hear that. But there's a word called communism, and they're trying to get socialism over the line.</p><p>But these people are - this is beyond socialism, to a large extent. And I think that we're going to have a tremendous success. We had a - sort of, an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000 - maybe more; I think it was nine - wanting to come. We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We have a 21,000-seat stadium, and then, with the basketball court, it held many more than that. It was packed. And we had a similar number outside, and we had thousands and thousands of people that wanted to be there. And this was an opening.</p><p>And you look at Biden; they say he had 600 people. That wasn't 600; that was 150 people. (Laughter and applause.) That was 150. That was a very small crowd. (Laughter.) And even their big crowds - I mean, if they have 1,000 people, it's like a big crowd. We have enthusiasm that's far greater than the left. It's not even a contest. They don't want to say that. They never will say that.</p><p>We had, on the Mall, just the other day - 4th of July - a tremendous success. It was pouring. The weather was just - it was beautiful, in one way. They learned it was my real hair that day - (laughter) - because I was drenched. Well, that is the one good thing. I ran, and they learned it's my hair, because I've been through every windstorm, sandstorm. Let's go over here. Let's go this one, that one - this desert. Let's go to this ocean and get out of the plane. Sir, the wind is blowing at about 70 miles an hour. I said, Boy, it's got to be - it's got to be mine. (Laughter.)</p><p>But we've seen it all. We've seen it all. And I tell you what: More than anything else, I've met great people. I've met great people. Dedicated people. And I think that the election coming up, Kevin, this is the most important election of our times.</p><p>This is an election where our country is going to go one way or it's going to head in the direction of Venezuela. And that's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen.</p><p>This Green New Deal - and I - you know, I hate to speak badly of it right now because it's a little early. I spoke too early on Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. (Laughter.) I spoke - I should've saved it.</p><p>But, you know - so I don't like to go too early because I don't want them to change. I like the Green New Deal. I want them to keep going. I don't want them to make - you know, the problem with this business: They can make a change, and immediately upon making the - it lasts for about a week. You look at, for instance, on the wall, Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall. Right, Liz? Totally in favor. Everybody. Hillary. Everybody. They were all in favor of a wall, just a few years ago.</p><p>Now a wall is a - well, that's okay. They want open borders. They want people to pour in, including criminals - the worst criminals. They want people to pour into our country. Nobody can tell me that's good, politically. Nobody can tell me.</p><p>So all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, they've got a right to speak their mind. That includes them. That includes them. But they don't have the same difficulty. They don't get shut out. I wrote a few terms. I said to my son, Don, who's here some- - where are you, Don? Where are you, Don? (Applause.) He's very good. Kimberly. Don. People like Don, I tell you. (Applause.) Good. Thank you, Don.</p><p>But we wrote out a few - shadow ban, 100 percent. You look at what's going on. You know, I could go - the blocking - just the basic blocking of what we want to get out. The fact that they don't let them join. They don't. There was - there's no doubt in my mind that I should have millions and millions - I have millions of people - so many people, I wouldn't believe it. But I know that we've been blocked.</p><p>People come up to me and they say, Sir, I can't get you. I can't follow you. They make it impossible. These are people that are really good at what they do. They say, They make it absolutely impossible. And, you know, we can't have it. We're not going to let it happen. Josh, we're not going to let it happen.</p><p>And, you know, if they did it on both sides, if it were done to the other side, to the other group - and I'm representing everybody. I do. I represent everybody. I fully understand liberal. I fully understand Democrat. We want to get along. We want to make sure that everybody loves each other, if that's possible. And, maybe, I really believe it is. Someday it will be.</p><p>I, for a while, have said that the thing that's going to bring us together is great success. Now we have tremendous success - greater than we've ever had before. I mean, our country picked up trillions of dollars in value and worth. China has gone down trillions of dollars. The tariffs have hurt them. I don't want to hurt them, but I want to give us a fair playing field. But China has gone down trillions. We've gone up tril- - not billions, trillions. We've gone up in value and worth.</p><p>I want everybody to do well, but they've got to treat us fairly. They've got to treat - everybody has to be treated fairly. Their side, our side - we all have to be treated fairly.</p><p>And, you know, the farmers say, We just want a level playing field, sir. I love the farmers. They're patriots. And China, as you know, targeted the farmers because they think they could get to me by hurting the people that I love and that we take care of. And it had no impact.</p><p>I would watch, even on networks that don't exactly like me, and I'd watch as they interview farmers. And they'd have 10 or 12 people sitting around. They're saying, We don't care. The President is right. We've been ripped off for many years. Somebody has to do - somebody had to do this.</p><p>China made, over the last 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars. You could say four to five hundred billion dollars a year. That's not sustainable. That's not - we built China. And you know what? They've done a great job. I don't blame them; I blame our former Presidents and the leaders of our country for allowing this to go on ever since the World Trade Organization opened up. They allowed this to go on. They allowed hundreds of billions of dollars a year to be taken out of our country and to be used to rebuild China. So those days are over.</p><p>So, right now, they're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. A lot of money coming in. You know, we had a 3.2 GDP for the first quarter. Everyone said, I wonder how that happened. Because first quarter is the weakest quarter always - almost - almost always. And we had like this great quarter.</p><p>But I don't consider 3.2 great. I consider much higher. And, frankly, if we had lower interest rates - you know, we're forced to pay more money than other countries because we have a rate that's high. We have somebody that likes raising rates. Now, I think he's maybe going to change, but we'll find out. But if we had lower, we'd have another 10,000 points. We're doing - we just set a record. You know, I'm a very greedy person. We just set a record: 27,000. I said, We could be 10,000 points higher. We could be 10,000 because there's no inflation. A big thing is inflation. There's no inflation. But we're doing so well. We're going to keep it that way.</p><p>So, I just want to introduce - because a person that I've admired for a long time who is a great lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, and she's one of the leading First Amendment lawyers in our country. And, Harmeet, could you come up - just say a few words, please? Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. DHILLON: Thank you, Mr. President. (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. President. It's a tremendous honor to be here with a lot of people who I really respect and admire.</p><p>The corrupt establishment that you talked about and the mainstream media have told a lot of people in this room that the social media censorship and the banning that we're experiencing is all in our heads. They're gaslighting us with this lie.</p><p>Let me tell you about a couple of people I represent in my law practice and the civil rights work that we do. David Horowitz is a great American, who is a supporter of yours - has been in the movement for many decades. Well, Twitter abruptly de-platformed him one day - took him off, said he was banned. And then, he complained and then they let him back on. And then, the next day, they did the exact same thing to him. That's not an accident.</p><p>James Damore is another great American who I represent. Mr. Damore complained internally about Google's discriminatory practices against conservatives and pushed for more balance. Not only was he fired for daring to do that, but then these social media platforms used their platforms to humiliate him publicly, weaponize their platforms, and make sure that he could not get a job in Silicon Valley. That's a disgrace.</p><p>But it goes beyond that. These social media CEOs have come to Congress in front of the - many of these members of Congress here, and they've lied about what they do. They've lied about the data theft. They've lied about the media manipulation. And they can't get away with that.</p><p>Now, Senator Blackburn knows, from what happened to her on Twitter, that these companies are trying to stop the ordinary men and women who you represent from hearing their voices. I'm very concerned that they affected the outcome of the 2018 election. And if we let them do what they're going to - what they've been doing, it's going to affect the outcome of the 2020 election as well.</p><p>So, Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting everybody here to talk about these issues. And we're all behind you joining the fight to make sure that every American's voice is heard. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And what Harmeet said is so, so true. I mean it's - it's really incredible. You know, I've watched and I've watched some of these scenes that have been taped and gotten through - talented people, by the way - but gotten through and gotten to the public where you see the hatred of - of our party, of our people, of our voice. And you say, That's the collusion. It's a collusion between the Democrats and the media and - and social media and these platforms. It's a disgraceful thing. (Applause.)</p><p>And another thing, I believe you're representing a young man who just got slugged, viciously slugged. I think it's a disgrace. Do you ever notice they pick on certain people? I mean, he would tell you he's not the toughest person in the world physically, right? They don't go after Bikers for Trump. (Laughter.)</p><p>Do you ever notice that? They don't go after our construction workers, who love us. They don't go after the police. They don't go after - we have incredible people. You know, we're the elite. They say they're elite. You know. Do you ever hear this? Hey, I live better than all of them. (Laughter.) Great education. The greatest houses. The great- - but I guess I'm not elite. They live like in the basement of their mom's home. (Laughter.) Their arms are this big. Look, like this.</p><p>But they have the black - they have the black masks on, and they have sticks. And they hit people. They hit people in the face, in the head - this Antifa.</p><p>But do you ever notice the Antifa is never there when we have a bikers rally? (Laughter.) They're never there when the construction workers and the unions are honoring the President. They're never around. They're always there when you have a single guy protesting in front of a school.</p><p>And as you probably know - I think all of you know - we did something very serious. I signed an executive order recently. We're taking money away from those schools. (Applause.) We're going to - you know, we give them billions and billions of dollars, and they don't allow free speech. (Applause.) And we don't want anything special, but we want free speech.</p><p>We're also joined by someone affected by this troubling bias very, very much - and President of Live Action and somebody I've watched, really, with great admiration. Lila, please come up. Lila Rose. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. ROSE: Thank you so much, Mr. President. It's really an honor to be here. Thank you for doing this important summit.</p><p>I represent Live Action. I'm the founder and president, and we are a pro-life organization which reaches millions of people every week with the truth about abortion and human dignity.</p><p>We have been, for four years, banned from doing any advertising on Twitter. And they told us that, in order to reinstate our accounts, we'd have to stop calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood and stop sharing our pro-life content. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other abortion groups continue to advertise.</p><p>Last month, we were permanently suspended from Pinterest, and they accused us of spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation with our pro-life content, with no evidence. And then, news media groups picked up the narrative and spread it around. Meanwhile, abortion groups, including abortion clinics, post freely on Pinterest.</p><p>And then, recently, our videos have been viewed more highly than almost any other abortion-related content on YouTube. But YouTube - we made it to the first page of search results, but YouTube buried our pro-life videos and boosted pro-abortion videos. So this double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech, even though they say that they are politically neutral and they don't discriminate. They even testified before Congress and said that.</p><p>So thank you so much to the administration and to you, Mr. President, for holding this very important summit. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Thank you very much.</p><p>So, one of the advantages of being President is when you ask for a meeting, you get it, generally. I don't know - I can't think of too many I haven't gotten. And you say, I'd like to see you in Oval Office. Or you have somebody call - Oval Office.</p><p>I have been with all of these people at the highest level - one-on-one, just recently, with Google. Just recently, with Twitter. The top. All right? And you talk to them and you swear they're like your best friend. Oh, sir. No, we're - we're - we believe - we - freedom of speech. Oh, yes. Absol-...</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And we go out -</p><p>He says, Liar. Who said that? (Laughter.) Must come from Queens. (Laughter.)</p><p>So - so it's very interesting to see that. And - and the level of - you know, you look at them - the sincerity. And I say, That's fantastic. And they'll leave. And then, I'll realize, three or four weeks later, it's worse. It actually got worse.</p><p>Because I say - look, I believe in technology. I believe in free markets. I believe in freedom of speech. I believe in all of the things, and they are super genius.</p><p>I'll tell you, I'm dealing with China. And they admitted there's nobody like Silicon Valley. There's nobody smart, in that sense - maybe not smart in other senses. I've watched some of them speak before Congress; it's not pretty. (Laughter.) I say, I could do much better than that. (Laughter.)</p><p>But I tell you what: Technologically, it's unbelievable what they think of. Even Dan and I, when we sat with you-know-who at Twitter - number one. We talked about certain things. He says, You know, we could do this, this, this. I said, That's really great. You know, this is incredible stuff.</p><p>China will admit there's nobody like these brains. But they're not using that brilliance and they're not using what we gave them fairly. And they have to do that.</p><p>And we don't want to stifle anything. We certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think that the mainstream media is free speech either because it's so crooked. It's so dishonest.</p><p>So, to me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech. Somebody came to my office - and I won't say who, but a very big person. And I said, Okay, you don't like the term 'fake news' - which I think I get credit for, but I'm sure that, if I said I get credit, they'll say, Thirteen years ago, somebody came up with the terms 'fake.' (Laughter.) I think I'd get credit. I'd be very proud to take it. But I think I'd get credit.</p><p>Now, by the way, the worst fakers of all are using fake news. I saw the other day on CNN - total fakes - I see on CNN - they go, Fake-news media has reported... No, no - they're fake-news media. (Laughter.) They've turned it around. (Applause.) They've turned it around.</p><p>So I'm not going to allow - and Josh and all of us, we're not just going to allow it to happen like this. We're not going to be silenced.</p><p>Two months ago, we created a new White House tool to report social media bias, censorship, and discrimination. We saw you folks being taken off, and we fought on all of you. And many of you are back now. But many of the names - I won't mention your names - but some of you were taken off for absolutely no reason.</p><p>I mean, in all fairness, some of you I could almost understand. (Laughter.) I mean, some of you guys are out there. (Laughter.) But even you should have a voice. (Laughter.) But some of you - no, some of you deserve - (applause) - some of you. I mean, it's genius, but it's bad. (Laughter.)</p><p>But they take off people that are - you know, that you wouldn't believe. And we received over 16,000 responses just in a tiny little period of time talking about this subject.</p><p>Based on the feedback that we're hearing from you, I'm announcing that we will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month, have a big meeting and a real conversation. We want - might want to invite some of you. I know, Josh, we're going to have you and some of the senators.</p><p>And it's amazing how the senators - including Democrats, in all fairness - which is probably because they know it can turn on them also. It can turn very quickly. But they want to come. So we'll let you know the date, okay?</p><p>And today, I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans. That's you people in this room and a lot of people out there. There are a lot of people.</p><p>We hope to see transparency, more accountability, and more freedom. That's on both sides. This is not - I am not speaking for our side, assuming we're all - I don't even know if you're on our side. You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience, and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody. Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people.</p><p>To all of the social media influencers here today - a lot of - you have a lot of power and you have a lot of strength. And, you know, you have to use it wisely. Many of you do, but you have to.</p><p>I want to thank you once again for being here. You're very special people. You're very brilliant people, in so many cases. I look around the room - I mean, I see people that really have almost found a new life over the last short period of time with this new technology. But this new technology is so powerful and so important, and it has to be used fairly. It has to be used fairly.</p><p>So thank you all for being here. It's a great honor. Tremendous honor.</p><p>We're going to take a few questions, I think. And then I'll head out. And you're going to actually come - if you want, you can come to the great Rose Garden. You can stand in the rain with me. We're going to talk a little bit about the fact that we're not allowed to ask for whether or not somebody is a citizen on the census form. And I think we have a solution that will be very good for a lot of people - really good.</p><p>END</p><p>4:42 P.M.

Khanna Talks Tech Jobs Across America With Prime Minister Tony Blair, Microsoft Ceo Brad Smith at Web Summit</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Ro Khanna, member of the House Oversight Committee and Congressional Representative for Silicon Valley, participated in the 2019 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. Rep. Khanna joined two of Web Summits robustly attended panels. The first, None left behind: Making tech work for the many was a fireside chat in conversation with former Prime Minister Tony Blair. The second, Rebuilding trust in tech was a conversation with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith. Khanna had several individual conversations with speakers while there, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who touted his efforts and innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Khanna has traveled across rural America discussing opportunities to bring technology jobs into communities left behind and mapping out a future for the global economy. Rep. Khanna, in early 2020, will introduce a bill that will establish a grant program to build up tech-related schooling opportunities in the middle America  legislating his vision of transition to innovation-based economies. His plan entails a multibillion-dollar investment inspired by Morrill Act of 1862. Khanna has traveled to several economically distressed cities in Kentucky, West Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina and South Carolina. There, Rep. Khanna has partnered with local lawmakers to bring Silicon Valley representatives to meet with local businesses and universities to help form partnerships.</p><p>The reality is that technology has enriched our lives in so many ways. In enhancing communication, enhancing the promise of medicine, enhancing the possibility of information. And yet that innovation and wealth has been concentrated in a few areas. And people in Silicon Valley are increasingly aware that many have been left out in rural America, in minority communities. Our country will fall apart if we dont integrate and provide those opportunities to these places that have been left out. Put simply, no child should be forced to leave their hometown to get a good job.</p><p>How are we going to create new jobs given the technology revolution? What are we going to do to make sure theres not geographic inequality? What are we going to do to have thoughtful regulations, so democracy is enhanced, not undermined, based on these new platforms? So, my view is that the central question of governance is how are we going to have thoughtful economic policy, thoughtful regulation, to deal with the technology revolution, and thats sorely missing in Congress.</p><p>Our politics are either about the restoration of the past, or an embrace of the future. At a very simple level, Donald Trump is saying lets go back to the past, lets go back to the way life used to be, and if you believe, as I do, in a multi-cultural democracy you have to convince people that technology and the future is going to be a force for good in their lives, not a force of disruption. That to me is the central challenge for modern politics, said Rep. Khanna.</p><p>Its a great pleasure to be with Ro as well, whose work I admire greatly. The people being left behind are the people who dont understand how technology is changing the world, who feel that the force of globalization is passing them by. The big challenge is how do you get the changemakers and the policymakers together. Today, the question of technology should run throughout government. My view is you need to reorder politics around handling this technological revolution. the problem today is that youve got a real world revolution in this room, and youve got politics in the other room, and the question is how you put that together.</p><p>Technology is more than about Big Tech. Its about all those companies that are being created now, that are doing new things, that are innovating. We need that energy to be in the political room as well . . . a lot of the time these guys want to be as far away from government as possible, I understand that. But its necessary for the politicians to understand the world in order that they make the right policy. And this dislocation between the revolution thats happening on the ground and the political debate is worrying and its dangerous, said Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-158992899</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFT-K9X1-F11P-X15R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"689\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

By using the Privacy Act of 1974 as its framework, the bill provides overdue transparency and accountability from the tech industry while ensuring that small businesses and start-ups are still able to innovate and compete in the digital marketplace.</p><p>There has been a growing consensus that Congress must take action to address consumer data privacy, Rubio said. However, I believe that any efforts to address consumer privacy must also balance the need to protect the innovative capabilities of the digital economy that have enabled new entrants and small businesses to succeed in the marketplace. That is why I am introducing the American Data Dissemination Act, which will protect small businesses and startups while ensuring that consumers are provided with overdue rights and protections. It is critical that we do not create a regulatory environment that entrenches big tech corporations. Congress must act, but it is even more important that Congress act responsibly to create a transparent, digital environment that maximizes consumer welfare over corporate welfare.</p><p>Specifically, the ADD Act would do the following:</p><p>Not later than 180 days after enactment of the ADD Act, the FTC is required to submit detailed recommendations for privacy requirements that Congress can impose on covered providers. These requirements would be substantially similar to the requirements applicable to agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974.</p><p>Not earlier than one year after the date on which the Commission has submitted detailed recommendations (18 months after enactment), the FTC will publish and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress proposed regulations to impose privacy requirements on covered providers that are substantially similar to the requirements applicable to agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974.</p><p>To ensure Congress acts in a timely manner, if the Congress fails to enact a law based on the recommendations provided by the date that is two years after enactment of this bill, the FTC would promulgate a final rule, not later than 27 months after the date of enactment to impose privacy requirements based on the narrow, congressionally mandated course of action created through this bill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-135407341</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V71-JD71-F11P-X0D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who heads the Senate Commerce Committee, opened Wednesday's hearing by saying there's a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats for a new data privacy law.</p><p>But the approach being pondered by policymakers and pushed by the internet industry leans toward a relatively light government touch. That's in contrast to stricter EU rules that took effect in May.</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, says examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>The companies aren't going to tell that story to the Senate panel, she said. These companies make their money off consumer data.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire life cycle of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators elsewhere have started to act.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the possible unintended consequences of California's approach. For instance, he says the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws, the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties. Thune's pronouncement and one from a White House official stress that a balance should be struck in any new legislation - between government supervision and technological advancement.</p><p>The goal is a policy that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, says examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>The companies aren't going to tell that story to the Senate panel, she said. These companies make their money off consumer data.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire life cycle of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators elsewhere have started to act.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the possible unintended consequences of California's approach. For instance, he says the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws, the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties. Thune's pronouncement and one from a White House official stress that a balance should be struck in any new legislation - between government supervision and technological advancement.</p><p>The goal is a policy that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LEIPZO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC1-5PF1-JB5P-J4VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 28, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00027JF</classCode><className>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Others say not so. Whats the right middle ground there, how do we solve, where do you think were going to go? Will the government stay open?</p><p>Sen. Moran (4:19): We ought to have a continuing resolution, not shut down government, but we ought to do it for a very short period of time  a day or two  and stay here and resolve these differences. Because not only are we talking about DACA and immigration, the attempt to resolve those issues which are very important, but also disaster assistance, the list is long CHIP, the program for healthcare, the Collins-Nelson bill. We ought not delay these things until March. Im a member of the Appropriations Committee as well and I dont want us to be back here in February with another continuing resolution. We need to get out of the CR business and get to doing 12 appropriations bills. This is where we can prioritize spending, we can reduce spending, and perhaps most importantly we can rein in agencies, departments and bureaucrats with directions about how the money can be spent.</p><p>Sen. Moran (5:14): Congress every once in a while, we get some credit these days and its perhaps one of our greater successes  reining in regulations. Weve done that via CRA, a congressional process by which you can reject administration regulations, and we can only do that in a very narrow path. Where we can do that every year, every day is in appropriations by taking away money that comes from bad behavior or bad ideas. We need to get out of the CR and get into an appropriations process again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-107980377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFD-W1R1-JDJN-613F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

News media associations and journalism groups accuse the tech giants of jeopardizing the industry's economic survival by putting out news content on their platforms without paying for it. They will make their case against the companies at Tuesday's hearing of the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The big tech companies \"have gained a monopolistic position that lets them dominate the digital advertising marketplace and distribute massive amounts of content from news publishers on their platforms without paying to produce the content,\" the Save Journalism Project said in a statement.</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\" \"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>In a Capitol steeped in partisanship, inflamed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report and Democrats' intensifying probes of President Donald Trump, the House Judiciary Committee's investigation of tech market power stands out. Not only is it bipartisan, but it's also the first such review by Congress of a sector that for more than a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment _ with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business.</p><p>These are monopolies,\" Rep. David Cicilline said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, who heads the antitrust subcommittee and is leading the hearing, vowed that the panel will broadly investigate the digital marketplace and \"the dominance of large technology platforms,\" with an eye toward legislative action to increase competition. \"We know the problems; they're easy to diagnose,\" Cicilline said. \"Shaping the solutions is going to be more difficult.\" Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,'' but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what [the Europeans] are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations. Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated. Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back,\"Walmart is much larger.\" And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it ``will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\"</p><p>In hearings and closed-door work over coming months, lawmakers in the House aim to unpeel the complex onion of the tech industry's dominance. They are expected to summon the chief executives of the major companies to appear before the panel. Not showing up, as some CEOs have done in the past, is unlikely to be tolerated.</p><p>\"There could be something really useful\" to emerge as legislation, said Allen Grunes, who led merger investigations at the Justice Department as an antitrust attorney. Lawmakers could address, for example, the galloping acquisition of small companies by the tech giants or craft an update of antitrust laws to apply better to complex tech behemoths, suggested Grunes, a co-founder and attorney at the Konkurrenz Group in Washington.</p><p>\"It's not illegal to be a monopoly,\" he said. \"But it's wrong for someone at the top of the hill to kick the people off who are trying to climb it.\" - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2238606910</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFT-TXS1-DY0W-448N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,'' but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what [the Europeans] are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations. Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated. Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back,\"Walmart is much larger.\" And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it ``will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\"</p><p>In hearings and closed-door work over coming months, lawmakers in the House aim to unpeel the complex onion of the tech industry's dominance. They are expected to summon the chief executives of the major companies to appear before the panel. Not showing up, as some CEOs have done in the past, is unlikely to be tolerated.</p><p>\"There could be something really useful\" to emerge as legislation, said Allen Grunes, who led merger investigations at the Justice Department as an antitrust attorney. Lawmakers could address, for example, the galloping acquisition of small companies by the tech giants or craft an update of antitrust laws to apply better to complex tech behemoths, suggested Grunes, a co-founder and attorney at the Konkurrenz Group in Washington.</p><p>\"It's not illegal to be a monopoly,\" he said. \"But it's wrong for someone at the top of the hill to kick the people off who are trying to climb it.\" - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB1-N0Y1-DXMS-83TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is complex and fragmented, both globally and by subject matter, making it difficult for technology providers to navigate. Almost weekly there are new headlines warning of risks and perils of 'big tech' and misuse of data. Now, more than ever, it is important to ensure public trust in technology, its providers, and to advocate for global standards.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This series will help businesses navigate these complexities and approach compliance comprehensively, by spotlighting the different issues impacting technology providers.</p><p>Wherefore technology regulation? Rebuilding trust in the wake of the techlash</p><p>It is safe to say that the 'techlash' has well and truly arrived. It seems that barely a week passes without a new headline warning of the risks and perils of 'big tech' and the misuse of data. We are arguably at an inflection point  a recognition that the impact of technology on society is not confined to one sector or industry, but has become truly embedded in (and disrupted) all aspects of daily life. It has never been more important to ensure public trust in technology and its providers, and it has never been clearer that such trust is built on shaky foundations. It is no wonder that calls for regulatory action are increasingly being met with governmental responses.</p><p>Although the current approach is complex and fragmented (both globally and, often, by subject matter), there is no time to wait for global consensus to emerge. Businesses in every sector will need to monitor and approach compliance comprehensively, holistically, and with an eye towards driving standardisation over time in order to remain ready to respond to the digital age.</p><p>From a policy perspective, today's US-based technology industry was born and evolved in an era of comparatively 'permissionless innovation'. In this vision, the internet itself was a global, borderless playground where anything was possible, and anyone could invent the 'next big thing' with minimal barriers to entry and without the need to navigate a complex web of local and overseas laws. Seeking to control or place limits on the industry, and indeed the internet itself, could thus stifle the atmosphere of innovation that gave rise to today's tech giants. In technology parlance, the relative under-regulation of the industry and the companies operating within it was seen as a feature and not a bug.</p><p>The first clear indication that this state of affairs could not continue was seen in 2013, with the publication of documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. These documents detailed the extent of mass surveillance conducted by the US government, allegedly with the involvement, knowingly or otherwise, of US-based technology companies. This prompted an intense mistrust of US technology companies and the fear that such companies may no longer be capable of ensuring the privacy of personal data, particularly from government surveillance.</p><p>Then, in 2016, consulting firm Cambridge Analytica acquired and used the personal data of millions of Facebook users with the intention of (invisibly) influencing the political process. This scandal revealed more about how data and technology can be misused in ways that consumers might never have anticipated.</p><p>These revelations, and those that followed it, have clearly and significantly damaged trust in the technology industry, and have led to a fundamental rethink of the formerly 'light-touch' approach to its regulation. Regulation specific to, or targeted at, the industry and its participants is quickly proliferating, including regulations targeted at online harmful content, encryption and the use of algorithms and other data-driven technologies.</p><p>In general, the role of regulation in society is multi-faceted. It is often viewed as a way to monitor and regulate behaviour and prevent harm, whether to individuals, companies, states or society more broadly. This perspective applies equally to recent technology regulation, which often seeks to:</p><p> in the case of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and regulatory action taken by consumer protection regulators against technology companies, protect individuals in respect of the misuse of their data by others;in the case of regulation addressing online harmful content, protect society from the detrimental impacts of the wider proliferation of this content;in the case of regulation addressing critical national infrastructure, protect these key industries and infrastructure from hacking and security risks; andin the case of regulation addressing foreign direct investment, protect states from the perceived security risks of allowing such investment to proceed unchecked.</p><p>However, this narrower lens ignores the critical role that regulation can play in building trust. If implemented in a way that drives toward a coherent and holistic global standard, regulation can help industry participants to establish or maintain a social licence to operate, and accordingly create an environment for their activities to flourish.</p><p>For example, the nascent aviation industry could easily have been stalled due to consumer suspicion about safety and performance. Instead, the establishment of a clear and coherent regulatory environment (national and international, and supported through industry stakeholder participation, co-regulation, and co-operation) helped the industry to establish consumer trust and consequently, achieve widespread acceptance.</p><p>It is not difficult to envisage a similar role for technology regulation, and one that is sorely needed. The current technology regulatory landscape is changing rapidly, often in a way that responds reactively with the aim of regulating behaviour in response to specific events or concerns. This does not lessen the imperative for businesses to understand and comply with these regulations now.

The DOJ's loss in its effort to block the AT&amp;T/Time Warner merger and pending appeal will likely impact not only 'vertical' mergers but also horizontal tech mergers given the court's focus on the dynamic competitive landscape.

The hearings are also expected to address 'the role of intellectual property and competition policy in promoting innovation', a topic of great importance to tech and pharma industries.8 In a meeting with the press announcing the hearings, Simons said that the FTC's 'mantra is vigorous enforcement'.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote9\"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>Mike Swift, Leah Nylen, Kirk Victor, and Claude Marks, 'FTC's Simons promises \"vigorous enforcement\" amid review of antitrust, consumer protection in digital age', MLex (20 June 2018).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Pharmaceuticals and medical devices remain key focus for enforcers</p><p>The FTC's pro-enforcement cadence is particularly pronounced in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.</p><p>Since being elected, Trump has been outspoken, complaining about drug prices.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote10\"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p>Sarah Karlin-Smith, Politico, 'Trump Says Drug Industry \"Getting Away with Murder\"' (11 January 2017) (quoting a press conference of then president-elect Donald Trump), <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trumppress-conference-drug-industry-233475\">www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trumppress-conference-drug-industry-233475</url> ; Jessie Hellmann, The Hill, 'Trump to Congress: We Must Bring Down Drug Prices \"Immediately\"', (28 February 2017) (quoting President Trump's first address to Congress),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/321706-trump-to-congress-we-mustbring-down-drug-prices-immediately\">http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/321706-trump-to-congress-we-mustbring-down-drug-prices-immediately</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote> Trump's FTC appointees have also voiced concern about drug prices. Simons, for instance, stated during his confirmation hearing that he is 'very concerned' about price increases for prescription drugs and said he would look into creat- ing a task force to assess whether anticompetitive conduct is lead- ing to higher prices.

The DOJ refused to accept proffered behavioural rem- edies in reviewing AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner and instead sought a preliminary injunction to block the merger. The same district court judge that found the DOJ's consent agree- ment, resolving concerns raised by Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal to be 'in the public interest', denied the DOJ's effort to block AT&amp;T's acquisition of Time Warner, discussed further below. The FTC meanwhile appears to be changing its approach to remedies to resolve potential competition concerns in the pharma- ceutical industry. The director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition said during a speech in February 2018 that the FTC will be more sceptical of divestitures of pipeline assets:</p><p>[P]arties should expect that in transactions where complex pharmaceutical products . . . need to be divested, we will require the divestiture of contract manufacturing capabilities rather than other assets, such as pipeline products. Based on a history of problems with divestitures in this area, our view is that divesting ongoing manufacturing rather than products that haven't yet come to market places the greater risk of failure on the merging firms, rather than the American public.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote32\"/><label>32</label><bodyText><p>D Bruce Hoffman, Acting Director, Bureau of Competition, Fed.

Williams</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cyber attacks and security breaches have become an increasingly significant risk of doing business. During the first quarter of 2013, numerous social media sites and iconic news media outlets, including Facebook, Twitter, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal, announced incidents of targeted cyber attacks that put the privacy of their customers at risk. [1] Criminal groups have learned that there is money to be had in the \"profession\" of cyber hacking. Cybercrime is now a multimillion-dollar industry serving those interested in buying and selling stolen personal data. [2] The impact on businesses is staggering: In 2012, cybercrimes cost U.S.companies an average of $8.9 million. [3] When factoring in, among other things, cybersecurity insurance, lost business opportunities, lawsuits, and mitigating adverse publicity, costs can quickly accrue. As a result, some companies have also seen the merits of enlisting well-intentioned hackers to identify system vulnerabilities. In 2012, Googleannounced that it was willing to pay up to $1 million in rewards to those who were able to hack its GoogleChrome browser. [4] The well-known search engine explained that it wanted to test GoogleChrome's strength against cybercrime and identify any existing security flaws that could be fixed. [5]</p><p><br/>  An absence of federal legislation and cybersecurity infrastructure has forced companies like Googleto resort to such unusual measures in the war against cyber attacks and cybercrime. While most companies understand that their value is oftentimes tied to how well they keep consumers' information secure, they have, for years, been awaiting Congress' action in implementing heightened private sector/public sector cooperation and even cybersecurity regulation-that will not leave them bankrupt in the process. For the past several years, Congress has been unsuccessful in its attempts to adopt cybersecurity legislation that appeases both the corporate community and civil liberty groups. A heated debate has arisen concerning the best ways to regulate cybersecurity. While companies welcome input from the government about cybersecurity issues and efforts to combat cybercrime, they cringe at the notion of reporting obligations and mandates that require them to purge personal user information before sharing data concerning cybercrime threats with government entities. Instead, companies are demanding immunity from civil suits stemming from the disclosure of personal information during mandatory information sharing. Business owners are also weary of government involvement in the creation and implementation of business practices. On the other side of the debate lie technology-focused lobbying groups that dislike the promotion of information sharing without the burden of first cleansing data of all personal user information. They also reject the idea of an internet \"kill switch\" that would give government the power to shut down the internet in the event of a national emergency.<br/>  For years, Congress has failed to resolve the mandatory regulation versus voluntary cooperation debate. As a result, the business community has been left with the responsibility of protecting sensitive consumer data without governmental support or direction. Many believe 2013 will be the year of passage of the first cybersecurity law. This White Paper provides a review of failed prior legislative efforts, starting first with the Cybersecurity Act of 2010. This White Paper also provides a review of the Obama administration's approach to cybersecurity without legislation, namely: the Obama administration's Executive Order on cybersecurity and the measures it is taking to share governmental information about cyber threats with the corporate community.</p><p>The Cybersecurity Act of 2010</p><p>In April 2009, Democratic Senator John D. Rockefeller IV introduced the Cybersecurity Act of 2010. Senators Evan Bayh, Barbara Mikulski, Bill Nelson, and Olympia Snowe cosponsored the bill. [6] Senator Snowe was the only Republican among the bill's sponsors. The fairly expansive and comprehensive legislation focused on creating guidelines and regulations for cybersecurity in both the public and private sectors. [7] The proposed legislation placed significant reporting and compliance requirements on public companies and authorized the President to initiate rulemaking for \"critical infrastructure information systems\"-information systems considered so vital to the United States that their debilitation or destruction would have crippling effects on the nation's safety and security. [8] Further, the bill charged the President to design a comprehensive national cybersecurity emergency plan. [9] The proposed bill gave the President power to employ what would be known as an internet \"kill switch\" as part of the mandated cybersecurity emergency plan. [10] This \"kill switch\" would allow the President to shut down certain portions of the internet in cases of national emergency. [11]<br/>  The notion of the internet \"kill switch\" stirred opposition against the bill, creating concerns that it gave the President too much discretionary power and infringed on civil liberties. [12] Critics also argued that the bill required an unwarranted increase in government spending and contained a number of measures that were both disruptive and detrimental for the cybersecurity industry. [13] The reporting and compliance requirements on the private sector were also feared to have the same effect as the \"security frameworks\" provision in Sarbanes-Oxley, which burdened publicly traded companies with extensive documentation and expenses related to ensuring compliance. [14] As a result of these reporting requirements, the private sector believed it was being overregulated and underfunded. In the end, the bill never received widespread support and ultimately died in the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. [15]</p><p>The Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010</p><p>On June 10, 2010, Independent Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut introduced the Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010. [16] The bill was cosponsored by Democratic Senator Thomas Carper and Republican Senator Susan Collins. [17] The proposed legislation again directed the President to create a cybersecurity emergency plan that included the authority to seize control of, or even shut down, portions of the internet. [18] In an effort to allay fears that the bill provided the same controversial discretionary power for a presidential \"kill switch\" as that described in the Cybersecurity Act of 2010, Senators Lieberman and Collins issued a press release stressing that the bill only affected critical infrastructures-not the entire scope of the internet. [19] The press release failed to subdue critics' concerns, who warned that the bill created the potential for absolute power. [20]<br/>  The proposed legislation also required private companies, like broadband providers, search engines, and software firms, to comply with any emergency measures established by the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply meant facing hefty fines. [21] In addition, the new bill called for improvement to the nation's cybersecurity framework by establishing national committees on cybersecurity. [22] It also directed the President to appoint a single director of cybersecurity to oversee infrastructure implementation and national policy. [23]<br/>  What most differentiated this bill from its predecessor was its focus on business protections. The bill granted companies immunity from civil suits when they could show that a federal regulation or command caused a programming error that resulted in damage to customers. [24] Companies would also receive indemnification from the federal government when the harm caused to customers was the result of a federal emergency order. [25]<br/>  This time, the need for greater regulation in the private sector contributed to the bill's failure. In an effort to avoid the backlash against the reporting requirements contained in the Cybersecurity Act of 2010, the new bill shifted much of the burden from the private sector to the public sector by creating regulations and requirements that affected only the federal government. [26] While the bill tried to alleviate the financial burdens that would be placed on private industry, it was then criticized for leaving the private sector underregulated. Critics again attacked Congress for its failure to find a \"sweet spot\" between the business community and privacy interests.<br/>  Critics, including the nation's largest technology-focused lobbying group, were also focused on the possibility of another internet \"kill switch.\" [27] Despite receiving bipartisan support from Democratic Representative Jay Rockefeller and Republican Representative Olympia Snowe, the bill failed to gain widespread support. [28]</p><p>International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act</p><p>The International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act was introduced by Democratic New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in August 2011. [29] Gillibrand's proposed legislation focused on cybersecurity efforts overseas as it addressed multilateral efforts to prevent and investigate cybercrime on an international level. [30] The bill required the President to provide an annual presidential report to Congress that discussed foreign countries' use of information and communications technologies (\"ICT\") and their responses to cybercrime on a domestic and international level. [31] The bill also promoted foreign assistance to potential cybercrime havens by requiring the President to develop programs designed to combat cybercrime abroad in countries with low ICT levels. [32] Further, the bill directed the President to identify countries of cyber concern and impose restrictions on those countries that failed to comply with appropriate benchmarks. [33]<br/>  The internationally focused bill was referred to various subcommittees, including Foreign Affairs, Ways and Means, and Financial Services, but it ultimately fell victim to subcommittee debate and, like other attempts at cybersecurity regulation, never moved past the committee stage. [34]</p><p>The Cybersecurity Act of 2012</p><p>On February 14, 2012, Independent Senator Joe Lieberman made yet another attempt at cybersecurity legislation through the introduction of the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. [35] Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein, John Rockefeller, and Sheldon Whitehouse were cosponsors. [36] Unlike its predecessors, the bill's directives were aimed at federal agencies, instead of the President. The bill also aimed to protect critical U.S. infrastructure through joint collaboration between the government and the private sector. [37]<br/>  The proposed legislation directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult with owners of critical infrastructure and formulate an action plan to protect the nation's critical systems. [38] The bill also asked federal agencies to adopt best practices that would motivate employees to demonstrate leadership in cybersecurity. [39] Further, it required the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate with private sector and academic experts to develop risk management strategies. [40] The expansive legislation also touched on education programming. The bill required the development of new education and recruitment programs and directed the Secretary of Education to develop curriculum standards to include cybersecurity issues from elementary school through higher education. [41]<br/>  The Cybersecurity Act of 2012 encountered strong opposition from Republican senators, including Senator John McCain, who sided with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. [42] Opponents largely consisted of business leaders, who argued that the bill's regulations intruded into private business operations, thereby increasing private sector costs. [43] While businesses believed the bill gave the government too much power in regulating their own security, supporters of the bill contended that there could be no guarantees that companies would self-regulate if left to their own devices. [44] Republicans promptly initiated a filibuster in the Senate, and thus there was never a final vote on the measure. [45]</p><p>President Obama's Executive Order: \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity\"</p><p>Frustrated with Congress' lack of progress in adopting cybersecurity legislation, President Obama identified cybersecurity among the top issues to address in his second-term agenda. [46] On February 12, President Obama issued an Executive Order titled \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\" [47] The Executive Order was signed just hours before the President's State of the Union Address, in which he again highlighted the need for a cybersecurity framework.<br/>  The Executive Order dramatically broadened existing information sharing programs, making it easier for private companies in control of the nation's critical infrastructure to share information about cyber attacks with the government.<br/>  Section 9(a) of the Executive Order provides that within 150 days, i.e., by July 12, the Secretary of Homeland Security \"shall use risk-based approach to identify critical infrastructure where a cybersecurity incident could reasonably result in catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, e-commerce security, or national security.\" The Section includes a carve-out for \"commercial information technology services.\" Section 9(e) provides that the Secretary is to notify confidentially the owners and operators of critical infrastructure of their designation as such and shall provide to them the basis for that determination. The owner and operators may request reconsideration.<br/>  Section 2 of the Executive Order defines the key term \"Critical Infrastructure\" as \"systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\" Debates have already broken out and lobbying commenced regarding which firms will be found to provide \"critical infrastructure\" and which firms will be exempt \"commercial information technology service\" providers. For example, telecommunication service providers such as AT&amp;T and Verizon have questioned why firms that provide digital services-such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft-should be exempted. [48] Marcus Sachs, Vice President of National Security Policy for Verizon, argues that email is \"critical infrastructure\": \"If email went away this afternoon, we would all come to a stop. Hell yeah, email is critical.\" [49] Others add that it is not realistic to expect to protect telecommunications \"critical infrastructure\" unless information technology products that use telecommunications networks are also considered because hackers will naturally attack the weakest link in any network.<br/>  Section 7 provides that the Secretary of Commerce shall direct the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to lead the development of a framework to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure (the \"Cybersecurity Framework\"). The Director is ordered to publish a preliminary version of the Cybersecurity Framework within 240 days,i.e., by September 30. The final version is due within one year,i.e., by February 12, 2014.<br/>  Section 8 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a \"voluntary program\" to support the adoption of the Cybersecurity Framework by owners and operators of critical infrastructure and other interested parties. In particular, Section 8(d) directs the Secretary to \"coordinate establishment of a set of incentives designed to promote participation in the program.\" Section 8(e) provides that the Secretary of Defense and Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, shall make recommendations to the President and others \"on the feasibility, security benefits and relative merits of incorporating security standards, into acquisition planning and contract administration.\"<br/>  Under Section 10(a), within 90 days of publication of the preliminary Cybersecurity Framework, i.e., by December 29, various federal agencies are directed to issue a report to the President \"that states whether or not the agency has clear authority to establish requirements based upon the Cybersecurity Framework to sufficiently address current and projected cyber risks to critical infrastructure, the existing authorities identified, and any additional authority required.\" Under Section 10(b), if current regulatory requirements are deemed insufficient, then within 90 days of the publication of the final Cybersecurity Framework, i.e., by May 13, 2014, the agencies are directed to propose risk-based, efficient and coordinated actions to mitigate cyber risks. Under Section 10(c), within two years after the publication of the final Cybersecurity Framework, the agencies are directed, \"in consultation with owners and operators of critical infrastructure, [to] report to CMB or any critical infrastructure subject to ineffective, conflicting or excessively burdensome cybersecurity requirements.\"<br/>  In an effort to address the fact that Executive Orders generally lack any actual legal enforcement, President Obama offered incentives to companies to voluntarily adopt the standards initiated under the Cybersecurity Framework. [50] Despite this work-around, critics argued that the Executive Order failed to provide companies with sufficient protections that would induce any voluntary cooperation. [51] Private companies willing to participate faced a significant risk: Information sharing with the government could lead to additional liabilities and lawsuits because the data that would be given to the federal government could include private information from customers. As a result, critics questioned whether companies will participate without additional protections and safeguards, such as legal immunity from civil suits. [52] Regardless, analysts predicted that the President's Executive Order would serve as the starting point for congressional action on meaningful cybersecurity legislation. [53]</p><p>CISPA</p><p>On February 12-the very same day that President Obama issued his Executive Order on cybersecurity-Republican Representative Mike Rogers and Democratic Representative Dutch Ruppersberger introduced the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (\"CISPA\"). [54] The proposed bill required the Director of National Intelligence to establish procedures that would allow the federal government, including the intelligence community, to share cyber threat information with the private sector. [55] Upon receipt of such information, private entities would thereafter be prohibited from further disclosure of the cyber threat information to third parties. [56] The bill also allowed companies to pass user information to the federal government and absolved private sector firms of the responsibility or requirement to remove personal information before sharing it with the government. [57] Further, CISPA provided broad legal immunity to companies that collected and shared inaccurate cyber threat information, as long as they were able to prove that the information was provided in good faith. [58]<br/>  Allowing companies to pass unsanitized user information to the government, however, stirred significant outcry from civil liberty groups, which argued that the bill could lead to significant violations of privacy rights. [59] The broad grant of immunity to cooperating companies also initiated opposition from the White House. [60] The administration argued that the scope of liability protections granted to businesses was too broad and that more targeted liability protections were needed. [61] On April 18, the House of Representatives passed CISPA with a vote of 288-127, despite strong opposition from privacy advocate groups and a veto threat from the White House. [62]<br/>  Currently, CISPA's future looks grim as it sits stalled in Senate subcommittee. Privacy rights lobbying groups and internet activists have come together in strong opposition of the bill, declaring a violation of privacy rights. [63] Outspoken Democratic senators, like Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, have vowed to fight the bill and prevent its passage. Understanding and accepting the bill's likely demise, both Senator Jay Rockefeller and Georgia Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss have decided to \"start from scratch,\" and are working on new legislation aimed at bridging the gap between corporate interests and privacy rights. [64]<br/>  While legislators continue to search for the seemingly elusive balance between effective cybersecurity regulation, business interests, and privacy protections, businesses are left to fend off cybercrimes on their own. As cybercrimes increase, businesses will be forced to focus their attention and resources on collateral business obligations, rather than the promotion of their respective services and products. Googleillustrates one of the most innovative ways in which to engage the battle against cybercrime, and it also underscores the importance of cybersecurity. In an effort to avoid the unwanted costs and distractions associated with data breaches, businesses must now make it a priority to be vigilant in their efforts to combat cybercrime. The first steps in establishing proper cyber protections should begin with conducting risk assessments to identify system vulnerabilities. Identifying internal weaknesses will assist businesses in establishing internal policies and protections that will strengthen their security measures and fortify their data.<br/>  Further attempts at passing cybersecurity legislation are expected for the remainder of 2013. In order to successfully do so, Congress will need to offer substantive guidance to those businesses seeking ways to improve their cybersecurity without overstepping in internal business management and day-to-day operations. Further, it will need to find equilibrium between business interests and privacy protections. Until effective cybersecurity legislation comes to fruition, businesses must understand that it is up to them to protect their consumers, and their ultimate bottom line.</p><p>Banking Regulators Urge Banks to Take Action</p><p>U.S. regulators are not waiting on Congress to take action to combat cyber attacks. For example, federal officials and the banking industry are preparing for a major cyber \"war game\" exercise titled \"Quantum Dawn 2\" involving banking regulators, the Department of Homeland Security, and major banks and securities firms represented by the Securities Industry and Financial Management Association. [65] Moreover, Treasury Department officials and other officials have been conducting classified and nonclassified briefings with bank officials. [66] Finally, federal financial regulators are advising bank executives to change the way they think about cyber attacks and to consider them as they do more traditional risks, such as credit and interest rate risk, when they make strategy decisions. Taking it a step further, federal regulators are telling banks that they will be judged on their preparations against cyber attacks when regulators evaluate their operational risks. [67]</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The advice and warnings that federal financial regulators are now providing to bank executives should be heeded by all private sector firms. While the private sector should remain involved in congressional attempts to pass cybersecurity legislation, it should not wait on legislation to take action. The risks are simply too great.</p><p>Footnotes</p><p>[ 1] Joanna Stern, \"Facebook Hacked; No User Data Compromised,\" ABC News, Feb. 15, 2013, <url normalizedValue=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/facebook-hacked-month-user-datacompromised/story?id=18515870#.UYFVeKK-1Bk;\">http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/facebook-hacked-month-user-datacompromised/story?id=18515870#.UYFVeKK-1Bk;</url> Dan Milano, \"250,000 Twitter Accounts Hacked: Don't Panic, Here's What to Do,\" ABC News, Feb. 1, 2013,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2013/02/250000-twitter-accounts-hacked-dont-panic-heres-what-to-do;\">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2013/02/250000-twitter-accounts-hacked-dont-panic-heres-what-to-do;</url> Jethro Mullen, \"New York Times, Wall Street Journal Say Chinese Hackers Broke into Computers,\" N.Y.

The bipartisan bill, cited as the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act, is intended to capture major online platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter that offer \"free\" services to users while monetizing user data through targeted advertising.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Who Would Be Subject to the Law</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Specifically, the proposal applies to \"commercial data operators,\" defined as consumer online services providers or data brokers that: Generate a material amount of revenue from the use, collection, processing, sale or sharing of user data; andHave more than 100 million unique monthly users in the United States for a majority of the months in the previous one-year period. </p><p>New Obligations for In-Scope Operators</p><p> Frequent Disclosures to Users (every 90 days) In-scope operators must make the following disclosures to users on a routine basis (not less frequently than every 90 days): Economic value assessment - an assessment of the economic value the operator places on the user's data.Information - information about the types of data collected from the users, whether by the operator or by a third party under a contract with the operator, and the ways in which the data is used (if such use is not directly or exclusively related to the online service provided to the user).  User's Right to Delete Data In-scope operators must provide users with a mechanism by which users can delete all, or individual fields, of the data that the operator possesses or controls with respect to the user. The deletion requirement is subject to certain exceptions, including legal obligations of the operator, the existence of legal claims, and detection and prevention of security incidents or illegal activity. Disclosures to the SEC In-scope issuers must disclose in their annual or quarterly SEC reports the total value of all the data they hold and any contracts with third parties for the collection of user data through their online service.Within one year of the law's enactment, in-scope issuers would be required to provide additional disclosures, including, among other things: measures in place to protect the user data; an assessment of the risks associated with storing the data; each discrete revenue-generating operation that relies on user data; the entry into any contract valued at more than $10 million related to collection or sharing of user data; and the amount of revenue derived during the reporting period from collecting, processing, selling, using or sharing user data. </p><p>Valuation of User Data</p><p> The bill directs the SEC, in consultation with standards setting organizations, to develop methodologies for calculating the value of user data. It notes that distinct methods may be needed to calculate the value of data for different uses, sectors and business models.</p><p>Potential Impact</p><p> Users have generally been encouraged to view online platforms as \"free\" services, but the DASHBOARD Act may change this. The bill attempts to increase transparency and put a dollar figure on what a user's participation in the service is worth to the service provider. With this information, users will be able to decide whether, in fact, they are \"paying\" too much for access. The bill does not attempt to redistribute any of this value. Users will not receive remuneration for data, but they will be informed that this value exists and potentially be able to make more informed decisions as a result.While the bill's prospects are unclear, it comes in the midst of several overlapping dynamics facing by the tech industry: a push for a federal privacy law, a developing view in the U.S. of personal data as a discrete asset and increasing scrutiny of the large technology companies by antitrust regulators. Push for a Federal Privacy Law. In the wake of the full implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the enactment of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) (which will go into effect January 1, 2020), U.S. lawmakers have been  actively discussing a comprehensive federal data privacy law. While it remains to be seen whether any bill can garner the necessary consensus to get through Congress, consumer groups are pushing for any federal bill to include transparency and control features such as the requirements in this bill to provide consumers with information about what data has been collected about them and a right to request that their data be deleted. Such features are also found in the GDPR and CCPA, as well as in Brazil's new privacy law. Enforcement of the DASHBOARD Act would fall within the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under Section 5 of the FTC Act, under which the FTC investigates \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\" In addition, the FTC would be responsible for issuing regulations under the act, a feature consistent with the FTC's  desire for targeted rulemaking authority under any federal privacy legislation. However, the bill does not contain certain additional consumer protection authority the FTC has been lobbying for, such as the  authority to impose civil penalties.Personal Data as an Asset. The bill's requirement to disclose the value of data is consistent with a developing view in the United States of personal data as a discrete asset that consumers may sell (or choose not to sell). This complements certain provisions in the CCPA, such as the provision permitting consumers to opt out from the sale of their data and the provision giving them the right to equal treatment. Under the latter, while covered businesses are prohibited from discriminating against consumers who exercise rights under the CCPA (e.g., the business cannot deny them goods or services or charge them a different price), certain discrimination is permitted - i.e., the CCPA explicitly allows businesses to charge consumers a different price or rate, or provide them with a different level or quality for goods or services, if such difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer's data. Knowing the value of one's data permits a more intelligent determination of whether discrimination is fair.Antitrust Scrutiny. From an antitrust standpoint, the bill's sponsors have indicated that the required transparency about the value of the user data could encourage competition and make it easier for agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission to identify anticompetitive practices. The two senators have been outspoken advocates of regulating big tech companies, and recently collaborated on a \"Do Not Track\" bill, which would allow users of online services to opt out of any non-essential online data tracking (that is not necessary for the service to properly work). </p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Over the past few years, state AGs have taken an increasingly active role in privacy and data security matters, using their broad consumer protection authority to enforce rapidly evolving state laws and investigate data security lapses. Even more recently, state AGs have begun to step out of their typical enforcement roles to pursue policy and legislative initiatives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite signs of momentum, Congress is unlikely to pass any major new national cybersecurity legislation this election year. Companies are thus likely looking at another year where privacy and data security enforcement remains largely in the hands of state AGs. Here are three trends to watch out for in 2020.</p><p>More AG notification laws.</p><p>In order to wield their consumer protection authority, state AGs need to keep abreast of data breaches. It's no surprise that in 2019 we saw several states pass or expand legislation requiring that state AGs be notified after a cybersecurity incident (including Massachusetts, New York, Arkansas, Illinois, Oregon, Texas, and Washington). We predict this trend will continue in 2020.</p><p>Currently, upwards of twenty-five states require<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>Including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.</p></bodyText></footnote> some form of AG notification after a breach. Some notification statutes are triggered by the number of residents affected (as few as 250 residents in South Dakota, and as many as 1,000 in Arizona), whereas others require disclosure no matter the size of the breach. The required contents of these notification can vary as well. For instance, in 2019 Massachusetts expanded its AG notification law to require that companies disclose:</p><p> A detailed description of the nature and circumstances of the breach;The number of Massachusetts residents affected;The person responsible for the incident, if known;The type of personal information compromised, including, but not limited to:  Social Security numberDriver's license numberFinancial account numberCredit or debit card numberor other data; Whether the company maintains a written information security program;All the steps the company has taken or plans to take relating to the incident, including updating the written information security program;Whether a report has been made to law enforcement and whether law enforcement is investigating the incident; andWhere applicable, certification of credit monitoring services pursuant to Chapter 93H, section 3A.</p><p>AG notifications add another layer of complexity to your breach response. If you experience a breach, you will need to track the relevant deadlines, and draft and send a notification that meets the statutory requirements applicable to your state. Depending on the state, the AG may also have some law-enforcement responsibility related to data breaches, meaning you could be looking at an investigation if your breach is severe.</p><p>Because state laws in this area are constantly changing, it is important to stay current on breach notification laws in your state(s).</p><p>Ramping up the pressure on federal regulators.</p><p>In 2019, AGs in several states ramped up the pressure on federal regulators to police big tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Google. Over the last few years, there has been a growing feeling in many quarters that the federal government has adopted a laissez faire (and overly business-friendly) attitude toward consumer data privacy. Increasingly, state AGs and other state regulators are picking up the perceived slack at the federal level.</p><p>For example, in June, nine state AGs and the District of Columbia sued to block the T-Mobile/Sprint merger, a move that later gained support from FTC and DOJ. In July, thirty-nine state AGs signed onto a letter requesting that the FTC take several steps to better protect consumer privacy. More recently, on September 6, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) announced that a bipartisan coalition that would be investigating whether Facebook \"may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising.\" And on September 10, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) announced that a bipartisan coalition of 50 attorneys general investigating Google's alleged market power in search and digital advertising as well as potential abuses of consumer privacy.</p><p>Pressure from state AGs throughout 2019 likely contributed to the FTC's record-breaking $5 billion settlement with Facebook, its $175 million settlement with Google's YouTube (where the FTC was joined by New York Attorney General's Office), and DOJ's recent announcement that it was investigating all four big tech giants, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon. While Congress is unlikely to make any big legislative moves during an election year, we expect that won't stop state AGs from continuing to turn up the pressure in 2020.</p><p>Increased power to state AGs.</p><p>Finally, watch out for state laws that increase AGs' roles in data privacy and security enforcement. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a case in point. The law, which became effective January 1, 2020, authorizes the California attorney general's office to draft implementing regulations and bring enforcement actions. In October 2019, California AG Xavier Becerra released the long-awaited draft regulations. Enforcement will begin six months after the regulations are finalized or on July 1, 2020, whichever comes first. We expect that other states will follow California's example and give their AGs greater privacy watchdog power.</p><p>Another such example is the federal Mind Your Business Act, which was introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) in October 2019. The Act allows state AGs to bring a civil action on behalf of residents if they have reason to believe residents' interests \"[have] been or [are] being threatened or adversely affected\" by a practice that violates the FTC regulations. Although the Act is unlikely to become law, it is indicative of the trend toward giving AGs greater enforcement tools</p><p>To view Foley Hoag's State AG Insights blog click  here</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

We really appreciate your work and as Andrew said, after my remarks they are going to put on a presentation of the China Initiative, which I think you'll find very interesting, so if you have the time I urge you to stay for that. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum - especially Elaine Didier - for hosting this event. I also thank the Ford Presidential Foundation and its Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, it's hard to put together an event like this, but in the current circumstances it's especially challenging and I really appreciate it. And I really appreciate all of you who've come, I know many have come from around the state and I appreciate the effort that was made to be here for these remarks.</p><p>I was last in Grand Rapids, it would be 30 years ago John. John Smietanka, from here, was one of my Principal Deputy when I was Deputy Attorney General and stayed on while I was Attorney General. He was U.S. Attorney here in the Western District, so John it's great to see you here. I feel a special bond to the Ford Administration so it's appropriate to be here today for these remarks, because I started out in the CIA in 1973 and President Ford took office and because of what was going on at the agency, I had the privilege of working closely with many of the superb people that he brought into government. Many of whom I had the opportunity to work with over the years, several of whom were my mentors. One of the people I met was the Attorney General, at that time, Ed Levi, who President Ford made Attorney General. His portrait is up in my conference room and his grandson Will Levi is my Chief of Staff, so as I say, I feel a special closeness with the Ford Administration even though I wasn't a political appointee in that administration. Many of the political appointees that I work with over the years really cut their teeth during the Ford Administration. </p><p>I'm privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century and that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue, will control the future. Since the 1890's, at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess, has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. It's because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history, but turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What's at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen- which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren?</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that the days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over. And last week, the FBI Director Chris Wray, described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities. In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. Now, Chris Wray, told me that shortly after his speech last week, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim to be despicable, but I'll settle for especially disgusting. But no matter how the Chinese seek to characterize it I do hope that my speech and Mike Pompeo speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is fitting that were here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest echelons of the government at the dawn of America's reengagement with China, which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972, and three years later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. And even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then minority leader Gerald Ford wrote: If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people... this last impression - of the reality of China's colossal potential - is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder. It is now nearly fifty years later and the pressing pondering as of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China's remarkable rise had a famous motto: hide your strength and bide your time. That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980, to nearly 20 percent today. And by some estimates based on purchasing parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. China is no longer hiding it strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg-an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent technological superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Chinese Communist Party's Made in China 2025 initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles, and many other technologies. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, Made in China 2025 sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether. </p><p>Made in China 2025 is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and industrial espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China. </p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats. </p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Although billed as foreign aid, in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism. </p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its Digital Silk Road initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields, like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill, much like chess or the even more complex Chinese game, Go. In 2017, Beijing unveiled its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan, a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China, in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation.</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer - allowing us to serve as the world's arsenal of democracy. China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's arsenal of dictatorship.</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion. </p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again. The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers - including American companies - from exporting them to other countries that needed them. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments.</p><p>China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively creating their own competitors.</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply, Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as APIs. As one Defense Health Agency official noted, [s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States], it could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they've used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a high-value-added-industry and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies. </p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, [t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Chinese Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps. </p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders. Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence - even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion. </p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood's actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the Ancient One, a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people. Or, as the Chinese government might say, [w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to please the CCP. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party. </p><p>The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market - both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only three percent five years earlier. </p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood - and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, [e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood. Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem. Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies, such as Cisco, helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China - the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud. </p><p>Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. During the gun fight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them, shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones and we thought that suggested that there may be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones. And for four and a half months we tried to get in, without any help at all from Apple. Apple failed to give us any help getting into the cell phones. We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future, where we found communications with Al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack. Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. And what we've asked for is a warrant - when we have a warrant from a court - that we should be able to get into because cellphones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives - efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view. </p><p>As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or U.S. politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a friendly face on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from these American businessmen is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed. </p><p>America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the guanxi - or system of influential social networking - necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the agents of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship, and their political or other similar activities, by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations in the United States. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes, which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands. </p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength. </p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a stupid mistake. Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures at the facility during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks. </p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarter's earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell - later Justice Powell - sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. [T]he time has come, he said, indeed, it is long overdue - for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it. So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement. </p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations. Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm and how long they will hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule. </p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before and we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we - the American people, the American government, and American business together - can do it again. Our freedom depends on it. </p><p>Source: U.S. Department of Justice</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2424771305</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D3-HGM1-JBHT-D20X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Communist Party-China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gerald R Ford Presidential Museum &amp;

Ford Presidential Museum</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you very much, Andrew for your very kind introduction and I'd like to say that I really appreciate the work that Andrew and Matt, our U.S. Attorneys for the Eastern and Western District of Michigan our doing here for the people of Michigan and all the law enforcement community from Michigan, that is here today. We really appreciate your work and as Andrew said, after my remarks they are going to put on a presentation of the China Initiative, which I think you'll find very interesting, so if you have the time I urge you to stay for that. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum - especially Elaine Didier - for hosting this event. I also thank the Ford Presidential Foundation and its Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, it's hard to put together an event like this, but in the current circumstances it's especially challenging and I really appreciate it. And I really appreciate all of you who've come, I know many have come from around the state and I appreciate the effort that was made to be here for these remarks.</p><p>I was last in Grand Rapids, it would be 30 years ago John. John Smietanka, from here, was one of my Principal Deputy when I was Deputy Attorney General and stayed on while I was Attorney General. He was U.S. Attorney here in the Western District, so John it's great to see you here. I feel a special bond to the Ford Administration so it's appropriate to be here today for these remarks, because I started out in the CIA in 1973 and President Ford took office and because of what was going on at the agency, I had the privilege of working closely with many of the superb people that he brought into government. Many of whom I had the opportunity to work with over the years, several of whom were my mentors. One of the people I met was the Attorney General, at that time, Ed Levi, who President Ford made Attorney General. His portrait is up in my conference room and his grandson Will Levi is my Chief of Staff, so as I say, I feel a special closeness with the Ford Administration even though I wasn't a political appointee in that administration. Many of the political appointees that I work with over the years really cut their teeth during the Ford Administration.</p><p>I'm privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century and that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue, will control the future. Since the 1890's, at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess, has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. It's because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history, but turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What's at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen- which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren?</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that the days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over. And last week, the FBI Director Chris Wray, described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities. In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. Now, Chris Wray, told me that shortly after his speech last week, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim to be despicable, but I'll settle for especially disgusting. But no matter how the Chinese seek to characterize it I do hope that my speech and Mike Pompeo speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is fitting that were here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest echelons of the government at the dawn of America's reengagement with China, which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972, and three years later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. And even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then minority leader Gerald Ford wrote: If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people... this last impression - of the reality of China's colossal potential - is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder. It is now nearly fifty years later and the pressing pondering as of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China's remarkable rise had a famous motto: hide your strength and bide your time. That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980, to nearly 20 percent today. And by some estimates based on purchasing parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. China is no longer hiding it strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg-an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent technological superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Chinese Communist Party's Made in China 2025 initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles, and many other technologies. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, Made in China 2025 sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.</p><p>Made in China 2025 is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and industrial espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China.</p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.</p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Although billed as foreign aid, in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.</p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its Digital Silk Road initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields, like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill, much like chess or the even more complex Chinese game, Go. In 2017, Beijing unveiled its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan, a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China, in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation.</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer - allowing us to serve as the world's arsenal of democracy. China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's arsenal of dictatorship.</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.</p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again. The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers - including American companies - from exporting them to other countries that needed them. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments.</p><p>China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively creating their own competitors.</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply, Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as APIs. As one Defense Health Agency official noted, [s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States], it could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they've used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a high-value-added-industry and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.</p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, [t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Chinese Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.</p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders. Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence - even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.</p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood's actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the Ancient One, a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people. Or, as the Chinese government might say, [w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to please the CCP. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market - both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only three percent five years earlier.</p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood - and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, [e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood. Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem. Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies, such as Cisco, helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China - the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud.</p><p>Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. During the gun fight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them, shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones and we thought that suggested that there may be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones. And for four and a half months we tried to get in, without any help at all from Apple. Apple failed to give us any help getting into the cell phones. We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future, where we found communications with Al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack. Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. And what we've asked for is a warrant - when we have a warrant from a court - that we should be able to get into because cellphones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives - efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.</p><p>As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or U.S. politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a friendly face on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from these American businessmen is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.</p><p>America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the guanxi - or system of influential social networking - necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the agents of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship, and their political or other similar activities, by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations in the United States. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes, which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands.</p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength.</p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a stupid mistake. Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures at the facility during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.</p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarter's earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell - later Justice Powell - sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. [T]he time has come, he said, indeed, it is long overdue - for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it. So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.</p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations. Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm and how long they will hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule.</p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before and we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we - the American people, the American government, and American business together - can do it again. Our freedom depends on it.</p><p>Source: U.S. Department of Justice</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D0-9WP1-DXMS-81PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He convened Thursday's White House Social Media Summit of like-minded critics of Big Tech, excluding representatives from the very platforms he exploits.</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>In remarks to the participants, whom Trump called \"online journalists and influencers,\" Trump said, \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people.\"</p><p>\"You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter,\" he said.</p><p>Greater scrutiny</p><p>Trump signaled tough actions ahead by his administration against big tech companies.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign, and a bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump's volley of Twitter messages Thursday had familiar targets - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals - that have proven resonance with his political base. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020. He hailed himself as \"so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!\"</p><p>A \"big subject\" of the summit would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,\" Trump said in his tweets.</p><p>\"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he said.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. By policy, Twitter prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. weighed in on the subject Wednesday, tweeting, \"Twitter: We won't allow pro-life groups like (at)LiveAction to run ads on our 'platform' &amp; if you're a conservative we might ban you for 1st Amendment protected speech that we arbitrarily deem 'offensive.'\"</p><p>Response to accusations</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday. \"Internet companies depend upon their users' trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.\"</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has been sharply critical of the big companies for reasons of their market dominance and effect on competition. He leads a House Judiciary subcommittee that has opened a bipartisan probe into the tech giants' market conduct.</p><p>\"If someone wants to show me some empirical data, instead of some alt-right member's paranoid claims, I'd appreciate it,\" Cicilline said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter and uses the platform almost daily to speak directly to them. He has a knack for tweeting outrageous, divisive or tongue-in-cheek missives that spur frenzied reactions from the mainstream press.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has accused Twitter, without evidence, of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\" - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK0-2M21-JB5P-J340-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He convened Thursday's White House Social Media Summit of like-minded critics of Big Tech, excluding representatives from the very platforms he exploits.</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base. </p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>In remarks to the participants, whom Trump called \"online journalists and influencers,\" Trump said, \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people.\"</p><p>\"You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter,\" he said.</p><p>Greater scrutiny</p><p>Trump signaled tough actions ahead by his administration against big tech companies.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign, and a bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump's volley of Twitter messages Thursday had familiar targets - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals - that have proven resonance with his political base. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020. He hailed himself as \"so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!\"</p><p>A \"big subject\" of the summit would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,\" Trump said in his tweets.</p><p>\"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he said.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. By policy, Twitter prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. weighed in on the subject Wednesday, tweeting, \"Twitter: We won't allow pro-life groups like (at)LiveAction to run ads on our 'platform' &amp; if you're a conservative we might ban you for 1st Amendment protected speech that we arbitrarily deem 'offensive.'\"</p><p>Response to accusations</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday. \"Internet companies depend upon their users' trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.\"</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has been sharply critical of the big companies for reasons of their market dominance and effect on competition. He leads a House Judiciary subcommittee that has opened a bipartisan probe into the tech giants' market conduct.</p><p>\"If someone wants to show me some empirical data, instead of some alt-right member's paranoid claims, I'd appreciate it,\" Cicilline said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter and uses the platform almost daily to speak directly to them. He has a knack for tweeting outrageous, divisive or tongue-in-cheek missives that spur frenzied reactions from the mainstream press.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has accused Twitter, without evidence, of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\" - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2257392763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF8-W8C1-DY0W-44JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>NATION OF ISLAM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He has accused Twitter of making it ``very hard for people to join me'' and ``very much harder for me to get out the message.'' He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.</p><p>Trump frequently lashes out at the press, and did so again Thursday, tweeting that, ``Fake News is not as important, or as powerful, as Social Media'' and predicting outlets ``will quickly go out of business'' when he leaves office. He asserted that ``even Social Media would be driven out of business'' if he loses in 2020.</p><p>The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. But while some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet ``offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.''</p><p>Its members' platforms ``don't have a political ideology or political bias,'' the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies ``succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.''</p><p>Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said ``We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.''</p><p>Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants' market dominance. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK0-2M21-JB5P-J33C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

America wake up\", NBC News reported</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter soon after removed the tweet and replaced it with a gray box that says, \"This Tweet is no longer available\".</p><p>A cure for COVID-19, the deadly disease caused by the coronavirus, doesn't exist, and scientists have been working on developing both a range of treatments and vaccines. They and the Trump administration are racing to have a vaccine ready by the end of the year.</p><p>Twitter announced early Tuesday, \"Tweets with the video are in violation of our COVID-19 misinformation policy.\"</p><p>Trump also retweeted tweets defending the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine, including one that accused Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, of misleading the public by dismissing the drug.</p><p>\"I have not been misleading the public under any circumstances,\" Fauci responded Tuesday morning on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" when asked for his reaction to Trump's retweets.</p><p>Fauci reiterated that the \"overwhelming prevailing clinical trials\" that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it's \"not effective\" in treating the coronavirus.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was temporarily locked out of his Twitter account on Tuesday after posting the same controversial video shared by Trump promoting hydroxychloroquine and saying people don't need to wear masks, said Andy Surabian, an adviser to the president's son. In a text message, Surabian added the president's son should be able to resume tweeting later in the day.</p><p>\"Twitter suspending Don Jr. for sharing a viral video of medical professionals discussing their views on Hydroxychloroquine is further proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,\" Surabian said in a statement, adding, \"It is beyond the pale for Twitter to silence someone for sharing the views of medical professionals who happen to dissent with their anti-Hydroxychloroquine narrative.\"</p><p>The American president had recently tried to take a more moderate approach to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>He conceded, for example, last week at one of his restarted coronavirus White House briefings that it will likely \"get worse before it gets better\". The president has also been touting the importance of wearing masks after dismissing them for months. Despite his change in tone, he pushed states to reopen on Monday as a number of experts are calling for states to shut down.</p><p>Twitter has been much more aggressive in recent months in either removing tweets posted by the president, fact-checking them in real time or even placing warning labels over them.</p><p>The social media giant first fact-checked a pair of tweets posted by Trump in May when he claimed there was \"NO WAY\" an election with boosted mail-in voting would be legitimate. Twitter added a fact-check label to both tweets.</p><p>A few days later, Trump signed an executive order that asked federal regulators to revisit a 1996 law that protects websites from liability for what their users post.</p><p>And then a day after he signed the executive order, Twitter put a tweet from Trump behind a warning label, which said that the president had violated its rules against glorifying violence when he tweeted about protests over the death of George Floyd.</p><p>In June, Twitter and Facebook removed a video posted to Trump's social media accounts of a \"racist baby\" because of a copyright claim from one of the children's parents. Twitter labeled the video \"manipulated media\".</p><p>Trump stood by his comments on hydroxychloroquine at a press briefing later Tuesday, telling reporters \"I happen to believe in it\".</p><p>\"I would take it. I, as you know, took it for a 14-day period, and I'm here,\" Trump stated, noting, \"It didn't get me, and it's not going to - hopefully - hurt anybody.\"</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration has recommended against taking hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat or prevent COVID-19.</p><p>Trump announced in May that he was taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent contracting the virus.</p><p>Trump abruptly ended the briefing Tuesday after a reporter asked him why he would share content to his Twitter account from a doctor who has pushed wildly false medical information including that doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens and that doctors are trying to create a vaccine to make people immune from becoming religious.</p><p>\"She was on air along with many other doctors. They were being fans of hydroxychloroquine, and I thought she was very impressive in the sense that - from where she came, I don't know which county she comes from - but she said that she's had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients, and I thought her voice was an important voice. But I know nothing about her,\" Trump stated before leaving the briefing room. - FNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2428105713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-78J1-JBHT-D00F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"848\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

America wake up\", NBC News reported</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter soon after removed the tweet and replaced it with a gray box that says, \"This Tweet is no longer available\".</p><p>A cure for COVID-19, the deadly disease caused by the coronavirus, doesn't exist, and scientists have been working on developing both a range of treatments and vaccines. They and the Trump administration are racing to have a vaccine ready by the end of the year.</p><p>Twitter announced early Tuesday, \"Tweets with the video are in violation of our COVID-19 misinformation policy.\"</p><p>Trump also retweeted tweets defending the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine, including one that accused Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, of misleading the public by dismissing the drug.</p><p>\"I have not been misleading the public under any circumstances,\" Fauci responded Tuesday morning on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" when asked for his reaction to Trump's retweets.</p><p>Fauci reiterated that the \"overwhelming prevailing clinical trials\" that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it's \"not effective\" in treating the coronavirus.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was temporarily locked out of his Twitter account on Tuesday after posting the same controversial video shared by Trump promoting hydroxychloroquine and saying people don't need to wear masks, said Andy Surabian, an adviser to the president's son. In a text message, Surabian added the president's son should be able to resume tweeting later in the day.</p><p>\"Twitter suspending Don Jr. for sharing a viral video of medical professionals discussing their views on Hydroxychloroquine is further proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,\" Surabian said in a statement, adding, \"It is beyond the pale for Twitter to silence someone for sharing the views of medical professionals who happen to dissent with their anti-Hydroxychloroquine narrative.\"</p><p>The American president had recently tried to take a more moderate approach to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>He conceded, for example, last week at one of his restarted coronavirus White House briefings that it will likely \"get worse before it gets better\". The president has also been touting the importance of wearing masks after dismissing them for months. Despite his change in tone, he pushed states to reopen on Monday as a number of experts are calling for states to shut down.</p><p>Twitter has been much more aggressive in recent months in either removing tweets posted by the president, fact-checking them in real time or even placing warning labels over them.</p><p>The social media giant first fact-checked a pair of tweets posted by Trump in May when he claimed there was \"NO WAY\" an election with boosted mail-in voting would be legitimate. Twitter added a fact-check label to both tweets.</p><p>A few days later, Trump signed an executive order that asked federal regulators to revisit a 1996 law that protects websites from liability for what their users post.</p><p>And then a day after he signed the executive order, Twitter put a tweet from Trump behind a warning label, which said that the president had violated its rules against glorifying violence when he tweeted about protests over the death of George Floyd.</p><p>In June, Twitter and Facebook removed a video posted to Trump's social media accounts of a \"racist baby\" because of a copyright claim from one of the children's parents. Twitter labeled the video \"manipulated media\".</p><p>Trump stood by his comments on hydroxychloroquine at a press briefing later Tuesday, telling reporters \"I happen to believe in it\".</p><p>\"I would take it. I, as you know, took it for a 14-day period, and I'm here,\" Trump stated, noting, \"It didn't get me, and it's not going to - hopefully - hurt anybody.\"</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration has recommended against taking hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat or prevent COVID-19.</p><p>Trump announced in May that he was taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent contracting the virus.</p><p>Trump abruptly ended the briefing Tuesday after a reporter asked him why he would share content to his Twitter account from a doctor who has pushed wildly false medical information including that doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens and that doctors are trying to create a vaccine to make people immune from becoming religious.</p><p>\"She was on air along with many other doctors. They were being fans of hydroxychloroquine, and I thought she was very impressive in the sense that - from where she came, I don't know which county she comes from - but she said that she's had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients, and I thought her voice was an important voice. But I know nothing about her,\" Trump stated before leaving the briefing room. - FNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-WN21-JB5P-J17N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"846\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In the last several months alone, (1) the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) each announced major investigations into digital platforms; (2) as part of its own wide-ranging, bipartisan investigation, the House Judiciary Committee conducted another round of hearings exploring the impact of digital platforms on competition; and (3) in parallel, states have launched their own joint investigation of large technology companies in consultation with the DOJ. These developments underscore the reality that technology companies of all stripes  especially digital platforms  are operating in an increasingly complex, evolving, and fraught regulatory environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This article discusses recent developments in the U.S. regulatory landscape, explains how they dovetail with broader antitrust enforcement trends, and explores their potential implications for technology companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DOJ and FTC Investigations Into Digital Platforms</p><p>On July 23, 2019, the DOJ announced that the Antitrust Division has launched a broad \"review\" of whether and how \"market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\" Although the announcement did not single out specific companies, it stated that the review is focused on concerns relating to \"search, social media, and some retail services online.\" In addition, the DOJ noted that it is conferring with and seeking information from various interested parties, including the public and industry participants \"who have direct insight into competition in online platforms.\" On August 30, Google's parent company, Alphabet, confirmed that it had received a civil investigative demand (CID) from the DOJ requesting documents and information relating to prior antitrust investigations in the United States and abroad.</p><p>The DOJ review parallels ongoing efforts by the FTC, which has made examining and investigating the antitrust implications of large technology companies a major enforcement priority. Earlier this year, the FTC launched the Technology Task Force (TTF), a new division of the Bureau of Competition dedicated to \"monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets, investigating any potential anticompetitive conduct in those markets, and taking enforcement actions when warranted.\" In addition to examining industry practices and conducting law enforcement investigations, the TTF will coordinate and consult with staff throughout the FTC on technology-related matters, including reviewing prospective and consummated mergers in the technology sector. The TTF is already staffed by at least 17 attorneys detailed from divisions across the Bureau of Competition and will include one or more specialists from the private sector, with direct oversight by senior agency officials. Since its deployment, the TTF has been very busy, proactively meeting with Silicon Valley companies to gather information and considering potential investigations. </p><p>The extent to which the FTC and DOJ are coordinating their inquiries is unclear. In June, it was reported that the FTC and DOJ reached a formal clearance agreement dividing up review of major technology companies, although such an agreement has not been confirmed by the agencies. It is unusual for the agencies to formally split up \"jurisdiction\" over companies. Instead, clearance is typically determined by industry or at the outset of a formal investigation, with investigative authority going to the agency with greater familiarity with the relevant product, service, or sector.</p><p>State Attorney General Investigations</p><p>For some time, a large, bipartisan group of state attorneys general (AG) has reportedly been preparing to launch a joint investigation of large technology companies. The states have been closely coordinating their efforts with the DOJ. In July, representatives of several state AGs met with senior DOJ officials and Attorney General William Barr to discuss antitrust concerns and potential investigations. A spokesperson for Arizona's AG noted that the meeting \"involved a discussion of online platforms and a number of concerns regarding consumer protection issues raised by the states,\" adding that, \"[w]hile DOJ already has an antitrust review of big tech companies underway, the states are weighing all of their available options and considering possible independent courses of action.\" Commenting on collaboration between the DOJ and the states, Antitrust Division head Makan Delrahim recently stated that \"it would be a cooperative matter that benefits everybody, and all the states and their enforcement objectives as well as the [companies being investigated].\" On September 9, the attorneys general of 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico announced a wide-ranging antitrust investigation of Google, initially focused on online advertising. Today, nearly every state in the United States is involved in sweeping investigations of one or more major technology companies.</p><p>Congressional Investigation and Hearings</p><p>In June, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee announced a bipartisan investigation focused on competition in digital markets. As part of this investigation, on July 16, 2019, the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law held a hearing with representatives from several technology companies. Committee Chairman David Cicilline set a charged tone for the hearing in his opening remarks, stating that the internet has become \"increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship,\" and suggesting that large technology companies are creating a \"kill zone\" with respect to new competition. He took the FTC and DOJ to task for not doing enough to regulate these platforms, accusing the regulators of giving the companies \"de facto immunity.\"</p><p>Committee members questioned the companies on a range of topics, including their respective market positions; their use of terms of service and data policies; the ability of platform owners to wield market power to disadvantage rival participants and benefit their own products and services; and the targeting of nascent competitors in so-called \"killer\" acquisitions. The companies' representatives responded to questions in live and written testimony, emphasizing the highly competitive, dynamic, and fragmented nature of the markets at issue and the significant procompetitive benefits stemming from their products and services. Additional Congressional hearings exploring the antitrust implications of large technology platforms will be held in September.</p><p>Global Enforcement Trends</p><p>These U.S.developments are unfolding in the context of a broader global climate of aggressive and escalating antitrust regulation of digital platforms and other technology companies. Competition authorities around the world are actively pursuing new cases, exploring novel liability theories, and reconsidering whether existing antitrust legal frameworks are equipped to regulate technology companies in the digital economy. For example, as the European Commission's (EC) preliminary investigation of Google's online job search tool continues, 23 rival job search engines recently sent a letter to Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager alleging that Google is abusing its dominance by favoring its own job search results and disadvantaging competitors. Since 2017, the EC has brought several enforcement actions against Google for abuse of dominance in online shopping, Android, and ad intermediation, resulting in over $9 billion in fines. Today, numerous competition authorities around the world are actively investigating technology companies in a wide range of areas.</p><p>Political Climate</p><p>Meanwhile, in the political sphere, an increasingly vocal chorus has been calling for extreme reforms to remedy perceived harms to competition, such as the breakup of \"Big Tech\" and the unwinding of consummated mergers. U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has unveiled a sweeping plan that proposes \"big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition . . . .\" Specifically, the plan calls for legislation classifying large digital platforms as \"utilities,\" prohibited from simultaneously owning and participating in their platforms. In addition, the plan proposes to appoint regulators \"committed to using existing tools to unwind anti-competitive mergers.\" Echoing this idea, FTC Chairman Simons recently remarked that the FTC would be willing to break up major technology companies if appropriate and necessary to prevent harm to competition, noting that \"[i]t's not ideal because it's very messy[,] . . . [b]ut if you have to you have to.\"</p><p>Key Insights and Takeaways</p><p>The scope and pace of new developments in antitrust enforcement in the tech sector are dizzying. However, several key themes are emerging from these developments, foreshadowing where enforcement might be headed.</p><p> First, a new era of antitrust regulation of technology companies is well underway in the United States and abroad. Foundational antitrust principles (e.g., reliance on the consumer welfare standard and the separation of antitrust and privacy laws) are being questioned, while drastic remedies, such as the breakup of firms, are being considered by enforcers and normalized in the political discourse. Second, antitrust enforcement in this sector is gaining momentum. The foregoing developments may mark the beginning, rather than the culmination, of a long enforcement arc that could continue for many years. Third, technology companies are facing scrutiny from a multitude of sources, including federal and state law enforcement authorities, competition authorities around the world, policymakers, and political figures. Antitrust has become a hot topic in the public domain, taking on a populist dimension as the media covers new developments and fuels the antitrust debate, driving further engagement by key players. As the number of actors propelling aggressive enforcement in the technology sector continues to grow, antitrust exposure increases. Moreover, the pace of enforcement is rapidly accelerating as these entities attempt to keep up with the pace of technological innovation  and one another.</p><p>In some ways, it remains unclear where these various enforcement vectors may ultimately lead and how they might intersect (e.g., collaboration, jurisdictional tensions, divergent enforcement decisions, and/or duplicative relief). Nonetheless, it is clear that recognizing and managing antitrust risk in this environment requires understanding a complex battle being waged on multiple fronts.</p><p> Mofo Tech Blog - A blog dedicated to information, trend-spotting &amp; analysis for science &amp; tech-based companies</p><p>Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.</p><p>\u00a9 Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP.

It leaves the EU on Jan. 31 and will then open parallel trade discussions with both the U.S. and the EU. And the U.S. and the EU have just started their own discussions as President Donald Trump turns his focus away from China following the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with Beijing.</p><p>Members of Trump's Cabinet talked up the prospects of a swift trade deal with Britain and argued that it should be relatively straightforward given how similar the two economies are.</p><p>At a press briefing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's heading to London this weekend to meet with his counterpart, Sajid Javid, particularly about trade.</p><p>\"It's an absolute priority of President Trump and we expect to complete that within this year,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>Though Javid has said that negotiating a trade deal with the EU will be his ``top priority,'' discussions with the U.S. will take place at the same time.</p><p>Mnuchin said that was \"obviously an aggressive timeline.\"</p><p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the U.S. and Britain shouldn't be too difficult as the two economies have more in common than they do with the EU.</p><p>\"Both are very heavily services-oriented and within services, such as financial services there's already a pretty high degree of integration and coordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,\" he said.</p><p>Ross also sought to dampen concerns raised in Britain that a future trade deal would mean higher drug prices as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain's state-run National Health Service.</p><p>\"What we think is that drugs should have similar prices wherever they are but I don't believe we are in any position to tell the U.K. what they should pay for drugs,\" he said.</p><p>Though the U.S. is hugely important, Britain conducts far more business with the other 27 countries of the EU - that's why so many businesses want economic relations to be as close as possible.</p><p>Paolo Gentiloni, the former Italian prime minister who is now the EU's main economy commissioner, said he welcomes the clarity over Brexit following last month's convincing election win by Boris Johnson's Conservative Party.</p><p>\"Eleven months for a free trade agreement is really very short if we look at other free trade agreements, but the EU is ready to do all in our power to have the best possible relation with the U.K.,\" he said. \"It's not easy in 11 months but I think it is still possible.\"</p><p>How quickly a deal can be reached will depend on what Britain is looking for. Javid has insisted Britain will not stick to EU rules and regulations, which could make a deal harder.</p><p>\"As we leave there's bound to be change but we have also been clear that there's no point in leaving the EU but sticking with all its rules and regulations forever,\" he said.</p><p>Given that stance, expectations are slim for anything more than a bare-bones trade agreement.</p><p>\"Hopefully we can minimize the disruption as much as possible,\" said Roberto Gualtieri, Italy's new finance minister.</p><p>The final piece of the trade jigsaw relates to the U.S. and the EU, and discussions have begun as Trump turns his gaze to what he considers to be the unfair treatment of American businesses by Brussels.</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's new president, said a deal could be secured \"within weeks,\" an aspiration that took many close observers by surprise and wasn't wholly shared by U.S. officials.</p><p>She didn't lay out the scope of any such agreement but she appeared intent on avoiding any tariffs on European carmakers, which Trump has threatened repeatedly in recent days.</p><p>Mnuchin said the purpose of tariffs, and the threat of tariffs, \"is to get free, fair and reciprocal trade.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, France agreed to delay its tax on big tech firms like Google and Facebook in exchange for a U.S. promise to hold off its retaliatory tariffs on French cheese and wine. Discussions on an international approach to digital taxes will now take place under the auspices of the Paris-based Organization or Economic Co-operation and Development.</p><p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the agreement was a big win for France's \"aggressive\" approach.</p><p>\"If France would not have been the first European country to introduce a national digital taxation, there would not be any discussion at the OECD level anymore,\" he said Thursday.</p><p>\"It would have been buried, to be very clear. So we can be tough. We can be offensive.\"</p><p>The approach seems to be setting the tone for what are likely to be complicated discussions - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y27-HDS1-JB5P-J3TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"887\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COOPERATIEVE CENTRALE RAIFFEISEN-BOERENLEENBANK BA (RABOBANK)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000951</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Speech</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UN human rights chief urged FacebookWednesday to more proactively address hate speech but warned against excessive regulation, after US President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>accused tech giants' platforms of bias against him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein's appeal follows a decision by Facebookthis week to ban Myanmar's army chief and other top military brass named in a UN probe linking them to a possible genocide against Rohingya Muslims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The social media network is the prime source of news and information for many in the country, but has also been a platform for the army and Buddhist hardliners to spread hate speech against the Rohingya and other minorities.</p><p>The site aired support for the military's bloody clearance operations last year that forced some 700,000 Rohingya over the border into Bangladesh.</p><p>We felt early on very uncomfortable with what we were seeing in Myanmar, (but) in the early meetings that we had with Facebook, I didn't think they were taking it seriously, said Zeid, who is due to step down from his post as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights at the end of the week.</p><p>Hopefully they've now awoken, he told reporters in Geneva, warning that there could easily be other cases where Facebookis the dominant medium in a country where you see a deterioration of human rights conditions and then their role would be brought into question.</p><p>He cautioned that the company should be careful, since it risked being subpoenaed in possible future trials of those accused of the worst crimes.</p><p>'Accessory'</p><p>We've seen from the jurisprudence of the past that if you've enabled, you've abetted, you've been an accessory, Zeid said, stressing that while he was not accusing Facebookof that, they have to be sure that they know where they are and what side of the law they are on.</p><p>The Jordanian national, who is set to be succeeded by former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet, urged Facebookto not wait until a full-blown crisis erupts to act against hate speech.</p><p>They should be thinking proactively about what steps they will take to mitigate that, he said.</p><p>Zeid meanwhile warned of going too far in the opposite direction, cautioning that there is also another danger (of being) overregulated.</p><p>He pointed to recent comments by the US president, who has accused big tech firms like Facebook, Google and Twitter of bias against him, slamming what he called rigged internet search results.</p><p>Trump offered no details on what if any actions he might take, but a top White House aide suggested the administration may look at some type of regulation in response to the president's complaints.</p><p>Zeid insisted that instead of more government regulations, the platforms' actions must be regulated by (international) human rights law.</p><p>'Dangerous'</p><p>The comments did not mark the first time the UN rights chief has criticized Trump.</p><p>He has repeatedly warned that the US president's relentless attacks on the media are dangerous.</p><p>On Wednesday, Zeid said Trump's recent statements have been very worrisome to me, reiterating his warning that the president's words could trigger violence against journalists.</p><p>All of us would be horrified, but perhaps not shocked if we heard of a journalist that was attacked and severely beaten for example at one of the rallies, he said, stressing that if that happens the president would bear some responsibility.</p><p>As the campaigning seasons heat up, whether it be for the midterm elections or the presidential elections to come, the conduct of the president should be under very careful scrutiny by the international community and by this office, Zeid said. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

In this six-part article, the authors address this effort, describing the state of the SEC, new amendments to simplify disclosure requirements, and proposed rule changes to promote capital raising and increase the number of public companies. The authors then turn to the SEC's requests for comments on possible elimination of quarterly reporting and revisions to the rules governing private capital markets and pending legislation in Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Congress have recently shown a concerted effort to encourage capital formation and lessen the burden of reporting requirements for both public and private companies. Current SEC Chairman Jay Clayton outlined his views on this point, saying, \"[i]t is important for the SEC to review our regulations to ensure that they are consistent with our ever-evolving capital markets.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>Jay Clayton, Remarks on Capital Formation at the Nashville 36/86 Entrepreneurship Festival, August 29, 2018, available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-clayton-082918\">https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-clayton-082918</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote> The primary purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the SEC's recent efforts to follow through with that statement.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>ThisarticleiscurrentasofJuly31,2019.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Part I of this article begins by providing an overview of the current state of the SEC, including a brief discussion of the current SEC commissioners and the political climate surrounding the recent activity. Part II considers new amendments that simplify certain disclosure requirements found in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X, as well as other rules and forms. Part III outlines the SEC's new and expanded definition of a \"smaller reporting company\" (or \"SRC\"), which is expected to include almost half of all public companies. Part IV follows with a discussion of amendments to Rule 701 of the Securities Act of 1933, which permit more public companies to issue equity-based compensation without disclosing it to investors. Part V reviews the SEC's pending requests for public comment, including the possible elimination of quarterly reporting. Part VI concludes with a discussion of the proposed legislation called the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018 and other proposed bills. Each part will be addressed in turn.</p><p>PART I  STATE OF THE SEC</p><p>Before diving into a discussion regarding the recent and proposed changes to the regulations, it is important to understand the background surrounding these changes and ask why they are happening. The short answer is  the federal government is focused on the promotion of capital-raising and increasing the overall number of public companies in the United States.</p><p>Throughout the modern era, the publicly traded corporation has been a cornerstone of our nation's economy. It enables enterprises to raise money from the broadest possible group of investors and it allows almost anyone  from my 95-year-old grandmother in rural Colorado to the most sophisticated institutional investment fund on Wall Street  to invest in, and earn a profit from, the ventures of others. In the last few years, however, the universe of these \"cornerstone\" companies in the United States has been shrinking and, as of late, more capital is being raised privately than publicly. For example, new businesses have been offering shares to the public at less than half the rate of the 1980s and 1990s.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>JayR.Ritter,InitialPublicOfferings:UpdatedStatistics,availableat<url normalizedValue=\"https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/\">https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/</url> 2018/01/IPOs2017Statistics_January17_2018.pdf.</p></bodyText></footnote> At the end of 2017, there were about 3,600 firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges, which is less than half the number of similar firms in 1997. The big tech companies that would have gone public in eras past are staying private, dramatically limiting which investors have the opportunity to profit from their rapid growth and success.</p><p>The SEC has flagged this as a problem. Jay Clayton, Chairman of the SEC, has called the seeming decline of the traditional U.S.-listed public company as \"a serious issue for our markets and the country more generally,\" and said that the \"potential lasting effects [to] the economy and society are, in two words, not good.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>Jay Clayton, Remarks at the Economic Club of New York, available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/remarkseconomic-club-new-york\">https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/remarkseconomic-club-new-york</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote> The SEC and Congress have attacked this problem on two fronts: first, by adopting specific changes to the securities offering process itself (such as allowing testing the waters before an initial public offering (\"IPO\") and confidential submission of registration statements); and second, by reducing the burdens and costs of being a public company. It is the latter of these methods that this article will address.</p><p>Current State of the Commission</p><p>The SEC has five commissioners who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Because each commissioner serves a five-year, staggered term, one of each of the five commissioners' terms ends on June 5th of each year. No more than three commissioners may belong to the same political party. The President designates one of the five commissioners to serve as Chairman. Chairman Clayton (a former corporate partner at a large firm) is an Independent who was sworn in on May 4, 2017 and whose term expires in 2021. The last chair, Mary Jo White, was a former prosecutor who seemed focused on the SEC's enforcement program, with an eye to policing minor technical violations of the law (commonly referred to as \"broken windows\"). However, each chair adds his or her own focus to the SEC, and Chairman Clayton is focused on protection of the capital markets, technology, and enforcement actions against those who prey on retail investors.</p><p>The other commissioners currently serving are Robert J. Jackson, Jr., Hester M. Peirce, Elad L. Roisman, and Allison H. Lee. Commissioner Jackson (a former Professor of Law at NYU School of Law) is a Democrat who was sworn in on January 11, 2018 and whose term expired on June 5, 2019<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>CommissionerJacksonhasnotindicatedwhenheplanstoofficiallystepdownfromhispost,butheispermittedbylawtocontinueservingthroughtheendof2020.</p></bodyText></footnote> ; Commissioner Peirce (a former Senior Research Fellow and Director of the Financial Markets Working Group at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University) is a Republican who was sworn in on January 11, 2018 and whose term expires in 2020; and Commissioner Roisman (a former Chief Counsel of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs) is a Republican who was sworn in on September 11, 2018, and whose term expires in 2023. Most recently, on July 8, 2019, Commissioner Lee (a former securities partner and SEC staff member from 2005 to 2018) was sworn into office filling the vacancy opened since Kara Stein's 18-month tail period expired on December 31, 2018 and finally bringing the SEC back to full strength.</p><p>There have also been changes to the Staff of the SEC over the last several years. Perhaps most significant to this discussion, the Division of Corporation Finance got a new Director, William H. Hinman, in May 2017. Chairman Clayton noted in the SEC's announcing release that \"[Mr. Hinman] understands the SEC's mission to promote capital formation while ensuring that investors have the information necessary to make informed decisions.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>WilliamHinmanNamedDirectorofDivisionofCorporateFinance,availableat<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2017-97\">https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2017-97</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>In his spring 2018 testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Hinman articulated a consistent view:</p><p>Against the backdrop of a declining number of U.S. public reporting companies, the Division has been looking at ways to make the public company alternative more attractive. While there are many reasons why companies may choose not to go public, to go public at a later stage, or to exit the public markets, to the extent we are able to attract more companies to join our public companies reporting system and do so at an earlier stage, it will ultimately benefit companies, our markets and investors. Although initial public offerings (\"IPOs\") and developing public companies may not be suitable for all investors, more IPOs occurring at an earlier stage means a wider range of investors are able to more fully participate in the growth of companies. It is far more efficient for retail investors to invest in companies through our public markets than our private markets. Increasing the number of public companies is becoming more and more important as Americans are increasingly relying upon their own investments for retirement.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote7\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p>William H. Hinman, Testimony on \"Oversight of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance,\" before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment, available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/testimony-oversight-secsdivision-corporation-finance\">https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/testimony-oversight-secsdivision-corporation-finance</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Other notable changes include: Robert Stebbins being named General Counsel of the SEC in May 2017, Stephanie Avakian and Steve Peikin being named CoDirectors of the Division of Enforcement in June 2017, Kyle Moffatt being named Chief Accountant of the Division of Corporation Finance in February 2018, Valerie Szczepanik being named Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovations in June 2018, and S.P. Kothari being named Chief Economist and Director of the Division of Economic Risk Analysis in February 2019.</p><p>Beyond the SEC, we also have a political climate that is volatile and eager for change. From each of the SEC, the White House, and Congress, we have repeatedly heard since early 2017 that it is a priority for this country to increase capital raising and to have a larger number of publicly traded companies. For example, as further discussed in Part V below, President Trump called for the SEC to study the possibility of eliminating quarterly reporting for public companies. And in December 2018, the Division published a request for public comment on ways to ease a public company's quarterly reporting requirements, while still maintaining appropriate levels of disclosure and investor protection. Likewise, in May 2018, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  the main industry trade group representing securities firms, banks, and asset management companies  issued a report encouraging Congress to reduce high regulatory costs and SEC rules that may discourage companies from going or staying public. The report provided specific and concrete suggestions.</p><p>Many of the commissioners' speeches over the last 18 months have been consistent with this theme of trying to strike a balance between lessening the burden of being a public company and investor protection. For example, in early November 2018, at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, Commissioner Peirce discussed proposed changes to certain disclosure requirements and noted, \"[o]ur financial reporting and corporate disclosure system is essential to wellfunctioning markets, which are, in turn, essential to the ongoing provision of the goods and services that make modern lives so safe and comfortable.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote8\"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p>Hester M.
