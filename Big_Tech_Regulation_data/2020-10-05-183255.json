Net neutrality means internet service providers (ISPs) cannot block, slow, or provide preferential treatment to particular sites and services. The new rule \u2014 the Restoring Internet Freedom order \u2014 would allow ISPs to impose fees on customers who want to access rival sites.\u00a0 Your home internet bill\u00a0will likely get more expensive. On Thursday December 14, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), led by chairman Ajit Pai, will vote to repeal the net neutrality rules[1] it put in place in 2015 during the <person><nameText>Obama administration. </nameText></person></p><p>\"Net neutrality is the principal that internet service providers should, in general, treat all data sent over the network the same, no matter whether it's an email, an emoji sent over a chat service, a phone call, a political rant live-streamed by a college student from her parents' basement, or the latest show on Netflix,\" Business Insider's Steve Kovach explained[2]. Pai's proposal, named the Restoring Internet Freedom order[3], would enable internet service providers (ISPs), like Comcast, AT...Spectrum, and Verizon, to favor their own sites and services and charge customers fees to access \u2014 or at the very least, quickly load \u2014 rival sites. In other words, you would no longer be able to access every website on the internet under your current, monthly fee.\u00a0 \"If you're a Comcast customer, you may have to pay extra to be able to stream video from Netflixor Amazon, rather than from NBC or Hulu, which Comcast part-owns. If you're a Verizon customer, you may get charged extra to access Google's news or finance sites rather than Yahoo's,\" Kovach wrote. Ultimately, the new order would reclassify ISPs as \"information services\" instead of \"public utilities,\" giving the FCC less regulatory authority in the industry. So all this can happen as long as the ISPs, or telecommunications companies, disclose their practices to customers, businesses, and the FCC.\u00a0 But it's not only customers who would be paying more. Companies may also be charged a toll by ISPs in order to make their content available to us. Big tech companies like Google, Netflix, and Spotify wouldn't be happy about the tolls, but they'll pay them because they can afford it. Smaller startups, on the other hand, would likely have a harder time paying. That's one major argument lobbed by net neutrality supporters: repealing the rules would kill innovation and favor the current behemoths. \"If every new company has to pay to play, you're sucking dollars away from innovation and using them to line ISP pockets,\" Nilay Patel, the Editor-in-Chief of Verge, wrote in an article[4] earlier this year. Not to mention, assuming smaller companies simply cannot afford these tolls, competition would thin out and we'd be left with less to choose from, both content-wise and cost-wise. The dollar figure ISPs likely plan to impose in fees and tolls remains to be seen, but if the FCC repeals net neutrality, you can bet your internet bill will increase if you want to keep watching \"Stranger Things\" on Netflixor listening to the latest hits on Spotify.NOW WATCH: How the net neutrality vote will affect you and why you should care[5]See Also: 5 financial choices that will haunt

Under net-neutrality protections, internet service providers are barred from blocking, slowing, or providing preferred treatment to particular sites and services. The rules are designed to keep the internet open to all comers and give everyone a fair shot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Without net-neutrality protections, ISPs could block you from streaming video from Netflix or YouTube or charge you extra just to access those sites. They could also force Netflix or YouTube to pay more to ensure that its videos be streamed at the same speed and quality as at other video sites.</p><p>Such moves would most likely force you to pay more to view and access the videos and other information you regularly get through the internet. They also could limit your choices if the ISPs block access to particular companies' sites or charge those companies tolls that only the biggest and richest among them can afford.</p><p>The FCC has had some form of net-neutrality protections in place since 2005. After two different versions of the rules were struck down in court, the FCC in 2015 officially designated broadband providers as telecommunications companies, a move that allowed it to put in place new rules grounded in its authority over such companies under Title II of the Communications Act.</p><p>The latest proposal from the FCC reverses the designation of broadband providers as telecommunications companies and do away with the three major net-neutrality prohibitions. Under the new proposal, companies would be able to block, slow, or provide fast lanes to particular sites or services.</p><p>Their only responsibility under the proposal would be to disclose such practices to customers. The FCC now leaves it up to the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether broadband companies were doing anything they hadn't disclosed.</p><h>Why does the FCC want to repeal net neutrality?</h><p>Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p><p>When it comes to his philosophy regarding telecommunications companies, the FCC's chairman, Ajit Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, is a free-market libertarian. He is ideologically opposed to even the idea of the FCC regulating such companies. He opposed the FCC's 2015 rules and announced even before he became chairman that he would seek to overturn them.</p><p>But ideology will only get you so far when it comes to changing regulations; agencies must have a reasonable rationale for reversing themselves. Pai's main argument for doing away with the net-neutrality rules is that they have depressed industry investment.</p><p>Broadband investment can take different forms, but it usually results in faster, more reliable networks that are available to more people. Those are outcomes that partisans on both sides of the net-neutrality debate support.</p><p>The problem with Pai's argument is the data he cites <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/fccs-claim-that-broadband-investment-has-dropped-is-flawed-2017-11?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">doesn't support his claim</url> that investment is falling. Instead, that data shows that broadband investment has basically been flat since 2013, with a lot of variation among the different companies. A study from the consumer-advocacy group Free Press indicates       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/broadband-investment-up-after-new-net-neutrality-rules-2017-5?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">broadband investment has actually increased</url> since the 2015 net-neutrality rules took effect.</p><p>Regardless, some companies have significantly cut back on their investments in recent years. But even just looking at those companies, none have blamed their reduced investment on the net-neutrality rules.</p><h>What happens after the repeal?</h><p>The rules wouldn't take effect for a few months - some 60 days after they are published in the Federal Register. In the meantime, consumer-advocacy groups and other opponents will almost certainly file suit to try to block them. Members of Congress, particularly Democrats, are likely to introduce legislation to try to overturn them.</p><p>Assuming the rules take effect on schedule, broadband providers - wired and wireless alike - would be free to create so-called fast lanes for their sites and services and those of partners that pay for the privilege. They'd also be free to charge consumers extra to access certain services like streaming video, or to block or slow down sites or services that compete with theirs - or that they simply don't like.</p><p>The only obligation broadband providers would have would be to tell you what they're doing. But such disclosures are sure to come in the kind of fine print that few of us understand or even read.</p><h>Who benefits from the repeal?</h><p>The big telecommunications companies including AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast are cheering the impending death of the net-neutrality rules, in part because they think the repeal will allow them to make more money and give them more control.</p><p>But even the large internet companies that support the rules - including Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix - are likely to benefit from their demise. There's a good chance, once the rules are gone, that broadband providers will try to make internet companies pay to transmit their websites, stream their videos, or send their data to the providers' customers. And the internet giants, with their deep pockets, are the companies in the best position to afford those tolls.</p><p>The end of the rules could end up cementing the dominance of the big tech companies by thwarting their potential competitors and disruptors.</p><h>Who loses?</h><p>Normal internet users like you and me would lose out with the repeal of the net-neutrality rules. It won't happen overnight, but you can expect broadband providers to start limiting what you can access on the internet or charging you more to get to the sites and services you regularly use.</p><p>Also, entrepreneurs and smaller internet companies - the people and startups pioneering new kinds of services or aiming to be the next Netflix, Google, or Facebook - could lose out if they can't afford the broadband companies' potential tolls.</p><h>What's next?</h><p>The main action on net neutrality is likely to move to the courts after the FCC vote, but a decision is unlikely to come until at least a year after the repeal.</p><p>Given the broad public support for net neutrality, there's a good chance lawmakers or the FCC will try to reinstate the rules if Democrats regain the majority in Congress next year or the White House in 2020.</p><p>NOW WATCH: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-net-neutrality-explained-fcc-ajit-pai-2017-12?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Thursday's big net neutrality vote could drastically change the internet - here's what it means for you</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Also:</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-net-neutrality-explained-fcc-ajit-pai-2017-12?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Thursday's big net neutrality vote could drastically change the internet - here's what it means for you</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/republican-congressmen-ask-fcc-not-to-repeal-net-neutrality-2017-12?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Three-fourths of Republican voters say they support net neutrality - and party lawmakers are starting to speak out against repealing it</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-will-lead-to-higher-prices-fewer-choices-2017-12?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">The FCC plans to repeal net neutrality this week - and it could ruin the internet</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE ALSO:\u00a0Three-fourths of Republican voters say they support net neutrality - and party lawmakers are starting to speak out against repealing it</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISIUS-5a3147124aa6b5d3198b460c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISIUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VD6-SG41-DXY7-W421-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465531</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1226\"/><timeReceived>01:54 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Insider Inc.

The Federalist Society takes no position, and offers a forum for clear and constructive exchange.\u00a0<br/>The topic of the first series is \"Governing the Internet,\" which covers issues from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to net neutrality, mergers, and more. This topic is co-sponsored by the Practice Groups and the\u00a0Regulatory Transparency Project.</p><p><br/>The first two pieces in the series are \"FCC's O'Rielly on First Amendment &amp;Fairness; Doctrine Dangers\u201d by Neil Chilson and Adam Thierer, and \u201cBig Tech and the Whole First Amendment\u201d by Craig Parshall. This piece is part of an ongoing discussion on issues of tech and regulation.<br/>---<br/>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the provision of law imparting broad immunity to America\u2019s tech giants, is approaching its 25th birthday\u2014perhaps its last in its original form. A rigorous debate over the law\u2019s application has captured bipartisan attention on Capitol Hill and civil society more broadly. This attention has endured despite concentrated efforts to dismiss it.<br/>As reform proposals proliferate in Congress, the executive branch is pursuing its own reform track with an Executive Order released in May. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has taken the first implementing step, petitioning the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue regulations narrowing the broad interpretation of Sec. 230 currently granted to tech companies\u2014not by Congress, but by the courts. All of these reform efforts share one goal: to make the recipients of Sec. 230\u2019s benefits more transparent and accountable to their users in exchange for the statutory legal privileges they receive.<br/>A return to original intent<br/>Specifically, the petition asks the FCC to use the broad authority granted to it in Sec. 201(b) of the Telecommunications Act to clarify the interaction between the two immunities granted to internet platforms by Sec. 230, (c)(1) and (c)(2). The first immunizes platforms against liability for content posted by third parties on their sites; the second protects the platforms if and when they block or remove content.<br/>The character, nature, and transparency of the type of content removal protected by (c)(2) is one of the key areas of the NTIA\u2019s petition. The petition argues (correctly, in the view of my organization, the Internet Accountability Project), that the statute intended a narrow immunity designed to give platforms the freedom to filter content that is \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable\u201d without fear of liability. Unfortunately, embedded in that section is a catch-all phrase, \u201cotherwise objectionable,\u201d that gives tech platforms discretion to censor anything that they deem \u201cotherwise objectionable.\u201d Such broad language lends itself in practice to arbitrariness.<br/>In other words, while the law\u2019s intended purpose was to protect the \u201cgood samaritan\u201d behavior of platforms to block and remove smutty content online, the troublesome text of Sec. 230 has created an unintended consequence: a grant to Big Tech companies and other online platforms of extraordinary legal protection from those lawsuits that would challenge their suppressive, discriminatory power over the lawful viewpoints of citizen-users.<br/>The legislative history of the statute clarifies the conflict between intent and outcome. Sec. 230 itself, written originally as an amendment to the Communications Act of 1995, was titled the Online Family Empowerment Act and described by the House Rules Committee as an amendment \u201cprotecting from liability those providers and users seeking to clean up the Internet.\u201d<br/>Sec. 230 was a necessary protection for an infant internet of small companies, which would have been overwhelmed by the massive liability they would face for knocking out bad actors. As a byproduct of Sec. 230, however, the Internet has grown and changed dramatically from small online chat rooms hosting 36 million users to one dominated by what are now a handful of America\u2019s largest companies hosting 4.8 billion people online. Sec. 230\u2019s protections have been, and in some form, likely remain, critical to this growth.<br/>Sec. 230 itself has likewise evolved from humble beginnings to a judicially contorted statute whose application protects content wildly beyond what is suggested in the text of the law itself. Law professors Danielle Keats Citron and Benjamin Wittes refer to Sec. 230\u2019s judicial interpretation as a \u201cfortress built in the courts,\u201d one that shields platforms from all kinds of accountability for unlawful activity.<br/>As the NTIA\u2019s petition emphasizes, courts have now construed Sec. 230 to grant liability-immunity from contracts, consumer fraud, revenge pornography, anti-discrimination civil rights obligations, and even facilitating terrorist activity.<br/>Sec. 230 and the downstream effects of viewpoint bias<br/>Sec. 230\u2019s protections also encompass viewpoint-based content removal, despite the statute\u2019s intention for the internet to develop as a \u201cforum for a true diversity of political discourse\u201d and \u201cmyriad avenues for intellectual activity.\u201d The broad interpretation of tech companies\u2019 legal immunity that allows them to discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, combined with the market dominance of a few large companies, presents an insidious threat to our free society.<br/>Their market dominance is perhaps the decisive factor in understanding how harmful viewpoint discrimination can be to individual citizens and our society more broadly. Google filters information for 90 percent of the world. Facebook is the primary news source for over half of Americans. Twitter captures a smaller market share, with 22 percent of Americans using the site, but stands out as one with the most news-focused users\u2014according to one survey, around seven-in-ten adult Twitter users utilize the site for news.<br/>When these platforms engage in viewpoint moderation that ranges far beyond content properly understood to be \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing\u201d and so on, the downstream effects are significant, contorting not just the free expression of individuals, but also the values of independent thought, viewpoint diversity, market access, and behavior.<br/>Consider that these platforms now determine what constitutes \u201cappropriate\u201d medical information for their users\u2014even when it is presented by board-certified physicians. Earlier this year, Facebook banned anti-lockdown protest content where it \u201cviolated social distancing rules,\u201d but embraced no such pseudo-governmental enforcement role against the protest activities that have been organized on their platform in violation of local ordinances. Google-owned YouTube has decided that an interview with Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist and professor at Stanford University Medical Center and an advisor on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, is \u201canti-science\u201d for its data-driven discussion about the efficacy of broad lock-downs.<br/>Facebook has also acted as the arbiter of due process rights for Kyle Rittenhouse, the teen charged with fatally shooting two people amid the riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse\u2019s attorney says his client acted in self-defense, but Facebook has blocked all posts in praise and support of him, and taken down links to contribute to his legal defense. Facebook, by its own admission one of the most powerful speech companies in the world, has already declared him guilty of mass violence, and restricted the use of its platform to reflect their subjective, extralegal judgement.<br/>Google has unprecedented power to filter information for most of the planet, and seems to flex this muscle with impunity. A 2019 investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that Google \u201cmade algorithmic changes to its search results that favor big business over smaller ones,\u201d and modified search results around subjects like abortion and immigration. In June, Google demonstrated how much power it has to demonetize entire news sites for minor violations of its ad policies. In July, the search engine inexplicably stopped presenting search results for several leading conservative websites. Breitbart News has presented analysis suggesting conservative sites are routinely downgraded.<br/>The gatekeeping role of these mega-platforms is taking on broad and opaque roles as it relates to the upcoming election. Big Tech\u2019s influence on voter behavior has already been well-documented. Center-left leaning research psychologist Dr. Robert Epstein testified before Congress that Google \u201cdisplays content to the American public that is biased in favor of one political party.\u201d He estimated Google\u2019s search behavior, which he tested against other search engines in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election, swung as many as 2.6 million votes to Clinton. He also estimates that Google\u2019s algorithmic filtering has \u201cbeen determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide since at least 2015.\u201d<br/>Facebook and other tech platforms are reportedly \u201cwar gaming\u201d different election outcomes, as well as meeting with government officials about \u201cpotential threats to election integrity.\u201d \u201cDigital platforms,\u201d according to Axios\u2019 reporting, are now as important as state and local elections agencies in \u201cprotecting public confidence\u201d as it relates to \u201cfaith in democracy.\u201d<br/>In other words, mega-corporations have as much power as the government itself\u2014and in some ways, more power, because theirs is unchecked and unaccountable. The decision of government officials to meet with these platforms regarding election integrity is an admission of how much power they now hold; so much that the decisions of a handful of unelected CEOs could alter or distort voter behavior in a free society.<br/>Sec. 230 is not an entitlement<br/>The legality of content moderation itself is not at issue\u2014but rather, the profound impact these actions have on the nature of free thought and expression when done at the scale at which these companies exist. A single algorithmic decision made by a private corporation, accountable to no one, changes what kind of viewpoints and information are available to billions of people around the world. The downstream effects of this change the nature of truly independent thought and behavior in ways that should concern both Congress and the executive branch\u2014particularly as it is a law Congress passed which advantages the exercise of these activities.<br/>Yet DC\u2019s tech establishment frequently rejects this argument, choosing instead to focus on the First Amendment right of corporations to suppress whatever content they so choose, never acknowledging that these choices, when made at scale, have enormous ramifications. Rather, they suggest that those who are unsatisfied simply use or build alternatives (how they treat those alternatives and the people who build and use them, however, reveals the suggestion to be less than sincere).<br/>But this argument intentionally sidesteps the fact that Sec. 230 is not required by the First Amendment, and that its application to tech platforms privileges their First Amendment behavior in a unique way among other kinds of media corporations. Newspapers also have a First Amendment right to publish what they choose\u2014but they are subject to defamation and libel laws for content they write, or merely publish. Media companies also make First Amendment decisions subject to a thicket of laws and regulations that do not similarly encumber tech platforms.<br/>In other words, Sec. 230 is, as Santa Clara law professor Eric Goldman has put it, \u201can implicit financial subsidy\u201d to the tech platforms. Ultimately, the Sec. 230 debate centers on what type of accountability these platforms should exhibit in exchange for this government-mandated privilege\u2014none, or some. For 24 years, neither Congress nor regulatory agencies have required any quo for what is a substantial quid. That is now changing.<br/>Agency authority and the NTIA Petition<br/>The NTIA petition seeks to ground Sec. 230\u2019s special immunity into the language of the statute as articulated, rather than the expansive, judicially-bloated interpretation that covers behavior far from the free expression the statute was envisioned to foster. It demands a measure of accountability and transparency in exchange for a government benefit. While there are those who might use this authority as a cudgel to suppress speech, many others seek to bring it back to its original intent of facilitating more speech.<br/>The inevitable question about the scope of FCC\u2019s jurisdiction arises, of course. But it is reasonable to suggest that FCC\u2019s authority over Internet \u201cinformation services\u201d could extend to the rule-making requested by NTIA, and that it could be consistent with existing law. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision approving that FCC governance classification in National Cable &amp;Telecommunications; Assn. v. Brand X, cited and followed in the 2019 D.C. Court of Appeals ruling in Mozilla v. FCC, could support that approach. In addition, clarifying the vagaries and inconsistencies of section 230 in its meaning and application would not be inconsistent with the FCC\u2019s light touch philosophy regarding online issues.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>That such actions are necessary is quickly becoming inarguable. Sec. 230, as currently interpreted, has fostered the growth of companies now so powerful that a single algorithmic change can, as one commenter put it, select \u201cwinners and losers in every sphere of public life, from markets to political contests.\u201d Sec. 230 was not designed to advantage this behavior, or to entitle it.<br/>As Scott Cleland noted recently, \u201cAmerica is the only country that protects platforms from people, but not people from platforms.\u201d Sec. 230 was designed to optimize free speech for users, and the ability of platforms to provide a forum for a safe and lively debate. Its current application, however, has reversed its intended effect, prioritizing the speech rights of platforms over and above those of their users\u2014and at a scale that distorts the information access, free thought, and market access for billions. It\u2019s time to expect more from platforms who have been given plenty. The NTIA should be applauded for acting with the diligence and urgency that this issue requires.<br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>                                 Permalink            <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://fedsoc.org/commentary/fedsoc-blog/the-fcc-should-address-distortions-of-section-230\">https://fedsoc.org/commentary/fedsoc-blog/the-fcc-should-address-distortions-of-section-230</url><br/>                                            Print                    <br/><br/>                                Email            <br/><br/>Facebook Share            <br/><br/>Twitter Share            <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-114274</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X0-T1T1-JBJN-M2TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 22, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS &amp;

The repeal will likely mean higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.The repeal is good news for large telecommunications and internet companies. In a move that could fundamentally reshape the internet \u2014 and spur a new wave of legal wrangling \u2014 the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday will vote on a proposal to repeal its net neutrality rules. The vote will take place during the FCC's monthly meeting, which starts at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. With Republicans who oppose those rules in control of the commission, the proposal is basically guaranteed to pass. </p><p>Here's what you need to know about net neutrality, the proposal, and what's likely to happen next:What's net neutrality?Net neutrality is the principle that all traffic on the internet should be treated equally. Under net neutrality protections, internet service providers (ISPs) are barred from blocking, slowing, or providing preferred treatment to particular sites and services. The rules are designed to keep the internet open to all comers and give everyone a fair shot. Without net neutrality protections, ISPs could block you from streaming video from Netflix or YouTube or charge you extra just to access those sites. On the flip site, they could force Netflix or YouTube to pay them to ensure that their videos were streamed to their users at the same speed and quality as other video sites. Such moves would likely force you to pay more to view and access the videos and other information you regularly get through the internet. They also could limit your choices if the ISPs block access to particular companies' sites or charge those companies tolls that only the biggest and richest among them can afford. The FCC has had some form of net neutrality protections in place since 2005. After two different versions of the rules were struck down by the courts, the FCC in 2015 officially designated broadband providers as telecommunications companies, a move that allowed it to put in place new rules grounded in its authority over such companies under Title II of the Communications Act. The latest proposal from the FCC would reverse the designation of broadband providers as telecommunications companies and do away with the three major net neutrality prohibitions. Under the new proposal, companies would be able to block, slow, or provide fast lanes to particular sites or services. Their only responsibility under the proposal would be to disclose such practices to customers. The FCC would leave it up to the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether broadband companies were doing anything they hadn't disclosed.Why does the FCC want to repeal net neutrality? When it comes to his philosophy regarding telecommunications companies, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, is a free-market libertarian. He's ideologically opposed to even the idea of the FCC regulating such companies. He opposed the FCC's 2015 rules and announced even before he became chairman that he would seek to overturn them.\u00a0 But ideology will only get you so far when it comes to changing regulations; agencies have to have a reasonable rationale for reversing themselves. Pai's main argument for doing away with the net neutrality rules is that they have depressed industry investment. Broadband investment can take different forms, but it usually results in faster, more reliable networks that are available to more people. Those are outcomes that partisans on both sides of the net neutrality debate support. The problem with Pai's argument is the data he himself cites doesn't support his claim[1] that investment is falling. Instead, that data shows that broadband investment has basically been flat since 2013, with a lot of variation among the different companies. Meanwhile, a study from consumer advocacy group Free Press indicates broadband investment has actually increased[2] since the 2015 net neutrality rules took effect. Regardless, some companies have significantly cut back on their investments in recent years. But even just looking at those companies, none has blamed their reduced investment on the net neutrality rules.What happens after the repeal?The rules won't take effect for a matter of months \u2014 some 60 days after they are published in the Federal Register. In the meantime, consumer advocacy and other groups will almost certainly file suit to try to block them. Members of Congress, particularly Democrats, will also likely introduce legislation to try to overturn them. Assuming the rules take effect on schedule, broadband providers \u2014 wired and wireless alike \u2014 would be free to create so-called \"fast lanes\" for their own sites and services and those of partners who pay for the privilege. They'd also be free to charge you extra to access certain services like streaming video, or block or slow down sites or services that compete with their own \u2014 or that they simply don't like. Any of that and likely more would be fair game under the FCC's new regime. The only obligation broadband providers would have would be to tell you what they're doing. However, you can bet such disclosures will likely come in the kind of fine print that few of us understand or even read.Who benefits from the repeal?The big telecommunications companies including AT...Verizon, and Comcast are cheering the impending death of the net neutrality rules, in part because they think the repeal will allow them to make more money and give them more control. But even the large internet companies that support the rules \u2014 including Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix \u2014 will likely benefit from their demise. There's a good chance, once the rules are gone, that broadband providers will try to make internet companies pay to transmit their web sites, stream their videos, or send their data to the providers' customers. And the internet giants, with their deep pockets, are the companies in the best position to afford those tolls. The end of the rules could end up cementing the dominance of the big tech companies by thwarting their potential competitors and disruptors.Who loses?Normal internet users like you and me will lose out with the repeal of the net neutrality rules. It won't happen overnight, but you can expect broadband providers to start limiting what you can access on the internet or charging you more to get to the sites and services you regularly use. Also, entrepreneurs and smaller internet companies \u2014 the people and startups pioneering new kinds of services or aiming to be the next Netflix, Google, or Facebook \u2014 could lose out if they can't afford the broadband companies' potential tolls.What's next?The main action on net neutrality is likely to move to the courts after the FCC vote, but a decision likely won't come until at least a year after the repeal. Given the broad public support for net neutrality, there's a good chance lawmakers or the FCC will try to reinstate the rules if Democrats regain the majority in Congress next year or the White House in 2020.

In 2015,\u00a0TalkTalk was hacked by a spotty teenager. It was fined \u00a3400,000 for failing to adequately secure customer data, and subsequently haemorrhaged 101,000 customers and \u00a360 million in sales.To counter this threat, businesses are increasingly involving\u00a0their senior tech experts (CIO/CSO/CISO/CTO)\u00a0in their buying decisions. </p><p>That leads to one conclusion for B2B tech marketers: play up the fear factor, and put the \u2018cybersecurity sell\u2019 front and centre in your campaigns.Take Facebook, for example, which continues to nurture its developer community with the\u00a0launch of Threatexchange. Nominally for IT security professionals, this social network is marketed as a B2B product to the businesses that employ them.But cybersecurity sell doesn\u2019t just apply to specialist tech businesses. Brands that traditionally resided outside the tech space, like PwC and KPMG, are moving to provide tailored cybercrime defences for their existing clients\u2019 industries.Scale this approach for your own B2B brand: whether it\u2019s a product division, a product, or a product feature, ensure you\u2019ve got something to offer for today\u2019s cybercrime-savvy tech buyers.After all, awareness is growing everywhere. Just under three-quarters (73%) of major global businesses report that cybersecurity features in board meetings\u00a0at least quarterly. Plus senior decision-makers have both a personal and professional stake in defending against cybercrime: Target\u2019s CEO\u00a0Gregg Steinhafel was fired\u00a0in 2014 following a data breach that affected 40 million customers and the company\u2019s CIO Bob DeRodes was replaced by an executive with a very strong background in information security.How do you manage the cybersecurity sell?The CSO/CISO/CIO is more interested in cybersecurity than in your core product proposition, so be sure to prepare marketing and sales collateral that answers this buyer\u2019s specific needs. You see B2B brands now talking cybersecurity through forbidding colours and imagery. One great example is\u00a0HP's 'The Wolf' campaign\u00a0\u2013\u00a0putting the cybercrime sell on a range of office printers.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">B2BMAG-165951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">B2BMAG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TFS-2N91-JCKT-V11X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300739</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 B2B Marketing All Righs Reserved</copyright><publicationName>B2B Marketing magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37356\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 8, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Dow Jones Industrial Average naik 160,29 poin, atau 0,61%, menjadi 26.539,57, demikian laporan  CNBC  dan   AFP  , di New York, Rabu (29/7) atau Kamis (30/7) pagi WIB.  Sementara, indeks berbasis luas S&amp;P 500 melonjak 1,24% atau 40,00 poin menjadi 3.258,44, sedangkan Nasdaq Composite Index melesat 1,35% atau 140,85 poin menjadi 10.542,94.  Facebook dan Amazon masing-masing meroket lebih dari 1% bersama dengan Apple dan Alphabet. Penguatan itu terjadi ketika CEO perusahaan tersebut bersaksi di hadapan anggota parlemen Amerika Serikat setelah penyelidikan selama setahun terhadap praktik anti-persaingan mereka. Investor mencari tahu tentang bagaimana Big Tech menangani tantangan   antitrust   dari regulator.  Saham Big Tech berada di antara yang mencatat kinerja terbaik tahun ini. Facebook dan Alphabet sama-sama melambung lebih dari 13% (year-to-date) hingga sesi Rabu. Amazon meroket 64,2% sepanjang periode tersebut dan Apple naik 29,5%.  Sikap The Fed  Dalam sebuah pernyataan, komite pembuat kebijakan The Fed mengatakan aktivitas ekonomi dan lapangan kerja di Amerika \"meningkat dalam beberapa bulan terakhir namun tetap jauh di bawah level awal tahun.\"  Komite itu menambahkan bahwa \"permintaan yang lebih lemah dan harga minyak yang secara signifikan lebih rendah menahan inflasi harga konsumen. Secara keseluruhan kondisi keuangan membaik dalam beberapa bulan terakhir, sebagian mencerminkan langkah-langkah kebijakan untuk mendukung ekonomi dan aliran kredit ke rumah tangga dan bisnis Amerika.\"  The Fed memangkas suku bunga AS ke kisaran 0-0,25% awal tahun ini dalam upaya untuk mendukung perekonomian, dan mempertahankan kondisi pasar yang stabil. Chairman Jerome Powell mengatakan kepada wartawan bahwa The Fed akan mempertahankan langkah-langkah stimulus bersejarahnya sampai mereka yakin ekonomi telah \"melewati\" krisis.  \"Ini benar-benar sesuai dengan apa yang kami prediksi,\" kata Gregory Faranello, Kepala Perdagangan Suku Bunga di AmeriVet Securities. \"Mereka dengan jelas mengaitkan keberhasilan ekonomi dengan virus korona...mereka semua terlibat dalam hal ini.\"  Namun, Eric Winograd, ekonom AllianceBernstein, menilai The Fed harus mengambil tindakan lebih agresif dalam upaya merangsang ekonomi riil.  \"Mereka menunjukkan   sense of urgency   untuk mendukung pasar keuangan. Mereka tidak menunjukkan urgensi untuk mendukung ekonomi riil,\" kata dia.  \"Apa yang dapat mereka lakukan - apa yang saya prediksi akan mereka lakukan, semoga pada September - menyediakan panduan lanjutan yang mencakup variabel ekonomi dan mengatakan mereka tidak akan menaikkan suku bunga sampai inflasi di atas 2%. Mereka juga bisa melakukan kontrol kurva imbal hasil; itu sesuatu dalam   toolkit   mereka.\"  Laporan Keuangan  Pekan tersibuk dari musim laporan keuangan berlanjut, dengan General Electric dan Boeing merilis angka kuartalan terbaru mereka. GE melaporkan pendapatan lebih kuat dari perkiraan bersama dengan kerugian yang lebih luas dari ekspektasi. Saham raksasa industri itu anjlok 4,4%. Boeing juga membukukan kerugian yang lebih luas dari estimasi dan sahamnya merosot 3%.  Saham Advanced Micro Devices melonjak lebih dari 12,5% setelah pembuat   chip   itu membukukan laba kuartalan lebih baik dari perkiraan dan mengeluarkan panduan optimistis untuk tahun ini.  Starbucks mengalami kerugian selama kuartal ketiga tahun fiskal, tetapi jaringan kedai kopi terbesar di dunia itu menaikkan perkiraan untuk kuartal saat ini, mendorong sahamnya melesat lebih dari 3%.  \"Sudah jelas bahwa yang terburuk sudah berakhir untuk keuntungan perusahaan,\" kata David Lefkowitz, Kepala Ekuitas UBS Global Wealth Management. \"Namun, laju pemulihan masih bergantung pada jalur virus korona dan stimulus pemerintah lebih lanjut.\"  \"Dalam pandangan kami, ini akan sangat penting karena sejumlah perusahaan menyebutkan bagaimana dukungan pemerintah sangat penting bagi pemulihan dan bisnis mengantisipasi bahwa lebih banyak bantuan akan dibutuhkan,\" kata Lefkowitz.

According to privacy advocates interviewed by Consumer Reports, splitting some of these companies apart might help protect consumer privacy and give people more ability to choose among competitors. </p><p>But not all experts agree that antitrust actions, whether they involve splitting companies or forcing them to abandon noncompetitive practices, will help average consumers.  The House Judiciary Committee announced this week that it will hold hearings on digital marketplace practices. It has also been widely reported that the Justice Department will look into Apple and Google, and that the Federal Trade Commission will focus on Facebook and Amazon.  \"This is about how do we get competition back in this space,\" said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who leads the House Antitrust Subcommittee, at a press conference on Monday.  In addition, Cicilline said the House will investigate whether existing antitrust and consumer protection laws are adequate to \"tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers,\" or whether they need to be updated.  Consumer advocates have long expressed concerns about the growing power of big technology companies, and say a range of reforms could be needed.  \"A handful of of big tech companies have come to dominate the marketplace, shaping what we buy, how we communicate, and other aspects of our lives. Consumer voices are being drowned out,\" says Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumer Reports. \"There is no silver bullet, so all options have to be on the table,\" including new laws and regulations, along with antitrust investigations.  More about Big Tech Will Facebook's New Plan Really Deliver on Privacy? Facebook's Face Recognition Privacy Setting Missing for Some Users How to Use Google Privacy Settings Amazon Echo Dot Kids Violates Privacy Rules, Advocates Claim Guide to Digital Security and Privacy  The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice declined to comment to Consumer Reports on any pending investigation.  Legal, business, and consumer advocacy experts contacted by CR cautioned that antitrust cases could go on for years. \"If we want relief and we want it in our lifetime, I don't think antitrust is the way to go,\" said Hal Singer, a senior fellow at George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center.  Instead of a drawn-out antitrust process, Singer thinks Congress should give the FTC more power to write and enforce regulations on online platforms, the way the Federal Communications Commission has authority over cable operators. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN1071166920190610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9K-18F1-J9XT-P2M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"473\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 10, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site. Federal regulators and legislators are preparing to investigate the business practices of some of the world's biggest tech giants, looking at whether the companies should be subject to antitrust action. According to privacy advocates interviewed by Consumer Reports, splitting some of these companies apart might help protect consumer privacy and give people more ability to choose among competitors. </p><p>But not all experts agree that antitrust actions, whether that involves splitting companies or simply forcing them to abandon anticompetitive practices, would help average consumers. The House Judiciary Committee announced this week it would be holding hearings on digital marketplace practices. It's also been widely reported that the Justice Department will look into Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission will focus on Facebook and Amazon. 'This is about how do we get competition back in this space,' said Rhode Island representative DavidCicilline,who leads the House Antitrust Subcommittee, at a press conference on Monday. In addition, Cicilline said the House will investigate whether existing antitrust and consumer protection laws are adequate to \"tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers,\" or whether they need to be updated. Consumer advocates have long expressed concerns about the growing power of big technology companies, and say a range of reforms could be needed. \"A handful of of big tech companies have come to dominate the marketplace, shaping what we buy, how we communicate, and other aspects of our lives. Consumer voices are being drowned out,\" Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumer Reports, says. \"There is no silver bullet, so all options have to be on the table,\" including new laws and regulations, along with antitrust investigations. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice declined to comment to Consumer Reports on any pending investigation. Legal, business, and consumer advocacy experts contacted by CR caution that antitrust cases can go on for years. \"If we want relief and we want it in our lifetime I don't think antitrust is the way to go,\" says Hal Singer,a senior fellow at George Washington's Regulatory Studies Center. Instead, Singer advocates giving the Federal Communications Commission the job of regulating competition and consumer protection in the internet arena, the way it already oversees cellular and cable providers. Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and the author of the best-selling book, \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google,\" disagrees. He points to antitrust successes from Standard Oil a century ago right up to the 1990s investigation of Microsoft that, according to a number of experts, induced the company to scale back monopolistic practices that could have blocked Google and other companies from growing. \"There are very few government actions\u2014regulations, wars, taxes\u2014where you can look back and say 'Almost every time they did this it worked out.' Except antitrust,\" Galloway says. \"Antitrust is sort of batting 1.000.\" Antitrust investigations and their effects on consumers would vary widely for each company. Here's how things could play out with Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Amazon declined to speak on the record; the other companies did not respond to requests for information. Amazon, A Store Without a Cloud? Amazon is in the catbird seat when it comes to online retailing, according to antitrust experts. The company owns the major marketplace for third-party vendors to sell to consumers, while using the same platform to promote its own private-label merchandise. In addition, Amazon collects a vast amount of data about the companies selling on the platform\u2014what moves well, at what prices, and where else on Amazon people click before making a buying decision. Advocates worry that the company could use that data to recognize sales trends and respond to them, perhaps by launching its own competitive products. Experts who spoke to CR suggested that regulators might try to split Amazon's selling platform from its own branded products. But there's an even simpler way to imagine where an antitrust action against Amazon might focus. In addition to its online retail marketplace, Amazon also provides servers and backend support to a vast proportion of all sites on the web through its profitable Amazon Web Services division. Galloway contends that Amazon's lucrative AWS business has allowed the retail side of the business to keep prices low without worrying much about profit margins, dampening the emergence of e-commerce competition. \"We don't know what we're missing,\" says Galloway. \"There would have been a lot more e-commerce companies founded in the last 10 years if you didn't have Amazon subsidizing their retail platform and effectively giving consumers a dollar's worth of value for 90 cents,\" he says. While consumers benefit in the short term from those cut-rate deals, removing that cash cow from the compay's business could result in a healthier collection of online retailers vying for attention with great customer service, attractive pricing, unique products, or other consumer benefits, he says. \"Spinnng off AWS would force Amazon to compete more fairly against other retailers,\" Galloway says. Apple Battling iOS Competitors? Consumer advocates note that Apple began as a computer company that for years battled against a market dominated by machines running Microsoft operating systems, but now it makes money not just from hardware but also from content, apps, and cloud services. And the links between those parts of the company could be a focus for regulators. Alex Harman, who focuses on competition issues at Public Citizen, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, points out that Apple supplies nearly half the smartphones in the United States. 'They have a captive market with the iPhone,' for Apple's own messaging, photo storage, and music services, he says. While iPhone owners can use competitors' apps, they need to download them from the company's App Store\u2014and Apple takes a cut of the revenue, including in-app purchases. App developers call it the \"Apple tax.\" Google has a similar advantage with Android and the Google Play Store, but Google sells relatively few of its own phones, and Android phones don't block you from downloading apps from other sources. Douglas Melamed, a Stanford law professor who specializes in antitrust law, points out that in 2012 the Justice Department prevailed over Apple in a small antitrust case alleging price-fixing on ebooks. Further, Apple is currently facing private litigation regarding app store competition. How might regulators approach Apple?'A remedy might permit app developers to sell through some other means online,' he says. Consumers might face uncertainty about whether such apps were safe from malware, a problem that currently gives Android users a good reason to stick to the Google Play Store. But it could also open the market for alternative app marketplaces, and put pressure on Apple to reduce its app commissions, which can get passed on to consumers. Facebook Stripped of Instagram? Facebook is already being investigated by the FTC over its consumer privacy practices. If an antitrust action were to follow, it's easy to imagine the fracture lines where the company could be split: Facebook boughtthe Instagram photo sharing service in 2012 and the WhatsApp messaging service in 2014, and has maintained them as separate brands. \"The purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram was an anti-competitive act, designed to prevent these companies from growing and potentially competing against Facebook,\" Public Citizen's Harman alleges. Facebook says its now moving rapidly to integrate the messaging functions of Facebook and Instagram with WhatsApp. According to the company, the goal is to make things more convenient for consumers, while leveraging WhatsApp's encryption technology to enhance consumer privacy. But consumer advocates say that combining all of those messaging platforms looks like a strategy to make it harder for regulators to roll back the acquisitions. WhatsApp's privacy policy acknowledges that Facebook can already use the records of who you text, from where, and when, for marketing, even though the contents of the messages remain inaccessible. If the company was broken apart, Harman suggests, it could be a win for consumer data privacy. \"A breakup could result in competition on privacy,\" he says. \"WhatsApp had held up privacy as a virtue, so instead of a race to the bottom on privacy you'd have a race to the top.\" However, other experts suggest that the benefits would be small\u2014unless there were bigger changes to the messaging world. Charlotte Slaiman, policy counsel with Public Knowledge, a Washington D.C.-based public policy organization, argues that lively competion would require all messaging apps to be interoperable with those from competitors. \"You'd not only be able port your data from Facebook to a new competitor, but what's really important is that you'd be able to continue to communicate with your friends on the network,\" she says. Right now, if you're on a Samsung phone using the AT...ellular network and a friend is on a Verizon iPhone you can still text and make phone calls. You don't need to use the same service all your friends already signed up with. But you can't use WhatsApp to send a message to other popular messaging apps such as Telegram, Viber, or Slack. And that tends to lock in the dominant position of whichever apps already have the most users, regardless of whether more convenient or more private alternatives enter the market. Google Without YouTube? Google, and its parent company Alphabet are a very complicated, multifaceted set of businesses. These include, but aren't limited to, Search, Gmail, YouTube, the Android operating system, Google's own Android phones, and three closely related advertising systems that touch every part of the online advertising business\u2014letting other companies plan where and how to advertise, accepting ads on Google's own sites, and placing ads all over the web. It's not clear where the Department of Justice would focus an antitrust investigation, says Slaiman of Public Knowledge. And big corporate investigations tend to move slowly and secretly, she says, so the DOJ might not explain what it may be investigating for a year or more. That leaves privacy and business experts to speculate. One possibility is that if Google were broken up, consumers wouldn't see much difference. That's the view of Harman of Public Citizen, who contends that each of the resulting mini-Googles would dominate its own slice of turf. \"YouTube doesn't have a natural competitor,\" he says, citing one example. \"If you broke the company up into five separate monopolies that doesn't solve anything.\" Galloway disagrees. He suggests that if, say, Google's Search business were spun off from YouTube, the two companies might immediately go into competition against each other. \"I believe that in the first strategy meeting of the new YouTube after the breakup, they would go into text-based search. And I believe in the first meeting of an independent Google, they would decide to go into video,\" he says. \"Then you'd have two viable competitors in a market where you now have one.\" The result could be lower prices for advertisers\u2014consumers don't pay cash for most of Google's products and might not benefit financially. But, Galloway says, a potential YouTube competitor might also have a new incentive to differentiate its services, perhaps by actively banning harmful content. In that scenario, \"I think that within 12 months [one of the rivals] would be a much safer place for our children to go,\" he says. \"Innovation would mean more safety.\" Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world.

The market has been up throughout the day -- pretty much since the get go, and has held on to the gains with a few wobbles on the way that we will discuss, but we are at record levels throughout.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The markets are up, and these are the reasons why. The Fed's Jerome Powell strongly hinting at a rate cut today. We'll hear from his second day of testimony, and why the markets like it so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The French are taxing Big Tech. The Americans don't like it and they are threatening to retaliate.</p><p>Also the British Navy to the rescue after a BP tanker is menaced in the Persian Gulf.</p><p>We are live in the world's financial capital, New York City, where it's just started to rain, otherwise, a beautiful day in the city. It is Thursday. It's the 11th of July. I'm Richard Quest. Yes, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening, a record day -- a record breaking left, right and center for U.S. markets, as hopes for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve is propelling Wall Street and markets to new highs. And if you look at what's happening in the market, well, we're talking some serious numbers here.</p><p>The Dow Jones has topped 27,000 for the first time, and the S&amp;P 500 could also close at a record of its own. It has crossed 3,000. It's been bouncing up and down throughout it, but it is touch and go now as it traded virtually flat.</p><p>The NASDAQ, however, no records there. It is in the red for this session. But it has been -- you know, perspective, perspective, perspective. It is easing back from the all-time high that it only set on yesterday. And the main driver in all of this remains the U.S. Fed where investors are absolutely certain now -- the futures market has 100 percent certainty of a rate cut because of the economic and economic uncertainty in the situation at the moment.</p><p>In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee this Thursday, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said concerns about U.S.-China trade were very much at play in these decisions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: The trade negotiations that have been going on have injected uncertainty for those businesses into their supply chain. So many of them have moved their supply chains, some moved them to Mexico, and then found that Mexico might be the target of tariffs. Others are considering what to do.</p><p>In any case, it's -- at a minimum, it's a distraction from going out there and you know, rolling out new products and that sort of thing. And so it shows up a lot in the Beige Book just overall concerns, and I think it's weighing on the outlook.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: That is fascinating, Clare Sebastian listening to the Fed Chair. He was he was almost like an economist pundit, rather than the Chair of the Fed. It shows up in the Beige Book. That's the anecdotal report that the Feds regional banks provide. But there's no easy sign of solution on this.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: No, absolutely not. And we've seen again today, President Trump has been tweeting that, you know, China is letting the U.S. down by not buying more farm products.</p><p>So look, the Fed Chair clearly sees a real world impact. He says it's also showing up in the data, lower business investment, manufacturing is starting to suffer. And I think, you know, obviously, this is why the market is up today, perversely, because this is yet more evidence that the Fed is now moving towards a rate cut at the end of July. He doesn't see the truce at the end of June, as a lifting of the uncertainties.</p><p>QUEST: Is this rate cut justified? I mean, Anthony Chan yesterday said it was. Peter Tuchman at the stock exchange says you've got low unemployment, you've got growth -- strong growth -- there is no honest justification other than presidential pressure for this rate cut.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And market pressure. And I think that should be taken seriously because there is a real risk that if the Fed does nothing at the end of July, that they inadvertently cause a tightening in financial conditions by causing a drop -- the serious drop in the market.</p><p>So I think they have to an extent been boxed in here, not necessarily by presidential pressure, although that is something that people are worried about, but by the markets themselves.</p><p>QUEST: Looking -- we talked yesterday about the Minutes and when one read the Minutes as I know, you will have read them closely. The Committee -- it's going to find it very difficult not to cut rates having come out and said well, we all pretty much think we should at some point.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right. I think certainly, we are now looking at a 25 basis point cut at the end of July. They were divided at that meeting. There wasn't a major consensus towards a cut. But most people were edging towards that.</p><p>So I think what we're going to see now, one economist described it to me as an immunization shot at the end of July, a way of kind of insulating the economy against the coming risks. What happens after that? I think, it is very much up for debate.</p><p>[15:05:23] QUEST: But people are now talking about growth of under two percent.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right.</p><p>QUEST: Which is not on -- I mean, I don't see that on the horizon, yet. We've just had a 3.1 percent growth. So it's a fairly dramatic drop to suggest that by the end of the year, what are your economists telling you?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: That it is going to start to slow and it's not just about the U.S. economy, but the global growth picture is really starting to weigh on the U.S. There's uncertainty about trade that is slowing economies around the world, all of this is starting to hit the domestic economy.</p><p>And you know, we see it from the big international institutions, the IMF, the OECD -- everyone is predicting that growth is going to start to slow over the next year or so.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Thank you. Your thoughts on this particular matter are most important. Join the conversation, as always. Now, whatever your favorite digital device is, we want you to join the conversation. And you can do it at cnn.com/join. The issue there is whether the Fed should be cutting interest rates cnn.com/join.</p><p>Robert Reich is with me. He is the former U.S. Labor Secretary. He joins me from Berkeley in California. Mr. Secretary, it is always good to have you. Thank you, sir for taking time. Firstly, on this question, do you think the Fed has been bullied into a prospective rate cut at the end of July?</p><p>ROBERT REICH, FORMER U.S. LABOR SECRETARY: Well, Richard, it certainly looks like the Fed has been bullied in the sense that Donald Trump has been very, very outspoken unlike any other recent President about the importance of the Fed cutting rates. He has even said that he is looking into the possibility of getting rid of Jerome Powell if he doesn't like what Jerome Powell is doing in terms of rates.</p><p>It's very important, but at the same time -- and Powell is in a very difficult spot here. It's very important for the Fed and for Powell to show or at least give the impression that the Fed and Powell are not being affected by the President and that they are independent.</p><p>And as Julia just said, there are reasons to worry about an economic slowdown, and also a global slowdown and uncertainties, particularly with regard to China-U.S. trade and that trade war. So I think the Fed is in an almost impossible position right now.</p><p>QUEST: Right, in that impossible position, they will probably -- I mean, it would be extraordinary if they did not cut now, having basically telegraphed it to the market. Are you as concerned as Jerome Powell? It clearly seemed to be in his testimony about this slow down predicated on the back of the trade problems?</p><p>REICH: Well, yes, there is a lot of reason to be concerned. But here's the irony, the uncertainty is mostly coming out of the White House. I mean, this is a President who basically runs his entire administration on uncertainty, on fear, on him pulling rabbits out of hats.</p><p>And in that atmosphere, you have a Fed, and a Chairman of the Fed trying to keep the rudder, trying to keep the ship of the economy going straight. And it looks like -- and it is going to continue to look like Jerome Powell is sort of bailing out Donald Trump from Donald Trump's trade wars or his threats of trade wars.</p><p>QUEST: Don't you find though, because there's a sudden uncomfortableness of position here, because they use us -- for example, you had been a critic in the past of China's trade policies. And now of course, somebody is doing something about them.</p><p>But of course, the issue is whether they're doing the right thing. Does it make sense to be going into battle against with China in this way?</p><p>REICH: Well, the question of what tools does the United States have or the rest of the world have with regard to China? And exactly what does the United States want from China? And those aren't slightly different questions.</p><p>I mean, with regard to a trade imbalance, yes, China and the United States can look at that trade imbalance and see if progress has been made over time. But the Trump administration has been very ambiguous about what else it wants from China.</p><p>It doesn't like the fact for example, that China is seeking dominance in a lot of high technology areas and people in the Trump administration have been quite vocal about the importance of China not becoming a national security threat in terms of technologies like 5G.</p><p>Well, you can't as a matter of American national policy and trade policy, bully China into not trying to become a world leader in the technologies of the future. So you see how uncertain this entire system is.</p><p>And finally, Richard, just to add to another bit of uncertainty with very, very low interest rates and the anticipation of very low interest rates, we've got a lot of borrowing going on that itself creates instability in the system.</p><p>[15:10:24] QUEST: While we were just talking, we've got the early answer on should the Fed cut rates with markets at record highs? Seventy eight percent of the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS viewer, the wise viewer says no, 22 percent say yes. If you were voting on that, should the Fed cut rates with markets at record highs? What would your vote be?</p><p>REICH: I would say in the very short term, yes, but I would -- because I am concerned about the long term as many of your viewers are, I would say this adds to instability. This is the wrong time, the wrong place. The Fed should not be playing or appear to be playing politics.</p><p>QUEST: It's a difficult situation. We'll talk more about with you in just a moment, sir.

Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: That verdict will be handed down in due course. Staying in France, the country is about to become the first country in Europe to introduce a tax on tech giants. Now, the U.S. is investigating the move saying it could discriminate against large tech companies, you know the names: Facebook, alphabet, Apple and Amazon. Because of the way the taxes are constructed, designed on certain revenue bases, it will be the large U.S. tech companies that will be hit hardest.</p><p>In return, the U.S. is open to 301 investigation and that could lead to retaliation with tariffs on French goods. Robert Reich is still here, former U.S. Labor Secretary. Mr. Reich, the French have got the bit between the teeth on this, whilst other countries are looking at whether Big Tech should be broken up or restricted or regulated, the French have decided to tax. A good idea?</p><p>REICH: Well, it's certainly an opening salvo, Richard in what is expected to be, I would say a year or two or five, a long drawn out fight with the tech giants as to what their responsibilities are to various nations.</p><p>Even in the United States, there's a big debate about whether tech ought to be broken up and what tech ought to be required to do. Whether there ought to be new regulations.</p><p>I think what the French are doing, and this is almost typical of the French, and I say this in a very positive way, is they are putting themselves out there as the kind of canary in the coal mine.</p><p>And yes, the Trump administration is likely going to respond. But remember, these tech giants are not just American firms, these are global firms. They make their money all over the globe, a lot of what the money - - that Amazon and Facebook and Google are making comes from places like France.</p><p>QUEST: But you would agree that the tide of opinion is turning against them on certain areas. So for example, if it's Facebook, there's questions about Messenger and WhatsApp. And, you know, effectively, it's the new telephone exchange for the 21st Century.</p><p>If it's Amazon, there are questions about, yes, they pay the tax that the law says, but is that the right level of tax? Is that the fair level of tax?</p><p>REICH: Well, absolutely, Richard. I mean there are questions about market power that underlie all of these things, because these tech giants really are based on what are called network economies that are beyond economies of scale. They really -- it's very, very hard for anybody else to get in the market.</p><p>And so you've got these five American tech giants that are increasingly dominating the market with regard to all kinds of consumer technology products and this causes ripples of problems in the economy all over.</p><p>QUEST: Straightforward question. Are they too powerful and should they be broken up?</p><p>[15:20:00] REICH: Well, my own view and I have expressed this in a variety of places is that they should be broken up, but it doesn't require -- I mean, in other words, there are different ways of breaking up. You can require the technologies be licensed to other competitors. That's one way of so-called breaking them up. You don't have to literally take a sledgehammer and do what we did to MaBel, the giant AT&amp;T monopoly in the United States. There are many other things that can be done.</p><p>But what I've noticed is that in Washington, among Republicans, as well as Democrats, there is an increasing concern about the market power of these tech giants.</p><p>QUEST: Final question. It just occurred to me. I can't have you here -- which of the candidates for the Democratic nominees do you like the look of?</p><p>REICH: Well, I'm not taking sides at this point, Richard. I think it's very important for the -- no, no, I'm not being coy. Democrats have got to stay together. I mean, if we are going to and I say we, as a Democrat, if we're going to defeat Donald Trump in November -- next November, it is very, very important for Democrats not to get involved in the same kind of antagonizing primary fights that they got into in 2016.</p><p>QUEST: Mr. Secretary, good to see you. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it very much.</p><p>REICH: Good to see you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. Now, we should take a moment and have a look and check on the markets. To Europe. Now, that French tech tax is weighing on the market investors' minds, especially if it means retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. But it is years away.</p><p>It widened an earlier rally, which was driven by optimism over Jerome Powell's comments. And you may also think, of course, that there's to be an eco-tax, and as a result, all of Europe down, which is interesting because they had seen a strong open in New York, and they simply were unable to follow on through.</p><p>You may not realize it, but many of the American films and TV shows we're watching weren't filmed in Hollywood, instead, they were filmed in the U.S. State of Georgia.</p><p>Now some Hollywood's big players want to cut production because of Georgia's new law that would ban most abortions after six weeks.

A quick look at the markets before we take a halfway break. You'll want to see exactly where we are in the record. Yes, still at records -- records for the Dow. The S&amp;P slightly more questionable. We are -- we were over 3,000 but bouncing up and down between that at the moment for the broader market.</p><p>After the break drama on the high seas. The U.K. says an Iranian attempt to impede a British oil tanker is reported by the Royal Navy.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I am Richard Quest. There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. Military forces are upholding international law after an Iranian boat attempted to impede a British tanker in the Persian Gulf. Sam Kiley is in Abu Dhabi to tell us about that.</p><p>And the founder and driving force of Norwegian Shuttle steps down. He will leave the legacy of a long haul, low cost carrier and a very strong one at that, but we we'll sort through the financials. As we continue, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>A tense standoff in the Persian Gulf. The United Kingdom says its Navy intervened when Iranian vessels tried to force a British oil tanker to change course into Iranian waters. This comes a week after the British seized an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar. We will have a live report in just a moment after these news headlines.</p><p>U.S. Federal agents are getting ready to start rounding up undocumented immigrants across the country. A U.S. official says the raids will start on Sunday and they'll target to thousands of people who are already under deportation orders.</p><p>He has been lobbying to include that in the U.S. Census and he is expected to table that effort and order the government to get citizen data through other means.</p><p>[15:30:10]</p><p>In Greece, police have located the body of the missing American scientist Suzanne Eaton, calling it a homicide. Two residents found her body deep in this tunnel which was once used as a military bunker. A molecular biologist who had been attending a conference in Crete, she disappeared whiles jogging.</p><p>And a freak storm in northern Greece has killed six tourists and injured dozens of people. The storm which only lasted 15 minutes included almost constant lightning and violent winds and rain. Such storms in the Mediterranean are rare and occur when sea surface temperatures are warm.</p><p>The British government says it's concerned by Iran's attempt to stop a BP oil tanker from passing through the Straits of Hormuz. Now, British Heritage -- so, let's remind ourselves what was happening. British Heritage was sailing out of the Persian Gulf into the Straits of Hormuz.</p><p>Coming -- hang on, kind of sorts of a nice bit of color here, try another color, given that -- well, you get the idea. It was sailing this way out and Britain says three armed Iranian boats tried to block its passage and tried -- here we go, tried to block its passage and in doing so, now, they were only turned away when a Royal Naval frigate warned them off.</p><p>At that particular point, the Iranians then withdrew. The State Department has condemned Iran's -- what it describes as unlawful action. But if you look at this particular area, you'll see just how close and how tight and how important it is. Bearing in mind, the amount of traffic that comes through this choke point and the ability of any of the countries around to actually influence what is going on.</p><p>Sam Kiley is in Abu Dhabi and is very familiar with the Straits of Hormuz and that choke point that we're talking about. But Sam, as I look at this, now, how risky was it for the HMS Montrose to try and protect the heritage whiles the Iranians were jockeying?</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, given that the Montrose has and did brand this as 30 millimeter automatic cannon, a numerous 7.62 chain-fed machine guns against a 3 fast moving but armed Iranian gun boats, Richard, not much of a match and the Iranians backed off.</p><p>But that would have been the moment had they clashed there. And there would have been only one victor, but there would have been no winner in this. It would have escalated in all probability to something much more catastrophic. For that reason, the Minister of Defense have been trying to play down this incident when it first came out, actually through the Pentagon and Barbara Starr's exclusive report last night that this clash had occurred a long time before the Ministry of Defense would really give any detail on it.</p><p>And when they did, they said that the Iranians had indeed tried to effectively herd this BP tanker into their own territory and this making good on pledges by President Rouhani, not very many hours earlier on, who said that --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>KILEY: Iran would extract retribution for the seizing of that ship at Gibraltar.</p><p>QUEST: But as I look at this map, what becomes clear is the ability for this to re-occur. If the Iranians have got the bit between the teeth in this way, largely on the back of the taking of the -- of the Gibraltar vessel, then their ability to cause mischief around this area is pretty much unlimited.</p><p>KILEY: It's pretty unlimited. There's only 31 kilometers between what is the tip of that peninsula which is a money territory and Iran. It's a very narrow choke point, indeed, the amount of international waters, of course, even less. So, if you don't want to go through Iranian waters, the congestion is very serious.</p><p>Now, insurance rates have gone up 10 fold, just to go through that area is an indication of the potential for Iran, as you say, to disrupt and cause a degree of economic dismay. And that's part of the pressure that Tehran is trying to put on the international community, but especially on the United States to return to negotiations.</p><p>[15:35:00] QUEST: Sam, thank you, good to have your interpretation on that. Sam Kiley joining me. Jakob Larsen is the head of Maritime Security for BIMCO; the world's largest international shipping association. He joins me now from Copenhagen via Skype. When you look at this situation, and you think about what's happened in the last 24 hours, how concerned are you that a BP; a major tanker was -- there was an attempt to interfere with it, which one of the world's leading navies had to prevent?</p><p>JAKOB LARSEN, HEAD OF MARITIME SECURITY, BIMCO: Obviously, we are concerned and we see this as an escalation in an already very tense situation. So, I think it was very good that the Royal Navy were at the scene and were able to prevent the situation escalating any further. And I think it actually demonstrates that armed escort vessels or convoys can actually make a difference, a positive difference to Maritime security levels in the region.</p><p>QUEST: But that's a fascinating concept in the sense -- I mean, there's a certain traditional aspect to it, an armed convoy, and if you think, of course, of the Saudi ships and those that were mined and those that have been damaged. But how do you really want armed escorts going from the Gulf of Oman through the Straits and into the Persian Gulf? What happens when you have multiple armed escorts?</p><p>LARSEN: In the event that there are multiple war ships present in the Straits and we see this already. I mean, obviously, those that are working together, they will need to coordinate closely to avoid misunderstandings, and they will also need some pretty good strong doctrine where they are very clear on what their intentions --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>LARSEN: Are to avoid unnecessary escalation of the -- of the --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LARSEN: Situations with for example Iranian Revolutionary Guard or Iranian Navy.</p><p>QUEST: Is --</p><p>LARSEN: But that said, I think it's something that has been done before, and I'm quite sure that capable Navies are able to manage themselves in a sensible fashion here.</p><p>QUEST: If we look at what happened yesterday, is this, in your opinion, is this an accident waiting to happen?</p><p>LARSEN: I think this was an accident waiting to happen. After the Iranian tanker was seized in Gibraltar, the Iranian authorities have clearly stated that they want to pay back in a similar fashion. So that was expected. On the 13th of June, we saw two vessels attack them in the Gulf of Oman, and since then, we haven't seen any attacks in shipping in the Gulf --</p><p>QUEST: Good --</p><p>LARSEN: But I think it's the fear across the whole industry that it might just happen again, especially if the U.S. is keeping up the pressure on Iran.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir, thank you, thank you for joining us tonight, much appreciate it. Oil prices are shedding some of the gains that they made on Wednesday. Several factors, and it depends on which side of the Atlantic we're talking about, the upside and the downside. For instance, OPEC is forecasting a surplus next year, less demand for oil even as OPEC members are keeping a lid on production.</p><p>And I'll counter that with the tensions in the Straits of Hormuz which are keeping prices from falling too much. So, you have within those, you've got Brent particularly being affected. And then you've got WTI, West Texas, it's dropping less because of a tropical storm Barry which you can see there, bearing down on the southern U.S., and that's putting a lot of oil rigs, not as many as first thought, but there are still sizable number of rigs in the danger zone in what could become a category one hurricane.</p><p>As you and I continue our evening chat, the chief executive of Norwegian is stepping down after two decades. He was a former fighter pilot, he took a brand from a local operator, made it into a low-cost carrier, and then a global giant as the first true global low-cost long haul. We'll talk about that after the break.</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Some news to bring you. Twenty five people have sustained minor injuries as a result of turbulence. They're on an Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Sydney. The plane was over the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off Hawaii when it encountered violent turbulence. According to the airline, the flight diverted to Hawaii where it landed in Honolulu less than three hours ago.</p><p>Stephanie Elam is in Los Angeles. And this was -- this was, I mean, the plane was in the cruise and then everything went wrong.</p><p>STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Very quickly too, Richard. And just to update that number, the airline say it's 35 passengers --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ELAM: That may have been minorly hurt during this. Now, they're saying this -- the airline calling it \"unforecasted and sudden turbulence\". They were 600 miles southwest of Hawaii when this happened, and they decided to turn around because of the injuries, they could tell that people were hurt. In fact, take a listen to what some of the passengers said happened on the flight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHARON THORNTON, PASSENGER ON DIVERTED CANADIAN FLIGHT: We were all sort of dozing, and the cabin was pretty dark, and it just seemed that the plane just sank and then flew up. A lady in front of us, I don't think she had her seat belt on, she hit the ceiling.</p><p>LAURIE TYLER, PASSENGER ON DIVERTED CANADIAN FLIGHT: It went bang and the people just shot up and then down again, and then it was over.</p><p>MICHAEL BAILEY, PASSENGER ON DIVERTED CANADIAN FLIGHT: A lot of people hit the ceiling, and a lot of screaming. Sitting in front of me, they hit the place together, hit and actually snapped and broke it, and the oxygen masks came down, and you had a lot of panic, but we're sort of straight away -- a lot of people were injured, yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELAM: And our affiliate \"KHNL\" in Honolulu talking to those passengers, saying that nine people have gone to the hospital, they may have some head or neck injuries. Some of them, they're saying we're superficial like scratches and the like. But they're saying some of the flight attendants may have been hurt as well when one of those rolling carts may have toppled over onto one of the flight attendants.</p><p>It's worth noting that this happened about four hours into the flight. The plane was dark, service was done for the period, and most people were snoozing at the time when this happened. They're also saying that a lot of the injuries seem to have been sustained by people who were not wearing their seat belts.</p><p>We know that two pregnant women were on board. One was wearing her seat belt and that gave her some pain after the turbulence, the stress of the seat belt there. The other one was not wearing her seat belt. But the passengers telling our affiliate that the flight crew was very reassuring, and that after this happened, which was just mere seconds, five minutes later, they said the captain came on the PA system to tell them that the plane was fine, but that they were going to turn around and return to Honolulu to make sure that the passengers were OK.</p><p>Ambulances were there to meet them. At this point now, those passengers, Richard, are in line at Air Canada figuring out if they're going to re- route to continue on to Sydney still today or whether or not they're going to have this unexpected stay in Honolulu and travel out tomorrow. But scary for those people who were definitely asleep, and really important to point out that keeping that seat belt on while you're flying is --</p><p>QUEST: No --</p><p>ELAM: Good advice.</p><p>[15:45:00] QUEST: No one believes the importance of it until it happens. Stephanie Elam, thank you. Let's stay with aviation. The founder and chief executive of Norwegian Air is stepping down after 17 years. Bjorn Kjos says he will stay on as an adviser to the chairman. The former fighter pilot changed the airline business.</p><p>He took his low cost airline and he went long haul low-cost across Europe and then to the U.S. and Asia and Latin America. It's led to soaring costs, high debts and the airlines struggle to control. Now, in 2013, Norwegian launched its first low-cost long haul flight.</p><p>By last year, the financial picture had worsened to such an extent that the airline needed a partner. It received takeover offers for example from IAG which it rebuffed and indeed Lufthansa also. In late 2018, Norwegian announced a program to save $230 million a year, it cut routes, it closed some bases outside Norway.</p><p>And this January, IAG said it had sold its stake that it was taking in hopes of forcing Norwegian into some form of negotiations. Norwegian announced it was asking shareholders to stump up another $350 million. I spoke to Bjorn Kjos in 2018 and asked him about the future for Norwegian in a crowded market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BJORN KJOS, FOUNDER, NORWEGIAN AIR SHUTTLE: All this have competitors. It's just about who really you have. We got up to scale and certainly served so many of the cities in U.S. and the other huge networks in Europe. So, we are at the level now, we should definitely release our harvesting now.</p><p>QUEST: And what will it take though to become profitable?</p><p>KJOS: Well, we run top the long haul this year, tremendously. No, we are all on the peak now, we can -- no, we can start harvesting. So we should - - our future as I see it will be bright.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Simon Calder is with me, travel editor at \"The Independent\". We have to -- we have to divorce here, don't we? The fact, the admiration that people have, that we all have beyond for what he's built with Norwegian Air shuttle and now the long haul with the reality that he's finding it very difficult to get the long haul low-cost profitable.</p><p>SIMON CALDER, TRAVEL EDITOR, THE INDEPENDENT: All right, he certainly is, and -- no, I mean, they've done tremendously well. They are the biggest non-U.S. carrier to the New York market. Bigger than Lufthansa, bigger than Air Canada, bigger than British Airways, which is quite an achievement except that in the airline business, as you know and Bjorn Kjos knows, you don't get any marks for scale if you're losing money and they have been losing money prodigiously.</p><p>And it's simply the kind of expansion that we have seen --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>CALDER: So many times that has cost airlines dearly.</p><p>QUEST: But the airlines itself, I mean, the European sector, the low-cost sector is profitable and is well regarded. I mean, if they got into really serious trouble, which they have been to some extent, there are plenty of people who take them over.</p><p>CALDER: Well, are there? I mean, they got the absolutely golden opportunity last year when IAG; the parent company of British Airways and Iberia of Spain effectively said here you are. Here's -- oh, I think at the time, $1.3 billion. I don't think you'd find anybody who would be paying that much money for Norwegian now.</p><p>They've certainly done well in the sense that they have rattled the long haul airlines. They forced them into making their own moves to cut costs long haul, but we still have the problem --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>CALDER: That they're trying out routes, they're not working, they are retrenching, and now, they're actually -- I think we probably see in this current calendar year, we'll probably see them actually reduce the number - -</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>CALDER: Of aircraft and number of routes, but of course, lots of that still with the Boeing 737 Max.</p><p>QUEST: Quick question. That plane going -- the Air Canada from Vancouver to -- I mean, it wasn't sustained turbulence --</p><p>CALDER: Oh, yes --</p><p>QUEST: It was just obviously one very nasty jolt.</p><p>CALDER: Oh, sure, but terribly upsetting experience for the passengers. And as we have all been saying, make sure you are strapped in. It's now a big logistical headache, of course, for Air Canada who have passengers in Honolulu where they don't want to be.</p><p>They've got other passengers waiting in Sydney to go back to Vancouver. It's going to take a few days to sort this one out because their pilots are, I hope, in Waikiki enjoying a cocktail.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: There's a -- there's a wistful -- sorry, when there's a wistful tone in your voice. It's good to see you, sir, thank you as always.</p><p>CALDER: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: We're into the last few minutes of trade on Wall Street, and the Dow is set to close at a record. Thanks to dovish tones of the Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a moment.</p><p>[15:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Well, looking at the eye, we're at the best of the session. We're up 207, we're 212 a moment ago, last few moments of trade on Wall Street. The Dow is on a track for a record close, the S&amp;P is also heading for a record.

Goldman, which is number five is at 2.7 percent. So, a really strong -- banks across the Dow are up, in fact, the only weak points are some of the tech stocks further down.</p><p>It's all lifted by Jerome Powell's testimony, I talked to Peter Tuchman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on \"EXPRESS\", he told me, the markets could be in trouble if they need another rate cuts in the near future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER TUCHMAN, QUATTRO M. SECURITIES: I think it's more of a risk of lowering rates into a strong market that in fact if things do slow down, and we will need to once again need a stimulus and lower rates once again - -</p><p>QUEST: Oh --</p><p>TUCHMAN: That we won't have another bullet in your chamber, that's my fear. I don't think we're rising quickly. This market has been growing beautifully from 26 out of 27 file(ph) right off of the Christmas eve lows that we saw, we're up 20 percent for the year, solid market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Paul La Monica, guru is with us.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes sir --</p><p>QUEST: What do you make of it? I mean, we're at a record for no obvious reason --</p><p>LA MONICA: Well --</p><p>QUEST: Other than rate cut which may happen later -- which will happen later this month, that may or may not be necessary.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, that obviously is what we need to debate, but it is the reason why this market is grinding higher yet again because, say what you want about the political pressure from President Trump, but it's the market pressure, the market, I think you could argue, has bullied the Fed into this position where --</p><p>QUEST: I want to know why?</p><p>LA MONICA: They need to --</p><p>QUEST: Why, the market has -- how has the market bullied them?</p><p>LA MONICA: Well, you have the Fed's funds futures and things of that queue up, people going on TV networks like ours and competitors and talking about how the Fed has to really take action to avoid a big drop-off in the stock market that could eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy.</p><p>And I think it just creates this sort of fear environment where if you're Jerome Powell, and if you don't do what the market wants, there's this violent reaction that then starts to feed on itself.</p><p>[15:55:00] And I think --</p><p>QUEST: But --</p><p>LA MONICA: It's an unfortunate situation that the Fed has lost control so to speak, and is letting the market bully.</p><p>QUEST: But the Fed, I mean, what they're really doing when they cut in two weeks, three weeks is reversing that last rate rise which many said was the last -- was the straw in the camel, and that's when the market went down very sharply --</p><p>LA MONICA: Right --</p><p>QUEST: Right, that's where we had all that volatility --</p><p>LA MONICA: Right --</p><p>QUEST: In December. It was a terrible holiday on Wall Street, and I think it is fair to wonder if Jerome Powell and the rest of the Fed, did they make a mistake by going too far with that rate hike in December, and that by taking it back now, it's essentially their admission of guilt, their admission of error.</p><p>That would be the all well and good, the problem though is that once you cut rates once, the market gets greedy. I can bet you President Trump will get greedy, he'll like the way that the market has reacted and though want more. Give me more, give me more. They're like gritty kids in Willy Wonka.</p><p>At some point, Powell has to say, enough is enough, no more candy, go brush your teeth.</p><p>QUEST: Eighty percent of our viewers say the rate rise is not justified. We will have our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment. David and Goliath, the Norwegian struggle to be one of the world's great airlines, and Bjorn Kjos who is without doubt one of the great pioneers in aviation along with the likes of Sir Freddie Laker and yes, Richard Branson.</p><p>He took this airline, Norwegian air shuttle, he grew it into a low-cost carrier across Europe, free Wi-Fi, great service, friendly staff, a lot, and then decided low cost long haul was the way forward in the future. Now, we can argue whether he's gone too far, too fast and yes, he has.</p><p>He's grown the airline too fast, he's got his 787s, he's now got 737 Maxs, but you cannot take away the brilliance and genius and pioneering spirit of Bjorn. It is upon people like him that aviation has been born and grows and thrives. And the fact he's now retiring for the time being is to be -- is to be celebrated as his career.</p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable.

The Dow is at a record!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019071101cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-2NG1-JB20-G139-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001SGS</classCode><className>ORANGE SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NEW YORK GIANTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>ORAN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>ORA (PAR)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Market, Economy, Wall Street, Federal Reserve, Europe, Deaths, Tax, Big Tech, Abortion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Census Citizenship</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tropical Storm Barry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>WTI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Stock Exchanges</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

In a living room office overflowing with books and baby toys, Wylie settles into an armchair and unspools the story of how she found herself up against the mother of all Internet companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In October 2017, Sidewalk Labs, a Google-affiliated company looking to make urban life more streamlined, economical and green by infusing cities with sensors and data analytics, announced plans to build the world's first neighborhood \"from the Internet up\" on 12 acres of the Toronto waterfront, an area known as Quayside. Sidewalk aims to, for example, build an \"advanced microgrid\" to power electric cars, design \"mixed-use\" spaces to bring down housing costs, employ \"sensor-enabled waste separation\" to aid recycling and use data to improve public services.</p><p>The company's long-term vision is to expand to the adjacent Port Lands, a valuable 800-acre tract of industrial waterfront. And from there, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a press conference to unveil the project, to \"other parts of Canada and around the world.\" Quayside will be \"a testbed for new technologies,\" Trudeau declared in rousing tones. \"Technologies that will help us build smarter, greener, more inclusive cities.\" The media was then treated to a series of utopic renderings of a futuristic neighborhood featuring driverless buses, green-roofed condos and carefree\u00a0children running\u00a0barefoot\u00a0amid butterflies.       </p><p>Wylie, however, has zero tolerance for smart city PR-speak. \"The smart city industry is a Trojan horse for technology companies,\" she told The WorldPost. \"They come in under the guise of environmentalism and improving quality of life, but they're here for money.\"</p><p>Wylie's resume is filled with positions in IT, government consultancies and corporate development. More recently, she's worked part-time as a professor while volunteering for various \"open data\" and \"civic tech\" initiatives. Last November, she launched Tech Reset Canada (TRC) with three other activist-entrepreneurs - all women.</p><p>The group describes itself as \"pro-growth\" and \"pro-innovation\" but questions whether a top-down smart city project by an American tech behemoth is really in the best interests of Toronto's citizens. \"This is a story about governance, not urban innovation,\" Wylie said. \"There is nothing innovative about partnering with a monopoly.\"</p><p>TRC's founders are not opposed to the concept of smart cities in principle. Their concerns revolve around the collection and commodification of urban data and whether that occurs through a democratic process or via corporate fiat.</p><p>As it is, technological innovation has far outpaced lawmakers' ability to establish the rules of the road, whether in the context of Google and Facebook's immensely profitable endeavor to commodify Internet browsing activity or Internet-connected assistants like Amazon's Alexa, which eavesdrops on your every conversation while awaiting your commands. But critics of the smart city industry say that it brings the disconnect between policy and digital intrusions on privacy to another level.</p><p>Sidewalk's vision for Quayside - as a place populated by self-driving vehicles and robotic garbage collectors, where the urban fabric is embedded with cameras and sensors capable of gleaning information from the phone in your pocket - certainly sounds Orwellian. Yet the company contends that the data gathered from fully wired urban infrastructure is needed to refine inefficient urban systems and achieve ambitious innovations like zero-emission energy grids.</p><p>But so far, the virtual world has been something we opt into - giving up various rights in the terms of service agreements we hastily click closed - and can opt out of if we so choose. It's one thing to willingly install\u00a0Alexa\u00a0in your home. It's another when publicly owned infrastructure - streets, bridges, parks and plazas - is\u00a0Alexa, so to speak. There's no opting out of public space, or government services, for which Sidewalk Labs appears eager to provide an IT platform. An integral component of the proposal for Quayside is an identity management system: a \"portal through which each resident accesses public services,\" whether library cards, drivers' license renewals or healthcare.</p><p>Who will own the data streaming from sensors in every park bench, lamppost and dumpster in Quayside? No one at Sidewalk Labs, nor in local government, has given a straight answer to that question yet.</p><p>Wylie doesn't see it as a topic for debate. \"Data produced by the public should be publicly owned and managed transparently,\" she said. \"A lot of the urban problems that smart-city projects propose to address don't require a technological solution. Toronto's affordable housing crisis isn't going to be solved with more data - it's political will that's lacking.\"</p><p>When the Internet became dominated by smartphones and social media, the social contract with big tech seemed fairly durable: companies provide useful services at shockingly low prices or for free in exchange for a steady drip of information about our lives that, when collected en masse, has commercial value. But this arrangement appears to be up for a revision. An Axios poll in February found that 55 percent of Americans were concerned that the government was not doing enough to regulate the tech industry, up from 40 percent who felt that way just three months earlier. The industry still enjoys high favorability ratings overall, though this too is waning. Each of the five biggest tech companies have lost points since last fall, Google down by 12 points to 64 percent favorable, Amazon down by 13 points to 59 percent, and Facebook down by 28 points to 5 percent.</p><p>At a Toronto City Council meeting in January, Wylie delivered a deputation asking local officials to take steps to \"ensure that the data and data infrastructure of this project are the property of the city of Toronto and its residents.\" She also demanded greater transparency around the project as a whole.</p><p>When the Quayside project was announced last year, the terms of the contract between the company and Waterfront Toronto, a government-created agency that has partnered with Sidewalk to develop Quayside, were not made public. This was because they included \"commercially sensitive provisions,\" reporters were told at the time. (Neither Sidewalk Labs nor Waterfront Toronto accommodated interview requests for this article.)</p><p>City councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong, the only elected official on the Waterfront Toronto board of directors (and thus privy to the contract), has urged his fellow councilors to intervene. \"I know enough about the agreement that I think you would like to know more about the agreement,\" he said.</p><p>Since the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal blew open in March, Sidewalk's critics - a motley coalition of Canadian academics, privacy activists, business leaders and bureaucrats - have begun to control the conversation about Quayside.</p><p>Wylie has become the movement's de facto leader. The ad hoc campaign that started in her living room last fall has taken her from closed-door meetings on Parliament Hill in Ottawa to a fellowship at a think tank established by one of the co-creators of BlackBerry, who called Wylie \"a hero.\" Her pithy blog posts aim to keep Sidewalk's \"boil-the-ocean hubris,\" as she puts it, in check, while the company's representatives go about the city preaching the virtues of their plan. \"New drum to bang from here on out: no,\" she wrote in one post.</p><p>By spring, the public's relationship with Sidewalk had grown tense.</p><p>On May 1, in an apparent effort to respond to its critics, Sidewalk Labs released a Responsible Data Use Policy Framework, which states that the company \"will not sell personal information to third parties or use it ourselves for advertising purposes.\" On the surface, this would seem to assuage the public's worst fears. But to the data-literate, it's a fairly hollow promise because it leaves open the option of selling or otherwise commercializing anonymized, aggregate data - which is subject to           its own perils and can be un-anonymized by malicious actors. And besides, Facebook didn't sell its users' personal information to Cambridge Analytica. The data was made available - a key distinction - through an API that any web developer would have had access to.</p><p>On May 2, a local tech entrepreneur named Marc de Pape published a blog post that gave a critical account of his experience being interviewed for a position in Sidewalk Labs' \"city services department.\" De Pape withdrew his candidacy, citing philosophical differences that became apparent during the interview. It was the final question - \"how voting might be different in the future\" - that made his stomach turn. \"I was shocked and offended by the question as a Canadian ... how blindly ambitious do you have to be as a private American company to even imply that our public voting systems are within your mandate?\"</p><p>On May 3, The WorldPost attended a town hall-style meeting for the project, one of many public relations events that have been held since October, at which residents were invited to give input. In previous meetings, the presentation had focused on cutting-edge technology but now seemed more about convincing attendees that Toronto would not become a \"dystopian technocapitalist hellscape,\" as New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo recently described big tech's pivot to city-building. A tone of defensiveness, if not annoyance, pervaded the question-and-answer session that followed, during which attendees raised thorny questions about how their data would be used.</p><p>During the event, Wylie tweeted her disappointment about an announcement Sidewalk Labs made from the stage: that long-promised details about their plan would be delayed several more months. Micah Lasher, Sidewalk's head of policy and communications, shot back on Twitter while the meeting was still in progress: \"Except, no, that's not what was said. No matter how much you want to rush this process, we are going to continue to be deliberative.\" (But a\u00a0video\u00a0of the event shows that is what was said.)</p><p>Surprised, Wylie approached him about the disagreement. During their exchange, Lasher characterized her activism as disingenuous and motivated by personal gain. Through a representative, Lasher acknowledged the exchange but maintained that his words and tone were \"appropriate.\" A Sidewalk spokesperson who was also present insisted that \"all ended amicably.\" The feeling wasn't mutual. Wylie and a fellow activist who was present during the interaction described the conduct as an effort to intimidate.</p><p>The tech industry's \"move fast and break things\" culture - as Mark Zuckerberg famously, or perhaps, infamously, put it - tends not to take kindly to laws, institutions and individuals that get in the way. If the Toronto region is to become \"Silicon Valley North,\" as local boosters have long branded it, Wylie would prefer that such arrogance be left at the border.</p><p>\"Sidewalk Labs faces a number of political minefields, as I see it,\" said city councilor Kristyn Wong-Tam when The WorldPost reached her by phone. \"I don't want to shut the project down, but the more that they don't answer critical questions ... [the more] they're going to erode their social currency.\"</p><p>Following three high-profile resignations at Waterfront Toronto in July, the government-created agency took pains to rescue their image. The contract with Sidewalk Labs was finally made public, but it has also been rendered null and void by a newly published agreement that puts the company on a much shorter leash. Where the original agreement gave Sidewalk broad latitude as the \"master developer,\" all but handing over the keys to the 800-acre Port Lands, the new version hands the reins back to the government and makes it clear that, at least for now, the 12 acres at Quayside are all that's being promised.</p><p>On issues of privacy and data governance, the first agreement was largely silent, while the new version states that the project will move forward under \"the most privacy protected/citizen-centered set of policies and governance structures in the world, recognizing privacy as a fundamental human right.\"</p><p>\"It's a win for Waterfront Toronto because they walked back a really bad deal,\" said Wylie, who sees the government-created agency taking back control after overly accommodating Sidewalk. \"But it's not a win to me as a member of the public because we are now just more entrenched in this.\" She's not impressed with the lofty claims about privacy, either. \"That's advertising language. Tacking 'human rights' on at the end doesn't change that. We need to change our laws to reject surveillance capitalism as a social norm.\"</p><p>                          This was produced by                                                  The WorldPost                                                 , a partnership of the                                                  Berggruen Institute                                                  and The Washington Post.                    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-11715cfe97a84c938304f074316b6e97</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0C-7GF1-DXKP-J4FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2213\"/><timeReceived>4:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 8, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CQG1</classCode><className>MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000CMJ5</classCode><className>BUSINESS ANALYTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000565</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

The reason? Congress's anti-trust sub-committee has started demanding documents from Facebook and other big tech firms as part of its probe into whether big tech firms are acting anti-competitively. And Zuckerberg's trip suggests the company is worried.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The increasing pressure from the US Congress is just one example of how governments all over the world are starting to fight back against the power of Facebook. The company is facing fines, regulations and even calls for it to be broken up. But regulators and politicians still face a significant challenge in reining in Facebook's financial, political and social might.</p><p>Earlier this year, Facebook was hit with a $5 billion (R76bn) fine from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as a $100million fine from the Securities and Exchanges Commission, over its involvement in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The company could also face further billions in fines in Europe for violating data protection laws.</p><p>But Facebook made $16.6bn from advertising in the three months to June 30 this year alone. So even such huge fines don't necessarily amount to much of a punishment. However, these penalties are only one check on Facebook's power, and governments are increasingly willing to take action.</p><p>Alongside Congress's review, the FTC, the Department of Justice and a number of state attorneys are investigating big tech firms, including Facebook, for possible anti-trust violations. The UK Competition and Markets Authority is also carrying out a market study into online platforms and the digital advertising industry. In Germany, Facebook is fighting an anti-trust action in the courts. Reports suggest EU anti-trust regulators are interested in scrutinising the company's recently-launched cryptocurrency, Libra.</p><p>More generally, the EU has taken anti-trust action against several other big tech firms. Its recently re-appointed competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said data use by tech companies may need further regulation.</p><p>It's not just Facebook's economic monopoly that politicians are worried about, however. Parliamentarians from a growing number of jurisdictions -including Argentina, Canada, Chile, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Singapore, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Trinidad and Tobago, and the UK - are now meeting as the International Grand Committee. Their goal is to examine the impact of social media - and particularly Facebook - on democracy.</p><p>Facebook is now the primary medium for political advertising and targeting. The firm has rolled out stricter rules and recently took down a UK Conservative Party ad for breaching them. But there are now demands to regulate social media advertising by political parties through statutory regulation, rather than relying on Facebook's internal rules. In fact, Zuckerberg himself has called for legislation in this area.</p><p>New rules introduced this year in Australia and Canada. Meanwhile, the UK government has yet to implement proposals from its Cabinet Office.</p><p>Many countries - including Australia, India and Singapore - have developed new measures to take down criminal or terrorist content or disinformation from social networks. Other governments are also looking at the issue. This is a tricky area for regulation because questions remain around exactly how to define offending material and what processes can be put in place that respect human rights.</p><p>Many commentators argue that Facebook needs to do far more in this area, but it's not in the firm's financial interest to do so. Facebook is effectively being subsidised for the costs of its own failures by users, media organisations and others who flag up problem materials.</p><p>Instead, goes the argument, Facebook, the polluter, should pay to address the online pollution that it's creating. As a result, a number of countries are discussing levies and enhanced taxes, not least because of Facebook's accounting structure that enables it to pay as little as 1% of its revenue in tax.</p><p>The bigger problem is the one that anti-trust investigations are looking at. This is the fact that, along with Google, Facebook soaks up the bulk of online and particularly mobile advertising. If you want to advertise online, you are effectively obliged to use its services.</p><p>The German Cartel Authority, the Bundeskartellamt, has called Facebook's combination of user data drawn from a variety of data sources \"an exploitative abuse\" of its dominant position.</p><p>The difficulty is in challenging that position given the global nature of the internet and the way most successful internet firms tend to inevitably attract a majority of users. One solution would be to force Facebook to sell its other social network apps - WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger - so it wouldn't have so many sources of data on users.</p><p>But, as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has highlighted, another significant problem is the fact that its business is vertically integrated. This means it controls different parts of the advertising industry.</p><p>It's effectively a social media network, a media distribution company, a media-buying company, an advertising exchange and a data analytics company. For this reason, some argue that structural separation of Facebook's internal functions might be a more powerful solution.</p><p>One thing is clear: fixing Facebook will take co-ordinated international regulation. At the core of this discussion, of course, is corporate power in the age of surveillance capitalism.</p><p>Facebook's repeated failures mean that legislative and regulatory action has reportedly now even turned to the question of criminal investigation.</p><p>We're some way from effective action, but it looks increasingly like governments, legislators and regulators will not accept the status quo. Where Facebook has users, governments will regulate. | The Conversation</p><p>Andrews is a Professor of Public Service Leadership at the Cardiff University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DNWSSA-113735668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DNWSSA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X62-D371-F091-R2CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312416</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1004\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily News (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 03, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The reason? Congress's anti-trust sub-committee has starteddemanding documentsfrom Facebook and other big tech firms. It's part of the committee's investigation into whether dominant tech firms are acting anti-competitively. </p><p>And Zuckerberg's trip suggests the company is worried.The increasing pressure coming from the US Congress is just one example of how governments all over the world are starting to fight back against the power of Facebook. The company is facing fines, regulation and even calls for it to be broken up. But regulators and politicians still face a significant challenge in reining in Facebook's financial, political and social might.In summer 2019, Facebook was hit by aUS$5 billion finefrom the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as aUS$100m finefrom the Securities and Exchanges Commission over its involvement in theCambridge Analyticadata scandal. The company also possiblyfaces finesof further billions in Europe for violating data protection laws.But Facebook made US$16.6 billion from advertising in the three months to June 30, 2019 alone. So even such huge fines don't necessarily amount to much of a punishment. However these penalties are only one check on Facebook's power, and governments are increasingly willing to take action.Alongside Congress's review, theFTC , theDepartment of Justiceand anumber of state attorneysare investigating big tech firms including Facebook for possible anti-trust violations. The UKCompetition and Markets Authorityis also carrying out a market study into online platforms and the digital advertising industry. In Germany, Facebookis fightingan anti-trust action in the courts. Andreports suggestEU anti-trust regulators are interested in scrutinising the company's recently launchedcryptocurrency Libra .More generally, the EU has taken anti-trust action against several other big tech firms. Its recently re-appointed competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager,saidthat data use by tech companies may need further regulation.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.menafn.com/updates/pr/2019-09/30/TC_cc6e15a7-5_Image_In_Body.jpg\"/>Facebook is facing increasing calls for it to be broken up.<br/>M-SUR/Shutterstock<br/>It's not just Facebook's economic monopoly that politicians are worried about, however. Parliamentarians from a growing number of jurisdictions including Argentina, Canada, Chile, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Singapore, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Trinidad and Tobago, and the UK are now regularly meeting as theInternational Grand Committee . Their goal is to examine the impact of social media, and particularly Facebook, on democracy.Facebook is now the primary medium for political advertising and targeting. The firm has rolled outstricter rulesandrecently took downa UK Conservative Party ad for breaching them. But there are now demands in anumber of countriesto regulate social media advertising by political parties through statutory regulation, rather than relying on Facebook's internal rules. In fact, Zuckerberg himselfhas calledfor legislation in this area.New rules have been introduced this yearin AustraliaandCanada . Meanwhile the UK government has yet to implement proposals fromits Cabinet Office . Many countriesincluding Australia, India and Singapore have developed new measures to take down criminal or terrorist content or disinformation from social networks. And other governments arelooking at the issue . This is a tricky area for regulation because questions remain around exactly how to define offending material and what processes can be put in place that respect human rights. Manycommentators arguethat Facebook needs to do far more in this area but it is not in the firm's financial interest to do so. Facebook is effectively being subsidised for the costs of its own failures by users, media organisations and others who flag up problem materials. Instead, goes the argument, Facebook the polluter should pay to address the online pollution that it is creating. As a result anumber of countriesare discussing levies and enhanced taxes, not least because of Facebook's accounting structure that enables it to pay as little as1% of its revenuein tax.<br/>'Exploitative abuse'The bigger problem is the one that anti-trust investigations are looking at. This is the fact that, along with Google, Facebooksoaks up the bulkof online and particularly mobile advertising. If you want to advertise online, you are effectively obliged to use its services. The German Cartel Authority, the Bundeskartellamt, has called Facebook's combination of user data drawn from a variety of data sources, ' an exploitative abuse ' of its dominant position.The difficulty is in challenging that position given the global nature of the internet and the way the most successful internet firms tend to inevitablyattract a majorityof users. One solution would be to force Facebook to sell its other social network apps, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger so it didn't have so many sources of data on users.But, as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commissionhas highlighted , another significant problem is the fact its business is vertically integrated. This means it controls different parts of the advertising industry. It is effectively a social media network, a media distribution company, a media buying company, an advertising exchange and a data analytics company. For this reason,some arguethat structural separation of Facebook's internal functions might be a more powerful solution.One thing is clear, fixing Facebook will take coordinated international regulation. At the core of this discussion of course is corporate power in the age ofsurveillance capitalism . Facebook's repeated failures mean that legislative and regulatory action has reportedly now even turned to the question ofcriminal investigation . We're some way yet from effective action but it looks increasingly like governments, legislators and regulators will not accept the status quo. Where Facebook has users, governments will regulate.<br/><br/>&lt;ul&gt;<br/>Facebook<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/>Social media<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/>Regulation<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/>Fines<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/>Antitrust<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/>competition law<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/>Antitrust Law<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/>anti-trust<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/>Big tech<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/>Antitrust regulation<br/>&lt;/li&gt;<br/><br/><br/>MENAFN3009201901990000ID1099068505</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MENENG-1099068505</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MENENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS9-CD81-JCNX-338K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300954</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MENA English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38985\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 30, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The reason? Congress's anti-trust sub-committee has started demanding documents[4] from Facebook and other big tech firms. It's part of the committee's investigation into whether dominant tech firms are acting anti-competitively. </p><p>And Zuckerberg's trip suggests the company is worried. The increasing pressure coming from the US Congress is just one example of how governments all over the world are starting to fight back against the power of Facebook. The company is facing fines, regulation and even calls for it to be broken up. But regulators and politicians still face a significant challenge in reining in Facebook's financial, political and social might. In summer 2019, Facebook was hit by a US$5 billion fine[5] from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as a US$100m fine[6] from the Securities and Exchanges Commission over its involvement in the Cambridge Analytica[7] data scandal. The company also possibly faces fines[8] of further billions in Europe for violating data protection laws.   Facebook is facing increasing calls for it to be broken up.M-SUR/Shutterstock[9] But Facebook made US$16.6 billion from advertising in the three months to June 30, 2019 alone. So even such huge fines don't necessarily amount to much of a punishment. However these penalties are only one check on Facebook's power, and governments are increasingly willing to take action. Alongside Congress's review, the FTC[10], the Department of Justice[11] and a number of state attorneys[12] are investigating big tech firms including Facebook for possible anti-trust violations. The UK Competition and Markets Authority[13] is also carrying out a market study into online platforms and the digital advertising industry. In Germany, Facebook is fighting[14] an anti-trust action in the courts. And reports suggest[15] EU anti-trust regulators are interested in scrutinising the company's recently launched cryptocurrency Libra[16]. More generally, the EU has taken anti-trust action against several other big tech firms. Its recently re-appointed competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said[17] that data use by tech companies may need further regulation.  It's not just Facebook's economic monopoly that politicians are worried about, however. Parliamentarians from a growing number of jurisdictions including Argentina, Canada, Chile, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Singapore, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Trinidad and Tobago, and the UK are now regularly meeting as the International Grand Committee[18]. Their goal is to examine the impact of social media, and particularly Facebook, on democracy. Facebook is now the primary medium for political advertising and targeting. The firm has rolled out stricter rules[19] and recently took down[20] a UK Conservative Party ad for breaching them. But there are now demands in a number of countries[21] to regulate social media advertising by political parties through statutory regulation, rather than relying on Facebook's internal rules. In fact, Zuckerberg himself has called[22] for legislation in this area. New rules have been introduced this year in Australia[23] and Canada[24]. Meanwhile the UK government has yet to implement proposals from its Cabinet Office[25]. Many countries[26] including Australia, India and Singapore have developed new measures to take down criminal or terrorist content or disinformation from social networks. And other governments are looking at the issue[27]. This is a tricky area for regulation because questions remain around exactly how to define offending material and what processes can be put in place that respect human rights. Many commentators argue[28] that Facebook needs to do far more in this area but it is not in the firm's financial interest to do so. Facebook is effectively being subsidised for the costs of its own failures by users, media organisations and others who flag up problem materials. Instead, goes the argument, Facebook the polluter should pay to address the online pollution that it is creating. As a result a number of countries[29] are discussing levies and enhanced taxes, not least because of Facebook's accounting structure that enables it to pay as little as 1% of its revenue[30] in tax. 'Exploitative abuse' The bigger problem is the one that anti-trust investigations are looking at. This is the fact that, along with Google, Facebook soaks up the bulk[31] of online and particularly mobile advertising. If you want to advertise online, you are effectively obliged to use its services. The German Cartel Authority, the Bundeskartellamt, has called Facebook's combination of user data drawn from a variety of data sources, 'an exploitative abuse[32]' of its dominant position. The difficulty is in challenging that position given the global nature of the internet and the way the most successful internet firms tend to inevitably attract a majority[33] of users. One solution would be to force Facebook to sell its other social network apps, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger so it didn't have so many sources of data on users. But, as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has highlighted[34], another significant problem is the fact its business is vertically integrated. This means it controls different parts of the advertising industry. It is effectively a social media network, a media distribution company, a media buying company, an advertising exchange and a data analytics company. For this reason, some argue[35] that structural separation of Facebook's internal functions might be a more powerful solution. One thing is clear, fixing Facebook will take coordinated international regulation. At the core of this discussion of course is corporate power in the age of surveillance capitalism[36]. Facebook's repeated failures mean that legislative and regulatory action has reportedly now even turned to the question of criminal investigation[37]. We're some way yet from effective action but it looks increasingly like governments, legislators and regulators will not accept the status quo. Where Facebook has users, governments will regulate.

The reason? Congress's anti-trust sub-committee has started       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-congress/apple-facebook-amazon-google-emails-demanded-in-u-s-house-panel-probe-idUSKCN1VY1FX\">demanding documents</url> from Facebook and other big tech firms. It's part of the committee's investigation into whether dominant tech firms are acting anti-competitively. And Zuckerberg's trip suggests the company is worried.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The increasing pressure coming from the US Congress is just one example of how governments all over the world are starting to fight back against the power of Facebook. The company is facing fines, regulation and even calls for it to be broken up. But regulators and politicians still face a significant challenge in reining in Facebook's financial, political and social might.</p><p>In summer 2019, Facebook was hit by a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/24/facebook-to-pay-5bn-fine-as-regulator-files-cambridge-analytica-complaint\">US$5 billion fine</url> from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-24/facebook-agrees-to-pay-100-million-to-settle-charges-with-sec\">US$100m fine</url> from the Securities and Exchanges Commission over its involvement in the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/cambridge-analytica-51337\">Cambridge Analytica</url> data scandal. The company also possibly       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-nears-decisions-in-facebook-privacy-cases-11565602202\">faces fines</url> of further billions in Europe for violating data protection laws.</p><p>But Facebook made US$16.6 billion from advertising in the three months to June 30, 2019 alone. So even such huge fines don't necessarily amount to much of a punishment. However these penalties are only one check on Facebook's power, and governments are increasingly willing to take action.</p><p>Alongside Congress's review, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/11/tech/ftc-big-tech-antitrust-investigations/index.html\">FTC</url>, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/tech-companies-antitrust-review\">Department of Justice</url> and a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/06/facebook-google-antitrust-privacy-investigations-us\">number of state attorneys</url> are investigating big tech firms including Facebook for possible anti-trust violations. The UK       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study\">Competition and Markets Authority</url> is also carrying out a market study into online platforms and the digital advertising industry. In Germany, Facebook       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-germany/german-cartel-office-to-take-facebook-case-to-high-court-idUSKCN1VG1AJ\">is fighting</url> an anti-trust action in the courts. And       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-eu-facebook-antitrust/eu-antitrust-regulators-raise-concerns-about-facebooks-libra-currency-sources-idUKKCN1VB1BQ\">reports suggest</url> EU anti-trust regulators are interested in scrutinising the company's recently launched       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/libra-72410\">cryptocurrency Libra</url>.</p><p>More generally, the EU has taken anti-trust action against several other big tech firms. Its recently re-appointed competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, <url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-antitrust-data/eu-may-need-to-regulate-tech-giants-data-use-eu-antitrust-chief-idUKKCN1VY1HU\">said</url> that data use by tech companies may need further regulation.</p><p>It's not just Facebook's economic monopoly that politicians are worried about, however. Parliamentarians from a growing number of jurisdictions including Argentina, Canada, Chile, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Singapore, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Trinidad and Tobago, and the UK are now regularly meeting as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/international-grand-committee-evidence-17-19/\">International Grand Committee</url>. Their goal is to examine the impact of social media, and particularly Facebook, on democracy.</p><p>Facebook is now the primary medium for political advertising and targeting. The firm has rolled out <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/28/tech/facebook-political-ads-2020/index.html\">stricter rules</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49701027\">recently took down</url> a UK Conservative Party ad for breaching them. But there are now demands in a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/how-does-political-advertising-blackout-laws-work/1111560\">number of countries</url> to regulate social media advertising by political parties through statutory regulation, rather than relying on Facebook's internal rules. In fact, Zuckerberg himself       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/4/posts/10107013839885441?sfns=m\">has called</url> for legislation in this area.</p><p>New rules have been introduced this year <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2019/April/Authorising_online_political_communicatio\">in Australia</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;dir=regifaq&amp;document=index&amp;lang=\">Canada</url>. Meanwhile the UK government has yet to implement proposals from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-safeguards-uk-elections\">its Cabinet Office</url>.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparison\">Many countries</url> including Australia, India and Singapore have developed new measures to take down criminal or terrorist content or disinformation from social networks. And other governments are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper\">looking at the issue</url>. This is a tricky area for regulation because questions remain around exactly how to define offending material and what processes can be put in place that respect human rights. </p><p>Many <url normalizedValue=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/understanding-facebooks-failure-to-deal-with-hate-speech\">commentators argue</url> that Facebook needs to do far more in this area but it is not in the firm's financial interest to do so. Facebook is effectively being subsidised for the costs of its own failures by users, media organisations and others who flag up problem materials. </p><p>Instead, goes the argument, Facebook the polluter should pay to address the online pollution that it is creating. As a result a <url normalizedValue=\"https://taxfoundation.org/digital-taxes-europe-2019\">number of countries</url> are discussing levies and enhanced taxes, not least because of Facebook's accounting structure that enables it to pay as little as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/08/facebook-uk-tax-bill-sales-margaret-hodge\">1% of its revenue</url> in tax.</p><h>\"Exploitative abuse\"</h><p>The bigger problem is the one that anti-trust investigations are looking at. This is the fact that, along with Google, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://marketingland.com/almost-70-of-digital-ad-spending-going-to-google-facebook-amazon-says-analyst-firm-26256\">soaks up the bulk</url> of online and particularly mobile advertising. If you want to advertise online, you are effectively obliged to use its services. The German Cartel Authority, the Bundeskartellamt, has called Facebook's combination of user data drawn from a variety of data sources, \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2019/07_02_2019_Facebook.html\">an exploitative abuse</url>\" of its dominant position.</p><p>The difficulty is in challenging that position given the global nature of the internet and the way the most successful internet firms tend to inevitably <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.london.edu/lbsr/nine-reasons-why-tech-markets-are-winner-take-all\">attract a majority</url> of users. One solution would be to force Facebook to sell its other social network apps, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger so it didn't have so many sources of data on users.</p><p>But, as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%2520platforms%2520inquiry%2520-%2520final%2520report.pdf\">has highlighted</url>, another significant problem is the fact its business is vertically integrated. This means it controls different parts of the advertising industry. It is effectively a social media network, a media distribution company, a media buying company, an advertising exchange and a data analytics company. For this reason,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2018/05/02/how-to-break-up-facebook/\">some argue</url> that structural separation of Facebook's internal functions might be a more powerful solution.</p><p>One thing is clear, fixing Facebook will take coordinated international regulation. At the core of this discussion of course is corporate power in the age of <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/deletefacebook-is-still-feeding-the-beast-but-there-are-ways-to-overcome-surveillance-capitalism-93874\">surveillance capitalism</url>. Facebook's repeated failures mean that legislative and regulatory action has reportedly now even turned to the question of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/13/facebook-data-sharing-investigation\">criminal investigation</url>. We're some way yet from effective action but it looks increasingly like governments, legislators and regulators will not accept the status quo. Where Facebook has users, governments will regulate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leighton Andrews does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUK-124120</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5H-8YD1-JB75-9011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1079\"/><timeReceived>12:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United Kingdom</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7117\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 30, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The reason? Congress's anti-trust sub-committee has started demanding documents from Facebook and other big tech firms. It's part of the committee's investigation into whether dominant tech firms are acting anti-competitively. And Zuckerberg's trip suggests the company is worried.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The increasing pressure coming from the US Congress is just one example of how governments all over the world are starting to fight back against the power of Facebook. The company is facing fines, regulation and even calls for it to be broken up. But regulators and politicians still face a significant challenge in reining in Facebook's financial, political and social might.</p><p>In summer 2019, Facebook was hit by a US$5 billion fine from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as a US$100m fine from the Securities and Exchanges Commission over its involvement in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The company also possibly faces fines of further billions in Europe for violating data protection laws.</p><p>But Facebook made US$16.6 billion from advertising in the three months to June 30, 2019 alone. So even such huge fines don't necessarily amount to much of a punishment. However these penalties are only one check on Facebook's power, and governments are increasingly willing to take action.</p><p>Alongside Congress's review, the FTC, the Department of Justice and a number of state attorneys are investigating big tech firms including Facebook for possible anti-trust violations. The UK Competition and Markets Authority is also carrying out a market study into online platforms and the digital advertising industry. In Germany, Facebook is fighting an anti-trust action in the courts. And reports suggest EU anti-trust regulators are interested in scrutinising the company's recently launched cryptocurrency Libra.</p><p>More generally, the EU has taken anti-trust action against several other big tech firms. Its recently re-appointed competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said that data use by tech companies may need further regulation.</p><p>It's not just Facebook's economic monopoly that politicians are worried about, however. Parliamentarians from a growing number of jurisdictions including Argentina, Canada, Chile, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Singapore, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Trinidad and Tobago, and the UK are now regularly meeting as the International Grand Committee. Their goal is to examine the impact of social media, and particularly Facebook, on democracy.</p><p>Facebook is now the primary medium for political advertising and targeting. The firm has rolled out stricter rules and recently took down a UK Conservative Party ad for breaching them. But there are now demands in a number of countries to regulate social media advertising by political parties through statutory regulation, rather than relying on Facebook's internal rules. In fact, Zuckerberg himself has called for legislation in this area.</p><p>New rules have been introduced this year in Australia and Canada. Meanwhile the UK government has yet to implement proposals from its Cabinet Office.</p><p>Many countries including Australia, India and Singapore have developed new measures to take down criminal or terrorist content or disinformation from social networks. And other governments are looking at the issue. This is a tricky area for regulation because questions remain around exactly how to define offending material and what processes can be put in place that respect human rights.</p><p>Many commentators argue that Facebook needs to do far more in this area but it is not in the firm's financial interest to do so. Facebook is effectively being subsidised for the costs of its own failures by users, media organisations and others who flag up problem materials.</p><p>Instead, goes the argument, Facebook the polluter should pay to address the online pollution that it is creating. As a result a number of countries are discussing levies and enhanced taxes, not least because of Facebook's accounting structure that enables it to pay as little as 1% of its revenue in tax.</p><p>'Exploitative abuse'</p><p>The bigger problem is the one that anti-trust investigations are looking at. This is the fact that, along with Google, Facebook soaks up the bulk of online and particularly mobile advertising. If you want to advertise online, you are effectively obliged to use its services. The German Cartel Authority, the Bundeskartellamt, has called Facebook's combination of user data drawn from a variety of data sources, 'an exploitative abuse' of its dominant position.</p><p>The difficulty is in challenging that position given the global nature of the internet and the way the most successful internet firms tend to inevitably attract a majority of users. One solution would be to force Facebook to sell its other social network apps, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger so it didn't have so many sources of data on users.</p><p>But, as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has highlighted, another significant problem is the fact its business is vertically integrated. This means it controls different parts of the advertising industry. It is effectively a social media network, a media distribution company, a media buying company, an advertising exchange and a data analytics company. For this reason, some argue that structural separation of Facebook's internal functions might be a more powerful solution.</p><p>One thing is clear, fixing Facebook will take coordinated international regulation. At the core of this discussion of course is corporate power in the age of surveillance capitalism. Facebook's repeated failures mean that legislative and regulatory action has reportedly now even turned to the question of criminal investigation. We're some way yet from effective action but it looks increasingly like governments, legislators and regulators will not accept the status quo. Where Facebook has users, governments will regulate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRENZA-PRESZA0210201900002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRENZA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X64-D7B1-JCH9-G0P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1005\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The reason? Congress's anti-trust subcommittee has started demanding documents from Facebook and other big tech firms. It's part of the committee's investigation into whether dominant tech firms are acting anti-competitively.Zuckerberg's trip suggests the company is worried.The increasing pressure coming from the US Congress is just one example of how governments all over the world are starting to fight back against the power of Facebook. </p><p>The company is facing fines, regulation and even calls for it to be broken up. But regulators and politicians still face a significant challenge in reining in Facebook's financial, political and social might.In summer 2019, Facebook was hit by a $5 billion fine from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as a $100m fine from the Securities and Exchanges Commission over its involvement in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The company also possibly faces fines of further billions in Europe for violating data protection laws.But Facebook made $16.6 billion from advertising in the three months to June 30, 2019 alone. So even such huge fines don't necessarily amount to much of a punishment. However these penalties are only one check on Facebook's power, and governments are increasingly willing to take action.Alongside Congress' review, the Federal Trade Commission , the Department of Justice and a number of state attorneys are investigating big tech firms including Facebook for possible anti-trust violations.The UK Competition and Markets Authority is also carrying out a market study into online platforms and the digital advertising industry. In Germany, Facebook is fighting an anti-trust action in the courts. And reports suggest that EU anti-trust regulators are interested in scrutinizing the company's recently launched cryptocurrency Libra .More generally, the EU has taken anti-trust action against several other big tech firms. Its recently re-appointed competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said that data use by tech companies may need further regulation.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2019-10/09/AT_cea6040b-8_Image_In_Body.jpg\"/>Facebook is facing increasing calls for it to be broken up. Photo: M-SUR/Shutterstock<br/>Concern on social media impact, political adsIt's not just Facebook's economic monopoly that politicians are worried about, however. Parliamentarians from a growing number of jurisdictions including Argentina, Canada, Chile, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Singapore, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Trinidad and Tobago, and the UK are now regularly meeting as the International Grand Committee . Their goal is to examine the impact of social media, and particularly Facebook, on democracy.Facebook is now the primary medium for political advertising and targeting. The firm has rolled out stricter rules and recently took down a UK Conservative Party ad for breaching them. But there are now demands in a number of countries to regulate social media advertising by political parties through statutory regulation, rather than relying on Facebook's internal rules. In fact, Zuckerberg himself has called for legislation in this area.New rules have been introduced this year in Australia and Canada . Meanwhile the UK government has yet to implement proposals from its Cabinet Office . Many countries including Australia, India and Singapore have developed new measures to take down criminal or terrorist content or disinformation from social networks. And other governments are looking at the issue . This is a tricky area for regulation because questions remain around exactly how to define offending material and what processes can be put in place that respect human rights.Many commentators argue that Facebook needs to do far more in this area but it is not in the firm's financial interest to do so. Facebook is effectively being subsidized for the costs of its own failures by users, media organisations and others who flag up problem materials.Instead, goes the argument, Facebook the polluter should pay to address the online pollution that it is creating. As a result a number of countries are discussing levies and enhanced taxes, not least because of Facebook's accounting structure that enables it to pay as little as 1% of its revenue in tax.<br/>\u2018Exploitative abuse' of dataThe bigger problem is the one that anti-trust investigations are looking at. This is the fact that, along with Google, Facebook soaks up the bulk of online and particularly mobile advertising. If you want to advertise online, you are effectively obliged to use its services. The German Cartel Authority, the Bundeskartellamt, has called Facebook's combination of user data drawn from a variety of data sources, ' an exploitative abuse ' of its dominant position.The difficulty is in challenging that position given the global nature of the internet and the way the most successful internet firms tend to inevitably attract a majority of users. One solution would be to force Facebook to sell its other social network apps, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger so it dosen't have so many sources of data on users.But, as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has highlighted , another significant problem is the fact its business is vertically integrated. This means it controls different parts of the advertising industry. It is effectively a social media network, a media distribution company, a media buying company, an advertising exchange and a data analytics company. For this reason, some argue that structural separation of Facebook's internal functions might be a more powerful solution.One thing is clear, fixing Facebook will take coordinated international regulation. At the core of this discussion of course is corporate power in the age of surveillance capitalism .Facebook's repeated failures mean that legislative and regulatory action has reportedly now even turned to the question of criminal investigation . We're some way yet from effective action but it looks increasingly like governments, legislators and regulators will not accept the status quo. Where Facebook has users, governments will regulate.\u00a0Leighton Andrews is a professor of Public Service Leadership at Cardiff University.

People across the country are starting to demand access to the parts and information necessary to at least try to figure things out on our own. It's been dubbed 'The Right to Repair' movement, and it's gaining steam: There are now right to repair initiatives on the midterm election ballots in 18 states[1]. These initiatives, if passed, would require manufacturers to provide buyers with diagnostic and repair documentation and make available for purchase the parts needed, including software updates.The ProblemHere are some of the ways manufacturers make it difficult or downright impossible for independent repair shops and DIYers to fix their products: Apple, the largest company in the world by market capitalization, introduced proprietary screws for their iPhones that they do not sell to repair shops, forcing independent shops to reverse engineer them if they want a shot at fixing the devices. They also refuse to provide full diagnostic manuals for their devices and use their lobbying might to crush legislation[2] that would compel them to do so. John Deere refuses to provide simple information that could allow people to repair their tractors, claiming that doing so would lead to rampant intellectual property theft. They even go as far as to say you can never really 'own' one of their tractors[3] because of all the proprietary software embedded in every machine. Nikon stopped selling replacement camera parts[4] to independent repair shops altogether in 2012, and many companies now restrict access to their repair manuals because of copyright concerns. The list of affronts to the would-be repairer goes on and on, and the message is clear: You should get repairs done by the original manufacturer, no matter how long it takes or how much money it costs, or you should buy a new product. The manufacturers claim that it's all for our own good. Tech industry lobbying groups claim that allowing regular folks to repair their devices is too dangerous and too fraught with the chance of intellectual property theft. They say that allowing any Joe Schmo to tinker with their device could destroy a company's competitive advantage, that allowing third-party repair puts the consumer at risk of a cyber attack[5], and that repairs can be highly dangerous. These hyped-up claims have always rankled consumers and repair shop owners, but lately things have come to a head. Farmers, the repair community, and sustainability advocates are especially fed up with the current state of affairs.Farmers Fight BackMuch like modern cars, modern tractors have complex onboard computers. So, when something goes wrong, the fix often requires looking into not just the nuts and bolts, but the the operating system of the onboard computer. But companies like John Deere are not releasing the information necessary to allow people to fix these issues. This causes massive delays while technicians are brought out to repair faulty sensors that are causing full-on computer shutdowns of otherwise perfectly functioning machines. Farmers feel like they're being hung out to dry, in part because it's lucrative for the manufacturers[6] to maintain their monopoly on repairs. John Deere's stance is that a large fraction of those trying to tinker with its onboard computers are likely to be unscrupulous 'pirates'[7]who will free ride off John Deere's ingenuity and steal its secrets. As if my farming friends in Wisconsin don't really want to fix their tractors. No, their actual goal, once they get the repair manual, is to don an eye patch, grow a beard, and sell valuable code on the dark web. The absurdity of it all has led to significant tension between farmers and equipment manufacturers and has galvanized millions of American farmers[8] to fight for the right to repair.Fixers Just Want a ChanceStudies show that most problems with our devices arise because of simple accidents[9], such as dropping the phone and cracking the screen. In theory, simple accidents should require simple fixes. With increasingly complex smartphones and restrictions on what diagnostic information is given to repair shops, that's no longer the case. Those working at repair shops say that removing the screens from modern smartphones is a maddening and tedious process[10], and that they 'cannot safely open a growing number of devices without specialized documentation, diagnostic software, and tools.' Plus, once you figure out one version of a phone, the next version might use a whole different set of materials. And that's just the screen. The difficulties multiply if you're trying to assess problems with the battery, the microchip, or the software. Because we pay good money for these devices, we feel we have the right to maintain them as we see fit. As the online repair site iFixit.org puts it[11], 'Would you buy a car if it was illegal to replace the tires? Would you buy a bike if you couldn't fix the chain?' The absurdity of those rhetorical questions highlights just silly it would be to make it illegal to fix our phones and tractors. Until we see how all the legislation plays out, fixers are encouraging people to purchase items based on how easy they are to repair[12].A Right to Reduce WasteElectronic waste is toxic[13], and the amount of it in the world is increasing. Outdated or difficult-to-repair items are swelling landfills with 49 million tons of e-waste per year[14], an issue the World Health Organization sees as a massive problem[15]. A big reason for all the waste is that consumers simply find it easier to chuck their old devices than to take the effort to fix them. Regulatory bodies are supposed to reduce the problem by encouraging sustainable practices by manufacturers. Companies are required to meet certain standards when it comes to repairability, battery removal, and device longevity. But in practice, tech company representativesdominate the boards of such institutions[16] and routinelyoppose efforts to broaden reuse and repair[17]. Right to repair advocates recognize the e-waste problem and believe that forcing tech companies to release diagnostic information will ease the problem. As a comprehensive report[18] on green technology standards by repair.org puts it, 'We need strong green electronics standards that encourage long-lasting products; the future of our planet depends on it.'Summing UpI'm happy that companies have made powerful and light devices. That said, I want the option to continue fixing my own computer[19] and phone. And if I can't do it myself, I love having access to a repair community[20] or a local repair shop that can help me out. To me, outlawing those things would be like outlawing baseball: Simply un-American. It's encouraging that there is a precedent for these kinds of right to repair movements. Massachusetts voters were able to pass a right to repair act[21] centered on automobile repair in 2012 that compelled automobile manufacturers to provide vehicle owners and independent mechanics with the diagnostic and safety information needed to repair their cars. I hope that we can find a way to have both amazing technology and the right to repair it ourselves, and I'm optimistic we'll eventually figure out a solution.

They're at war with the Feds. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Silicon Valley had better hope they win.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Michael Lacey's younger and more vulnerable years, his father gave him this advice: \"Whenever someone pokes a finger in your chest, you grab that finger and you break it off at the knuckle.\" Lacey grew up in the 1950s as a bright, bookish boy. His father, a sailor turned enforcer for a New York construction union, had little use for his son's intellectual gifts. If Lacey lost a fight at school, he says, his dad \"came home and beat me again.\" But the boy toughened up, and he carried the lessons he'd learned into adulthood. He became a newspaper editor and earned a reputation as a down-and-dirty First Amendment brawler. Early on in his career, he struck up a partnership with James Larkin, a publisher whose sensibilities matched his own. Together, they built the nation's largest chain of alternative newsweeklies.</p><p>Lacey and Larkin were heroes to many-micks from the sticks who made a fortune thumbing their shanty-Irish snouts at authority. Their papers went after mayors and police chiefs, governors and senators, Walmart and the Church of Scientology. They provoked outrage with their business practices too, by setting up Backpage.com, a kind of red-light district for the internet. As attorney Don Moon, the pair's longtime adviser, puts it: \"Their brand was always 'Fuck you. We don't have friends. We have lawyers.' \" That approach served them well for 45 years, right up until the morning Michael Lacey found himself staring into the barrel of a Glock.</p><p>A few minutes before 9 am on April 6, 2018, a fleet of unmarked vehicles with government plates rolled up in front of Lacey's multimillion-dollar compound in Paradise Valley, a few miles outside of Phoenix. These weren't the guests he'd been expecting. The 69-year-old divorced father of two had recently gotten remarried, and he was preparing to host a lavish party to celebrate his vows. Tents were pitched on his lawn; retired journalists and overworked lawyers were winging their way into town. FBI agents informed the groom that he was being arrested on charges of money laundering and facilitating prostitution. They cuffed him, then subdued the home's other occupants, including Lacey's 76-year-old mother-in-law, whom they ordered out of the shower at gunpoint.</p><p>For the next six hours, the lawmen tossed the compound looking for, among other things, \"evidence of wealth.\" They seized art, cash, computers, even the bride's wedding ring. Meanwhile, at the Phoenix airport, federal marshals awaited a 747 inbound from London. When it touched down, the flight crew made an announcement: Police would be boarding, so passengers must stay put. \"I wondered who they were there for,\" recalls Larkin, then 68, who was seated beside his son in business class. \"I quickly figured out it was me.\" (The Department of Justice declined to comment on the arrests.)</p><p>Partygoers soon received a cryptic text message. Owing to \"unforeseen circumstances,\" it said, the wedding celebration had been \"postponed.\" A notice went up on Backpage, explaining that the website had been seized \"as part of an enforcement action.\" More than a few guests completed the journey to Phoenix anyway; reporters can't resist a story, and Lacey had already paid for a block of rooms at the Hotel Camby. They gathered at various local watering holes, offering what one attendee describes as \"toasts to the accused,\" and pieced together a gripping narrative-a tale of free-speech crusaders crossed over to the dark side, dedicated news hounds become digital pimps.</p><p>Backpage, the domain that brought the federal government down on Lacey and Larkin's heads, wasn't much to look at-a bare-bones interface wrapped in Facebooky blue, similar to Craigslist in both form and function. Its name alluded to the old days of print publishing, when classified ads, especially ads for topless bars, escort services, and other sexually oriented businesses filled the final pages of alt -weeklies and provided much of their revenue. Visitors to the site were greeted with several columns of links, which directed them to listings for various metropolitan areas around the country. From there, they could reply to ads or write their own.</p><p>Many of the ads-for auto parts, part-time gigs, vacation rentals, and so on-were free to publish. But the lewd stuff, listed under the adult section, cost money. For as little as $2 a day, users could post in such categories as \"body rubs\" and \"dom &amp; fetish.\" The site's terms of use prohibited any content that could be considered \"unlawful,\" \"harmful,\" or \"obscene.\" To gain access to the adult section, all users had to do was click a link confirming they were 18 or older. Once inside, they saw an endless scroll of titles, some laden with innuendo (\"Cum lay your hotdog on my bun for memorial day\"), others more explicit (\"Three holes anything goes $90\").</p><p>As in the print days, these adult ads reigned supreme. In 2011 they accounted for 15 percent of Backpage's listings but generated more than 90 percent of its revenue. By the time the Feds pulled the plug on the site, it was operating in 97 countries and was valued at more than half a billion dollars. People called it the Google of commercial sex ads, a platform that dominated its market as thoroughly as Facebook dominated social networking or Amazon did online retail.</p><p>The government indictment that triggered Lacey and Larkin's arrests, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">United States v. Lacey, et al.</emphasis>, includes 17 \"victim summaries\"-stories of women who say they were sexually exploited through Backpage. Victim 5 first appeared in an ad on the platform when she was 14; her \"customers\" made her \"perform sexual acts at gunpoint, choked her to the point of having seizures, and gang-raped her.\" Victim 6 was stabbed to death. Victim 8's uncle and his friends advertised her as \"fetish friendly.\" The indictment accuses Backpage of catering to sexual predators, of essentially helping pimps better reach their target audiences.</p><p>In the years before their arrest, Lacey and Larkin had successfully beat back charges like these in court. They took refuge not only in the First Amendment but also in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Congress' great gift to the internet. Passed in 1996, Section 230 largely immunized online platforms from liability for the user- generated content they hosted. They were free to police offending material as they saw fit, without undue fear of prosecution by state or local authorities-as long as they didn't create it themselves. America's tech behemoths, from Twitter to Facebook, have often invoked Section 230 in court. The internet we have today wouldn't exist without it. After all, you can't build or sustain a giant network if you're getting sued every time a user says or does something objectionable.</p><p>For a while, Lacey and Larkin's strategy had worked: They'd won case after case, with the support of Big Tech and civil libertarians alike. But by the time the Feds descended on Paradise Valley that morning in the spring of 2018, the tide had turned. Many of their friends and allies had fled, spooked in part by too much bad press. The tech industry, which faced withering scrutiny over its role in the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, had thrown them under the bus. Their top lieutenant had flipped. And Congress had used them as an excuse to finally accomplish what it had been trying to do for more than 20 years-tear a hole in Section 230.</p><p>Maybe they should have seen it coming: The betrayals. The asset seizures. The changing zeitgeist. They were, to be sure, brazenly cashing in on the sex trade. But here's the thing: Silicon Valley had better hope they win. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">United States v. Lacey</emphasis> is a dangerous case, with potential consequences far beyond the freedom of two aging antiauthoritarians.</p><p>It's a mid-November afternoon in 2018, and Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin are seated on either side of the 20-foot-long glass table that dominates Lacey's living room. They're clad in jeans, polos, and ankle monitors. A black charging cord snakes from a wall outlet to Lacey's left foot, which emits an occasional beep.</p><p>Both men are out on million-dollar bonds, secured by real estate the government eventually hopes to own. The bulk of the charges against them fall under the Travel Act, a law designed by Robert F. Kennedy's Justice Department to target organized crime. According to the indictment, Lacey, Larkin, and their underlings not only turned a blind eye to prostitution and child sexual abuse but, driven by greed, actively worked to abet it. Their case is set for January 2020. \"El Chapo got to trial quicker,\" Lacey quips.</p><p>I've worked for both sides in this showdown. In the late 1990s, I was a staff writer for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dallas Observer</emphasis>, a weekly owned by Lacey and Larkin. Then, in 2001, I went to work for the Department of Justice as an assistant US attorney in Plano, Texas.</p><p>The two men have lived large, and it shows. Larkin is a burly former football player, 6   2   and easily 250 pounds, with cornflower eyes, chubby cheeks, and a ruddy complexion. Lacey's mug reveals decades of sun and single-malt Scotch-the hooded lids, the sagging chin, the lines running like canyons down his face and into his neck. His spiky hair has thinned and grayed, but he still has the prominent schnoz, the ice-blue eyes, and the knuckles famously tattooed with HOLD FAST. (His father, who served in the Navy during World War II, had the same slogan inked across his fists.)</p><p>Their situation looks bleak. The government has seized all of Lacey's financial accounts and most or all of Larkin's. Prosecutors have already produced more than 10 million documents and have promised, or threatened, more to come. It will cost the defendants several million dollars just to buy the software they need to search the government's files. For the time being, though, they're still drinking well. When I arrive, Larkin has uncorked a bottle of Jack Quinn, a cabernet produced at his 3-acre vineyard in Napa. (Although Larkin has owned the place since before Backpage existed, the government has given notice that it intends to seize the vineyard, alleging that he used Backpage-derived funds for its maintenance.) Lacey, meanwhile, is still knocking back Macallan 21-although nowadays he stops to ask the price. At the Blue Hound bar in Phoenix, where we repaired for a later interview, it's $120 per shot.</p><p>Lacey got his start in journalism in 1970, in the wake of the Kent State shootings, when he and a group of antiwar comrades at Arizona State University founded what would become the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Phoenix New Times</emphasis>. In the beginning, he claims, he sold his blood to pay the bills. He met Larkin two years later-not long after Lacey's father, the union enforcer, and his mother, an opera singer and registered nurse, were found frozen to death in a rented trailer in Oswego, New York. (\"It was a murder- suicide,\" Lacey says. \"They were drunk, and she turned on the gas.\")</p><p>The men connected immediately. Both were college dropouts, and both had suffered through difficult childhoods. Larkin's mother died when he was 2, and he spent most of his youth in what he describes as a \"Catholic ghetto.\" In high school, he cofounded a student newspaper, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Big Press,</emphasis> then promptly got himself suspended for criticizing administrators. \"I wanted to be in that business,\" he says. Lacey brought him on as publisher.</p><p>In 1977, Lacey and Larkin staged a putsch. They wrested control of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New Times</emphasis> from Lacey's cofounders and set about turning the fledgling broadsheet into an empire. Larkin worked out a lucrative revenue model, emphasizing classifieds and personals. (While a page of big retail ads might net $1,000, a page of classifieds, 100 ads at $25 a pop, could bring in $2,500.) Six years later, they began to expand. They bought up struggling weeklies in cities across the country-Denver, Houston, Miami-and transformed them into serious news organizations, hiring experienced, high-profile reporters and giving them resources to do the job.</p><p>They believed there was an audience for in-depth, long-form investigative reporting. A month after 9/11, for instance, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New Times Broward-Palm Beach</emphasis> published an expos\u00e9 on how lapses in federal immigration policy had allowed the hijackers to enter the country. In 2003, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Westword</emphasis> got the scoop on a sexual assault scandal at the US Air Force Academy. In 2013, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Miami New Times</emphasis> ran a story on the steroid scandal in Major League Baseball, which ultimately resulted in the suspension of 14 players. Lacey once told an interviewer, \"As a journalist, if you don't get up in the morning and say 'Fuck you' to someone, why even do it?\"</p><p>\"I didn't get into this racket to be told what to publish,\" Lacey growls.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"By anybody.\"</emphasis></p><p>They tangled with shareholders, authorities, competitors, printers, and municipalities that tried to restrict their distribution. Lacey, who wrote numerous stories himself, was known to clock reporters and pummel press aides, usually when spirits were involved. (He estimates that he's been arrested \"10 or 11 times,\" but \"only three for writing.\" The one criminal conviction on his record is for a misdemeanor DUI.) When violence didn't settle things, Lacey and Larkin often moved matters to the courtroom. Litigation was their idea of fun, the continuation of hell-raising by other means. \"I didn't get into this racket to be told what to publish,\" Lacey growls. \"By <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">anybody</emphasis>. If you don't like it, don't read it.\"</p><p>Steve Suskin, their former in-house counsel, says they and their companies were sued 56 times between 1997 and 2012 alone. \"We won them all,\" Suskin recalls. They were successful in part because they recognized that litigation is a war of attrition, and they were willing to go the distance. Says Lacey: \"You want to sue us, bring your lunch pail, 'cause we gonna be awhile.\" In their most famous legal set-to, they successfully sued Joe Arpaio, Maricopa County's notoriously anti- immigrant sheriff, for false arrest, winning a $3.75 million settlement. In a final flip of the bird to Arpaio, they used the money to set up a nonprofit to defend the rights of undocumented immigrants and Latinx Americans.</p><p>Through it all, Larkin kept the money coming in, embracing each new fad in classified advertising. In 1989, for example, the New Times group launched its first adult section, appropriately dubbed Wildside. (The ads were moderated by sales staff to ensure no blatant sex-for-money propositions made it into print.) Racy ads fueled the company's explosive growth; by 2001, Lacey and Larkin owned 11 papers, which raked in more than $100 million a year. But the good times didn't last. Craigslist had begun expanding into cities outside the Bay Area, offering free ads in all categories except jobs and erotic services. Classified revenue tanked.</p><p>In 2003, Larkin was approached by Carl Ferrer, an ad salesman he'd hired away from a small paper in Louisiana and installed as classified ad director at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dallas Observer</emphasis>. Ferrer, a short, slight man with a goatee and a perpetually worried look, proposed that they create an in-house version of Craigslist. Larkin put him in charge of building and running the website, which launched in 2004.</p><p>The following year, Lacey and Larkin won the prize they'd chased for years-<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Village Voice</emphasis>, the grande dame of alt- weeklies. When the New Times group merged with Village Voice Media, the two companies formed a 17-paper megachain valued at about $400 million, with an estimated $180 million in annual revenue.</p><p>Lacey and Larkin's timing could not have been worse. Between 2006 and 2012, according to the Pew Research Center, American news papers lost half their advertising revenue. Backpage, however, grew steadily, even if it wasn't nearly enough to offset the papers' declining receipts.</p><p>Lacey and Larkin say they were advised by counsel that what Backpage was doing was 100 percent legal. They saw no distinction between advertising and editorial; it was all protected speech, all mission-critical. In 2008, they were honored by the Arizona chapter of the ACLU as Civil Libertarians of the Year. In his acceptance speech, Lacey decried \"the gentrified instincts of soccer moms,\" which led demagogues like Joe Arpaio to crack down on press freedom. He vowed that both he and Larkin would continue to oppose the \"forces of offended decency\" wherever they found them.</p><p>\"You want to sue us, bring your lunch pail, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'cause we gonna be awhile.\"</emphasis></p><p>Today, they remain defiant. \"I didn't <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">do</emphasis> anything wrong,\" Lacey declares. \"I didn't <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">do</emphasis> what they say. And if they think they're gonna punk me, they got the wrong fucking guy.\"</p><p>One of the great ironies of internet history is that the Communications Decency Act-a law conceived, as its name suggests, to rid the web of vice-actually ended up doing the opposite. It was proposed in 1995 by Senator J. James Exon, a Nebraska Democrat who'd watched with increasing alarm as \"the worst, most vile, most perverse pornography\" spread online. He was particularly concerned about what all this obscenity might do to the minds of America's children, and went so far as to compile a \"blue book\" packed with X-rated screenshots. \"This is a sample of what is available today free of charge,\" he told his colleagues on the Senate floor when the CDA came up for debate. \"Click, click, click on the computer, on the information superhighway.\"</p><p>Although Exon repeatedly described the legislation as \"narrow\" and \"streamlined,\" the Department of Justice warned that its indecency provisions were unconstitutionally broad. Within a year and a half of the CDA's passage, the Supreme Court agreed and struck those provisions down. Section 230, however, survived, offering a safe harbor to some of the same sites that Exon had hoped to bring down. The information superhighway began to look more perilous than ever.</p><p>In 2001 two academics at the University of Pennsylvania published a widely cited study in which they estimated that some 326,000 children were \"at risk of commercial sexual exploitation.\" Although the authors didn't formally address what role the internet played, they asserted that \"online sexual victimization of American children appears to have reached epidemic proportions.\" By 2008, a new coalition of would-be regulators had emerged, led by the National Association of Attorneys General and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit partly funded by the US government. Together, both behind the scenes and in the press, the two groups began pushing some of the internet's major players to strengthen their safety protocols.</p><p>In response, Myspace, the web's largest social media platform at the time, gave the boot to some 90,000 convicted sex offenders. Facebook, meanwhile, took steps to prevent underage users from sharing personal information with strangers. Craigslist started requiring that anyone who posted an ad in its Erotic Services section provide a verified phone number and pay a fee by credit card. It also hired attorneys to moderate ads.</p><p>For some officials, though, these changes weren't enough. In early 2009, Thomas Dart, the sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, sued Craigslist for facilitating prostitution. \"Missing children, runaways, abused women, and women trafficked in from foreign countries are routinely forced to have sex with strangers because they're being pimped on Craigslist,\" he said. \"I could make arrests off Craigslist 24 hours a day, but to what end? I'm trying to go up the ladder.\" That same spring, tabloids across the country were awash in headlines about the \"Craigslist killer,\" a young man in Boston who'd responded to a massage ad on the site, then murdered the woman who posted it.</p><p>A federal judge in Chicago quickly tossed Dart's case, citing Section 230. But Craigslist eventually surrendered anyway. On the night of September 3, 2010, it quietly covered its Adult Services section with the word <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">censored</emphasis>. Two weeks later, in testimony before Congress, Craigslist execs explained that they'd done their best to address their critics' complaints; now, it seemed, they just wanted out of the headlines. They also warned that law enforcement was losing a valuable partner in the fight against trafficking. Yet Ernie Allen, the lanky Kentuckian who ran the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, saw this as a necessary step. \"Some of this problem will migrate to other areas,\" he said, \"but frankly that's progress.\"</p><p>Allen's prediction was right. In the wake of Craigslist's capitulation, the sex trade did indeed shift to other sites. There were many to choose from-myRedBook, Naughty Reviews, Cityvibe, Rentboy-but Backpage was the chief beneficiary. Larkin sent around an email advising his employees to expect \"a deluge\" of adult ads and reminding them that, \"like it or not,\" such ads \"are in our DNA.\" Lacey says he remained focused, as always, on the editorial side-though he had \"no problem\" seeing the ads \"take off like they did.\" Ferrer, meanwhile, seemed only too happy to inherit Craigslist's share of the adult market, even if that meant assuming its place in the crosshairs. \"It is an opportunity for us,\" he wrote in an email. \"Also a time when we need to make sure our content is not illegal.\"</p><p>Backpage was already getting into hot water. A girl in Missouri had sued the site in mid-September, alleging that she'd been pimped out at the age of 14 and that Backpage had willfully \"failed to investigate for fear of what it would learn.\" She claimed, without clear evidence, that the site's operators \"had a strong suspicion\" she was underage. Ultimately, a federal magistrate dismissed her case. The situation was tragic, he said, but Backpage was protected under Section 230. The girl needed to sue her pimp.</p><p>On October 18, Backpage announced on its blog that it had retained Hemanshu Nigam, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in sex crimes and child abuse, to develop a \"holistic\" safety program. Nigam sat on the board of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and had done similar work for Myspace. In the months that followed, Nigam and his new clients met repeatedly with representatives from anti-trafficking organizations. They discussed changes to Backpage's site architecture, moderation practices, and content policies. The organizations suggested, for instance, that users should be prevented from employing search terms such as \"incest\" or \"Lolita,\" since these might \"indicate illegal activity.\" Backpage moderators, meanwhile, should be on the lookout for \"ads written from masculine perspective,\" particularly if they employed the euphemism \"new in town,\" which \"is often used by pimps who shuttle children to locations where they do not know anyone and cannot get help.\"</p><p>By late January 2011, Backpage had implemented many of the recommendations: It had banned photographs with nudity, drawn up a list of \"inappropriate terms,\" beefed up its vetting process, and begun referring \"ads containing possible minors\" directly to Allen's staff. Ferrer also worked closely with the authorities. According to a Justice Department memo from 2012, \"unlike virtually every other website that is used for prostitution and sex trafficking, Backpage is remarkably responsive to law enforcement requests and often takes proactive steps to assist in investigations.\" A later memo noted that \"even Ernie Allen believed that Backpage was genuinely trying to rid its site of juvenile sex trafficking.\"</p><p>Lacey and Larkin say they were more than willing to help crack down on child abuse. But the demands being made of them seemed increasingly unreasonable. Sex trafficking, defined as commercial sex involving coerced adults or anyone under 18, was one thing. Consensual sex work was quite another-and it wasn't even illegal under federal law.</p><p>In March 2011, Lacey and Larkin flew to Virginia to meet with Allen. \"To say that the meeting did not go well is an understatement,\" Allen wrote later that day. After a full hour, he and Lacey \"were still screaming at each other.\" Allen demanded that Backpage do more to combat prostitution. Larkin said the site would enforce a \"news paper standard,\" but Lacey added, \"We are not Craigslist, and we aren't going to succumb to pressure.\" A Justice Department memo continues the story: \"Allen responded that 'At least you know what business you are in.' \"</p><p>Lacey's memories are no rosier. \"Allen pulls out this shoddy U. Penn report\"-the one from 2001-and \"thumps the table with it,\" he recalls. The report sent Lacey into orbit. \"They love to inflate the numbers by talking about children 'at risk' of exploitation,\" he says. Owing to the shadowy nature of sex trafficking, such numbers are notoriously hard to pin down: Experts at the Crimes Against Children Research Center have noted that \"scientifically credible estimates do not exist,\" and one of the Penn report's authors told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis> in 2015, \"Clearly, a new, more current study is needed.\"</p><p>Lacey thought he knew what business Allen was in too-fearmongering in the interest of fund-raising. He took the meeting as a finger in the chest. Within a few weeks, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Village Voice</emphasis> began to run articles examining the fishy data on child sex trafficking.</p><p>In April, Nigam suggested that, as a gesture of goodwill, Backpage should join the Demi and Ashton Foundation, a nonprofit created by actors Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore. The foundation had recently run a series of PSAs under the slogan \"Real men don't buy girls,\" featuring various Hollywood bigwigs. Lacey ignored Nigam's suggestion. Instead, he instructed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Village Voice</emphasis> to publish an article titled \"Real Men Get Their Facts Straight.\"</p><p>Larkin, for his part, tried to make nice with the authorities-at least until he and Lacey could cash out. Backpage was causing too many headaches, and the papers were growing deader by the day. \"Selling print sooner than later was the winning move,\" Larkin explains. \"The longer you waited, the dumber you were.\" Initially it seemed that Backpage would be the easier business to unload. By September 2011, a private-equity firm focused on \"out-of-favor industries\" had agreed to buy it for $150 million. But the deal fell apart after the National Association of Attorneys General announced an investigation of Backpage. Larkin and Lacey were incensed. Section 230 provided that websites could be prosecuted only under federal criminal law, so they considered a state-level investigation extralegal. From that point on, both men were ready to go to the mattresses.</p><p>The following fall, Lacey and Larkin sold their beloved alt-weeklies to a group of their own editors for just over $32 million, about 8 percent of what the chain had been valued at in 2005. (Even this amount was later negotiated down, after the buyers defaulted.) In a farewell letter, Lacey wrote that they were leaving to carry on their jihad \"over the First Amendment, free speech on the internet and Backpage.\" Cynics pointed to the money; by 2011, Backpage was raking in more than $50 million a year, nearly as much as the newspapers that spawned it.</p><p>Whatever their mix of motives, Lacey and Larkin moved their cause to the courtroom. With Section 230 as their weapon, they won a series of civil suits and successfully challenged anti-Backpage laws in New Jersey, Tennessee, and Washington state. Many of the court opinions noted the First Amendment problems inherent in regulating internet content. \"When freedom of speech hangs in the balance,\" wrote the Tennessee judge, \"the state may not use a butcher knife on a problem that requires a scalpel to fix.\"</p><p>By this point, the nation's attorneys general had had enough. As they saw it, Backpage and other internet platforms were using Section 230 as an excuse to duck their responsibilities to users. In July 2013, 49 of them signed a letter to Congress saying that the law needed an overhaul.</p><p>State attorneys general weren't the only prosecutors itching to get in on the action. The Feds were too, but they had a problem: They couldn't identify a viable crime. Prostitution wasn't a federal offense, and they didn't seem to think they could make sex-trafficking charges stick. Back in 2011, the Justice Department had quietly opened a grand jury investigation into Backpage in Washington state; according to an internal memo, prosecutors interviewed more than a dozen witnesses and subpoenaed more than 100,000 documents but ultimately decided that \"a successful criminal prosecution of Backpage is unlikely.\" They thought about trying to make a case under the Travel Act but, as they noted, that theory \"had never been litigated in a similar context.\" So they formulated another potential plan of attack. \"Moving forward,\" they wrote, the Justice Department should \"take a hard look at bringing this case as a civil forfeiture case,\" with its \"lower standard of proof.\" In this scenario, the government would seize a website operator's assets and property, then force them to prove they <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">weren't</emphasis> implicated in criminal activity.</p><p>In June 2014 the Justice Department put this plan into action. It seized myRedBook and demanded that the site's owner, Eric \"Red\" Omuro, forfeit $5 million in cash and property. The following summer, the Department of Homeland Security launched a similar raid against \"the nation's largest online male-escort service,\" Rentboy, and its owner, Jeffrey Hurant. Both men pleaded guilty to violations of the Travel Act in exchange for lighter sentences and lesser fines. The forfeiture approach seemed to be working.</p><p>Meanwhile, Backpage opponents were finding sympathetic ears on Capitol Hill. In April 2015, Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio and the chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, fired off the following tweet: \"backpage essentially sells human beings. It's horrible, and I'm going after them.\"</p><p>That same month, Lacey and Larkin finally located a serious buyer for Backpage: Carl Ferrer. He agreed to pay just under $603 million for the platform-four times what they'd been offered in 2011.</p><p>Portman's subcommittee soon issued a series of subpoenas, seeking internal documents that would reveal Backpage's moderation practices. The site fought back, but in September 2016 the US Supreme Court ruled that it had to fork over more than 1 million internal emails and other records. Every dubious decision, every bit of chatter and commentary, every lame joke between Backpage employees and managers, was about to come spilling out.</p><p>On January 8, 2017, the Senate subcommittee released its final report, titled \"Backpage.com's Knowing Facilitation of Online Sex Trafficking.\" It pushed the theory that Lacey, Larkin, Ferrer, and their employees had invalidated their liability protections under Section 230: Rather than removing illegal and obscene content, the Senate said, Backpage had helped develop it, using clever moderation practices to \"sanitize the content\" and conceal it from the eyes of the law-all in the name of earning a few extra dollars. This, the subcommittee implied, put Backpage in the position of a content creator, not a mere content host.</p><p>Most courts had been rejecting the same argument for six years, but now Portman and his colleagues had what they considered incontrovertible evidence. Much of it was contained in the report's 840-page appendix, which included highlights from the emails and other documents that the site had been ordered to produce.</p><p>The report outlined three major steps in Backpage's road to perdition. In the early days of the site, most ads for commercial sex were deleted outright. By early 2009, however, Ferrer had begun to instruct his employees to manually remove any obscene photos and \"forbidden words,\" then post the ad anyway. In an email, he wrote that he considered this the more \"consumer friendly\" approach, because it would avoid \"pissing off a lot of users who will migrate elsewhere.\" But the true goal, according to the Senate, was to give those ads \"a veneer of lawfulness.\" One former Backpage moderator, identified in the report as Employee C, testified that she saw her role as \"putting lipstick on a pig, because when it came down to it, it was what the business was about.\"</p><p>By late 2010, Backpage had developed an automated filter called Strip Term From Ad. It was tuned to remove problematic words (\"lolita,\" \"rape,\" \"fresh,\" \"little girl\") <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">before</emphasis> any human moderator had seen the ad. Because the original language wasn't saved on Backpage's servers, the Senate complained, there would be no real record of the offending content-nothing to send to law enforcement. \"Of course,\" the subcommittee wrote, \"the Strip Term From Ad filter changed nothing about the real age of the person being sold for sex or the real nature of the advertised transaction.\"</p><p>Perhaps that's why, in mid-2012, Backpage instituted a kind of hybrid process, automatically editing some ads while automatically banning others, depending on the terms used. But the Senate saw chicanery here, too. Ferrer complained that the auto-bans were causing confusion among users; if they submitted an ad that contained a banned term, they had no way of knowing why it had been rejected. And so Backpage rolled out an alert feature, which informed users which specific term was to blame. In the Senate's eyes, it was \"coaching its customers on how to post 'clean' ads for illegal transactions.\"</p><p>The appendix was full of what appeared to be smoking guns. In late 2010, for instance, Backpage's operations manager, Andrew Padilla, castigated one of his employees for putting a note on a user's account suggesting she was a prostitute. \"Leaving notes on our site that imply that we're aware of prostitution, or in any position to define it, is enough to lose your job over,\" Padilla wrote. \"If you need a definition of 'prostitution,' get a dictionary.\" The following summer, four months after the ill-fated meeting with Ernie Allen, Larkin cautioned Ferrer against publicizing Backpage's moderation practices. \"We need to stay away from the very idea of 'editing' the posts, as you know,\" he wrote in an email.</p><p>On the night the Senate report was released, Backpage finally shut down its adult section. It was, of course, far too late to stave off what was coming. The next morning, Lacey, Larkin, Ferrer, and two other Backpage executives appeared in Room 342 of the Senate's Dirksen Building for a grilling by Portman and his colleagues. It was a carefully choreographed bit of political theater. The Backpage witnesses took the Fifth, as senators knew they must; thanks to a pending case in California, they had no choice. Portman denounced them for refusing to \"come clean.\"</p><p>Within six months of the hearing, at least eight new civil lawsuits were filed against Backpage. The Section 230 defense now worked only intermittently, as courts increasingly read in exceptions. The site's operators began preparing for a rumble with the Feds. Backpage handed out fat legal retainers, as key employees lawyered up. Lacey and Larkin started segregating cash; funds from the sale of Backpage went into one set of accounts, while proceeds from the newspaper sale went into another. Ferrer bought a brand-new Texas McMansion, put it in his wife's name, and poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into renovations.</p><p>Still, Lacey and Larkin largely shrugged off the Senate's report. \"We didn't go out and try to disprove it,\" recalls an attorney who worked on the matter. \"It's not like there isn't plenty to say. But to try to rebut 50 pages of allegations in the press? That's fighting a losing battle.\" The lawyer added: \"It was a hit piece. It was intended to be a hit piece. What are you going to do?\"</p><p>In August 2017, Portman launched another attack against Backpage. With a bipartisan group of 20 senators, including Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal, he introduced the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or Sesta. Later, in an op-ed for WIRED, Portman laid out the bill's key features: It would remove Section 230's \"unintended liability protections for websites that knowingly facilitate online sex trafficking\" and \"allow state and local law enforcement to prosecute\" those sites. Just as J. James Exon, the sponsor of the Communications Decency Act, had done two decades earlier, the senators deflected concerns about constitutional overreach. Portman described Sesta as \"narrowly crafted\"; Blumenthal called it \"narrowly tailored.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley disagreed. On the day Sesta was introduced, the Internet Association-an industry consortium that represents Airbnb, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and more than three dozen other tech companies-released a statement calling the bill \"overly broad.\" While it was important to pursue \"rogue operators like Backpage.com,\" the association said, Sesta was more butcher knife than scalpel; it would create \"a new wave of frivolous and unpredictable actions against legitimate companies.\" In a letter to the Senate, a coalition of human rights and civil liberties organizations warned that the result of all this litigation would be \"increased censorship across the web.\" Platforms that had once sought to encourage free speech through light moderation would now take an iron-fisted approach. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the chilling effect would be particularly damaging to sites like Wikipedia, which \"don't have the massive budgets to defend themselves that Facebook and Twitter do.\"</p><p>But Big Tech and its allies were no longer really in a position to complain. On Halloween, Congress hauled in executives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Legislators wanted to know why the platforms had failed to stem the tide of fake news and misinformation in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, why they'd sold political ad space to Russian nationals, why they were supposedly muzzling conservative voices. Pundits opined that the web was all grown up now; many questioned why platforms still needed Section 230's protection.</p><p>Several days after the Capitol Hill perp walk, the Internet Association suddenly reversed course. It came out in favor of a lightly modified version of Sesta, which by now had been combined with an equally clumsily named House bill, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or Fosta. It was hard not to see the association's move as a cynical act of political pandering. As Winston Churchill once said, \"Each one hopes that if he feeds the crocodile enough, the crocodile will eat him last.\"</p><p>By the spring of 2018, things had gotten even worse for Big Tech. That March, news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, seeming to confirm the public's worst suspicions. Four days later, Congress passed Fosta-Sesta. The law amends Section 230 to allow states and civil plaintiffs to go after websites that \"promote and facilitate prostitution\" or \"knowingly benefit from participation in a venture that engages in sex trafficking.\" Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, one of the original authors of Section 230 and a longtime tech industry ally, warned that further measures could be in the offing if \"technology companies do not wake up to their responsibilities &amp;#230; to better protect the public.\"</p><p>In spite of the protests of free speech advocates, more than 100 organizations had come out in favor of the law-Truckers Against Trafficking, Girls With Grit, the Christian Action League of Minnesota. Seth Meyers and Ivanka Trump touted it too. But sex workers and their allies were bitterly opposed. The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists noted that Fosta-Sesta contained \"a sweeping and unproductive conflation of sex trafficking and consensual sex work.\" The association further argued-just as Craigslist had when it shuttered its adult section in 2010-that, in forcing sites like Backpage to remove or censor their content, the law would merely drive predators into even darker corners of the internet. Their crimes would be harder to spot and investigate, and many sex workers would be forced \"to pursue far riskier and more exploitative forms of labor\" on the streets.</p><p>Two weeks after Fosta-Sesta passed, Carl Ferrer appeared in a closed federal courtroom in Phoenix. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to facilitate prostitution and launder money, surrendered Backpage and its assets, and promised to cooperate with federal authorities. (Ferrer's plea forbids him to talk to the press. \"I'm not trying to avoid you,\" he told me at a recent court appearance. \"I just have to say no comment.\") A day later, the Feds nailed Lacey and Larkin in Phoenix, charging them and five other Backpagers under long- existing criminal statutes. As many legal experts pointed out, the move suggested that the government never needed Fosta-Sesta to prosecute the pair; President Donald Trump had yet to even sign it into law.</p><p>Lacey and Larkin never seemed to seriously consider that Ferrer might flip. Other insiders certainly did. \"I think he just chickened out,\" offers an attorney who worked with Ferrer for almost 20 years and spoke to me on condition of anonymity. The lawyer points out that Ferrer never shared Lacey's and Larkin's disdain for cops. \"That's an awful lot of pressure to put on a skinny white guy,\" he continues. \"And Jim was never all that nice to him.\"</p><p>Though it is still relatively early, the broad outlines of each side's strategy are clear. If this case reaches a jury, the government will likely argue that the end justifies the means-that sex trafficking and prostitution generally are so abhorrent that the government had to do away with Backpage, protected speech and all. They will employ what trial lawyers call \"reptile theory,\" tapping into the jury's primitive instincts, arguing that Backpage constituted a public danger and that convicting the defendants will make the community safer. They will tell the grisly tales set forth in the indictment's 17 victim summaries. They will depict Lacey and Larkin as calculating profiteers, outlaws who refused to honor the reasonable requests of law enforcement because they might make a few mil less. They will hope the defendants' seeming indifference to the plight of trafficking victims inspires the jury to overlook holes in the prosecution's case.</p><p>The defense strategy is equally clear. Lacey and Larkin will offer high-minded arguments in defense of what the public regards as low-value speech. They will challenge government experts who claim they can look at a sample of Backpage ads and know beyond doubt that they proposed illegal transactions. It's unclear how effective a witness Ferrer will be; over the past decade, he has given numerous sworn statements in Backpage litigation that contradict assertions in his plea. To the extent that Ferrer has anything damaging to offer, the defense will likely argue he was acting on his own. \"We had lawyers telling us how to do this,\" Lacey says. \"The only way this was going to blow up was if Carl was doing something he shouldn't have.\"</p><p>Fosta-Sesta is already panning out as its detractors feared. Once Trump signed it into law, platforms rushed to self-censor; nobody wanted to be Backpaged. Cityvibe shut down altogether. Reddit banned numerous communities, including r/escorts and r/SugarDaddy. Google reportedly began purging its users' cloud accounts of sexually explicit material. Cloudflare, one of the largest cybersecurity and website performance companies in the world, terminated service to Switter, a social media platform on which sex workers connected with each other and vetted their clients. Cloudflare is known for its commitment to free speech, but it was compelled to enforce what its general counsel called, in an interview with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Vice</emphasis>, \"a very bad law and a very dangerous precedent.\"</p><p>The endless game of whack-a-mole continues. A month after Fosta-Sesta passed, ads for commercial sex had plummeted 82 percent, according to TellFinder, a data analytics tool originally built by the Defense Department. Within another four months, though, the numbers had rebounded to 75 percent of their previous daily volume. New sites popped up, seeking to fill the void left by Backpage, just as Backpage had done with Craigslist. One of them was called Bedpage.</p><p>Still, the Justice Department remains committed to taking the Backpage defendants down. Its plan seems to be to force them to plead, \u00e0 la Rentboy and myRedBook. Since March 2018, federal prosecutors have seized more than $100 million in cash, real estate, and other assets from Lacey and Larkin. The strategy is simple: No money? No lawyers. QED.</p><p>The asset freezes raise all kinds of thorny constitutional questions. Generally speaking, federal prosecutors are permitted to freeze a defendant's assets based on probable cause alone, even before the defendant has a chance to challenge the government's case in court. But regular forfeiture rules do not apply in cases involving forums for speech-newspapers, films, books, magazines, websites. The US Supreme Court has decreed that when the government seizes these expressive materials, or the proceeds derived from them, it must immediately hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the seizure is valid.</p><p>But the Backpage defendants have a problem: So far, they can't get a court to hear their claims. Since last summer, the Justice Department appears to have been playing a clever shell game. They've brought cases against the Backpage defendants in two federal districts-civil seizures in Los Angeles, criminal matters in Phoenix-and they're making the defendants spend what money they have left chasing Uncle Sam from place to place. So far, judges in both districts have agreed with the government's suggestion that they should defer to each other, effectively denying the defendants a forum to challenge the asset freezes. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will hear arguments in the case in July.</p><p>Paul Watler, a media law specialist at Jackson Walker LLP in Dallas, is troubled by the seizure tactic. \"It's an end run around the First Amendment,\" he says. The big question remaining, according to Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, is whether federal prosecutors will use this strategy to crack down on other platforms in the future. \"Is this the leading edge or a one-off?\" he asks. \"I still don't know the answer to that. But they're coming for us, one way or another.\" Even if Fosta-Sesta is one day ruled unconstitutional, as many legal scholars expect, government officials have shown that they're willing to subvert Section 230 in other ways. If Lacey and Larkin lose-if the asset seizures stand and the Travel Act charges stick-prosecutors will have a valuable new weapon to wield against Silicon Valley. Personal wealth will be no deterrent.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Association of Attorneys General is on the warpath once again. On May 23, 2019, the group sent a letter to a handful of congressional leaders urging further cutbacks to Section 230. \"The abuse on these platforms does not stop at sex trafficking,\" they wrote. \"Stories of online black market opioid sales, ID theft, deep fakes, election meddling, and foreign intrusion are now ubiquitous.\" They recommended that Section 230 be amended to allow a wide variety of state-level criminal prosecutions.</p><p>Lacey and Larkin remain convinced that the furor over sex ads is a moral panic, irrational and hysterical, cynically stoked by politicians and law enforcement. And they're not about to surrender. They know they're not the world's most sympathetic defendants-rich (or formerly rich) white men accused of, at the very least, morally questionable business decisions, fighting for their right to hire the best lawyers money can buy.</p><p>Yet they can still seem oddly tone-deaf, even a touch naive. In April, a federal judge shot down Lacey's request to have his ankle monitor removed in order to swim during a Hawaiian vacation. (In pleadings, Lacey's lawyers explained he had use-'em-or-lose-'em flyer miles.) Prosecutors called Lacey a flight risk, and the resulting headlines were predictably brutal. Lacey responds with incredulity: \"The idea that I would run-are you kidding? I'm taking the first flight to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">confront</emphasis> you.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHRISTINE BIEDERMAN</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is a lawyer and investigative reporter based in Dallas.

Take Action[8] Stop Article 13[9]Goodbye, protections for artists and scientistsThe Copyright Directive was always a grab bag of updates to EU copyright rules\u2014which are long overdue for an overhaul, given that it's been 18 years since the last set of rules were ratified. Some of its clauses gave artists and scientists much-needed protections: artists were to be protected from the worst ripoffs by entertainment companies, and scientists could use copyrighted works as raw material for various kinds of data analysis and scholarship.Both of these clauses have now been gutted to the point of uselessness, leaving the giant entertainment companies with unchecked power to exploit creators and arbitrarily hold back scientific research. </p><p>Having dispensed with some of the most positive versions of the Directive, the trilogues have also managed to make the (unbelievably dreadful) bad components of the Directive even worse.A dim future for every made-in-the-EU platform, service and online communityUnder the final text, any online community, platform or service that has existed for three or more years, or is making \u20ac10,000,001/year or more, is responsible for ensuring that no user ever posts anything that infringes copyright, even momentarily. This is impossible, and the closest any service can come to it is spending hundreds of millions of euros to develop automated copyright filters. Those filters will subject all communications of every European to interception and arbitrary censorship if a black-box algorithm decides their text, pictures, sounds or videos are a match for a known copyrighted work. They are a gift[10] to fraudsters and criminals[11], to say nothing of censors[12], both government and private. These filters are unaffordable by all but the largest tech companies, all based in the USA, and the only way Europe's homegrown tech sector can avoid the obligation to deploy them is to stay under ten million euros per year in revenue, and also shut down after three years. America's Big Tech companies would certainly prefer not to have to install these filters, but the possibility of being able to grow unchecked, without having to contend with European competitors, is a pretty good second prize (which is why some of the biggest US tech companies have secretly lobbied for filters).[13]Download Your First Issue Free! Do You Want to Learn How to Become Financially Independent, Make a Living Without a Traditional Job ...nally Live Free? Download Your Free Copy of Counter MarketsAmazingly, the tiny, useless exceptions in Article 13 are[14] too generous[15] for the entertainment industry lobby, and so politicians have given them a gift to ease the pain: under the final text, every online community, service or platform is required to make 'best efforts' to license anything their users might conceivably upload, meaning that they have to buy virtually anything any copyright holder offers to sell them, at any price, on pain of being liable for infringement if a user later uploads that work.News that you're not allowed to discussArticle 11, which allows news sites to decide who can link to their stories and charge for permission to do so, has also been worsened. The final text clarifies that any link that contains more than 'single words or very short extracts' from a news story must be licensed, with no exceptions for noncommercial users, nonprofit projects, or even personal websites with ads or other income sources, no matter how small.Will Members of the European Parliament dare to vote for this?Now that the Directive has emerged from the Trilogue, it will head to the European Parliament for a vote for the whole body, either during the March 25-28 session or the April 15-18 session\u2014with elections scheduled in May. These elections are critical: the Members of the European Parliament are going to be fighting an election right after voting on this Directive, which is already the most unpopular legislative effort in European history, and that's before the public gets wind of these latest changes. Let's get real: no EU political party will be able to campaign for votes on the strength of passing the Copyright Directive\u2014but plenty of parties will be able to drum up support to throw out the parties that defied the will of voters and risked the destruction of the Internet as we know it to pour a few million Euros into the coffers of media companies and newspaper proprietors\u2014after those companies told them not to.There's never been a moment where your voice mattered moreWatch this space. We will be working with allies across the EU to make this upcoming Parliamentary vote into an issue that every Member of the European Parliament is well-informed on, and we're going to make sure that every MEP knows that the voters of Europe are watching them and taking note of how they vote. Digital rights activists across the EU will be working to make this upcoming Parliamentary vote into an issue that every Member of the European Parliament is well-informed on. Between the lobbying of Big Tech and Big Media, we'll be explaining what this means for everyday Internet users. And together, we're going to make sure that every MEP knows that the voters of Europe are watching them and taking note of how they vote. All that it takes is for you to speak up. Over four million Internet users have signed the petition against the Directive[16]. If you can do that, you can pick up the phone and call your MEP.[17] Tell them why you're against the Directive, what it means for you, and what you expect your representatives to do in the forthcoming plenary vote. It really is the last chance to make your voice heard.Cory Doctorow[18] is a science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger \u2014 the co-editor of Boing Boing[19] and the author of young adult novels like HOMELAND, PIRATE CINEMA and LITTLE BROTHER and novels for adults like RAPTURE OF THE NERDS and MAKERS.

Sarah Bianchi and Ernie Tedeschi, now analysts at research firm Evercore ISI, write in a private report\u00a0the Massachusetts Democrat probably would face a Republican Senate, hamstringing her ability to move much of her legislative agenda.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             But as Warren said at the last debate, \"I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it.\"\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The resulting regulatory bonanza, Bianchi and Tedeschi argue, would reach into just about every corner of the economy. \"All any President needs is to have an effective group of Administration officials in place with a clear agenda - which Warren certainly provides,\" they write. \"This is where much of the action in her Administration would be.\"\u00a0Bianchi was director of economic and domestic policy for ex-vice president\u00a0Joe Biden, who is running for president in 2020;\u00a0and Tedeschi served as a senior adviser and economist at the Treasury Department during the Obama administration.</p><p>We've written here about the difficulty Warren could face getting nominees confirmed by a GOP Senate. But it's worth considering the range of the moves she could try to make toward the \"big, structural change\" to which she has committed herself on the campaign trail. President Trump has certainly taken advantage of his regulatory powers, as did his predecessor,\u00a0former President Obama.</p><p>Here's a look at some of the actions a President Warren could take, per the Evercore ISI report.\u00a0</p><p>             1. A muscular antitrust push.\u00a0          </p><p>             A Warren administration could juice investigations\u00a0the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have\u00a0launched into big tech companies - and push to break up Amazon, Facebook and Google, Bianchi and Tedeschi write (Warren has made no secret of her desire to break up large tech companies like Facebook).\u00a0They argue the senator\u00a0would also fight to block tech giants from acquiring startups that pose a competitive threat. \"Companies have the ability to take the government to court,\" they write. \"But there is no doubt that a Warren Administration would make corporate America think twice before proposing many mergers.\" (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             It's not just big tech that would feel new antitrust heat from Washington. Bianchi and Tedeschi argue. \"Warren gave a speech in 2016 where she outlined her views about the concentration throughout the economy, including aspects of the health care sector, agriculture, and beyond,\" the report says, noting Warren was critical of the Obama administration for not being more aggressive on this front. \"There is no question she would look to undo certain mergers and there certainly would be a higher bar for [mergers and acquisitions] that increases industry concentration for a variety of industries.\"</p><p>             2. Tough new rules for Wall Street.\u00a0          </p><p>Though Warren wants to break up the big banks by restoring the Glass Steagall Act, the proposal stands little chance of moving on the Hill. But Bianchi and Tedeschi point to several other pressure points a President Warren\u00a0could target through executive authority. Among them: Ramping up pressure on the big banks through the living wills process; applying new scrutiny to credit ratings agencies via the Securities and Exchange Commission; and cracking down on non-bank financial companies, including by reviving the designation of some as systemically risky, subjecting them to stricter federal oversight.\u00a0</p><p>             3. More \"economic cold war\" with China.\u00a0          </p><p>Warren has been a tough critic of Beijing and would likely confront the regime on a number of issues. \"We think Senator Warren could be tougher particularly around issues such as labor, environmental rights, including Climate Change,\" Bianchi and Tedeschi write. \"Moreover, we think that she is trying to 'out tough' Trump on China given the political benefits of doing so, particularly in the Midwest.\"          </p><p>             They argue Warren would speak out where Trump hasn't, on human rights issues generally and the protests in Hong Kong specifically. She could look to bring that push home by extending \"criticism or action to Americans companies that have stopped their workers from expressing views on China or have put their companies in vulnerable positions by producing in the country or making the intellectual property vulnerable.\"</p><p>And they conclude she would continue the Trump team's effort to decouple U.S. and Chinese supply chains, including by dialing up export controls, regulating foreign investment, and looking to build up American tech and manufacturing capacity.\u00a0</p><p>             4. Raising worker pay.\u00a0          </p><p>Warren can't achieve her ambition of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by executive fiat. But she could make some opportunities to force companies to hike employee compensation. For example, she could more aggressively enforce rules already on the books governing what constitutes full-time work versus contract work.\u00a0</p><p>             5. Stronger corporate accountability.\u00a0          </p><p>\"One of Warren's main messages is that a central reason for the high levels of wealth disparity in the United States is due to a lack of accountability for those at the top - whether it is the top of the income scale or corporations,\" Bianchi and Tedeschi write. \"She has called this out as a Senator and no doubt would use all of the relevant agencies in the government - from DOJ to CFPB to the SEC - to hold corporations accountable.\" That would include prosecuting executives who break the law. And she could target stock buybacks through rules changes at the SEC.\u00a0</p><p>Some of Warren's more ambitious regulatory efforts could get knocked down in the courts.</p><p>But the Evercore pair note that Warren made her biggest mark on policy before arriving in the Senate in 2013 -\u00a0by standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"This is how she thinks about government and we believe her Administration would focus on a similar kind of accountability through the federal government,\" they write.\u00a0          </p><p>You are reading              The Finance 202          , our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.</p><p>- Trade uncertainty casts a pall over global growth. WSJ's Paul Kiernan: \"Finance ministers and central bankers who gathered in Washington for the [International Monetary Fund's]\u00a0fall meetings in recent days said in interviews and public events that the biggest risks to the global economy are trade-related uncertainties and divisions among nations over how to reduce them.</p><p>Global economic growth has ebbed\u00a0this year to its slowest pace since the 2009 recession, the IMF said. The main culprit for the malaise has been the trade war between the U.S. and China, which the fund estimates to have left a Switzerland-size hole in the global economy...\u00a0While the IMF predicts a modest pickup in 2020, it also stressed the risk of growth again falling short. The fund said the world's three largest economies--the U.S., China and Japan-are likely to slow further next year.\"</p><p>             Lagarde\u00a0             says the U.S. is at risk of losing its role as a leader:\u00a0 \"Christine Lagarde, the departing head of the International Monetary Fund who is set to take over as president of the European Central Bank, said in an interview that the U.S. risks diminishing its role as a global leader and warned of dire consequences of its trade war with China, the WSJ's\u00a0Kate O'Keeffe\u00a0reports.</p><p> \"[Lagarde] also warned [Trump] against pushing the Federal Reserve for lower interest rates because it could spur inflation. 'When the unemployment rate is at 3.7%, you don't want to accelerate that too much by lowering interest rates,' she said. 'Because the risk you take is that then prices begin to go up. You have to be very careful. You know, it's like navigating a plane.'\"</p><p>- Brexit's path remains uncertain.The Post's William Booth and Michael Birnbaum: \"At the very last minute on Saturday night, [Britist Prime Minister Boris] Johnson asked the Europeans for a Brexit delay until the end of January 2020. In fact, he sent three letters, leaving people to puzzle over exactly which one meant what - and to wonder: Where Brexit is headed next?\u00a0A most excellent question. Because nobody really knows.</p><p> \"After lawmakers voted 322 to 306 to withhold support for Johnson's new Brexit deal,\u00a0scuppering his hope of finalizing Britain's exit plan\u00a0at an extraordinary - but ill-named? - 'Super Saturday'\u00a0session in Parliament, the prime minister was forced to fold and seek an extension...\u00a0Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC, 'Notwithstanding the parliamentary shenanigans, we appear to have now the numbers to get this through.'\"</p><p>             British voters are exhausted. From Hermes Investment Management CEO Saker Nusseibeh: \"At this stage, any prediction for the future of this process is by definition perilous, but the popular mood for some sort of closure and an end to uncertainty would argue for an eventual Brexit. The economic price of that divorce as well as any mitigants\u00a0from a more independent economic policy will not be fully apparent for several parliamentary cycles. The UK has already suffered some economic loss, and I would argue more importantly, deep wounds to its social fabric and political framework, as a result of this process.\"</p><p>             - Goldman Sachs: The economic slowdown is widespread. From a note to clients:\u00a0\u00a0\"Economic data were titled to the downside this week, underscoring the broad-based nature of the ongoing economic slowdown. While we believe the US economy will be able to withstand the global storm, momentum will continue to cool into 2020. We see GDP growth slowing from 2.2% this year to 1.6% in 2020 as cautious consumers drive the economy at a slower pace.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>             - China braces for growth to fall below 6%:\u00a0 \"China's policy makers are preparing for two key policy meetings in the coming weeks with fresh evidence that sooner rather than later, the number for gross domestic product growth will start with a 5,\" Bloomberg reports.</p><p> \"Data released Friday showed an economy expanding at just 6.0%, the slowest in almost three decades, and with broad investment growth too tepid to rely on an upturn down the road.\u00a0People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang responded to the data not by hinting at much greater stimulus in the pipeline, but by reminding investors that China's focus remains on keeping its\u00a0heavy debt load\u00a0under control.\"</p><p>             And Liu He makes encouraging comments about a trade deal. Bloomberg: \"China's top trade negotiator offered positive signals that talks with the U.S. are making progress and both sides are working toward a partial trade deal. 'China and the U.S. have made substantial progress in many aspects, and laid an important foundation for a phase one agreement,'\u00a0Vice Premier Liu He said at a technology conference in Nanchang, Jiangxi, on Saturday. He reiterated that China is 'willing to work in concert with the U.S. to address each other's core concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect.'\"</p><p>             - Huawei in talks with U.S. firms to license 5G platform: \"Blacklisted Chinese telecoms equipment giant Huawei is in early-stage talks with some U.S. telecoms companies about licensing its 5G network technology to them, a Huawei executive told Reuters,\" Reuters's Alexandra Alper reports.</p><p>\"Vincent Pang, senior vice president and board director at the company said some firms had expressed interest in both a long-term deal or a one-off transfer, declining to name or quantify the companies ... The U.S. government, fearing Huawei equipment could be used to spy on customers, has led a campaign to convince allies to bar it from their 5G networks. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claim.\"</p><p>- NAM promotes USMCA with Pence. The National Association of Manufacturers and glassmaker SCHOTT North America are hosting Vice President Mike Pence today in Duryea, Penn. Pence is touring the facility at 3:55 p.m. and then giving remarks about the importance of Congress passing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. The event comes as NAM continues a intensive lobbying push for congressional approval of the pact. By its count, the group has conducted over 450 meetings with lawmakers, with a focus on House Democrats.\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0SoftBank seeks to avoid WeWork's liabilities: \"SoftBank Group Corp. is attempting to become the majority owner of WeWork without assuming the onerous lease obligations of the U.S. office-space sharing firm, according to people familiar with the matter,\" Reuters's Joshua Franklin, Greg Roumeliotis and Mike Spector report.</p><p>\"SoftBank is offering a $5 billion financing lifeline that The We Company, the parent of New York-based WeWork, is assessing against a proposal by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM. N) for a debt package of similar size from banks and institutional investors. WeWork could run out of cash as early as next month without new financing, sources have said, after the company pulled plans in September for an initial public offering (IPO). It abandoned the IPO when investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and the way WeWork was being run by its co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann, who now serves as board chairman.\"</p><p>- Facebook outlines a new path for Libra:\u00a0 \"Facebook Inc. facing growing skepticism about its digital currency project Libra ... said the initiative could use cryptocurrencies based on national currencies such as the dollar, instead of the synthetic one it initially proposed,\" Reuters's\u00a0Andrea Shalal reports.</p><p> \"David Marcus, who heads the Libra project for Facebook, told a banking seminar the group's main goal remained to create a more efficient payments system, but it was open to looking at alternative approaches for the currency token it would use ...\u00a0Marcus said he was not suggesting currency-pegged stablecoins were the group's new preferred option.\"</p><p>- Icahn will likely tap his son to take over his firm. Cue the \"Succession\"\u00a0theme music. WSJ's Cara Lombardo: \"At 83, Carl Icahn, the billionaire financier legendary for waging guerrilla warfare with corporate targets from TWA to Dell, finally has a succession plan. It's a little complicated. Fed up with New York, Mr. Icahn says he's moving his hedge fund to Miami and laying the groundwork to hand it over to his son, Brett.</p><p> \"Mr. Icahn says Brett is the 'leading candidate'\u00a0to take over the firm-once Mr. Icahn is ready to let go, which he doesn't seem to be just yet. 'I'm not going to give up making the real decisions,'\u00a0Mr. Icahn says. 'I'm still in charge, but he'd get a piece of the action.'\"</p><p>- Exclusive: Private equity goes on offense. The industry has come in for some harsh criticism from Democrats - particularly from Warren, who has called the firms \"vampires\" that are \"looting\" the economy and pitched a plan one economist said would \"be the end of private equity as we know it.\" Now the sector is fighting back, ramping up a campaign to convince voters and policymakers that the business model supports jobs and economic growth.\u00a0</p><p>The American Investment Council, private equity's lobbying group in Washington, is releasing a new economic report from Ernst and Young that says the industry supports 26 million American jobs and 5 percent of U.S. economic activity - while paying $174 billion in federal, state and local taxes last year. It highlighted Ohio's share with a release and an ad last week timed to the Democratic presidential debate there. And as it braces for more heat from presidential contenders, the group is also going up with a six-figure digital ad campaign in Washington and early-voting states to advance its message about the industry's contributions.\u00a0</p><p>             Lobbyists say they can work with Warren.Politico's Theodoric Meyer: \"Even in a Democratic presidential field in which most candidates have sworn off contributions from lobbyists, Warren's hostility to K Street stands out.\u00a0But while Warren's campaign rhetoric has made the influence industry nervous, many lobbyists who've worked with the Massachusetts senator's office say she's far from antagonistic when it comes to doing business with K Street.</p><p> \"Six lobbyists who interacted with her office said they'd never had trouble getting meetings. Several of them said that while they'd be reluctant to bring corporate clients to meet with Warren's leading progressive rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), they'd have no qualms about having them sit down with Warren.\"</p><p>             - Congress ramps up scrutiny of Boeing: \"U.S. lawmakers probing the 737 MAX jet crisis are ratcheting up scrutiny of Boeing Co. BA leaders as new details point to management pressure on engineers and pilots in its commercial-aircraft unit,\" the Wall Street Journal's Andrew Tangel and Andy Pasztor report.</p><p>\"Investigators for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee looking into the design and certification of the 737 MAX have received details of a three-year-old internal Boeing survey showing roughly one in three employees who responded felt 'potential undue pressure' from managers regarding safety-related approvals by federal regulators across an array of commercial planes. Workload and schedule were cited as important causes. Such conflicts could become problematic, the survey found, when it came to Boeing engineers who played dual roles designing certain systems on behalf of the plane maker and then certifying the same systems as safe on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration, as part of a decades-old agency program that effectively outsources such regulatory work to company employees.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Buttigieg eyes 35 percent corporate rate to fund health plan: \"Pete Buttigieg would pay for his $1.5 trillion health-care plan by rolling back President Donald Trump's corporate tax cut to return the rate to 35% and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, campaign spokesman Sean Savett said,\" Bloomberg News's Sahil Kapur reports.</p><p>\"Buttigieg's 'Medicare for all who want it' plan would extend the federal health-care program for seniors as an option for Americans who prefer it, while also letting people opt for private plans.

It's not that the likes of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America have gotten more resilient, they argue. Rather, the exam has gotten easier, part of a broader Trump-era push to roll back the post-crisis rules governing the financial sector.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"The results confirm that our financial system remains resilient,\" Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, who has led the central bank's effort to relax the tests, said in a Friday afternoon statement. \"The nation's largest banks are significantly stronger than before the crisis and would be well-positioned to support the economy even after a severe shock.\"\u00a0</p><p>             The test, the first version of which was deployed in the teeth of the financial crisis in 2009, aims to ensure that the biggest banks have a sufficient capital cushion to withstand a severe economic shock without presenting a risk to the rest of the system. The Fed splits the test into two parts. The \"quantitative\" portion, the results of which it released Friday after the market close, evaluates the preparedness of banks for different kinds of potential downturns. The second portion, set for release on Thursday, examines each bank's plans to pay out dividends or buy back stocks.</p><p>But the first half of the test presented the biggest hurdle, and no banks are in serious jeopardy of failing now. By some measures, the firms look to be showing steady strengthening. \"Under the Fed's 'severely adverse scenario,' the big banks would together lose $410 billion - an improvement from the $464 billion aggregate losses projected in last year's worst-case hypothetical scenario for the same firms,\" the Wall Street Journal's Lalita Clozel writes. \"Their common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, which measures high-quality capital as a percentage of assets, would fall to a low of 9.2%, from an actual level of 12.3% at the end of last year.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Those appearances may be deceiving, Bloomberg News's Mark Whitehouse wrote in an opinion piece last week. \"On the surface, the scenarios appear to be getting tougher over the years. But they keep\u00a0generating smaller pre-tax losses: Net of income, losses amounted to a weighted average of just 0.7% of assets for the four largest banks in the 2018 tests, down from 1.9% in the 2013 tests,\" he writes, pointing to this graphic:\u00a0</p><p>Whiteside ticked through some of the tweaks the Fed has made easing the banks' burden: \"It has largely\u00a0eliminated\u00a0the 'qualitative objection,'\u00a0which allowed officials to flunk institutions that couldn't demonstrate an adequate grasp of the risks they faced. It has released\u00a0details\u00a0of the model it uses to estimate losses, similar to showing banks the exam before they take it. And it\u00a0intends\u00a0to share the test results before banks decide on their plans for dividends and stock buybacks, allowing them to avoid the embarrassment of having their plans publicly rejected.\"</p><p>             The changes drew a rare rebuke last month from Daniel Tarullo, the Fed governor who led the effort to forge Wall Street's post-crisis rulebook. Among other problems with relaxed stress tests, he said, by offering more advanced clues to banks, the process allows the firms to \"find clever ways to reshape their assets\" to pass without reducing risk. After the current crop of regulators have moved on, Tarullo said, \"somewhere down the line, someone else will suffer that damage.\"          </p><p>- Stocks are up but investors are down. WSJ's Akana Otani: \"The share of individuals who say they expect U.S. stocks to rise over the next six months has held below 30% for six consecutive weeks, according to the American Association of Individual Investors. That marks the longest such streak since the leadup to the 2016 elections. Money managers also are glum. Half of fund managers believe that the global economy will weaken over the next 12 months, up from roughly 5% in May and marking the biggest one-month jump in pessimism since\u00a0Bank of America\u00a0began asking investors the question in the mid-'90s.\u00a0Much of the deterioration in sentiment appeared to be fueled by the back-and-forth between the U.S. and its trading partners in the past few weeks.\"</p><p>- Concerns over trade, the Fed have markets moving in tandem. WSJ's\u00a0Avantika Chilkoti\u00a0and Pat Minczeski: \"Bonds, stocks and currencies are moving in tandem more often, as central-bank surprises and trade uncertainty assert their grip over markets. Known by investors as 'risk-on, risk-off,'\u00a0the phenomenon happens when markets essentially split into two broad buckets that move together: risk-off, or haven assets, which rally when investors grow skittish; and risk-on, or growth assets, which rally when risk appetite returns.\"</p><p> \"A basket of assets that reflect either risk-on or risk-off sentiment has moved together nearly a quarter of the past 100 days through June 19, the highest level since mid-2016...\u00a0The number of risk-on, risk-off days has stepped up quickly since the beginning of the year as investors focus on the change in strategy from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, the on-and-off\u00a0trade tensions coming out of Washington, and signals of whether China will move to stimulate its economy.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:\u00a0          </p><p>-\u00a0What's in store for Trump-Xi's G-20 meeting: \" ... The biggest event in Osaka is likely to be a sideline meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which financial markets will be watching carefully,\" Bloomberg Businessweek's Shawn Donnan and Peter Martin report. \"After playing down its likelihood, Trump raised expectations on June 18 when he tweeted that, after a 'very good telephone conversation,' the two leaders would hold an 'extended meeting' during the summit.\"</p><p>\"The best-case scenario laid out by officials and analysts from both countries is that the meeting might yield a pause in any new U.S. tariffs and a resumption of the talks that broke down in May. While such a truce would extend the uncertainty of the past year, it would at least offer the hope of short-term peace. The worst-case scenario would turn the simmering trade tensions into a new cold war.\"</p><p>-\u00a0... Meanwhile Trump blacklists more companies: \"The U.S. put five more Chinese tech entities on a trade blacklist just days ahead of a high-stakes summit between [Trump] and [Xi] even as it offered a quiet olive branch by postponing a potentially provocative speech,\" Bloomberg News's Jenny Leonard and Shawn Donnan report.</p><p>\"The move on Friday to list four companies and a research institute involved in China's super-computing efforts follows the similar blacklisting of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co. last month, blocking it from buying U.S. software and components.\"</p><p>Huawei itself is digging in for an extended fight, The Post's Jeanne Whalen reports.\u00a0</p><p>             The White House is considering additional measures for 5G equipment: \"The Trump administration is examining whether to require that next-generation 5G cellular equipment used in the U.S. be designed and manufactured outside China, according to people familiar with the matter. The move could reshape global manufacturing and further fan tensions between the countries,\" the WSJ's Stu Woo and Dustin Volz report.</p><p>\"A White House executive order last month to\u00a0restrict some foreign-made networking gear and services due to cybersecurity concerns started a 150-day review of the U.S. telecommunications supply chain. As part of that review, U.S. officials are asking telecom-equipment manufacturers whether they can make and develop U.S.-bound hardware, which includes cellular-tower electronics as well as routers and switches, and software outside of China, the people said.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Amazon Merchants are feeling pain from the trade war: \"Amazon.com Inc. merchants around the world are scrambling to navigate an unpredictable trade war that's upending their proven business model of buying inexpensive goods in China and selling them at a markup in the U.S. The problem is particularly acute now as Trump weighs another $300 billion worth of tariffs, many on consumer goods,\" Bloomberg News's Shelly Banjo\u00a0and Spencer Soper report.\u00a0</p><p>\"Mom and pop sellers won't be able to wait for Trump's decision: They have to place factory orders now and figure out pricing if they want to get their goods made in time for the lucrative Christmas shopping season, when they make as much as half their annual revenue.\u00a0The most obvious\u00a0solutions - raising prices, shifting production to other countries, stockpiling inventory - all have costs and complications of their own.\" (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\u00a0owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>-\u00a0Trump denies threatening to demote Powell: \"[Trump] said he never threatened to demote Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, though he maintained he has the authority to do so,\" CNBC's Spencer Kimball reports. 'I didn't ever threaten to demote him,' Trump said in an interview with NBC's \"Meet The Press\" that broadcast Sunday. 'I'd be able to do that if I wanted, but I haven't suggested that.'</p><p>\"Trump went on to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, saying [Powell] made a mistake. 'Obama had someone that kept the rates very low,' Trump said. 'I had somebody that raised the rates very rapidly - too much. He made a mistake, that's been proven.'\"</p><p>-\u00a0Trump administration pushes to deregulate with less enforcement: \"[Trump's] promises to reverse the regulatory actions of the Obama administration have been stymied by court challenges, but his administration is achieving the goal another way: by not hiring people to do the work of enforcing rules that are on the books,\" WSJ's Alex Leary reports.</p><p>\"At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created to crack down on unscrupulous small lenders and debt collectors, enforcement is down by 80% from its 2015 peak ... Even so, there is growing dissatisfaction among business leaders over the administration's pace of rolling back actual regulations. Until regulations are eliminated, industry operators still must be prepared for inspections, even if they are less likely. And if Democrats retake the White House in 2020, a new president could easily ramp the rules back up and enforce those that remain on the books.\"</p><p>- Google's enemies to help build anti-trust case. WSJ's Ryan Tracy and Valentina Pop: \"As U.S. officials prepare\u00a0an antitrust probe\u00a0of\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0Inc.'s\u00a0Google and possibly other Silicon Valley giants, a loose-knit crew of its rivals is gearing up to help. In industries from news to travel to online shopping, competitors of Google are readying documents and data in anticipation of meetings with the Justice Department, according to industry representatives.</p><p> \"Many of these companies have long argued that Big Tech platforms illegally abuse their market power. In recent years some of them have found a receptive audience in Europe, where authorities have\u00a0thrice fined\u00a0Google for\u00a0alleged monopolistic practices. Google has paid the fines but is challenging them in court. Now rivals are stepping up their advocacy in the U.S., where antitrust enforcers recently divvied up the job of examining antitrust concerns at large tech platforms, with the Justice Department\u00a0preparing a Google probe.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Restaurants are pushing delivery companies to lower fees: \"Some of the biggest restaurant operators are pushing back against fees charged by delivery companies, turning up the heat on young businesses already wrestling with rivals in an increasingly crowded market for bringing food to people's doors,\" the WSJ's Heather Haddon reports.</p><p>\" ... Growing competition in the delivery business is emboldening many restaurants to seek lower rates from such companies.\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0Corp., Applebee's and Cousins Submarines Inc. are among chains negotiating to pay lower commissions and asking their delivery partners to spend more on marketing and promotional discounts, people familiar with the negotiations said. Restaurateurs say high fees dent their profits. They add that lower fees and more promotional spending by delivery companies could increase customer choice by enticing more establishments to offer delivery.\"\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0San Francisco is set to ban e-cigs: \"San Francisco is expected to become the first city in the U.S. to ban e-cigarettes this week, a move that will likely pit the city against one of its fastest-growing startups: Juul Labs Inc.,\" the WSJ's Talal Ansari reports. \"The San Francisco Board of Supervisors will hold a final vote on the ordinance, which bans the sale, distribution and manufacturing of e-cigarettes, on Tuesday. The measure will then need to be signed by the mayor, London Breed.\"</p><p>\"San Francisco's move doesn't affect the sale of cigarettes, which will remain legal. Juul Labs, the dominant e-cigarette maker, has criticized the measure.\"</p><p>-\u00a0A Toys R Us comeback?: \"Maybe American kids will only have to live through one Christmas without Toys 'R'\u00a0Us. About a year after shuttering U.S. operations, the remnant of the defunct toy chain is set to return this holiday season by opening about a half dozen U.S. stores and an e-commerce site, according to people familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg News's Matthew Townsend and Joe Deaux report.</p><p>\"The stores are slated to be about 10,000-square feet, roughly a third of the size of the brand's big-box outlets that closed last year, the people said. The locations will also have more experiences, like play areas. The startup costs could be minimized with a consignment inventory model in which toymakers ship goods but don't get paid until consumers buy them, some of the people said.\"</p><p>- Sanders to propose eliminating student debt by taxing Wall Street. The Post's Jeff Stein: \"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will propose on Monday eliminating all $1.6 trillion of student debt held in the United States, a significant escalation of the policy fight in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary two days before the candidates' first debate in Miami. Sanders is proposing the federal government pay to wipe clean the student debt held by 45 million Americans - including all private and graduate school debt - as part of a package that also would make public universities, community colleges and trade schools tuition-free.</p><p> \"Sanders is proposing to pay for these plans with a tax on Wall Street his campaign says will raise more than $2 trillion over 10 years, though some tax experts give lower revenue estimates.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Democrats poised to challenge Waters over Ex-Im Bank: \"House Democrats are poised to challenge a deal negotiated by Rep. Maxine Waters that would impose new restrictions on the Export-Import Bank, the first show of resistance among members of the Financial Services Committee since she became chairwoman in January,\" Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt reports.</p><p>\"The new legislation that the California Democrat drafted with the finance panel's top Republican, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), would renew the agency's operations for seven years and expand its capacity to offer loan guarantees to foreign buyers of U.S. exports. Without action, the bank's charter would expire at the end of September ... The clash over the bill is shaping up to be a major test for Waters, who as committee chairwoman has pledged to work with her GOP counterpart to pass legislation to maintain the Export-Import Bank, federal flood insurance and terrorism insurance.\"\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0What business issues to watch for in this week's debates: \"Business has dominated the early policy discussions in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary,\" CNBC's Jacob Pramuk reports. \"Expect more talk about candidates' plans for corporate America when 20 hopefuls square off over two nights in the first Democratic debates this week.\"</p><p>\"Candidates have sparred over how large a role the government should take in molding the economy. They have differed over how free trade affects the economy - and whether trade deals can sufficiently protect American workers. Business issues will give candidates a platform to set themselves apart as they elbow for position in a jammed field.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Upcoming:          </p><p>             From The Post's Tom Toles:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-83a2783492b3483baf35ced9a3fa85a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-KX81-DXKP-J3VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2736\"/><timeReceived>11:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

The debate ...</p><p>with Brent D. Griffiths   If President Trump secures confirmation of his third pick for the Supreme Court, the institution would become a font of business-friendly decisions for years to come, many corporate and public interest lawyers alike say.    The debate around the consequences of the coming confirmation fight is reaching full tilt before Trump has even announced his nominee. It is primarily centering on what a 6-to-3 conservative majority will mean for hot-button social issues, namely, abortion rights , the future of the Affordable Care Act and the role the Supreme Court could play in a potential post-election legal battle over a contested result.    Yet the court is also primed to rule on a slate of issues pitting big-business interests against consumers and workers \u2013 with sweeping consequences for the balance of power between them.    This court already treats business interests more favorably than any in nearly a century, some scholars argue . In its 2017 term, the court returned pro-business decisions in more than 80 percent of the cases in which they were at stake, according to an  by Adam Feldman, author of the Empirical SCOTUS blog.   That was before Brett Kavanaugh replaced Anthony Kennedy on the court, advancing the court\u2019s rightward shift. Trump\u2019s pick is primed to cement that evolution. Per Feldman\u2019s analysis, the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the least business-friendly justice from 2015 through 2017:   Adding another justice likely to side with the corporate agenda, public-interest lawyers who argue before the court say, will make it harder for consumer and worker advocates to convert a swing vote to their side or narrow the scope of business-friendly decisions.   \u201cWith a 5-4 court, where there\u2019s more balance, a lot of issues are just one vote away. That becomes less true with a 6-3 court,\u201d says appellate lawyer Deepak Gupta, founder of Gupta Wessler. The dynamic enabled by that close division played out in May 2019, when the court  a defeat to Apple in a case that enabled a major antitrust class action against the tech giant to advance. Justice Kavanaugh cited precedent in joining the four more-liberal justices to forge a majority.   There are several areas of the law where business interests could see breakthrough victories under the new margin. Here are some to watch:   1. Corporations want to limit plaintiffs' right to challenge them by cracking down on where they sue.  The court is set to hear a case on the matter that will most likely be argued before a ninth justice is confirmed. It turns on two deadly car crashes involving malfunctioning Fords. The accidents occurred in Montana and Minnesota, and the plaintiffs want to sue the auto giant in those states; Ford contends because the cars were neither made nor sold in either place, it can\u2019t be held liable in their courts.   \u201cThe main thing corporations seek from the Supreme Court is limitations on the ability to sue them,\u201d says Allison Zieve, director of Public Citizen\u2019s litigation group. \u201cThere have been significant limitations imposed or recognized over the last couple of decades, and they\u2019ll continue to do that.\u201d   Sidley Austin partner Jonathan Cohn agrees a 6-3 court is more likely to narrow a practice he calls \u201clitigation tourism\u201d \u2014 a particularly high priority for the pharmaceutical industry.   2. Industry is looking to keep lawsuits against them out of the courts, forcing them into private arbitration.   Another way corporations seek to limit their exposure to lawsuits is by keeping disputes out of the courts through private arbitration. The court will hear arguments this fall over the scope of those agreements in a case that involves an antitrust suit against dental equipment wholesaler Henry Schein. But public interest advocates say many more related cases are probably coming. \u201cThese cases have tended to produce 5-4 splits, with enormous implications for the ability of consumers to hold businesses accountable,\u201d Gupta says.  3. Big business also wants to scale back the ability independent federal agencies to regulate industry.  Industry is seeking to circumscribe regulators\u2019 authority, in part by challenging the constitutionality of agencies insulated from oversight by elected officials. The court in a 5-to-4 decision this summer struck down the single-director structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But that ruling was a \u201csheep that comes in wolf\u2019s clothing,\u201d as former CFPB director Richard Cordray wrote , because it otherwise preserved the agency.   A similar challenge to the Federal Housing Finance Agency is pending , and more are probably on the way. \u201cThis is a long-term project: Justice Kavanaugh believes pretty strongly that the Constitution limits the arrangements for administrative agencies,\u201d Gupta says. At stake, he says, is the government\u2019s ability \u201cto take important issues and delegate them to experts who won\u2019t be captured by powerful industries and get the results they want.\u201d  4. Companies are increasingly invoking the First Amendment to challenge regulations.   Companies are increasingly invoking the First Amendment to challenge costly or burdensome regulations.   The strategy has met with a mixed record. Last year, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit  e-cigarette makers made a meritless argument when they contended a ban on the distribution of free samples violated their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge Spirit Airlines launched on free-speech grounds to federal rules governing how it advertises ticket prices and taxes to passengers. And the court rejected an appeal by the CTIA, the wireless communications industry group, aimed at striking down a Berkeley, Calif., ordinance that requires cellphone retailers to warn buyers of radiation risks.   Others have found success. Trade groups including the American Beverage Association convinced a federal appeals court last year that a San Francisco ordinance mandating warnings on sugary drinks violated the First Amendment.    Most significantly, big business won a landmark victory in 2018 when the high court ruled \u201cit was unconstitutional to allow public employee unions to require collective-bargaining fees from workers who choose not to join the union, a major blow for the U.S. labor movement,\u201d Robert Barnes and Ann Marimow  at the time. \u201cThe court, in a 5-to-4 decision, overturned a 40-year-old precedent, arguing that the rule could require workers to give financial support to public policy positions they oppose.\u201d Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said the rule violated workers\u2019 free-speech rights.   Court watchers say business interests may seek to bring more such cases, in which the argument would be more likely to find favor with a 6-to-3 conservative majority.  Some corporate lawyers warn against overstating the impact of a new justice.  And they say a conservative majority doesn't equate in all cases to a business-friendly one. \u201cI don\u2019t think the court is either business-friendly or not business-friendly,\u201d says Helgi Walker, chair of Gibson Dunn\u2019s administrative law and regulatory practice group. \u201cIf a Trump nominee is confirmed, you\u2019ll have a court that is perhaps that much more likely to follow the law that Congress writes and let Congress make the policy decisions, which is how the separation of powers is supposed to work.\u201d   But Cohn says it\u2019s a reasonable conclusion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to oversimplify it. But on balance, you could probably expect more of a reception to business-oriented arguments.\u201d  Market movers Dow drops more than 500 points.  Tech pressure continues to mount: \u201cThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 525.05 points lower, or 1.9 percent, at 26,763.13. Earlier in the session, the Dow was up 176 points. The S&amp;P 500 slid 2.4 percent to 3,236.92 and the Nasdaq Composite pulled back by 3 percent to close at 10,632.99,\u201d CNBC's Fred Imbert and Maggie Fitzgerald report .   \u201cShares of Amazon and Netflix dropped 4.1 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, to lead Big Tech lower. Facebook slid 2.3 percent. Alphabet closed 3.5 percent lower. Apple ended the day down 4.2 percent and Microsoft dipped 3.3 percent.\u201d (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)  The S&amp;P 500 is approaching correction territory . \u201c The benchmark gauge of U.S. equities is poised for its first monthly slide since March,\u201d Bloomberg's Rita Nazareth and Sarah Ponczek note .  Latest on the federal pandemic response Top CEOs call for \u201cmajor\u201d stimulus as relief talks remain stalled.  Executives say the economy is getting better but that the nation can't afford to backslide: \u201cRoughly 1 in 4 chief executives of some of the nation\u2019s largest companies say their businesses have recovered or will have by year end, despite the lingering ill effects of the coronavirus recession, according to a survey,\u201d Hannah Denham reports .   \u201cBusiness Roundtable surveyed 149 members about projected sales, capital spending and hiring for the next six months. The CEO Economic Outlook Survey rose to 64.0 in the third quarter, the headline index\u2019s first quarterly increase in nine quarters, according to a report released Wednesday. The index is up 29.7 points since last quarter but remains well below the historical average of 81.7, which dates to 2002.\u201d  Key quote : \"Further major support from the federal government is necessary to prevent economic recovery from being derailed,\u201d Joshua Bolten, president and chief executive of Business Roundtable said in a statement. \u201cFailure to act, along with the lack of comprehensive and coordinated efforts to stop the spread of covid-19, would impose long term damage on the U.S. economy, hurting most the workers and small businesses least able to absorb the blow.\u201d  Unemployment claims expected to remain high . \u201c The number of workers in the U.S. applying for jobless benefits likely held at historically high levels last week as the labor market slowly recovers from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d WSJ's Sarah Chaney reports . \u201cEconomists expect applications for jobless benefits ticked down to 850,000 last week from 860,000 a week earlier. Jobless claims are down significantly from a peak of near seven million in March but have stagnated at just over 800,000 in recent weeks.\u201d   Fed officials are also maintaining calls for more spending: \u201cThe recovery would move along faster \u2018if there is support coming both from Congress and from the Fed,\u2019 Chairman Jerome Powell said during the second of three days of congressional testimony Wednesday,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos reports .   \u201cChicago Fed President Charles Evans told reporters that his projection that the unemployment rate would fall below 6 percent by the end of next year had been premised on around $1 trillion in additional fiscal relief \u2026 Powell and his colleagues said Congress and the White House, more than the Fed, had the power to hasten a faster recovery.\u201d    Fed policymakers vow to keep interest rates near zero: \u201cFederal Reserve officials on doubled down on efforts to convince investors they will keep monetary policy easy for years to allow unemployment to fall, emphasizing that interest rates will stay near zero until inflation gets to 2 percent and stays there,\u201d Reuters's Howard Schneider, Ann Saphir, Jonnelle Marte report . \u201cBoth Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and [Evans] were adamant on Wednesday: Rates will not increase until labor markets recover fully from the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus, and prices hit the Fed\u2019s target.\u201d Goldman Sachs now says more stimulus isn't coming this year . \u201c We think it is now clear that Congress will not attach additional fiscal stimulus to the continuing resolution,\u201d firm economists wrote in a note. They estimate \u201cthe withdrawal of fiscal support will reduce disposable income in Q4 to roughly the pre-pandemic level.\u201d And as a consequence, they are cutting their fourth-quarter growth forecast in half, from 6 percent to 3 percent, on a quarterly annualized basis.  Coronavirus fallout More from the United States: Feared outbreaks in schools yet to arrive, early data shows: \u201cThousands of students and teachers have become sick with the coronavirus since schools began opening last month, but public health experts have found little evidence that the virus is spreading inside buildings, and the rates of infection are far below what is found in the surrounding communities,\" Laura Meckler and Valerie Strauss report . Trump attacks FDA plan for tougher standards on emergency vaccine approval: \u201cThe president said he had \u2018tremendous trust in these massive companies\u2019 developing prospective vaccines and suggested that they, not federal regulators, could best determine when a vaccine should be made available to the American people,\u201d Amy Goldstein and Laurie McGinley report . Fauci chides Sen. Rand Paul over herd immunity claims: \u201cWhite House coronavirus advisor Anthony S. Fauci pushed back against Paul's claim that New York has overcome the pandemic because it achieved herd immunity, telling the Kentucky Republican he\u2019s \u2018not listening,\u2019\u201d CNBC's Noah Higgins-Dunn reports . See the exchange here:  From the corporate front: United Airlines, pilots union agree  to delay furloughs until Oct. 30: \u201cHowever, pilots will not be paid during the month of October if that deal does not pass, according to a memorandum of understanding between United and the union representing its 13,000 pilots that was seen by Reuters,\u201d Tracy Rucinski reports . Disney pushes some of its biggest blockbusters well into 2021: \u201cThe studio, which is the driver of a large share of theatrical moviegoing around the world, is postponing its biggest films to at least May, with one being postponed until December 2021,\u201d Steven Zeitchik reports . The delays also mean that for the first time since 2009 there will be no new movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the highest-grossing film franchise of all-time. The world's largest hedgefund is operating out of tents in a Connecticut forest: \u201cOut among the pine trees across from Bridgewater Associates\u2019 headquarters in Westport, Conn., sit as many as 50 employees who help manage the $140 billion in assets of the world\u2019s largest hedge fund,\u201d Fortune's Jen Wieczner reports . Trump insists protesters are throwing Bumble Bee tuna cans, in the midst of pandemic tuna shortage: \u201cThere have been no media reports about police being hit by cans of tuna. Since the start of the pandemic, tuna fish has been in high demand,\u201d Laura Reiley reports . Pocket change California to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035.  This is a historic shift for a state that helped create car culture: \u201cFacing a record-breaking wildfire season as well as years of heat waves and droughts exacerbated by climate change, the Golden State is seeking to accelerate the shift away from combustion engines on its roads, which account for more greenhouse gas emissions than any other source,\u201d Dino Grandoni, Faiz Siddiqui and Brady Dennis report .   \u201cThe plan would give industry until 2045 to make sure medium- and heavy-duty vehicles are zero-emissions when feasible. Transportation currently accounts for the largest source of emissions in the state, outpacing the industrial, agricultural and residential sectors combined \u2026 Because of its market muscle, California\u2019s move could have ripple effects across the country and propel automakers to ramp up production of electric vehicles. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia already follow California\u2019s fuel efficiency standards, and auto manufacturers have long built cars to meet its more stringent specifications.\u201d   Wells Fargo CEO apologizes after blaming shortage of Black talent for the bank's lack of diversity: \u201cCharlie Scharf apologized in a memo to the entire company \u2018for making an insensitive comment reflecting my own unconscious bias,\u2019 \u201d Hamza Shaban reports .   \u201cThe Wells Fargo controversy comes as protests of police brutality and racism have swept across the country, drawing pledges from corporate America to fight racial inequality. It also comes as Wells Fargo, one of the country\u2019s largest banks, continues to struggle to repair its image after a series of consumer abuse scandals, including admitting that it had opened millions of fake accounts customers didn\u2019t want.\u201d   JPMorgan set to pay  nearly $1 billion in spoofing penalty: \u201cThe bank is set to pay nearly $1 billion to resolve market manipulation investigations by U.S. authorities into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities,\u201d Reuters's Lawrence Delevingne and Abhishek Manikandan report .   \u201cThe large fine would lift a regulatory shadow that has hung over the bank for several years and mark a signature victory for the government\u2019s efforts to clamp down on illegal trading techniques, such as spoofing, especially in the precious metals markets.\u201d  Trump tracker Judge orders Eric Trump to meet with N.Y. attorney general before the election.  Eric Trump had claimed he's too busy for a deposition:  \"A state judge ordered Eric Trump to be deposed no later than Oct. 7 in the New York attorney general's examination of the Trump Organization's financial practices, rejecting a protest by Trump's son, who has said he is too busy to meet with investigators until after November's election,\u201d Shayna Jacobs reports from New York.   \u201cThe judge also ordered that the Trump Organization and related business entities that were withholding documents and claiming attorney-client privilege proceed with producing records to the attorney general. The probe is a civil matter, not a criminal one. James\u2019s office has said the Trump Organization potentially misled lenders and duped tax authorities.\u201d  The regulators SEC raises bar for shareholder resolutions.  The changes address one of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton\u2019s top priorities: \u201cCommissioners voted 3-2 to pass a final rule requiring shareholders to hold $25,000 of stock for a year, up from $2,000 currently, in order to submit such proposals. That threshold will fall to $15,000 after two years of ownership and to $2,000 after three years, setting a sliding scale that gives priority to longer-term shareholders,\u201d WSJ's Paul Kiernan reports .   \u201cClayton and the two Republican commissioners who supported the change said it would discourage so-called gadfly investors from buying stocks simply to pressure companies to advance their personal beliefs \u2026 Critics of the move said it was the Trump administration\u2019s latest effort to stymie Wall Street\u2019s growing focus on environmental, social and governance\u2014or ESG\u2014issues, which are the subject of most shareholder proposals.\u201d  Money on the Hill DOJ to seek congressional action to reduce internet companies' immunity.  Such a bill is extremely unlikely to pass before the election: \u201cThe proposal advances two main goals the Trump administration and the department outlined in June: encouraging online platforms to actively address illicit conduct and manage content on their sites in fair and consistent ways,\u201d WSJ's Ryan Tracy and Brent Kendall report .   \u201cThe department refined its proposal in the intervening months based on feedback from market participants and other stakeholders such as victims\u2019 rights groups. As a result of that process, the department made some changes, including clarifying that internet companies would have immunity when they take down material that promotes violent extremism or self-harm \u2026\u201d  \u201cSen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who helped write the legal protections targeted by the administration\u2019s proposal, said Republicans are trying to \u2018work the refs ahead of the election\u2019 by threatening social media companies with retribution if they censor or fact-check content.\u201d Campaign 2020  Trump won't commit to a peaceful transfer of power:   University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers calls the statement \u201cterrible for the economy.\u201d   As we noted here last week, stock market investors are growing increasingly nervous about the prospect that an extended and contested result will inject more volatility into the market.    Trump's remarks also drew a rebuke from Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah):  Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testify before the Senate Banking Committee for the quarterly Cares Act update. The Labor Department reports the latest weekly jobless claims. A House small-business subcommittee holds a hearing on the Paycheck Protection Program. Costco, Darden Restaurants, CarMax, Rite Aid and BlackBerry are among the notable companies reporting their earnings.

Whether voters think it's tough enough could shape the direction of the 2020 race.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The former vice president, leading early polling for the Democratic presidential nomination, appeared to pivot Wednesday from a dismissive attitude he'd staked out just last month to a more confrontational posture toward the rising superpower.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             But some China hawks argue Biden's hardened stance still reads as accommodating compared to President Trump's tariff-backed bid to force structural economic changes in China. That creates\u00a0a contrast for blue-collar voters in Midwestern states that Biden has said he is uniquely positioned to recapture.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Biden, in a speech in Ottumwa, Iowa, blasted Trump's trade war as damaging American farmers and autoworkers while neglecting the investments at home necessary to keep pace with China's advancements in tech and infrastructure. \"We need to get tough with China. They are a serious challenge to us, and in some areas a real threat,\" Biden said. (Read his remarks as prepared for delivery here.)</p><p>             The conclusion marked an apparent departure from Biden's assessment of the Chinese threat in another Iowa speech on May 1. Then, he suggested that the U.S. does not need to worry about China as a geopolitical competitor. \"China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,\" Biden said at the time. \"I mean, you know,\u00a0they're not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they're not competition for us.\"\u00a0</p><p>Now, the former vice president says, to counter China's rise, the U.S. needs to plow money into research, workforce development and infrastructure; work with allies to police Chinese trading abuses; and \"tighten up our defenses so that American companies don't have to keep giving away technology to China, or having it stolen.\"</p><p>             Rob Atkinson, who served during the Obama administration on the National Innovation and Competitiveness Strategy Advisory Board, said Biden is \"clearly backtracking.\"          </p><p>             \"I think he knows his initial comments about China were not well received and were not going to play well in the battleground states, the heartland, so he had to change the narrative,\" Atkinson said.\u00a0</p><p>But he added that he was struck that Biden didn't call out Chinese mercantilism. \"He's saying China is a threat, but the response should be domestic policies only, and he appears to criticize aggressive trade policies going after China. If he stays with that and is the nominee, that's going to be the dividing line.\"          </p><p>             Ely Ratner, Biden's former deputy national security adviser, said Wednesday's speech didn't represent an about-face. \"I think the vice president has been consistent on this issue, and at the root of those earlier comments was what we heard today, which is an undying faith in the American people and faith in what makes America great,\" Ratner said. \"Having worked for him and heard him speak thousands of times, what I hear him saying is, given a level playing field, we can out-compete China.\"          </p><p>And he said Trump's approach may look tough but is effectively a dead end. \"Trump is not putting forward a competitive strategy with China,\" he said. \"He's confrontational without being competitive.\"</p><p>During the 2016 campaign, Trump broke from decades of Republican free-trade orthodoxy, effectively outflanking Hillary Clinton to the left on the issue by embracing a protectionist program. Since then, the tariffs he has imposed on key trading partners, and the retaliation from the countries facing them, have pinched farmers and autoworkers in the very Midwestern states that helped deliver him the White House.\u00a0</p><p>             And Quinnipiac polling last month revealed Trump's trade policies are underwater with voters in those Rust Belt battlegrounds: The survey of voters in Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin found 41 percent of respondents approve\u00a0of his approach to trade, while 56 percent disapprove.\u00a0          </p><p>Pointing to those results, the New York Times's Neil Irwin seemed to anticipate Biden's tack when he wrote last week, \"You can imagine a trade pitch from the 2020 Democratic nominee that goes something like this: 'I'll work with allies to keep pressure on China over its unfair practices - but not with open-ended tariffs on thousands of goods that are a tax on American consumers and invite retaliation against American farmers. I won't use tariffs against countries that are our close partners. And I'll use trade policy to try to boost well-being for American workers, rather than using it as a cudgel on unrelated issues.'\"\u00a0</p><p>             Nevertheless, Trump on Wednesday appeared to relish the opportunity to put his record against Biden's on the issue. \"Joe Biden thought that China was not a competitor of ours. Joe Biden is a dummy,\" he told reporters from the White House before leaving for his own trip to Iowa. \"China is a major competitor, and right now China wants to make a deal very badly. It's me right now that's holding up the deal. And we're either going to do a great deal with China or we're not going to do a deal at all... And China ate our country alive during Obama and Biden.\"</p><p>Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, pointed out that the top four vote-getters in the 2016 presidential primaries - Trump, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who reversed himself to oppose fast-tracking trade deals - all ran, to varying degrees, as protectionists. \"Notwithstanding that Biden realizes he needs to sound tough on China, he's still outlining the Obama approach,\" he said. \"The big question here in evaluating Biden's speech is: Do you think we were in a good place with respect to the Chinese in 2016?\"          </p><p>- Global bond markets taunt the Fed. Bloomberg's Emily Barrett: \"Bond markets around the globe are acting like central-bank rate cuts are only a rubber-stamp away from becoming a reality. Just look at the size and scope of the recent rally, which has dragged down yields across the curve. For example, the aggregate rate on longer-maturity sovereign debt ended last week at 1.18%, a level last seen two weeks before [Trump] was elected U.S. president...\u00a0The moves are underpinned by conviction that another global easing cycle is on its way.\"</p><p>- Investors'\u00a0inflation expectations fade. WSJ's Daniel Kruger: \"Investors' expectations for U.S. inflation\u00a0have declined\u00a0to their lowest levels since the start of the year, a sign of growing concerns about a slowdown in the global economy. The 10-year break-even rate, a market-based measure of investors' expectations for the average annual rate of inflation over the next 10 years, has fallen to about 1.7% from nearly 2% in late April.</p><p> \"The decline has coincided with a sharp rise in the odds in the futures market that the Federal Reserve\u00a0will cut interest rates\u00a0multiple times this year...\u00a0Analysts say the combination is a signal investors have little confidence that the Fed\u00a0can sustain the inflation\u00a0rate at its 2% target.\"</p><p>Investors will get a better look at the situation when U.S. consumer prices for May are released at 8:30 a.m. this morning.\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0Kudlow\u00a0says USMCA is more important than China: \"[Trump's] top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, told CNBC on Tuesday that enacting a trade pact with Mexico and Canada to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement is 'more important'\u00a0for the U.S. economy than a deal with China,\" CNBC's Kevin Breuninger reports.</p><p>\"Kudlow also said that he remains hopeful that negotiations between Beijing and the U.S. can return to the position of apparent near alignment they enjoyed before talks appeared to stall out last month, amid disagreements between the two economic superpowers.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, gives the USMCA a \"better than two-thirds chance\" of passing by the end of the year.\u00a0</p><p>             Mexico pledged\u00a0immigration crackdown to avoid tariffs.\u00a0The Post's Nick Miroff, Kevin Sieff and John Wagner: \"Mexican negotiators persuaded [Trump] to back down from his tariff threat by agreeing to an unprecedented crackdown on Central American migrants and accepting more-expansive measures in Mexico if the initial efforts don't deliver quick results, according to officials from both governments and documents reviewed by The Washington Post.</p><p> \"The enforcement measures Mexico has promised include the deployment of a militarized national guard at the Guatemalan border, thousands of additional migrant arrests per week and the acceptance of busloads of asylum seekers turned away from the U.S. border daily, all geared toward cutting the migrant flow sharply in coming weeks. The measures, described by officials from both sides and included in Mexican negotiating documents reviewed by The Post, appear to be more substantial than what the Mexican government has attempted thus far during the precipitous rise in migration to the U.S. border.\"</p><p>-\u00a0More from Kudlow on China: \"[Kudlow] said Tuesday that the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a strong pace through the rest of 2019 even if the U.S. and China don't reach a trade deal,\" CNBC's Fred Imbert reports. \"'The U.S. economy is very strong,' Kudlow told CNBC's 'Power Lunch.' 'I think we're in very good shape and I think we'll maintain a 3% growth pace this year.' \"</p><p>-\u00a0Silicon Valley turns away from Chinese cash: \"Since late last year, amid rising U.S.-China tensions, venture firms with China ties have been dialing back their U.S. investments, structuring deals in novel ways to avoid regulators or shutting their U.S. offices,\" the Wall Street Journal's Rolfe Winkler reports. \"Some American venture firms are dumping their Chinese limited partners or walling them off with special structures. And some U.S. startups that have taken significant Chinese money are keeping the investments quiet or trying to push their Chinese investors out to avoid scrutiny.\"</p><p>\"Behind the shift in sentiment is an effort by the U.S. government to stem a talent and technology outflow it fears could threaten American economic and military superiority. Some Chinese investors hoped a trade deal would be struck in April, easing tensions and reopening the path to investments, but instead the trade fight has spiraled into higher tariffs.\"</p><p>Foxconn says it can move out of China. WSJ's Yoko Kubota: \"Foxconn Technology\u00a0Group said it is ready to shift production for\u00a0Apple\u00a0Inc.\u00a0out of China if necessary, as the electronics assembler tried to assuage investors' concerns over the U.S.-China trade conflict. In the company's first-ever investor meeting and conference call since going public in 1991, senior executives at Taiwan-based Foxconn sought to address investor uncertainty as it prepares for a leadership transition.\"</p><p>Japanese firm follows Washington's trade blacklist: \"Japan's Tokyo Electron, the world's No. 3 supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, will not supply to Chinese clients blacklisted by Washington, a senior company executive told Reuters,\" Makiko Yamazaki reports.</p><p>\"The decision shows how Washington's effort to bar sales of technology to Chinese firms, including Huawei Technologies, is ensnaring non-American firms that are not obliged to follow U.S. law.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Defense contractors are teaming up as spending slows: \"The biggest aerospace-and-defense merger ever caps two years of deal making in an industry that is reorganizing in anticipation of slower growth in Pentagon spending and new priorities such as space systems and hypersonic missiles,\" the Wall Street Journal's Doug Cameron and Ben Kesling report.</p><p>\"United Technologies Inc and Raytheon Co. would be the third-biggest aerospace-and-defense company by sales after Boeing Co and Airbus SE. Those companies along with Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and the U.S. arm of BAE Systems PLC would dominate a defense industry in which some 50 companies vied for big contracts 30 years ago. Cuts to U.S. military spending also contributed to an estimated 17,000 U.S. firms leaving the industry between 2001 and 2015, according to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Ten states sue to stop Sprint-T-Mobile merger: \"Ten states led by New York and California filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to stop T-Mobile US Inc's $26 billion purchase of Sprint Corp, warning that consumer prices will jump due to reduced competition,\" Reuters's Diane Bartz and David Shepardson report.</p><p>\"The complaint comes as the U.S. Justice Department is close to making a final decision on the merger, which would reduce the number of nationwide wireless carriers to three from four.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Wells Fargo CEO search drags on: \"Wells Fargo &amp; Co. is having trouble getting top bankers interested in its open chief executive officer job,\" the Wall Street Journal's Rachel Louise Ensign and David Benoit report.</p><p>\"The bank's board has approached a small group of top candidates, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. consumer banking chief Gordon Smith, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. CEO William Demchak and former U.S. Bancorp chief Richard Davis, according to people familiar with the matter. Messrs. Demchak and Davis took a pass on potentially replacing Timothy Sloan, who resigned in late March, the people said.\"</p><p>-\u00a02020 Dems pressure McDonald's to address sexual harassment: \"Eight U.S. senators, including four presidential contenders, called on McDonald's to do more to combat workplace harassment, saying the number of misconduct reports is 'unacceptable,' \" my colleague Hamza Shaban reports. \"In a letter dated Tuesday, the lawmakers urged chief executive Steve Easterbrook to require all McDonald's franchise stores to update their policies against harassment, abuse and employee retaliation. They also wanted to know how the fast-food giant would evaluate workplaces to address harassment complaints and investigate reports of unsafe working conditions.\"</p><p>-\u00a0DOJ antitrust chief telegraphs possible tech moves: \"The Department of Justice's assistant attorney general brought the case against big tech into focus in a new speech delivered at the Antitrust New Frontiers Conference in Tel Aviv on Tuesday,\" CNBC's Lauren Feiner reports. \"Makan Delrahim laid out some possible arguments against the tech giants as his office is reportedly taking the lead on investigating Google parent company Alphabet and a potential probe into Apple. The Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile, reportedly has taken jurisdiction over Facebook and Amazon.\"</p><p>- Financial regulator sounds alarm on climate change.NYT's Coral Davenport: \"A top financial regulator is\u00a0opening\u00a0a public effort to highlight the risk that climate change poses to the nation's financial markets, setting up a clash with a president who has mocked global warming and whose\u00a0administration has sought to suppress climate science.</p><p> \"Rostin Behnam, who sits on the federal government's five-member\u00a0Commodities Futures Trading Commission, a powerful agency overseeing major financial markets including grain futures, oil trading and complex derivatives, said in an interview on Monday that the financial risks from climate change were comparable to those posed by the mortgage meltdown that triggered the 2008 financial crisis.\"</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Upcoming:          </p><p>             From The Post's Tom Toles:          </p><p>             Stephen Colbert on \"Trump's Super Secret Agreement With Mexico\":          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-1db9bc46fd134f6aa967116f818c2c21</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB0-YBF1-DXKP-J17X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2591\"/><timeReceived>11:44 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

They are moving to deploy both policy carrots and sticks to bring supply chains back to the United States, limit American investment in China and erect new barriers to Chinese companies seeking to expand here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump remains conflicted, and his team divided, over just how hard to push against Beijing.\u00a0</p><p>The tension is coming to a head in an internal struggle over a proposal by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro to force the American production of medical supplies through an executive order, Jeff Stein, Robert Costa and Josh Dawsey report this morning.\u00a0</p><p>Election-year politics are turbocharging the push for the GOP, as the party spies an opportunity to deflect from Trump's sinking approval ratings on his efforts to contain the crisis while harnessing growing popular animus toward China for its role in launching it. If all the anti-China talk translates into action, however, the economic consequences will be vast.          </p><p>Trump has complained about Chinese leadership in recent Oval Office meetings but has yet to sign the proposed order.</p><p>Navarro's proposed order would eventually force the federal government to buy pharmaceuticals and medical supplies manufactured domestically, my colleagues report.\u00a0</p><p>\"Although it has the support of some officials at the State Department and the National Security Council, [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin and several business leaders close to Trump are averse to making a major push on supply chains at a fragile moment for the economy,\" two former officials told The Post. \"And Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, shares Mnuchin's caution about Navarro's push to do this executive order at this time.\"</p><p>Trump's indecision follows weeks of public about-faces on Chinese culpability for the crisis. He initially praised Chinese President Xi Jinping's handling of the it, as his economic advisers worried a confrontational approach would scuttle the trade agreement the two countries announced in January. Later, Trump began blaming Chinese leadership for the spread of the disease and sought to brand it the \"Chinese virus\" and the \"Wuhan virus.\"</p><p>He then dropped those references, explaining earlier this month he is seeking economic engagement with the country. Yet Monday, Trump said at a news conference he is seeking to hold the Chinese accountable and pursue hundreds of billions of dollars in damages from the country. \"We're doing very serious investigations,\" he said, adding his administration hasn't \"determined the final amount yet.\"</p><p>Elsewhere, Trump's administration is pushing ahead against China.</p><p>Among the latest moves:</p><p>Closer to the president, Matthew Pottinger has emerged as a key hardliner.\u00a0</p><p>David Nakamura,\u00a0Carol D. Leonnig\u00a0and\u00a0Ellen Nakashima\u00a0have more details about the former Beijing correspondent for the Wall Street Journal now serving as Trump's deputy national security adviser.\u00a0</p><p>At a forum in India back in January, Pottinger said the economic decoupling of the two countries \"is something that's been underway for quite a long time - and it is not driven by the United States.\"</p><p>Congressional Republicans already are firing off a battery of proposals to sever U.S.-China commercial ties.</p><p>Most are focusing on addressing vulnerabilities they say the pandemic has exposed to Chinese-based supply chains for critical pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and personal protective gear. Others are looking further afield. Hill staffers and lobbyists say some could get a look from lawmakers in the coming weeks as they consider another economic rescue package.</p><p>Proposals offering tax benefits to American companies that move production home probably will be in the mix soon.\u00a0</p><p>Plans to impose mandates on companies struggling through the pandemic-induced economic shock are less viable.</p><p>\"When you get into sticks, people get defensive, and it's harder to reach agreement,\" Russ\u00a0Sullivan, a former staff director of the Senate Finance Committee who now lobbies on tax matters, tells me. \"More likely are\u00a0incentives centered around how we bring\u00a0onshore\u00a0businesses that are critical\u00a0to prepare for future\u00a0pandemics\u00a0or disasters.\"\u00a0</p><p>Derek Scissors - an American Enterprise Institute scholar and self-described \"multiyear pre-Trump supporter of decoupling\" - agrees. \"This is not the time to smash down burdens on U.S. companies,\" he says. Besides, he remains skeptical policymakers are ready to consider how to relocate the most entrenched supply chains, such as those for consumer electronics. \"The fact that we're talking about it doesn't mean we're anywhere close to dealing with the real issues,\" he says.</p><p>For the time being, investors don't appear spooked that drugmakers or medical suppliers will face costly requirements to uproot their Chinese operations. 3M, for example, has found itself in the headlines after its production of N95 masks in China became a diplomatic hot potato between Beijing and Washington. The Minnesota-based company saw its stock surge Tuesday after beating expectations with its first-quarter earnings.</p><p>Merck and Pfizer saw their shares slide after reporting quarterly results Tuesday. But executives for both drugmakers, who acknowledged earlier this year the pandemic could pinch their supply chains or depress sales, said on earningscalls they have experienced no production interruptions. And both expect an economic rebound in the second half of the year.</p><p>             The Dow snapped a four-day winning streak.          </p><p>             Big tech stocks slide considerably: \"Alphabet fell 3 percent ahead of its latest earnings release, which was scheduled for after the close. Facebook dropped 2.5 percent while Amazon slid 2.6 percent. Netflix shares fell 4.2 percent while Apple lost 1.6 percent,\" CNBC's Fred Imbert and Maggie Fitzgerald report.</p><p>\"Stocks that would benefit the most from a reopening led the market higher on Monday and were up again Tuesday. Shares of Simon Property Group and Kohl's rose 10.7 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, after big gains on Monday. Bank stocks such as Citigroup and JPMorgan also rose more than 0.7 percent each.\"</p><p>             Powell expected to promise an aggressive posture. The Federal Reserve is unlikely to unveil much in the way of new moves to stabilize the economy after its meeting today, \"putting attention on Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent news conference, which will be conducted remotely,\" WSJ's Nick Timiraos reports. \"With the prospect of a sharp economic rebound fading because of uncertainty about the novel coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Powell has to walk a line between shoring up confidence in policy makers' response to the crisis without sounding unduly optimistic.\"</p><p>             Investors and economists say trillions more needed to help economy: \"The economy could take one to two years to rebound to full strength and the Federal Reserve and Congress, having already committed historic sums to fight [the pandemic], will have to commit trillions more, according to respondents to the CNBC Fed Survey,\" Steve Liesman reports.</p><p>\"With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet already at an unprecedented $6.45 trillion, the 36 respondents see it rising on average to $9.8 trillion. The additional trillions will be added by the end of the current quarter, the respondents expect. Congress, having already committed about $2.5 trillion, is seen putting in an additional $2 trillion.\"</p><p>Wells Fargo predicts 10-year Treasury yields are on the verge of a comeback: \"Michael Schumacher, the firm's chief macro strategist, expects improving economic conditions will push Treasury yields higher and prices lower,\" CNBC's Stephanie Landsman reports. \"Schumacher's base case points to a better jobs picture as businesses reopen. A rebound in hiring won't happen overnight, but he feels it'll be enough to inject investor confidence into the markets and provide a catalyst for yields.\"\u00a0</p><p>             The Trump administration is scrambling to address mounting criticism of PPP loans.          </p><p>             Mnuchin said large loans will be closely scrutinized: \"Mnuchin said that any small business loan over $2 million will be subject to 'full review' before it could be forgiven,\" Erica Werner reports.</p><p>\"Amid an outcry about large companies receiving the loans, the [Los Angeles] Lakers repaid the $4.6 million government-backed loan it took out. Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC that it was 'outrageous' the NBA franchise had obtained the money in the first place. It's unclear if other professional sports teams received similar loans. The organizations aren't required to disclose it, and the government has not provided any records. Mnuchin also said, while appearing on Fox Business, that firms that improperly took these loans could be subject to 'criminal liability.' \"</p><p>             Trump orders meat plants to remain open.          </p><p>             The move comes despite concerns about worker safety: \"[The president] invoked the Defense Production Act to classify meat plants as essential infrastructure that must remain open. Under the order, the government will provide additional protective gear for employees as well as guidance, according to a person familiar with the action who spoke about the order before it was signed by the president,\" Taylor Telford, Kimberly Kindy and Jacob Bogage report.</p><p>\"Worker safety experts say such an order would prevent local health officials from ordering meat companies to use their the most effective weapon available to protect their employees from the coronavirus - closures. They also fear that it would also undercut newly issued federal health guidelines designed to put space between plant workers.\"</p><p>             The White House is also mulling aid to help energy companies: \"In conversations with independent analysts, senior administration officials have floated a variety of ideas including the imposition of tariffs on imported crude oil; purchasing oil in the ground and leaving it there until prices rebound; providing cash in return for equity stakes in faltering companies; and creating a government lending program similar to one for the airline industry,\" Steven Mufson reports.</p><p>\"The Federal Reserve could provide backing to some oil companies, just as it is doing with other businesses short on credit. The president could also try to build on his diplomatic work to persuade Saudi Arabia to divert some of the tankers heading this way. Saudi Arabia has announced cutbacks in production effective May 1, but the decision to send these tankers to the United States was made a month ago when the Saudis were still trying to flood the global markets in a dispute with Russia.\"</p><p>             In the U.S.:          </p><p>             Corporate impact:          </p><p>             Around the world:          </p><p>             The House will stay home for now.          </p><p>             The chamber scuttled plans to return after a backlash from some lawmakers: \"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Tuesday she had 'no choice' but to heed warnings from Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician of Congress, that bringing the chamber back for routine work after more than six weeks of limited operation would place lawmakers and support staff at heightened risk,\" Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report.</p><p>\"[Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell has chosen to accept the risk, bringing senators back for work starting with a Monday evening vote on Trump's nominee for inspector general of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Two days later, the Senate Judiciary Committee plans to hold a confirmation hearing for Justin Walker, a McConnell protege nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\"</p><p>             A House lawmaker announced a third-party presidential bid.          </p><p>             Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) will seek the Libertarian Party's nomination: \"Amash, who turned 40 this month, was elected in the 2010 tea party wave and grew increasingly distant from Republicans as the decade went on, fending off a primary challenge from a business-backed conservative in 2014. He was deeply critical of Trump's 2016 campaign, and even more critical of what the GOP did with control of the legislative and executive branches,\" David Weigel reports.</p><p>\"In 2019, Amash became the only Republican to call for Trump's impeachment. Not long after, he left the party and continued to vote against spending bills, while opposing many White House priorities. He faced a tough reelection in his Grand Rapids, Mich.-based district, with Republicans and Democrats both filing against him.\"</p><p>Boeing encounters another probe over the 737 Max.          </p><p>             The company faces a number of previously unreported investigations: \"Boeing Co. faces criminal and civil scrutiny into years of widespread quality-control lapses on its 737 MAX assembly line, according to people familiar with the details, potentially exposing the plane maker to greater legal liability than previously anticipated by industry and government officials,\" WSJ's Andy Pasztor and Andrew Tangel report.</p><p>\"The inquiries build on a federal grand-jury investigation into hazardously designed flight-control systems, these people said. As part of the expanded probes, Justice Department prosecutors and federal air-safety regulators have been scrutinizing potentially significant safety problems stemming from 737 MAX production missteps.\"</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Thursday:          </p><p>             Friday:          </p><p>             Saturday:          </p><p>             From The Post's Tom Toles:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-894b624444de45e391e96e4b73ef71e1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSP-WBK1-JB4M-V4F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2350\"/><timeReceived>12:04 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

He argued that an economically resurgent America lifts the world, and he invited the heads of foreign-based corporate giants in the audience to participate. \"There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States,\" he said. (Read more from my colleague Anne Gearan who was on the scene here.)          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The president also underlined his administration's intent to drive a harder line enforcing trade rules - a pledge given weight by his decision earlier this week to slap tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines. \"We support free trade but it needs to be fair, and it needs to be reciprocal because in the end unfair trade undermines us all,\" Trump said. \"The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning.\"\u00a0</p><p>             But notably, the president\u00a0also signaled a willingness to deal, including potentially reopening negotiations toward a Trans Pacific Partnership - the massive, 12-nation deal he railed against on the campaign trail and formally iced as soon as he took office.\u00a0</p><p>My colleague Heather Long reports that ears of\u00a0some in attendance perked up at that:\u00a0</p><p>             The relatively brief address came as an anticlimax. Trump's appearance had hung like a question mark in the thin Swiss air this week: Financiers, corporate chiefs and foreign leaders all tried to guess at what the first president to attend the gathering since 2000 intended to say both with his visit and during it -\u00a0and how it would play in this sanctum of the international order he's reveled in shredding.\u00a0</p><p>             But the suspense drained as the conference wore on.          </p><p>The unusually large delegation of administration officials that preceded Trump here made clear that the president\u00a0intended to lead with a solicitation for investment in the United States. Plus, the business class here revealed they are anything but hostile to most of Trump's\u00a0economic agenda, hailing his cuts to taxes and regulation as a potentially transformative catalyst for growth both within the United States\u00a0and beyond. (Fourth-quarter economic growth dipped slightly below 3 percent - a point of pride for the president over the previous two quarters - according to figures released while he was on stage. That means growth for the first year of his presidency came to 2.3 percent.)</p><p>             Rumors of walkouts during Trump's\u00a0speech that circulated over the course of the week didn't amount to much: My colleagues here counted only two protesters, both American. Inside the hall, Trump received mostly polite applause -\u00a0and some scattered hisses when he referred to \"fake\" news:          </p><p>One of the protesters, via The Post's Danielle Paquette:\u00a0</p><p>             But the thrust of Trump's speech -\u00a0his declaration that the country he leads is \"open for business,\" placed him within the mainstream of the heads of state who took their turns before him this week. The conference featured a heavy contingent - including India's Narendra Modi, Germany's Angela Merkel, France's Emmanuel Macron, UK's Theresa May and Canada's Justin Trudeau.\u00a0</p><p>And while they placed their emphasis differently, talking up the need to resist populist calls for walling off the world, they also made similarly commercial appeals for their own countries. In that, Macron made the grandest gesture, attempting to upstage Davos itself by gathering 140 CEOs on their way to the conference for a dinner at the palace of Versailles to make his pitch.\u00a0</p><p>             \"Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests, as president of the United States, I will always protect the interests of our country, our companies, and our workers,\" Trump said. His boosterism may have sounded, as one observer back in the U.S. emailed me, \"more like an IPO roadshow than a head of state speech.\"</p><p>It befit a week in which roaring markets drowned out much of the international anxiety surrounding Trump's leadership.\u00a0</p><p>             PROGRAMMING NOTE: I'll be back in Washington next week, and The Finance 202 will come out at its regularly scheduled time of roughly 8a.m. I hope you've enjoyed my special coverage -- please continue to read and if you are not already, sign up here.</p><p>             \"FAKE NEWS\" MAKES DAVOS APPEARANCE:          </p><p>- Trump team in Davos wakes up to bombshell report. This\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story (quickly matched by The Post) detailing Trump's aborted attempt last June to fire special counsel Robert Mueller broke in the 2 a.m. hour local time. The president faced shouted questions about it from the press as he arrived at the conference center this morning:</p><p>Per the NYT's Peter Baker, Trump called the stories \"fake news:\"</p><p>Watch Trump here:\u00a0</p><p>             SOROS SOUNDS OFF:\u00a0          </p><p>The legendary currency trader and billionaire\u00a0liberal bankroller\u00a0delivered a scorching critique\u00a0of Trump in a Thursday night speech to guests at his annual Davos dinner. He also lit into tech giants - and cryptocurrency.\u00a0</p><p>- On Trump: \"Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Putin's Russia, are on the rise. In the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state but he can't, because the Constitution, other institutions, and a vibrant civil society won't allow it.</p><p>             And yet: \"Clearly, I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world. But I regard it as a purely temporary phenomenon that will disappear in 2020, or even sooner. I give President Trump credit for motivating his core supporters brilliantly, but for every core supporter, he has created a greater number of core opponents who are equally strongly motivated. That is why I expect a Democratic landslide in 2018.\"</p><p>- On big tech: \"As Facebook and Google have grown into ever more powerful monopolies, they have become obstacles to innovation, and they have caused a variety of problems of which we are only now beginning to become aware... They claim they are merely distributing information. But the fact that they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulations, aimed at preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open universal access.\"</p><p>- On cryptocurrency (in response to a question): \"Cryptocurrency is a misnomer, and it's a typical bubble, which is always based on some misunderstanding,\" Soros said. \"Bitcoin is not a currency. A currency is supposed to be a stable source of value. A currency that can float 25% in a day can't be used to pay wages. So, it's a speculation based on a misunderstanding.\"</p><p>             - Trump arrived at the conference around 2:45 p.m. local time yesterday. He kicked off his visit by huddling with United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May, followed by a meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Then he hosted more than a dozen top European corporate executives for dinner, during which he pitched the U.S. as an investment opportunity. Today, before his speech, Trump held back-to-back meetings with the Rwandan and Swiss presidents.</p><p>             - Guess who came to dinner. Here's who was on the guest list:\u00a0</p><p>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson...Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen...\u00a0National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster... National Economic Council director Gary Cohn... Adidas's\u00a0Kasper Rorsted... Siemens AG's Joe Kaeser...\u00a0Thyssenkrupp AG's\u00a0Heinrich Hiesinger... Statoil ASA's\u00a0Eldar Saetre...

ABB Ltd's\u00a0Ulrich Spiesshofer...          </p><p>The original list had some typos (\"Martian:\")</p><p>Total's Pouyanne tweeted following the dinner:\u00a0</p><p>Here's a clip from the dinner:</p><p>NBC News's Monica Alba noted Tillerson arrived late, and waited on the sidelines before joining the table:\u00a0</p><p>             - All the President's\u00a0Friends:Bloomberg' Stephanie Baker, Caleb Melby and Jackie Gu pulled together\u00a0the\u00a0tangled web of \"the most important friends, frenemies and business associates that Trump and [senior adviser Jared Kushner] could encounter in Davos:</p><p>             MORE ON THE MNUCHIN\u00a0DOLLAR MELT:          </p><p>             -\u00a0Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin created a firestorm here by suggesting the Trump administration endorses a weak dollar, since it would make American exports cheaper to foreign buyers and thereby boost exports. The comments broke with decades of official U.S government support for a strong dollar - and prompted criticism from economists and market watchers that the statement could undermine confidence in a range of assets, including the Treasury market.</p><p>             The Times's Baker explained the tempest this way: \"His name now appears on the dollar bill. But that does not mean it is safe for him to actually talk about the dollar ...\u00a0Treasury Secretary\u00a0Steven Mnuchin\u00a0got a searing reminder of that this week when an apparently offhand comment, that a weak dollar benefits American trade, helped plunge the currency to\u00a0a three-year low\u00a0and touched off a flurry of speculation about the Trump administration's economic plans ...\u00a0If the United States were reversing more than two decades of policy, as some feared Mr. Mnuchin's comment indicated, it could initiate a return to the currency wars that once roiled the global economy.</p><p>             But Mr. Mnuchin insisted on Thursday that was not the case. He meant his previous remark only as a statement of fact, not an objective of the administration or another tool in Mr. Trump's war against what he considers unfair practices by America's trading partner ... 'I thought my comment on the dollar was actually quite clear yesterday,'\u00a0he told reporters hours before Mr. Trump arrived in Davos. 'I thought it was actually balanced and consistent with what I've said before, which is we're not concerned with where the dollar is in the short term, it's a very, very liquid market, and we believe in free currencies. And that there's both advantages and disadvantages of where the dollar is in the short term. Let me say, I thought that was clear.'\"</p><p>             NOT PLAYING WELL:          </p><p>             - Even with Mnuchin's boss.Trump told CNBC Mnuchin's comment was \"taken out of context.\" \"I read his exact statement and I'll tell you where I stand,\" he said. \"Number one I don't like talking about it because frankly nobody should be talking about it, it should be what it is. It should be based on the strength of the country.... The dollar is going to get stronger and stronger, and ultimately I want to see a strong dollar.\"</p><p>             - European Central Bank's Mario Draghi says Mnuchin's not playing by the rules.Bloomberg:\u00a0\"Draghi attacked the U.S. Treasury Secretary's comments on the dollar, saying he isn't playing by the rules. Speaking in Frankfurt on Thursday, Draghi said the recent euro-dollar moves are partly down to [Mnuchin]'s intervention, saying: The exchange rate has moved 'In part due to exogenous reasons that have to do with communication. But not by the ECB, but by someone else. This someone else's communication doesn't comply with the agreed terms of references.'\"</p><p>             - IMF's Lagarde wants an explanation: \"International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde had earlier called for Mnuchin to explain his remarks and reminded him that the dollar's value is set by the market. For good measure she added that now is not the time for a currency war. 'The dollar is of all currencies a floating currency and one where value is determined by markets and geared by the fundamentals of U.S. policy, Lagarde said in a Bloomberg Television interview.\"\u00a0</p><p>             - JPMorgan Chase's Frenkel warns of currency war. \"Among those who've raised the alarm are Jacob Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International. 'We should prevent it at all costs,' he said. 'A currency war in the monetary sphere is the mirror image of protectionism in the real sphere. We should have a mindset of openness in all dimensions.'</p><p>             -\u00a0 Larry Summers calls it bad form and bad policy: \"What is wrong with this picture? Style, first. Previous Treasury secretaries had little to say about the dollar. What they have said has been carefully scripted and oriented to long-term soundness. They insisted on being their administration's sole spokesman on foreign exchange issue. Mnuchin spoke without a script, began with near-term commercial considerations, and was apparently contradicted by the Commerce secretary. None of this can be reassuring to those looking to judge the competence and credibility of the Trump administration.\"</p><p>             - Trump rebuts \"false rumors\" about relationship with\u00a0 May.Fox News's Adam Shaw: \"The two leaders spoke [in Davos], where they downplayed rumors that their relationship had become frosty amid a number of high-profile controversies... '[ May] and myself have had a really great relationship, although some people don't necessarily believe that. But I can tell you it's true,' Trump told reporters. 'I have a tremendous respect for the prime minister and the job she's doing. And I think the feeling is mutual from the standpoint of liking each other a lot....We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military. We have the same ideas, the same ideals,' he said before turning to speak to May directly.</p><p>             'There's nothing that would happen to you that we won't be there to fight for you.' May was similarly glowing in her praise of what she called a 'really special relationship between the U.K. and the United States....In fact... stronger because we both face the same challenges across the world, and as you say, we're working together to meet those challenges,'\"</p><p>             - Trump also predicted improved trade relations with the country.BBC: \"... Trump said: 'One thing that will be taking place over a number of years will be trade. Trade is going to increase many times... We look forward to that and we are starting that process, pretty much as we speak.' Mrs. May replied...'Alongside that working for a good trade relationship for the future which will be for both our benefits, so the UK and the US both do well out of this - and it's been great to see you today.'\"</p><p>             - Mnuchin revived trade talks, too.BBC's Kamal Ahmed:\u00a0\"Mr.\u00a0Mnuchin said Britain would still be at the 'front of the queue' for a bilateral free trade deal following the exit from the European Union. 'As soon as the UK is ready we will be prepared to negotiate an attractive trade deal,' he told the BBC in Davos.\"</p><p>             - Post-Davos plans to visit UK in the works.\u00a0BuzzFeed's Jim Waterson and Ben Smith: \"Officials are currently 'finalising the details' of a visit, with no confirmation on where the US president will visit, or whether it will be a full state visit where he is hosted by Queen Elizabeth. Trump accepted the offer of a state visit to the UK in his first week as president, a rare honour for a US leader who has only just taken office. But a year later no date has been set for the visit, amid reports he was worried about negative coverage in the British press and potential protests.\"</p><p>             - May no longer a big Davos draw?\u00a0The Guardian's Larry Elliot: \"A\u00a0year on from her Davos debut as prime minister, May is a much diminished figure in the eyes of the people who run the UK's biggest companies. Downing Street considered May's 24 hours in Davos a success: she delivered a serious speech; she spent the morning in private conversations about the importance of new technology; she was the\u00a0first leader to hold a bilateral with [Trump]; and there were no embarrassing moments.</p><p>But something was not quite right.... Twelve months ago, May was a big draw in Davos. It was seven months after the Brexit vote and the UK had yet to trigger article 50....A year on, the hall was only two-thirds full to hear May speak, and her 30-minute address was considered worthy but dull. Most leaders prefer to sit on stage in an armchair while Klaus Schwab, the founder of Davos, butters them up. May opted for the formal approach, waiting off stage until Schwab had finished his spiel.\"</p><p>             - Meanwhile, Trump\u00a0not off the hook for his 'shithole' comments.The Post's Paul Schemm: \"If President Trump was hoping that the rancor provoked by his reported comment about Africa's 'shithole countries' had dissipated, the African Union's top official made clear Thursday that it was still very much on everyone's mind. The semi-annual meeting of African heads of state at the African Union begins Sunday. Speaking to African foreign ministers preparing for the summit, the African Union commission chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat said Africa was not happy with the U.S. president.... Among his many meetings [in Davos], [Trump]\u00a0will encounter Paul Kagame, president of Rwanda and a key player on the African continent.\"</p><p>             More from CNN: \"National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster confirmed that Trump will meet Kagame, according to CNN's Jake Tapper.\u00a0It's unclear whether Trump will meet other African leaders at Davos, but President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa are among the attendees.\"</p><p>             - African delegates planned to protest\u00a0Trump's speech: Swissinfo.ch: \"African delegates are planning to boycott [Trump's] closing speech ... Business Leadership Africa CEO Bonang Mohale, a Davos attendee, penned an open letter before the WEF meeting, urging people to turn their backs on Trump when he arrives at WEF...\u00a0'Many of us will be boycotting your address to delegates at Davos in protest against your divisive comments and continued failure to unequivocally apologise. We encourage likeminded peers to do the same.'\"</p><p>             - Ross talks automation.The Post's Danielle Paquette: \"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Thursday that the rise of automation will not significantly diminish jobs in the United States, and that the country will double down on retraining efforts to help workers who have been displaced by robots. 'Technology doesn't just shrink jobs,' he told reporters gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 'It changes the nature of jobs.' Ross invoked skeptics of the past who also feared shifts in the way people work - Luddites trying to keep factories from opening,' he called them.\"</p><p>             THE SCENE          </p><p>Bloomberg's Shannon Pettypiece\u00a0on the view from the president's ride into Davos:\u00a0</p><p>BuzzFeed's Ryan Broderick on his favorite moment:\u00a0</p><p>Here's what's on a mountainside near the conference:\u00a0</p><p>Spotted via NBC News's Vaughn Hillyard:\u00a0</p><p>             Here are some of the\u00a0highlights from Davos\u00a0of events you might want to attend\u00a0(all times local):          </p><p>             Today          </p><p>See Trump arrived in Switzerland:</p><p>Trump says he \"would certainly apologize\" for his Britan First retweet in a Piers Morgan interview (though it's rather qualified, see for yourself:)</p><p>How global companies are adjusting to rising nationalism:</p><p>See this nutella riot break out in a French supermarket:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-27b664a348014c6db9db1106d95b48e3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RH1-2FN1-DXKP-J2DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3297\"/><timeReceived>3:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 26, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is feeling\u00a0the heat from her rise in the polls: She parried\u00a0attacks in last night's debate from across the field on\u00a0her go-big policy plans - including a soak-the-rich wealth tax that's been central to her campaign.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren took incoming on a number of fronts, including her support for Medicare for all, her call for breaking up tech giants, and her foreign policy credentials. (See the full debate transcript here.) But it was her call for a 2 percent tax on households with assets worth more than $50 million that brought some of the sharpest jabs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proposal - which would add another 1 percent levy for net worths greater than $1 billion - has set off alarms among the Democratic donor class. On the debate stage, some of Warren's competitors took aim at it as practically unworkable or too politically polarizing.\u00a0          </p><p>             \"Sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions,\" former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) said.\u00a0          </p><p>The accusation highlights the animating tension in the field between more populist candidates and moderates: Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are\u00a0pushing for a structural overhaul of the economy while many of the others\u00a0are focused on more incremental change. (O'Rourke, for his part, said a wealth tax would be part of a solution before going on offense.)</p><p>             Warren sought to change the tenor of the debate over the wealth tax:\u00a0\"My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax,\" Warren said, nodding to the fact that Sanders has introduced a wealth tax of his own. \"It's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\"          </p><p>The comment elicited some protest from her fellow contenders. \"No one is supporting billionaires,\" former vice president Joe Biden said. And Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) fired back that Warren needed a \"reality check\" because \"no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires.\"</p><p>             Warren on the campaign trail has emphasized that her levy would raise an estimated $2.75 trillion from roughly 75,000 families. When she rolled it out, she pitched it as a means of rebalancing the concentration of wealth, which she framed as a threat to our democracy itself. Crowds at her rallies now chant \"Two cents!\" to voice their support for it.\u00a0          </p><p>             But on the debate stage, Warren\u00a0said she was \"really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive.\"          </p><p>\"Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires,\" said Warren, who describes herself as a \"capitalist to my bones.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"My problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you,\" she continued. \"But you built that fortune in America. I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to markets on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for. And all I'm saying is, you make it to the top, the top 0.1 percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.\"</p><p>             Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, the political newcomer who has elbowed his way into contention by touting his pitch for a universal basic income, criticized Warren's plan as unworkable. \"The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected,\" he said. \"If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from?\"</p><p>             Warren and Yang also clashed over their theories of the culprit behind\u00a0growing income inequality. Yang's campaign is staked on the idea that automation has displaced millions of American jobs, especially for blue-collar and middle class workers,\u00a0and will only get worse. Warren laid the blame at free trade deals that benefited multinational corporations at the expense of workers.\u00a0          </p><p>But the candidates didn't dig into the essence of the divide between Warren and her moderate rivals until the end of the debate. The attacks on the Massachusetts liberal shared a theme that Biden distilled: That Warren's plans are too ambitious to stand a chance of becoming law. \"I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\" Biden said. \"We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done?\"</p><p>             Warren responded by pointing to her role in establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Agency in the wake of the financial crisis. \"All of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try, because you will never get it passed,\" she said. \"And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law.\"</p><p>             Biden countered he had played a role, too, since he \"went on the floor and got you votes.\"          </p><p>             Warren offered him no thanks. \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\" she said. \"People told me, 'Go for something little;\u00a0go for something small;\u00a0go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept.' I said, 'No, let's go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.' And President Obama said, 'I will fight for that,' and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration.\"</p><p>You are reading              The Finance 202          , our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.</p><p>- Global economy on track for weakest growth since crisis. WSJ's Josh Zumbrun: \"Global growth is expected to slow to 3% this year, according to new estimates from the International Monetary Fund, down from an estimate of 3.2% in July. As recently as 2017, the global economy was growing at a 3.8% pace. The IMF attributed the sharp slowdown over the past two years primarily to rising trade barriers that have stunted manufacturing and investment around the world...</p><p> \"As the year has progressed,\u00a0trade has slowed more sharply\u00a0than forecasters had expected earlier in the year... Mounting signs of a slowdown have\u00a0alarmed global economic policy makers, many of whom are traveling to Washington this week for the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. At the top of their agenda is what can be done about a global-growth slowdown.\"</p><p>- Brexit talks stall. Bloomberg's Ian Wishart and co.: \"British and European Union officials are growing increasingly pessimistic about the chances of securing a Brexit deal in time for this week's summit amid growing resistance from Boris Johnson's Northern Irish allies. Johnson is struggling to win the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose votes will be crucial if Johnson is to get his agreement through parliament. The DUP is objecting to concessions Johnson has offered to secure a deal with the EU, among them putting a customs border in the Irish sea...</p><p> \"If a deal isn't sealed and approved by the British Parliament by Saturday, then Britain will once again be pitched into a constitutional crisis that could result in a chaotic no-deal exit. Johnson will be told to seek an extension to EU membership, but he has sworn not to delay Brexit further and a legal battle will probably follow.\"</p><p>-\u00a0       Earnings season is off to a great start:\u00a0 \"The unofficial start to earnings season is off to a bullish beginning with companies like UnitedHealth, Johnson &amp; Johnson and J.P. Morgan Chase all blowing past analysts' expectations, easing concerns that the China-U.S. trade battle would derail the economy,\" CNBC's\u00a0Maggie Fitzgerald reports.</p><p> \"Of the 11\u00a0S&amp;P 500\u00a0companies that reported earnings before the bell Tuesday, only two [Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs] missed Wall Street's estimates ...\u00a0Earnings for the\u00a0S&amp;P 500\u00a0are expected to decline by 4.6% for the third quarter, after growing by more than 3% in the second quarter, according to FactSet. This trend has not played out so far this season.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>- Is China really going to follow through with ag purchases?\u00a0WSJ's Chao\u00a0Deng and Lingling Wei: \"Despite a Chinese\u00a0promise to buy more\u00a0U.S. farm products, questions remain over how much, the time frame for purchases, and what the U.S. might have to give in return. Beijing is pushing the U.S. to drop plans to impose new 15% tariffs on $156 billion in consumer goods starting Dec. 15 and could use the farm purchases as leverage.</p><p> \"Chinese negotiators continue to say purchases must be based on actual demand and at fair-market prices, according to people briefed by the matter. The roughly $50 billion in\u00a0farm products touted by President Trump is far beyond what China has historically spent and would likely require Beijing to lean heavily on its state-owned firms to accomplish.\"</p><p>China threatens retaliation over Hong Kong bill.\u00a0Bloomberg's Iain Marlow and co.: \"China threatened unspecified 'strong countermeasures'\u00a0if the U.S. Congress enacts legislation supporting Hong Kong protesters, in a sign of the deepening strain between the world's two largest economies as they attempt to seal a trade deal. China's foreign ministry\u00a0issued the warning\u00a0Wednesday after the U.S. House\u00a0passed\u00a0a package of measures backing a pro-democracy movement that has rocked the former British colony for more than four months.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Paging Mr. Barron, John Barron:\u00a0 \"In almost all of his past books on China and economic issues, [Trump's] top trade adviser Peter Navarro has cited a supposed Harvard scholar and investor named 'Ron Vara'\u00a0often nicknamed the 'Dark Prince of Disaster'\u00a0offering bombastic, colorful commentary on China,\" Business Insider's\u00a0Grace Panetta\u00a0reports.</p><p> \"There's just one problem:\u00a0according to a new report in the Chronicle Review, \"Ron Vara\" himself doesn't exist, and appears to be an alter ego for Navarro himself. After all, 'Ron Vara'\u00a0is simply the word 'Navarro'\u00a0rearranged ...\u00a0In response to the Chronicle, Navaro characterized Vara as Alfred Hitchcock-like character and said it was 'refreshing that somebody finally figured out an inside joke that has been hiding in plain sight for years.'\"\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0Authorities pull\u00a0             DreamWorks\u00a0animated film over Chinese map scene: \"No movie, apparently, is cute enough to be immune from thorny international politics,\" the New York Times's\u00a0Daniel Victor reports.\u00a0</p><p> \"The news media in Vietnam reported on Monday that the authorities had pulled 'Abominable,'\u00a0a DreamWorks animated film about a Chinese girl who befriends a yeti, from theaters over a scene that shows a map of China. The map includes China's so-called\u00a0nine-dash line, which dips far down into the South China Sea - an audacious and hotly disputed claim to territory that Vietnam and other countries say is theirs.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Pence cancels event to promote\u00a0USMCA\u00a0for Turkey trip: \"Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Wisconsin this week has been replaced by a trip to Turkey,\" local WISN TV reports. \"It was to be the seventh in a series put on by America First Policies.\u00a0Pence's event will be rescheduled for Oct. 23, the group said.\" Trump said Pence will be leading a group of U.S. officials to seek a ceasefire.</p><p>             TRUMP WATCH          </p><p>-\u00a0       Turkey bank faces charges as Syria fight continues: \"The U.S. brought a criminal case against one of Turkey's largest banks for aiding a scheme to evade sanctions against Iran, a move that carries political overtones as tensions build over Turkey's military incursions in Syria,\" Bloomberg's\u00a0Greg Farrell and Christian Berthelsen report.</p><p> \"In an indictment filed ... in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors accused government-owned\u00a0Halkbank\u00a0of participating in a wide-ranging plot to violate prohibitions on Iran's access to the U.S. financial system. The conspiracy involved high-ranking government officials in Iran and Turkey, the U.S. said ...\u00a0The Turkish lira fell almost 1% after the charges were announced. It's down 4.5% so far this month, more than any of the 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.\"</p><p>-\u00a0       The GM strike may be ending soon: \"General Motors Co. and the United Auto Workers union were near a deal ... to end a 30-day strike that has cost the automaker about $2 billion after Chief Executive Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss took part in contract talks, according to two people briefed on the matter,\" Reuters's\u00a0David Shepardson reports.</p><p> \"While a final agreement has not been announced, the No. 1 U.S. automaker and the union have agreed to terms on most issues but were finalizing the wording on some matters, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks were ongoing. A deal will likely be announced on Wednesday.\"</p><p>-\u00a0       The fallout from LeBron's comments and the NBA's Hong Kong row:\u00a0 \"As divisive remarks by LeBron James inflame the NBA's already strained relations with its business partners in China, the league is likely concerned that its most marketable player has-for now-become its most controversial,\" Sports Illustrated's Michael McCann reports. \"The league knows that the manner in which the China situation ultimately plays out will impact the NBA's global brand, not only in China but also in the United States and with the international companies with whom the league does business.\"</p><p> \"Over the last 24 hours, James has been widely panned for seemingly prioritizing financial goals-be they his own or those of the league and players-over democratic ideals. Twitter users have created\u00a0memes\u00a0that mock James as a tool of the Chinese government. Protesters in Hong Kong have gone so far as to\u00a0burn replicas\u00a0of his Lakers jersey.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Warren pledges to turn down money from Wall Street and tech execs: Warren \"took another stance against Big Tech and Wall Street firms ... by pledging to turn down large contributions from their executives,\" CNBC's\u00a0Lauren Feiner\u00a0and\u00a0Tucker Higgins reports.</p><p> \"Warren\u00a0announced on her campaign website\u00a0that she will decline contributions over $200 from executives at Big Tech companies, large banks, private equity firms or hedge funds. After previously pledging not to take large contributions from pharmaceutical executives, Warren's announcement on Tuesday expanded the umbrella of forbidden donors.\"</p><p>- Nellie Liang: Deregulation threatens to exacerbate\u00a0financial instability. The former top Fed official warns in a Brookings Institution piece that systemic risks are rising:\u00a0\"The reason: financial regulations are being relaxed at the same time as the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates to offset risks from heightened trade tensions.\u00a0 This is not a good combination at this point in the business cycle. It greatly increases the risk that the next recession, whenever it occurs, will be severe because it will be amplified by elevated financial imbalances...\u00a0</p><p> \"Given current conditions, regulators should be ensuring the strength of the financial sector to withstand future risks, not weaken it, but that is not what is happening in the U.S.\u00a0 Recent moves to ease regulations suggest financial stability risks are at an inflection point.\u00a0 Incentives to leverage will continue to rise as interest rates remain low amid a global search for yield. \u00a0Vulnerabilities that have been \"moderate\" could escalate quickly to \"elevated\", as they did in the lead up to the 2007 - 2008 crisis.\"</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Thursday:          </p><p>             Friday:\u00a0          </p><p>From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Mike Luckovich:\u00a0</p><p>- The Washington Nationals are World Series-bound!\u00a0Much of official Washington spent Tuesday night flipping back and forth between the Democratic debate and Game Four of the National League Championship Series.

Now, a top tech lobbyist tells me, industries nursing grudges against tech giants - from movie studios to pharmaceutical companies - are eyeing the trafficking bill as a foot in the door and considering how to further tweak the law to their advantage. \"For years, the tech companies have said 'We're just platforms, and you have to take the good with the bad,' \" the lobbyist said. \"Those days are over. People are too pissed off here in Washington.\"\u00a0</p><p>The FTC investigation poses a more immediate threat to <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>The Washington Post's Tony Romm and Craig Timberg lay out the stakes:\u00a0</p><p>\"At issue for the company - and at the heart of the FTC probe - is a settlement they reached with the agency in November 2011, ending an investigation that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>deceived users about the privacy protections they are afforded on the site. Among other requirements, the resulting consent decree mandated that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>must notify users and obtain their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established...\u00a0</p><p> \"Recently, though, former FTC officials have said that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>entanglement with Cambridge Analytica may have violated the company's legal agreement with the federal watchdog agency ... About 270,000 users downloaded Cambridge Analytica's app. But the firm was able to obtain personal information about their friends, who likely had no knowledge that their data was being collected. Roughly 50 million people may have been affected. If the FTC ultimately finds that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>broke that agreement, it could fine the company $40,000 for each violation.\"             </p><p>A <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>privacy officer said the company remains \"strongly committed to protecting people's information\" and appreciates \"the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.\"\u00a0</p><p>             New reporting suggests the company's problems restricting access to user data go well beyond Cambridge Analytica. \"<person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>loose approach to policing how app creators and others deployed its user data persisted for years, including after a 2015 effort by the social network to restrict access, according to court documents and people familiar with <person><nameText>Facebook,</nameText></person>\" The Wall Street Journal's Deepa Seetharaman and Kirsten Grind write. \"Although <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had rules stating the terms under which developers could accumulate data, it appeared not to be able to ensure its rules were being followed... In interviews, developers said <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>officials were sometimes unclear about how developers could use the data they gathered from the platform.\"</p><p>From AEI's Jim Pethokoukis:\u00a0</p><p>             As the crisis mounts, the company's leaders are still weirdly absent from the scene - and not only in public. The Daily Beast's Spencer Ackerman reports that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>decided against facing his employees at an internal briefing Tuesday to explain the company's role in the Cambridge Analytica mess: \"Instead, the session was conducted by a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>attorney, Paul Grewal,\" Ackerman writes. \"That was the same approach the company used on Capitol Hill this past fall, when it sent its top attorney, Colin Stretch, to brief Congress about the prevalence of Russian propaganda, to include paid ads and inauthentic accounts, on its platform. Nor...\u00a0did chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg attend the internal town hall.\"</p><p>The silence from the C-suite may end soon. \"Top-level executives are becoming ever more frustrated over [<person><nameText>Zuckerberg] </nameText></person>not speaking more publicly on many of the complicated issues that have plagued the company in the last year,\" CNN's Laurie Segall reports. And Axios's\u00a0Mike Allen\u00a0this morning reports <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>will speak out in the next 24 hours\u00a0with \"remarks will be aimed at rebuilding trust.\" The chief executive\u00a0\"wanted to say something meaningful rather than just rushing out.\"          </p><p>             Regardless,\u00a0Zuckerberg faces\u00a0mounting calls to testify both on Capitol Hill and in the U.K.          </p><p>Here was Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee,\u00a0on Tuesday:\u00a0</p><p>Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee poked <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>too. \"\"I think that we ought to have the head of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>not their lawyer, not their number two, but their number one, come... state if they're really prepared to lead the industry to some controls that prevent all this from happening,\" she told reporters Tuesday. Feinstein said the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>founder needs to offer assurances that the company will do more to protect people's privacy - otherwise Congress will step in.</p><p>Politico's Kyle Cheney:\u00a0</p><p>-Fed meets, then Powell meets the press.CNBC's Patti Domm: \"Fed officials are expected to raise interest rates Wednesday, but it's not clear they will do much to resolve the debate in markets about how many more hikes are coming this year or next. The Fed has forecast three hikes for this year, but some economists expect it to add another. The market has priced in three hikes, but the question is whether Federal Reserve officials will signal a fourth when they release their latest forecasts Wednesday afternoon. That could result in a jump in bond yields and a stock market sell-off. One thing the markets do seem to agree on is that the tone of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's first meeting will be decidedly hawkish, and the Fed will reinforce that it sees an improved economy and it plans to continue raising interest rates.\"</p><p>- Closing in on a spending deal. Politico's Burgess Everett and co.: \"Congressional leaders are racing to finalize a spending bill by the end of Tuesday but find themselves still at odds over a host of controversial issues - delaying plans to unveil the proposal and raising the prospect of weekend votes to avoid a shutdown. Democrats, Republicans and the White House battled late into the night Monday and into Tuesday afternoon over whether to include provisions on President Donald Trump's border wall, a massive New York infrastructure project and the special counsel's Russia investigation, according to lawmakers and aides in both parties. There were still a number of unresolved issues as of Tuesday evening, and multiple sources were pessimistic that negotiators would reach a deal in time to release the bill before Wednesday. Asked how confident he was that the Senate would avoid weekend work, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) replied: 'I'm not real confident at this point.'\"</p><p>From AP's Andy Taylor this morning:\u00a0</p><p>- Senate to House: Take the\u00a0Crapo bill. WSJ's Andrew Ackerman: \"Senators are pressing House lawmakers not to jeopardize what they see as their best opportunity to ease postcrisis financial regulations, urging them to quickly pass bipartisan Senate legislation without making changes... Senate Banking Committee members in private meetings have said there is little political appetite in the Senate to vote on a revised version of the legislation. House lawmakers are reviewing the bill, which passed the Senate last week 67-31, and deciding whether to open it up for changes. Any additions to the bipartisan deal, which received support from 17 members of the Democratic caucus, would require the Senate to vote on it again.\"</p><p>             Fed still reigns supreme. Bloomberg's Jesse Hamilton: \"The financial industry has been jubilant since the Senate passed a GOP rollback of banking rules last week. But even if the Dodd-Frank overhaul clears the House, U.S. lenders will remain inside a cage built by the Federal Reserve.\u00a0That's because the bill, sponsored by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, doesn't touch the biggest constraint imposed on firms after the 2008 financial crisis: the Fed stress tests known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.\u00a0While the legislation would free two dozen banks with less than $250 billion of assets from some oversight, the CCAR exams mean regulators will still have control over firms' capital buffers and whether they can return profits to shareholders. Another burden the Crapo bill would leave in place is the Fed's insistence that banks keep a stockpile of ready-to-sell assets on hand to meet liquidity needs in an emergency.</p><p>- China tariffs may be delayed. WSJ's Bob Davis: \"The White House is preparing to crack down on what it says are improper Chinese trade practices by making it significantly more difficult for Chinese firms to acquire advanced U.S. technology or invest in American companies, individuals involved in the planning said. The administration plans to release on Thursday a package of proposed punitive measures aimed at China that include tariffs on imports worth at least $30 billion. But the tariffs won't be imposed immediately. Rather, U.S. industry will be given an opportunity to comment on which products should be subject to the duties. As part of the package, the White House will announce possible investment restrictions by Chinese firms in the U.S. and will direct the Treasury Department to outline rules governing investment from China. Final details of the plan, including the amount of imports to be hit by tariffs, remain in flux.\"</p><p>The decision comes as Chinese\u00a0Premier Li Keqiang, the country's second-in-command, struck a conciliatory note in a news conference, saying \"there are no winners\" in a trade war. But investors are rattled, with 30 percent of fund managers in a Bank of America survey naming a trade war as the greatest threat to the markets.</p><p>- America First, G-20 second. The Post's Damian Paletta\u00a0reports from Buenos Aires that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u00a0told his G-20 counterparts that \"the Trump administration would press ahead with a range of trade restrictions on numerous U.S. allies, rebuffing calls to scale back the White House's protectionist agenda despite intensifying resistance and threats of retaliation... Mnuchin parried warnings from other global finance ministers during two days of meetings here, telling them that... Trump is intent on reworking trade barriers in a way that promotes more U.S. exports...\u00a0He wouldn't say how many countries would be exempted from Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, saying that the president would make those decisions speedily.\"</p><p>From Damian:\u00a0</p><p>             No trade consensus. WSJ's Josh Zumbrun,\u00a0Andrea Thomas and,\u00a0Paul Kiernan: \"Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 countries failed to reach a new agreement on trade, amid a deepening split between the U.S. and other major economies over Washington's plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. G-20 summits revolve around writing a communiqu\u00e9 of shared principles on major economic policies. But after two days of negotiations, the closing statement released here Tuesday said G-20 officials \"recognize the need for further dialogue and actions\" on trade and they reaffirmed a set of principles that had been adopted last year at a G-20 summit in Hamburg.\"</p><p>- NAFTA talks take on food labels.NYT's\u00a0Azam Ahmed, Matt Richtel and Andrew Jacobs: \"The contentious negotiations over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement have veered into one of the world's most pressing health issues: fighting obesity. Urged on by big American food and soft-drink companies, the Trump administration is using the trade talks with Mexico and Canada to try to limit the ability of the pact's three members - including the United States - to warn consumers about the dangers of junk food, according to confidential documents outlining the American position. The American stance reflects an intensifying battle among trade officials, the food industry and governments across the hemisphere. The administration's position could help insulate American manufacturers from pressure to include more explicit labels on their products, both abroad and in the United States. But health officials worry that it would also impede international efforts to contain a growing health crisis.\"</p><p>RUSSIA WATCH:\u00a0          </p><p>- Flake uses the I-word. The Post's Bob Costa: \"Sen. Jeff Flake, one of President Trump's most prominent Senate critics, told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday that he would support impeachment proceedings against Trump if the president ends special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election 'without cause.' 'We're begging him: \"Don't go down this road. Don't create a constitutional crisis. Don't force the Congress to take the only remedy that Congress can take,\"'\u00a0said Flake (R-Ariz.). 'To remind the president of that is the best way to keep him from going down that road. To fire Mueller without cause, I don't know if there is any other remedy left to the legislative branch.'\"</p><p>             While McConnell tiptoes. NYT's Sheryl GayStolbergwrites\u00a0while other Republicans responded in some version of real-time to Trump's attacks on Mueller over the weekend, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) remained silent on the matter until Tuesday, when\u00a0\"at his regular weekly news conference, he had little choice. 'I agree with the president's lawyers that Bob Mueller should be allowed to finish his job,'\u00a0he said in his patented monotone, but he added that he did not believe Congress should pass a law to protect the special counsel. 'I don't think Bob Mueller is going anywhere,''\u00a0he said. In what some saw as a subtle message to the president, he called Mr. Mueller 'an excellent appointment,'\u00a0adding, 'I have a lot of confidence in him.'\"</p><p>- Trump ignored aides in congratulating\u00a0Putin. The Post's\u00a0Carol D. Leonnig, David Nakamura and Josh Dawsey: \"Trump did not follow specific warnings from his national security advisers when he congratulated Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin Tuesday on his reelection, including a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating 'DO NOT CONGRATULATE,'\u00a0according to officials familiar with the call. Trump also chose not to heed talking points from aides instructing him to condemn Putin about the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in the United Kingdom with a powerful nerve agent, a case that both the British and U.S. governments have blamed on Moscow.\"</p><p>- Corbat\u00a0clueless with Kushner. Bloomberg's Dakin Campbell: \"Citigroup Inc. said Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat was unaware that the bank was in the process of closing a real estate loan to a Kushner Cos. venture when he met with Jared Kushner. Corbat requested the March 2017 meeting with Kushner, a senior adviser to... Trump, to discuss U.S. trade policy and didn't discuss the loan or any personal business with Kushner Cos., the bank's general counsel said in a letter to four Democratic senators. New York-based Citigroup said the Kushner family has been a client for decades and the loan on a Brooklyn real estate project was made with no input from Corbat.\"</p><p>- When will the recovery end?NYT's Ben Casselman: \"There is no sign that the rebound will end anytime soon. Unemployment is low, job creation is strong and the overall economy seems to be gaining momentum, not losing it. Most economists expect the expansion to continue well into next year, which would make it the longest ever. Many think it could last for years, raising the possibility that President Trump could run for re-election amid the most sustained economic growth in a generation. Even the Federal Reserve's intention to impose three interest-rate increases this year - with the first expected on Wednesday - has done little to cloud the outlook.</p><p> \"But many economists also argue that the seeds of the next crisis are being sown today, even if it is several years before they poke above the surface. Good times are meant to give governments an opportunity to get their fiscal houses in order and address long-term challenges. Instead, the United States is piling on debt and adopting policies - immigration restrictions, increased trade barriers, looser financial regulation - that many economists view as counterproductive.\"</p><p>- Whistleblower lawyer rakes it in. NYT's Randall Smith: \"When Jordan A. Thomas left the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2011, he could have landed a job at a top law firm, likely earning $500,000 or more a year to defend corporations and Wall Street firms in government investigations. But Mr. Thomas had another plan: He wanted to build a law practice representing whistle-blowers seeking to expose corporate wrongdoing. 'People thought I was crazy not to go into a big corporate defense practice where I could make a lot of money,'\u00a0Mr. Thomas said.</p><p> \"Seven years later, his bet is paying off. He has built one of the top legal practices in the country representing corporate whistle-blowers. And because of a program that Mr. Thomas helped create at the S.E.C., in which whistle-blowers can receive a cut of penalties the agency imposes as a result of information they provide, the money is starting to pour into Mr. Thomas's firm. On Monday, the S.E.C. announced two awards totaling $83 million, with the money coming from a fund established by Congress that is financed by the fines paid by violators. Mr. Thomas said three clients of his firm, Labaton Sucharow, would collect the awards for alerting the agency to wrongdoing at Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit, which led to Merrill's paying $415 million to settle the case in June 2016.\"</p><p>             Today          </p><p>             Coming Up          </p><p>From The Post's Tom Toles:\u00a0</p><p>At the National Republican Congressional Committee March dinner, President Trump talked about wanting to call the Republican tax overhaul the \"tax cut, cut, cut bill:\"</p><p>Trump says there's \"no reason\" for the GOP to lose\u00a0the midterms:</p><p>Watch Stephen Colbert on President Trump congratulating\u00a0Vladimir Putin:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-d8a9eb05ee5a4442879e5d5988126d5d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXH-9TG1-JB4M-V0KB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3290\"/><timeReceived>12:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

But as investors signal they expect the Federal Reserve to respond - and President Trump             renews             pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates - Fed Chair Jerome Powell says it will take a longer view.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We'll be watching this carefully,\" Powell yesterday told the House Financial Services Committee. \"What will be the effects on the U.S. economy? Will they be persistent? Will they be material? That's really the question.\" Otherwise, he said the U.S. economy remains in a \"very good place.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His appearance came two days after the global death toll from the disease topped that of the SARS virus in 2002 and 2003. It now stands at 1,115, with more than 45,000 confirmed cases worldwide.</p><p>But the Chinese economy is four times as big as it was during the SARS outbreak, magnifying the global impact of an event that grinds down activity there.\u00a0</p><p>             \"It used to be when the U.S. got a cold, everybody else got the flu,\" and now China may be able to make a similar claim, S&amp;P Global U.S. chief economist Beth Ann Bovino tells me. Shrunken trade as a result of the virus is already costing major shipping firms $350 million a week, for example, and many factories in China remain shuttered or operating at a fraction of their capacity, per the Wall Street Journal's Costas Paris.</p><p>             Powell named the disruption to global supply chains as just one coronavirus consequence that could darken the economic outlook here. Among the others: the             drop-off in Chinese tourism             to the United States, diminished U.S. exports to China, and the ongoing convulsions in financial markets. The Fed chief predicted \"there will very likely be some effects\" on U.S. growth, though he was loath to get specific. \"We have to resist the temptation to speculate on this,\" he said.</p><p>Investors nevertheless are doing their best to assess how the Fed could adjust monetary policy to soften the blow: They see a 42 percent chance of at least one interest-rate cut by June, double the probability they assigned that move just a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.</p><p>             Many macroeconomic forecasters see the virus running its course by spring at the latest, allowing Chinese economic activity to make up most of the ground it has lost and leaving an even smaller mark on the U.S. \"While the markets are apparently convinced that the virus will force the Fed to cut rates again by year-end, the likelihood of a US epidemic now appears low, and we expect the knock-on impact of the disruption in China to shave no more than a few tenths off first-quarter GDP growth,\" Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics, writes in a research note.</p><p>             Yet others are cautioning against jumping to optimistic conclusions. Bovino says an extended crisis that crimps Chinese supply chains, for example, could derail a fragile U.S. manufacturing recovery \u00a0just getting its footing after U.S.-China trade tensions cooled.</p><p>             And David Wilcox, a macroeconomist who until recently served as the Fed's research director, tells me at least \"two dimensions of uncertainty\" are complicating the task of assessing the disease's threat to U.S. growth             - namely, the course of the disease itself and the actions authorities take to fight it.          </p><p>Wilcox, now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, underscored he is not a public health expert. But, he said, \"the progression of the disease has been pretty rapid, and where we are today is pretty different from what I would have expected a month ago. And that makes me cautious about saying where we will be in a month.\"</p><p>For now, he says, \"There is not a factual basis for making an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy. But the presumption should be that this may have a noticeable effect on economic activity, and what will be critical will be to judge just how persistent that effect is.\"</p><p>             But if the virus is still a fixture of news headlines \"six months to a year from now, which is the horizon that's more relevant for monetary policy, we will have a very serious problem on our hands\" of a magnitude that will make Fed interventions irrelevant, Wilcox says. \"The scale of the human tragedy will be very big.\"          </p><p>You are reading              The Finance 202          , our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.</p><p>- Powell also warns Congress on the deficit. The Post's Heather Long writes he told lawmakers that \"now would be a good time to reduce the federal budget deficit, which is expected to top $1 trillion this year. 'Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn,' Powell said in testimony to the House Financial Services Committee.</p><p> \"In past recessions, the Fed has played a large role in reviving the economy by sharply cutting interest rates. But Powell has been warning lawmakers that the central bank won't have much ammunition left to fight the next downturn because interest rates are so low (the benchmark rate is just below 1.75 percent, far below rates above 5 percent in the past). More government spending is likely to be needed to aid the economy in the next recession.\"</p><p>And he had an uncomfortable exchange with Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), who questioned his attendance at a recent party thrown by Amazon CEO (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos:\u00a0</p><p>- Consumer confidence hits two-year highs. Morning Consult's three indices of the sentiment hit levels not seen since early 2018. Per the outlet, \"Consumer confidence surged Friday after the January jobs report beat expectations, climbing 3 points in a single day... U.S. consumers remain largely unfazed by the increasing severity of the coronavirus outbreak - even as economists at the Federal Reserve assess the downside risk to the economy.\" \u00a0</p><p>             Meanwhile, credit card debt just touched a record.WSJ's Yuka Hayashi: \"Credit-card debt rose to a record in the final quarter of 2019 as Americans spent aggressively amid a strong economy and job market, and the proportion of people seriously behind on their payments increased. Total credit-card balances increased by $46 billion to $930 billion, well above the previous peak seen before the 2008 financial crisis, according to data released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Tuesday.</p><p>             Uh oh: \"Some cardholders, particularly younger ones, are running into trouble. The proportion of credit-card debt in serious delinquency, meaning payments were late by 90 days or more, rose to 5.32% in the fourth quarter, the highest level in almost eight years, from 5.16% in the third quarter. The serious-delinquency rate for borrowers from 18 to 29 years old rose to 9.36%, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2010, from 8.91%.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Sanders wins New Hampshire, barely: \" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) claimed unchallenged control of the Democratic Party's left wing with a victory in the New Hampshire presidential primary Tuesday as two moderates, Pete Butti\u00adgieg and a newly surging Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), vied for the opposition mantle in a campaign that has been remade over the past eight days,\" my colleagues Matt Viser and Sean Sullivan report.</p><p> \"Sanders and Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind., marked their second straight strong showings - they essentially tied in last week's Iowa caucuses, with Sanders carrying the popular vote and Buttigieg winning a slight edge in delegates.\"</p><p>             Sanders will emphasize a populist contrast with Buttigieg and the rest of the field. Taking the stage at his victory party after the crowd there mocked Buttigieg with a chant of \"Wall Street Pete,\" Sanders said, \"In this point in the campaign, we are taking on billionaires and we're taking on candidates funded by billionaires. But we are going to win because we have the agenda that speaks to the needs to working people throughout this country... The wealthy and powerful will start paying their fair share of taxes.\"</p><p>Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein helped Sanders make his point:\u00a0</p><p>             Here's what Sanders's victory looks like statewide: (Note this is from early this morning, the latest results can be seen here.)</p><p>-\u00a0Biden's bad showing has donors anxious: \"Panic set in among some of Biden's financiers on Wall Street and in other industries when it became clear Tuesday night that the one-time Democratic front-runner wouldn't hit the 15 percent threshold to score any delegates from the New Hampshire vote,\" CNBC's Brian Schwartz reports.</p><p> \"Other Biden supporters, however, shrugged off the lackluster showing while they wait and see what happens in the Nevada caucus Feb. 22 and the South Carolina primary Feb. 29. Some Biden bundlers, who declined to be named due to concern about upsetting the campaign, told CNBC that members of their donor networks are already calling to say that the former vice president's flop in the Granite State looks like an insurmountable hurdle. These donors are also saying that they will stop backing Biden's campaign if he continues under performing.\"</p><p>             The exit polls don't look much better for him: (These numbers could change, you can find the latest here.)</p><p>-\u00a0The moderate muddle: \"[Sanders] has staked his claim as the favored candidate of the party's liberal wing and a threat to win the nomination. But his performance in New Hampshire was hardly overwhelming and far short of what he accomplished here four years ago,\" my colleague Dan Balz reports.</p><p> \"Yet if Sanders is the candidate of the liberal wing, those who are more moderate are still divided in their choice ... The likely prospect now is that Sanders and several other candidates will divide the vote and delegates the rest of this month and into March, when more than 60 percent of the pledged delegates will be chosen. With support among the center-left candidates divided, Sanders could emerge from Super Tuesday with a lead in delegates. He would then be in a position to do what few Democrats thought possible before the campaign started, which is win the nomination - but not without a major fight.\"</p><p>-\u00a0There goes the UBI talk: \"Andrew Yang, a Democratic businessman who campaigned on giving every adult American a monthly check for $1,000, [ended] his campaign for president after a disappointing showing,\" my colleagues David Weigel and Amy B Wang report.</p><p>Yang said he had not decided whether to endorse another candidate, though campaigns have reached out ... In his stump speech, Yang warned of the societal and economic changes automation would continue to bring to the United States. He proposed countering it by implementing universal basic income in the form of a $1,000-a-month 'Freedom Dividend' for U.S. citizens.\"</p><p>             How one influential Yang supporter reacted: (Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey)</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>-\u00a0Officials claim Huawei has back doors: \"U.S. officials say Huawei Technologies Co. can covertly access mobile-phone networks around the world through 'back doors' designed for use by law enforcement, as Washington tries to persuade allies to exclude the Chinese company from their networks,\" WSJ's Bojan Pancevski reports.</p><p> \"Intelligence shows Huawei has had this secret capability for more than a decade, U.S. officials said. Huawei rejected the allegations. The U.S. kept the intelligence highly classified until late last year, when U.S. officials provided details to allies including the U.K. and Germany, according to officials from the three countries. That was a tactical turnabout by the U.S., which in the past had argued that it didn't need to produce hard evidence of the threat it says Huawei poses to nations' security.\"</p><p>             TRUMP WATCH:          </p><p>-\u00a0Treasury nominee pulled amid Stone sentencing fight: \"All four career prosecutors handling the case against Roger Stone withdrew from the legal proceedings Tuesday - and one quit his job entirely - after the Justice Department signaled it planned to undercut their sentencing recommendation for President Trump's longtime friend and confidant,\" my colleagues Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett, Ann E. Marimow and Spencer S. Hsu report.</p><p> \"As the drama unfolded, Trump also decided to withdraw his nomination of the District's former U.S. attorney, Jessie K. Liu, to serve as Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes, people familiar with the matter said. The withdrawal was first reported by Axios.\"</p><p>- Trump praises big tech companies: \"Trump gave a shout out to a group of four big tech giants that have market caps larger than $1 trillion, calling them MAGA,\" CNBC's Patti Domm reports.</p><p>\"Trump said four tech giants, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon.com, are part of a trillion-dollar club - MAGA. The term originated as Trump's campaign slogan - Make America Great Again - and is widely used by the president and his supporters. According to a press pool report, Trump said: 'For 144 days we set a record stock market. It means 401(k)s, it means jobs. Four trillion-dollar companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft. You have MAGA. The trillion-dollar club.' \" (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>- Sprint, T-Mobile deal wins judicial approval: \"A federal judge has ruled in favor of Sprint and T-Mobile's $26 billion merger, dismissing anti-competition concerns and clearing the way for a deal that would create the nation's third-largest wireless carrier as the industry hurtles toward the new frontier of ultrafast 5G service,\" my colleague Taylor Telford reports.</p><p>\"T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. carriers, respectively, have long argued that the deal would shield them from the industry's brutal pricing wars and expedite their ability to deliver 5G to the masses. Last year, they promised Washington that they would build out a 5G wireless network to 97 percent of the country in three years, including much of rural America, while offering the 'same or better rate plans at the same or better prices.' The combined company, which will retain the T-Mobile name, is expected to serve more than 100 million subscribers, rivaling the even larger footprints of AT&amp;T and Verizon. Sprint shares spiked more than 72 percent on the news, trading at $8.25 by midday. T-Mobile surged 11.1 percent, to $93.90.\"</p><p>- FTC expands antitrust probe of tech companies: \"Federal regulators opened a new front in their investigation of big tech firms, seeking to determine whether the industry's giants acquired smaller rivals in ways that harmed competition, hurt consumers and evaded regulatory scrutiny,\" the Wall Street Journal's John D. McKinnon and Deepa Seetharaman report.</p><p>\"The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday ordered Amazon Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Google owner Alphabet Inc. to provide detailed information about their acquisitions of smaller firms over the last decade. The new probe likely will involve hundreds of transactions that never came under federal scrutiny because they were under the dollar-value threshold for antitrust review, which will rise to $94 million for 2020, officials said.\"\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0Microsoft slams Amazon's JEDI suit: \"Redmond, Wash.-based computing giant Microsoft has criticized its rival Amazon for employing 'sensationalist and politicized rhetoric' in a lawsuit over a lucrative military contract known as JEDI, according to court records made public Monday,\" my colleague Aaron Gregg reports.</p><p> \"Microsoft's comments, included in a motion to partially dismiss a protest filed by Amazon, paint the clearest picture yet of how the company will defend its surprise win in the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure procurement. Microsoft was awarded the contract in late October after an 11th-hour intervention by President Trump prompted Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper to reexamine the Pentagon's approach ... Microsoft's attorneys said Amazon's claims are not supported by evidence and should be rejected.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Some charges dismissed against             Theranos\u00a0             founder:           A federal judge late \"dismissed some charges against Theranos Inc founder Elizabeth Holmes, but let stand wire fraud charges accusing her and an associate of misleading patients about the abilities of her company's blood tests,\" Reuters's Aakriti Bhalla reports.</p><p> \"The court ruled that since the tests were paid by their medical insurance companies the patients were not deprived of any money or property in taking Theranos blood testing services.\"</p><p>- Airbnb struggles ahead of IPO: \"Airbnb Inc. swung to a loss for the first nine months of last year as costs rose sharply, according to people close to the company, raising questions about the valuation and timing of the home-sharing giant's much-anticipated public-markets debut,\" the WSJ's Jean Eaglesham, Maureen Farrell and Kirsten Grind report.</p><p>\"The multibillion-dollar start-up racked up a $322 million net loss for the nine months through September, down from a $200 million profit a year earlier, one of the people said. The slide into the red could affect Airbnb's price tag in an initial public offering, according to investors. Airbnb's profitability was expected to give it an edge as it wooed public investors. After the troubled debuts of Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., investors have grown increasingly suspicious of companies with losses and no clear path to profitability.\"\u00a0</p><p>- GOP corporate tax rate looks to be locked in gridlock: \"The sharp divergence between Republicans and Democrats over the 21 percent corporate income tax rate was on display ... at the House Ways and Means Committee as Democrats began making the case for a large increase should their party succeed in November's elections,\" Bloomberg News's Laura Davison reports.</p><p>\"Several Democratic presidential candidates [including Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg] propose pushing the rate as high as 35 percent, its level before a Republican Congress enacted a massive tax cut in 2017. [Trump] has advocated for a rate as low as 15%, creating a 20 percentage point spread between leaders in the two parties. That amounts to a win for the status quo, essentially locking in the Republicans' 21 percent corporate rate for several more years unless Democrats sweep control of Congress and the White House.\"</p><p>- Former CNBC anchor will primary AOC. NY Post's Mark Moore: \"Watch out, AOC - MCC is gunning for your congressional seat. Former CNBC cable TV journalist Michelle Caruso-Cabrera filed the paperwork this week to take on firebrand Queens Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in this year's Democratic primary for the 14th Congressional District in Queens and The Bronx. Caruso-Cabrera boasts a similarly hardscrabble story of growing up in New York to AOC's - she says she once worked as a waitress while the 30-year-old congresswoman was employed as a bartender. Caruso-Cabrera has even chosen a similar moniker - wanting to be known as MCC.\"</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Thursday:          </p><p>             Friday:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-675e0b75ccf44bd99af375a6f8c499f6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y68-0221-DXKP-J097-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3217\"/><timeReceived>12:47 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009FYX</classCode><className>CME GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS523210 SECURITIES &amp;

But Wall Street is less clear on its impact. \u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          The initial thinking from market strategists is that a Democratic takeover would weigh on share prices, as a Biden administration worked with newly empowered congressional Democrats to roll back Trump's tax cuts and apply new regulatory scrutiny to big business, especially the tech industry.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"It's a question of what you know versus what you don't know,\" says Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. \"The uncertainty over what could happen if there's Democratic control isn't something that market has had to price in to this point.\"          \u00a0       </p><p>Biden now claims a commanding lead over Trump in the online betting market PredictIt:</p><p>And just this month, Senate Democrats have jumped out to an even wider advantage over Republicans on the same platform:</p><p>Since March, however, the typical inverse correlation between stocks and the prospects of a Democratic presidential victory have diverged:</p><p>Via Variant Perception Research:\u00a0</p><p>Columbia University economist Adam Tooze offers three theories for the phenomenon:</p><p>There's a disconnect between the stock market rally and the effect investors expect Biden's tax plan might have on its performance.\u00a0</p><p>But some analysts don't expect it to last. The team at Goldman Sachs, for example, sees a reckoning coming as investors weigh the risks of a second surge in coronavirus infections and start to key in on the presidential election.</p><p>\"Periods of elevated policy uncertainty have generally coincided with lower-than-average equity allocations during the past 30 years,\" they wrote in a Sunday note. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,117.86 on Monday, toward the upper range of where the firm's analysts expect it to trade for the rest of the year. \"Our year-end target remains 3000,\" they wrote.</p><p>             That research built on work the team produced earlier this month arguing that Biden's tax agenda, if enacted, would cut S&amp;P 500 earnings by $20, to $150 per share. The biggest change Biden proposes is hiking the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent; it stood at 35 percent before Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law in 2017. The Goldman team assessed what that change would mean when added to other corporate tax increases Biden is pitching, along with their overall impact on economic growth:</p><p>             \"Although the coronavirus has caused the sharpest decline in economic activity on record, in some ways tax policy represents a larger risk to earnings and consequently to equity prices,\" they wrote. That's in part, they said, because while investors have decided to look past the ongoing economic crisis as a one-time shock, \"a shift in government policy toward higher corporate taxes would reduce expectations for the entire long-term stream of profits.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Investors have been asking more questions about Biden's tax plan since he began securing his lead over Trump around Memorial Day, says James Lucier, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners. The Tax Policy Center estimates Biden's proposals would need to raise roughly $4 trillion total, with roughly half coming from corporations.\u00a0</p><p>Even a Democratic sweep wouldn't guarantee Biden's tax plan becomes law. But Lucier says it remains a possibility for investors to assess. \"I was initially skeptical you would raise taxes at a time of high unemployment and economic recession, but if economy is recovering, that may not be the case,\" he tells me.\u00a0</p><p>Others are more bullish on the market impact of a Democratic romp.</p><p>Morgan Stanley analysts argue the likeliest election outcomes - from a complete Democratic takeover to Republicans continuing to control some levers of power - would yield the same policy results, as far as investors are concerned. That is, Washington would keep the spending spigots open, providing key support to economic growth, at least in the immediate term. Republicans hanging on to power would push through deficit-financed tax cuts, the bank's team posits; and empowered Democrats would spend more than they raised with tax hikes.</p><p>The analysts, in a report earlier this month, don't discount that Democrats would redistribute money from corporations and the wealthy. But, they add, the likelihood of those tax changes needs to be considered in context \"of the broader economic picture... The economic situation is too fluid today to make a call on what the interplay of economic policy, fiscal spending and corporate taxes will look like in a Democratic controlled government.\"</p><p>If teasing out the election's market repercussions broadly is too tough, specific sectors could offer cues.</p><p>Tech stocks in particular helped power the market out of late March gulch it landed in as investors first panicked over economic fallout from the pandemic. Just six of them - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google and Microsoft - now make up nearly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500's value:</p><p>A Democratic push to apply new antitrust scrutiny to those names could weigh on the market as a whole.</p><p>That's according to Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The tech sector has more than doubled the return on the rest of the stock market since 2010,\" he pointed out in a recent note.</p><p>Here is a look, via Cembalest, at the number of antitrust cases the Justice Department has kicked off over the last four decades:</p><p>             A Democratic sweep presents a \"potentially scary proposition for big tech companies,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives tells me. For now, he says, the regulatory threat against the industry is \"viewed as a contained risk. But we're starting to edge closer to business model changes if you had a Biden White House and a Democratic controlled Senate.\"</p><p>And the success that the handful of tech giants have enjoyed in the pandemic has only raised their profile in Washington. \"They'll have a clear target on their back as we go into the fall and 2021, depending on which way the election goes,\" Ives says.</p><p>History suggests of all power combinations, investors prefer a Democratic president and a split Congress.</p><p>That's according to an analysis Ned Davis Research conducted of the Dow Jones industrial average's performance dating back to the beginning of the last century. But it is hardly conclusive. That arrangement has been rare -\u00a0and all-GOP control of the executive and legislative branches ranks just behind it. Here's how it looks, in somewhat psychedelic chart form:</p><p>             In general, says Clissold, \"the market does better when the incumbent party wins.\" But there may be a chicken-and-egg dynamic at play there, \"where both the market and the election are reflecting the economy's performance.\"</p><p>While the election is attracting more of his clients' attention now, Clissold says investors are still trying to assess how Biden, a onetime moderate now leading an increasingly progressive party, would govern. \"His vice presidential pick is getting a lot of interest,\" he says.</p><p>             But November is not yet top of mind. \"Financial markets are very guilty of that: Ignoring something, then thinking it's the only thing that matters.\"          </p><p>Stocks rose on tech strength.</p><p>             The Nasdaq closed at a record high. CNBC's Fred Imbert: \"The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 153.50 points, or 0.6%, to close at 26,024.96. The Nasdaq Composite posted a record closing high, advancing 1.1% to 10,056.47. The S&amp;P 500 ended the session up 0.7% at 3,117.86. The major averages briefly pared some of their gains towards the end of the session, after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told reporters the coronavirus is spreading at an unacceptable rate. Apple shares jumped more than 2% and hit a record high after the company made a slew of announcement at its annual WorldWide Developers Conference.\"</p><p>             Futures point to more gains, after diving on Peter Navarro's claim the U.S.-China deal is \"over.\"More from CNBC: \"The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures implied an opening gain of nearly 300 points. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq futures also pointed to a positive open.\"\u00a0</p><p>They tanked about 400 points after Navarro, the White House trade adviser, told Fox News in an interview that the trade agreement between the world's two largest economies had fallen apart. He subsequently put out a statement walking back the claim. And Trump tweeted an assurance the deal remains \"fully intact.\"</p><p>             Many investors are still afraid of stocks.          </p><p>             Nearly $5 trillion is parked in money markets: \"The coronavirus sell-off sent investors fleeing into money market funds, which ballooned well above $4 trillion, surpassing the peak of the financial crisis, according to research by LPL Financial,\" CNBC's Jesse Pound reports.</p><p>\"The flood into money markets pushed the sector's assets to the highest on record, peaking at $4.672 trillion during the week of May 13, according to Refinitiv Lipper, and even recent net outflows have left more than 90% of that increase intact. Money markets aren't the only sign that investors are holding cash outside of stocks and bonds. Deposits at banks have spiked as well, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\"</p><p>             Blackstone CEO             Steve Schwarzman             sees a \"V\" recovery in the next few months: \"While markets are benefiting from both liquidity and optimism that the coronavirus crisis can eventually be contained, Schwarzman said the economy will 'take quite a while before we sync up and get back to 2019 levels,'\" Bloomberg's Heather Perlberg and Hema Parmar report.</p><p>\"Also at the [ Bloomberg Invest Global virtual event], hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said he believes the recovery will begin by year-end and a normalization of the economy in the second half of 2021. Ackman said he sees gradual improvement on all fronts with so many resources poured into the health-care crisis.\"\u00a0</p><p>From the U.S.:</p><p>             The corporate front:\u00a0          </p><p>Around the world:</p><p>Trump limits foreign workers and extends immigration restrictions through December.\u00a0</p><p>             He argued the moves will protect workers displaced the pandemic. \"The ban expands earlier restrictions, adding work visas that many companies use, especially in the technology sector, landscaping services and the forestry industry,\" Nick Miroff and Tony Romm report. \"It excludes agricultural laborers, health-care professionals supporting the pandemic response and food-service employees, along with some other temporary workers.</p><p>\"The restrictions will prevent foreign workers from filling 525,000 jobs, according to the administration's estimates. The measures will apply only to applicants seeking to come to the United States, not workers who already are on U.S. soil.\"</p><p>             The U.S. Chamber, for one, objected. From John Murphy, the business lobby's senior vice president for international policy:\u00a0</p><p>             The E.U. is increasing ready to play hardball with Beijing.          </p><p>             At issue is China's closed-off economy despite pledges to be open to international companies: \"Top European Union officials warned China's leaders ... that ties between the two trade partners would be damaged if they failed to further open their economy to European companies and treat foreign firms\u00a0fairly, a clear sign of hardening attitudes toward Beijing,\" the WSJ's Laurence Norman reports.</p><p>\"Following videoconferences with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel urged Beijing to swiftly deliver on promises already made and conclude years of talks on an investment deal that Europe hopes will rebalance trading ties. EU officials have repeatedly said in recent months that they don't want to be drawn into what they see as a growing global confrontation between the U.S. and China. The remarks by Ms. von der Leyen and Mr. Michel, in contrast, reflect growing wariness of an increasingly assertive China and a greater willingness to push back.\"</p><p>Apple's new processors give it even more power over developers.          </p><p>             The tech giant is moving on from a partnership with Intel: \"Apple announced new chips for its Macs, which the company said would make the computers more power efficient. But some worried about a different kind of power: the kind Apple wields over its developers,\" Reed Albergotti reports.</p><p>\"Apple is switching from Intel processors, which it has used for more than a decade, to custom-designed chips made by Arm, a British company owned by the Japanese conglomerate Softbank. The change, which Apple announced at its WWDC developer event, is no small thing ... Some developers are concerned that chaos will mean opportunity for Apple, which for years has been making efforts to get developers on the Mac to distribute their products through the Mac App Store. Apple gets a hefty cut of all revenue generated through the App Store and imposes strict limitations on what the software is allowed to do.\"       </p><p>             Wirecard plunged into chaos: \"Wirecard said that 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) it had booked in its accounts likely never existed, a black hole that threatens to engulf the payments company and tarnish the reputation of Germany's financial watchdog,\" Reuters's Patricia Uhlig, Karen Lema and John O'Donnell report.</p><p>\"The one-time investor darling is holding emergency talks with its banks, which are owed roughly 1.75 billion euros, to avert a looming cash crunch triggered by the missing money. The episode marks a dramatic turn in the fortunes of a homegrown tech firm that attracted some of the world's biggest investors before a whistleblower alleged that it owed its success in part to a web of sham transactions.\"</p><p>NYSE makes new push for IPO alternative.          </p><p>             The move has the potential to transform the IPO market: \"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) submitted an amended rule change with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ... \u00a0in a bid to enable companies that debut on the stock market through a direct listing to raise capital,\" Reuters's Joshua Franklin reports.</p><p>\"The SEC declined an earlier request by NYSE in December to allow companies going public through direct listings to sell stock. It did not disclose the reasons for its decision at the time.\"</p><p>             SCOTUS sets limits on SEC's power             to recover ill-gotten gains: \"The court reaffirmed the agency's authority to seek disgorgement, a part of its civil enforcement arsenal aimed at passing on funds acquired in fraudulent schemes to the original investors,\" Reuters's Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung report.</p><p>\"But the 8-1 ruling, authored by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, limited the scope of what can be sought via disgorgement to no more than the net profits of the conduct at issue. The court also decided that disgorgement generally must go to investors.\"</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Wednesday:          </p><p>             Thursday:          </p><p>             From The Post's Tom Toles:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-8cbea68ae0c8457e9835765b3f7e42c2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606F-8GJ1-DXKP-J51X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2610\"/><timeReceived>12:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 23, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Everything you need to know here.                       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             And now, for a tax overhaul: The Price Tag Cometh.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House Republicans approved a budget Thursday that frees the party to cut taxes by $1.5 trillion over a decade, provided leaders in both chambers can keep their members marching in lockstep. But the razor-thin margin (roll call vote here) -\u00a0the tally was 216 to 212, with 20 Republicans opposing the spending blueprint - points to the difficulty ahead as the GOP hunts for revenue to pay for a sweeping rewrite of the tax code.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             In recent days, Republican agita over the tax rewrite has sprung from proposed tweaks to the personal side of the code. Specifically, the rank and file is sweating the implications for voters back home of the capping of\u00a0tax-free contributions to retirement accounts and the write-off for state and local taxes. Both of those changes will draw pushback from business groups: The retirement account proposal is\u00a0stirring worry among financial services interests; the National Association of Realtors, a political powerhouse, opposes repealing the break for state and local taxes.\u00a0</p><p>             Yet the real big-money battle is just days ahead.             House Republicans plan to unveil their first draft of a bill next Wednesday - and with it, changes to the corporate side of the code that will finally allow business interests of every size and stripe to determine whether they stand to win or lose. And then armies of lobbyists will pile into the breach to try to reshape the outcome. \"When the details come, that is when you're going to see K Street coming to Congress,\" House Speaker <person><nameText>Paul Ryan (R-Wis.</nameText></person>) saidat a Reuters event\u00a0Tuesday. \"And that's why this hasn't been done for 31 years.\"          </p><p>             For now, the prevailing mood downtown tips more toward dread than excitement. A majority of respondents to a survey\u00a0of tax professionals by Deloitte this week indicated they were more nervous about their companies being targeted for new revenue than enthusiastic about the prospects of a lower overall corporate tax rate, said\u00a0Jon Traub, who leads the firm's tax policy practice. \"It's fair to say a lot of people are holding their breath right now, waiting to see what's in the bill,\" Traub said.\u00a0          </p><p>With a wish list of cuts topping $5 trillion, tax writers will be looking everywhere but the couch cushions for sources of funding.</p><p>             Among the potential pay-fors:\u00a0          </p><p>- Repealing the write-off for interest paid on business debt. Beneficiaries -\u00a0including banks, private equity investors, electric utilities, real estate developers and farmers\u00a0- say the break, worth about $1.5 trillion, simply offers a deduction for a standard business expense. Critics say it distorts economic activity by subsidizing debt financing, encouraging dangerously high amounts of leverage. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) has pushed for its elimination, the richest remaining vein of new money to fund the overhaul. But sectors that rely on the break are already rallying for carve-outs that promise to whittle down its value.\u00a0</p><p>- A global minimum tax. Those close to the process expect\u00a0House Republicans to seek to impose a\u00a0new levy on what major American corporations earn abroad. The proposal could prove particularly painful for big tech and pharmaceutical companies using\u00a0sophisticated strategies to shuttle their intellectual property around the globe to minimize their tax burden. Versions of that idea floated a few years ago both by President Obama and then-Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.), went nowhere. But cracking down on international tax dodgers remains a top priority for Republicans, and a minimum tax is likely to be one of many proposals addressing the issue.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>             Scrapping the deduction for advertising expenses. Camp included this proposal, estimated to raise $169 billion over a decade, in a 2014 tax rewrite\u00a0summarily dismissed at the time. Since, though, tax writers have been picking back through the plan\u00a0for potential sources of revenue. Media companies that rely on advertising revenue would feel the pinch -\u00a0and object.\u00a0</p><p>             Ending the break for research and experimentation expenses. Another Camp oldie-but-goodie, worth an estimated $193 billion. It included software development costs, so among others, tech companies would fight it.\u00a0</p><p>             Accounting tweaks. One perennial pay-for calls for ending the \"last in, first out\" (LIFO) method of accounting for inventory, prized by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. It could raise tens of billions of dollars but would invite opposition from a powerful array of interests, including the National Federation of Independent Business, the small-business lobby, which has mobilized to thwart past attempts to do away with the strategy.\u00a0</p><p>And there will\u00a0be many more, because of the staggering dollar amounts\u00a0that tax-writers need to find to get anywhere close to their goal. Or, as Chris Krueger of Cowen\u00a0Washington Research Group writes in a note to clients this morning, \"The subtraction that is finally unveiled next week is going to be UGLY. Tax policy is zero-sum. Someone has to pay the cost of rate reductions...\u00a0Next week, we will see who is on the initial kill list...and expect them to push back as if this was a life-or-death struggle because for many, it is. Welcome to the corporate hunger games.\"</p><p>Republican leaders have talked up the goal of delivering the package by the end of the year, though considering the scale of the work ahead, that seems far-fetched. \"What I tell my clients is this is the start of a process,\" said Cathy Koch, Americas Tax Policy leader at EY. \"There's a lot of distance between Nov. 1 and final passage. And all that distance is going to entail modifications. Now's the time to get involved and speak up.\"\u00a0          </p><p>             FED WATCH:\u00a0          </p><p>- Down to Powell or Taylor. The Post's Damian Paletta and Bob Costa report that Trump has \"largely settled on nominating either former investment banker Jerome 'Jay'\u00a0Powell or Stanford University economist John Taylor to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, three people briefed on the process said, setting the stage for what could be one of the most consequential economic decisions of his administration...\u00a0The three people confirming that Powell and Taylor are now the front-runners spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the internal deliberations publicly.\u00a0Trump is well-known, though, for changing his mind on nominations late in the process, and several people warned that a final decision had not yet been made.\"</p><p>- Taylor echoes Trump. Bloomberg's\u00a0Christopher Condon: \"John Taylor, the Stanford professor who is among the finalists that President Donald Trump is considering to lead the Federal Reserve, argued Thursday that faster U.S. economic growth is possible if policy makers focus on reforms that encourage investment and hiring. 'I would go back to the basic principles, that incentives matter, that tax rates matter, and apply those principles,'\u00a0Taylor told an audience at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. 'You want to have the supply of the economy increasing more rapidly and you can do that with new policies.' Taylor's remarks were likely to find an approving audience in the White House. Trump took office in January with a promise to stoke the economy's growth rate, which has hovered a bit above 2 percent since 2010.\"</p><p>- Yellen\u00a0worries about Fed cred. Bloomberg's\u00a0Rich Miller: \"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has begun to openly acknowledge the possibility that the credibility of the central bank's 2 percent inflation goal may have weakened somewhat -- a surprising admission in what could be the final months of her tenure...\u00a0Yellen said it was an 'open question'\u00a0whether inflation expectations in major economies had edged lower.\u00a0If they have, that could pose difficulties for whoever heads the Fed next year.\"</p><p>- Three anti-Yellen House Rs weigh in. CNBC's Jeff Cox: \"Some House Republicans are calling on President Donald Trump not to reappoint Janet Yellen as Fed chair when her term expires in February. In a letter sent to the president, the legislators tell Trump that \"new leadership\" is needed at the central bank to push the economy forward. 'As general mistrust of government and public institutions continues to rise, we believe that new leadership at the Federal Reserve will help restore its reputation as a forward-thinking monetary institution instead of a slow growth regulator,'\u00a0said the letter, authored by Reps. Warren Davidson, Ted Budd and Alex Mooney.\"</p><p>             TAX FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>- Corker stays uncorked. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) teed\u00a0off on the direction of the tax overhaul in a CNBC appearance: \"Some of the items in the GOP tax reform discussion are just 'buying off'\u00a0special interests and serve no other purpose, [Corker] told CNBC on Thursday.\u00a0'Some of the things we're doing, I'm sorry, are ridiculous,\" [he] told 'Squawk Box,'\u00a0though he did not mention any specifics.</p><p> 'I'm sorry, but we live in a political world,'\u00a0said Corker, a member on the Senate Budget and Banking committees. Those things are 'not going to drive 1 ounce of economic growth. But it's what you have to do to pass a tax bill.'\u00a0</p><p>Corker described some efforts to pass tax reform as 'unfortunate.'\u00a0'It's buying off of people to pass tax reform,'\u00a0Corker said. 'We could take a lot of this off in the trash can and make it easier and actually do something that grows our economy and increases our wages,'\u00a0he said.\"</p><p>             But he also said he's \"all in\" on the tax overhaul and won't let his opinion of Trump shape his approach.          </p><p>- Taxing interest. Axios's Dan Primack\u00a0has details of a scaled-back plan Republicans are considering for repealing the business interest deduction. \"The current talk is to reduce the current 100% deduction down to 70%, with an expectation that the extra 30% would be taxed at the new statutory corporate rate. There is an expectation that existing debt would be grandfathered in, and transition rules may include grandfathering for debt that is in process as of the Nov. 1 roll-out (if that last part proves out, expect a massive surge in leveraged loan soft launches).</p><p>Caveat: Interest deductibility is viewed by the GOP as one of its few remaining ways to pay for tax cuts, and the 70/30 plan was devised in concert with 401(k) caps. If the 401(k) plan gets scrapped over Trump's tweet threats, then it's possible the deductibility limit could climb.\"</p><p>- Nov. 6 markup. Brady announced the plan Thursday after House Republicans approved the budget.</p><p>- The Big Six and a Half. \"White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney discussed President Trump's tax-reform plan Wednesday, describing it as 45 percent National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, 45 percent Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and 10 percent himself,\" The Hill's Isaiah Seibert writes.</p><p>- Gilded Age.\u00a0Something to keep in mind as congressional Republicans prepare to release a tax plan that early analyses suggested would concentrate its benefits among the rich, via The Guardian's\u00a0Rupert Neate: \"The world's super-rich hold the greatest concentration of wealth since the US Gilded Age at the turn of the 20th century, when families like the Carnegies, Rockefellers and Vanderbilts controlled vast fortunes.\u00a0</p><p>             Billionaires increased their combined global wealth by almost a fifth last year to a record $6 trillion\u00a0- more than twice the GDP of the UK. There are now 1,542 dollar billionaires across the world, after 145 multi-millionaires saw their wealth tick over into nine-zero fortunes last year, according to the UBS / PwC Billionaires report. Josef Stadler, the lead author of the report and UBS's head of global ultra high net worth, said his billionaire clients were concerned that growing inequality between rich and poor could lead to a 'strike back'.\"          </p><p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the Republicans' budget \"an assault, a ripoff, a shakedown, a looting of the middle class:\"</p><p>-\u00a0No NAFTA concessions.\u00a0Axios' sJonathan Swan: \"A top Trump administration official made the US pro-trade community despair - again. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross declared that President Trump had no interest in giving a single meaningful concession in the NAFTA talks with Canada and Mexico. 'We're asking two countries to give up some privileges that they have enjoyed for 22 years,'\u00a0Ross told CNBC's Becky Quick on Wednesday. 'And we are not in a position to offer anything in return.'... The NAFTA talks are frozen and the deal's future looks very dicey.\"</p><p>             Could Congress block Trump from ripping up the pact?Vox says yes, maybe: \"The answer is that no one knows for sure - but many think Congress could use its powers to prevent a total withdrawal from NAFTA. Under NAFTA rules, Trump can unilaterally withdraw from the agreement by giving Mexico and Canada six months' notice. But Congress also has a say, since it ratified and implemented the agreement through legislation. Congress can fight to keep that legislation - the rules governing the way that the US trades with Mexico and Canada under NAFTA - intact. It can also pass new laws designed to boost its own authority over trade agreements. It may even be able to pass a law that preemptively eliminates Trump's ability to unilaterally give Canada and Mexico notice of withdrawal.\"</p><p>- Gassed up. \"The White House is revisiting an increase in the federal gas tax to pay for infrastructure improvements President Trump promised to deliver on the campaign trail,\" The Post's Ashley Halsey III\u00a0reports. \"That news was conveyed to House members Wednesday in a meeting by Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn...\u00a0After campaigning on a promise he would lure private capital to invest in infrastructure, Trump in late April said he would be open to bumping up the federal gas tax, which has not seen an increase since 1993. Some Democrats, notable among them Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.), ranking Democrat of the House Transportation Committee, have fought an upstream battle to increase the tax.\"</p><p>RUSSIA WATCH:          </p><p>- Hill probes winding down?\u00a0Politico's Kyle Cheney and Elana Scor: \"Republican lawmakers say they're approaching the end of their investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election even though the most politically explosive issue - whether associates of President Donald Trump colluded with the Kremlin - remains unresolved. That will present Democrats who have spent a year amplifying suspicions about Trump's own ties to Russia with a wrenching choice: to join Republicans and set aside the most momentous aspect of their probes - or to break from the GOP and end any chance of presenting a united front against a continuing Russian threat.</p><p>             Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) has suggested his panel's investigation will end early next year, emphasizing that he wants to wrap up by February, ahead of the first 2018 primary elections. His panel still has a long list of witnesses to interview, but Burr described the timeline as a 'mathematical equation,'\u00a0one pitting the ability of the committee to schedule meetings against the calendar. And he's hinted it's possible the report will find no evidence of collusion between Trump allies and Moscow.\"</p><p>- Google lays low. Axios' David McCabe: \"Facebook and Google both have a Russia problem. But while Facebook has mounted a very public response to charges of election meddling on its platform, Google has kept its head down.\u00a0At least so far, Google has managed to avoid the scale of criticism that has hit Facebook and Twitter as a result of Congress' investigation into Russia's actions and the platforms' role in allowing them, which is good news for a company that is frequently at the center of tech policy battles. Still, it will get intense questioning when its general counsel testifies on Capitol Hill next week.\"</p><p>- Your dossier guide. The now near-mythic dossier alleging deep\u00a0Trump-Russia connections is back in the news. What you need to know about it - what's been reported, Trump's reaction, the key players, and how it fits into the Mueller probe -\u00a0here.</p><p>- GOP targets Mueller's budget. Politico's Darren Samuelsohn: \"Republicans trying to hobble Robert Mueller's sprawling probe into President Donald Trump and Russia matters are about to get a new weapon: the special counsel's budget. Lawmakers haven't yet seen the Russia investigator's first spending report, which must go through a Justice Department review before being made public. But they're already setting up a fight over how much the probe is costing taxpayers - and the fact that there's no end in sight...</p><p>             As a practical matter, Congress can't go after Mueller's day-to-day spending directly. His budget is being drawn out of a permanent Treasury Department account that is not subject to the annual appropriations process, and the DOJ regulations used to appoint Mueller state he \"shall be provided all appropriate resources\" to do his work.\u00a0Mueller is subject to some oversight. He had to produce a budget proposal to DOJ earlier this summer for the next fiscal year. And an internal DOJ audit office must review the first 4\u00bd months of his spending receipts.\"</p><p>- Rosenstein: Americans \"too savvy\" for Russian ads to work.\u00a0The Post's Aaron Blake: \"Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein is in charge of overseeing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community has said explicitly that it has no opinion on whether Russian interference affected the election. But Rosenstein does - at least when it comes to the ads for which Russia paid. Appearing on the \"Target USA\" podcast from Washington's WTOP radio station, Rosenstein said he thought American voters were too \"savvy\" to be influenced by such ads.\" He flatters us.\u00a0</p><p>- Treasury: Scale back rules for asset managers. WSJ's\u00a0Ryan Tracy and\u00a0Dave Michaels: \"Investment funds would see strict post-crisis rules scaled back or delayed under recommendations laid out Thursday by the Treasury Department its latest report outlining the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda. The report on the asset-management and insurance industries was the third issued in response to a February executive order from President Donald Trump directing the Treasury to re-evaluate U.S. financial regulations.</p><p>             The Treasury recommended scaling back a Securities and Exchange Commission rule for mutual and exchange-traded funds meant to reduce the risks of an investor exodus during a panic, particularly one provision that would require funds to estimate and disclose the liquidity of their holdings. The SEC, an independent federal agency, would need to act on the Treasury's recommendations for them to go into effect.</p><p>The report also said that designating large insurers and asset managers for stricter federal rules is 'not the best approach for mitigating risks,'\u00a0and regulators should focus instead on risky activities. That will be music to the ears of the largest companies in those industries, which under the Obama administration feared the federal regulation that comes with being labeled 'systemically important.'\"</p><p>             CapAlpha's Ian Katz weighs in, via a note to clients this morning: \"Broadly speaking, the report is positive for investors in asset managers and insurers. If Treasury's recommendations are implemented, many companies will be able to reduce some regulation-related costs and enjoy a bit more flexibility in the marketplace. One thing that stands out is how little Treasury asks of Congress. The vast majority of the recommendations can be completed by regulators. Many of those will likely be done, but we caution that making and changing regulations takes time, sometimes years. And the lower-priority recommendations might never be completed because agencies such as the SEC simply aren't built to churn out regs.\"</p><p>             If you're a woman working in the United States, you started working for free yesterday.          </p><p> \"The median salary for a full-time working woman is about 80 percent of a man's.

Griffiths          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fight Corporate Monopolies, a liberal political action committee, officially launched just over a month ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the group of operatives with ties to Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has already claimed its first upset victory: It helped topple Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), chairman of the House Financial Services housing subcommittee, in his Tuesday primary against 44-year-old Black Lives Matter activist Cori Bush.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The organization spent $90,000 on an ad portraying Clay as siding with big banks over then-President Obama against the fiduciary rule, the obscure-outside-the-Beltway requirement that financial advisers give retirement savers advice free of conflicts of interest. (Watch the spot above or here.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And now the PAC is aiming to repeat the coup against an even more powerful figure. It is targeting House Ways and Means Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) by once again highlighting an incumbent Democrat's Wall Street backers. The group has spent $300,000 on a pair of ads tying Neal to the Blackstone Group, his top source of contributions.</p><p>Neal's Sept. 1 race, against Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse, is emerging as the next major test for insurgent liberals. In anticipation of a potential Democratic sweep in November, they are working to pull the party's ideological center of gravity to the left, first by replacing business-friendly lawmakers and regulators with like-minded newcomers, then pressing them to embrace an agenda that fundamentally overhauls Washington's relationship with industry.</p><p>In her win over Clay, Bush became \"the fifth left-wing Democrat to oust an incumbent member of Congress from her party since the start of Trump's presidency - including three this year,\" Paul Kane and Dave Weigel note.</p><p>Also Tuesday, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a member of the four-woman \"Squad\" of liberals elected in 2018, dispatched a more moderate challenger in her own primary. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the highest-profile member of that group, routed former CNBC anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera in a June matchup that drew big-dollar contributions from a who's who of Wall Street titans.</p><p>\"The insurgents and establishment figures disagree over the impact of these races, some dismissing the anti-establishment wins as unique to each campaign,\" Paul and Dave write. \"But both sides agree that this movement feeds off victories, boosting fundraising for a slew of relatively new liberal PACs, and that losses would have starved them of political oxygen.\"</p><p>Jason Rosenstock, a financial services lobbyist with Thorn Run Partners, says his clients are busy gaming out not only the implications of different election outcomes but also the effect the newly assertive left could have on the direction of the Democratic Party. \"The financial services industry is perpetually going to be attacked by the far left,\" he says. \"The question is, 'How far does that bleed into the general ethos of the Democratic Party?'\"</p><p>In the case of Fight Corporate Monopolies, its sister organization, the American Economic Liberties Project, is laying the groundwork for an antitrust lobbying offensive. It will push Democratic lawmakers and regulators to break up big businesses the group argues are distorting markets while hurting workers and consumers \"in sectors from contact lenses to cat food.\"</p><p>\"There's a huge list of things we need to do to dig ourselves out of 40 years of deferring to monopolies,\" Sarah Miller, executive director of the project and a leader of Fight Corporate Monopolies, tells me.</p><p>Miller, a former Obama Treasury Department aide, says the concentration of corporate power has been \"supercharged by the pandemic. We're seeing the largest corporations make out like bandits and get all the support they could ask for, while support for families is time-limited and insufficient to provide stability and security.\"</p><p>The American Economic Liberties Project is laying out an agenda, shared here for the first time, that calls for a \"holistic reorientation of government's relationship to private power.\" While acknowledging there is \"no one-size-fits-all solution,\" it recommends a number of steps, including:</p><p>creating a public bank along the lines of the Depression-era Reconstruction Finance Corporation to help pandemic-ravaged businesses go through quick reorganizations;</p><p>adopting Warren's proposal to remake the private equity business model by making firms responsible for the employee pensions and debt obligations of the companies they buy;</p><p>providing for more muscular antitrust enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission;</p><p>directing Congress to conduct a \"thorough study of market concentration in the U.S.\";</p><p>and assessing the Federal Reserve's role in inequality while diversifying the central bank's leadership.</p><p>Antitrust advocates got a boost from the headline-grabbing House Judiciary Committee hearing last week featuring the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), who presided over the hearing as chairman of the panel's antitrust subcommittee, concluded it by declaring it had \"made one fact clear to me: These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up.\"</p><p>Miller argues the effort needs to go beyond Big Tech. Financial interests have figured prominently in the ads Fight Corporate Monopolies has funded so far because \"as regulators and policymakers have stepped back from structuring markets, Wall Street has stepped into that role ... Wall Street is the entity that's shaping the structure of commerce in America, and part of our overall goal is to make sure policymakers perform that role and perform it well.\"</p><p>The ads share a theme, seeking to connect little-noticed moves by lawmakers that earn them corporate favor with outcomes the group argues hurt their own voters.</p><p>In one of the ads targeting Neal, the group accuses the House's top tax writer of doing the Blackstone Group's bidding by blocking an effort to stop surprise medical billing, a profit generator for the private equity giant's hospital holdings. \"Corporate power is corrupting democracy, and Richie Neal is part of the problem,\" the ad's narrator says.</p><p>Neal campaign spokeswoman Kate Norton called it a false attack. \"The inconvenient truth for this dark money group is that the surprise billing measure they support would actually HURT hospitals and workers in Western and Central Mass, so Richie proposed his own bill,\" Norton said in a statement. \"And it's ironic that Alex Morse has built his entire campaign message about outside money while this is the first attack ad out the gate. It's another hypocritical move that Morse hopes no one will notice, but if he was standing in his principles he would denounce ads like this.\" Blackstone didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Faiz Shakir - Sanders's former campaign manager, an outside consultant to Fight Corporate Monopolies, and Miller's husband -says the group is funded by donors and institutions that share its agenda but declined to name them.</p><p>The president is taking more concrete steps toward a legally questionable outcome: \"Trump threatened to take executive action to extend an eviction moratorium, suspend collection of the payroll tax and boost unemployment benefits unless a coronavirus relief deal can be reached quickly with Democrats on Capitol Hill,\" Erica Werner, Karoun Demirjian and Jeff Stein report.</p><p>\"And in a sign the White House could be preparing to act, the Trump administration has asked federal agencies to identify all of the money they have not yet spent from the $2 trillion Cares Act, which passed in March ... White House officials are trying to determine whether this money could be redirected and used for other purposes, such as temporary unemployment benefits or the eviction moratorium.</p><p>White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has set a Friday deadline: Meadows said further negotiation would be pointless if a deal doesn't happen by then. \"But Democrats insisted they wanted to keep negotiating until they could reach agreement on an overall relief bill.\"</p><p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) addressed the prospect of administrative action: She said \"that Trump might be able to extend the moratorium on evictions - which expired last month - on his own, but she argued that would be of limited use without money attached. Democrats are pushing for rental assistance and housing assistance as part of the talks.\"          </p><p>             Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is facing some rare blowback:              \"I want to get an outcome,\" McConnell told Politico yesterday. \"And I think the best way to get an outcome and to maximize the potential on our side - and we are divided on this - is to make sure everybody knows what's going on.          </p><p>Where talks stand: \"Trump administration officials proposed reducing the figure to $400 weekly through early December,\" my colleagues report of movement on the $600 in weekly enhanced unemployment payments. But Democrats so far aren't budging from their demand to extend the benefit at its current level. Negotiators are set to meet again at 5 p.m. tonight.</p><p>There's also some movement on state aid: \"Democrats are seeking about $1 trillion in new aid for states and localities that have laid off more than 1 million workers since February ... Trump repeated his argument that Democrats want a 'bailout' of poorly managed states. The Trump administration is now offering $150 billion in state and local aid ... Republicans are also arguing that other money - such as the $105 billion they support for schools - should qualify as state aid, an argument Democrats reject.\"          </p><p>Payments ended last Friday: \"Many economists expect last week's expiration of $600 in enhanced weekly unemployment benefits to lead to a sharp drop-off in household spending and a setback for the U.S. economy's near-term recovery, even if the lapse turns out to be temporary,\" the Wall Street Journal's Kate Davidson reports.</p><p>\"The average unemployed worker in the U.S. earns a little more than $300 a week on traditional jobless benefits. That isn't enough for many people to keep up with routine bills, [Trevon Logan, an economics professor at Ohio State University]. Missing those payments could trigger evictions, fines and late fees-costs that consumers will try to avoid by pulling back on other kinds of spending, he said.\"</p><p>The economy was growing in May and June: \"But growth stalled in July as infections spiked in some parts of the country, leading to fresh restrictions, U.S. central bankers said,\" Reuters's Jonnelle Marte reports. \"The increase in infections has raised the downside risks to the economic outlook and suggests the reopening of the U.S. economy may be more protracted than many initially anticipated, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in a speech for the Liberal Arts Macroeconomics Conference.\"</p><p>And Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told CNN, \"The issue with the resurgence in the virus is it slowed down or somewhat muted the recovery we've been expecting.\"          </p><p>Hiring slowed dramatically in July: Businesses added only 167,000 workers to their private payrolls, a steep drop from analysts' expectations. \"The numbers reported by ADP mark a significant departure from the more than 1 million jobs that some economists had predicted and a sharp falloff from hiring gains reported just a month prior, suggesting almost no sector of the U.S. economy has been untouched by the apparent new slowdown,\" Tony Romm reports.</p><p>New weekly jobless claims, out at 8:30 a.m. this morning, are expected to show 1.4 million filers, per Bloomberg's consensus estimate. That would mark a negligible decline from the prior week.</p><p>The numbers have remained stubbornly high since late June. \"That halted what had been a swift decline from a peak of 6.9 million in late March, when the pandemic and business closures shut down parts of the U.S. economy,\" the Wall Street Journal's Eric Morath reports. The level recorded in recent weeks remains well above the highest on record before this year, which was 695,000 in 1982.\"          </p><p>             July jobs report out Friday will shed more light. \"Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast the report to show 1.5 million jobs were added last month and the unemployment rate fell to 10.6% from 11.1% in June,\" Morath writes. \"While those would be historically strong gains, they would also be a marked slowdown from the pace of the prior two months with unemployment still well above pre-pandemic levels.\"          </p><p>There's a drop in cases, but there could be other factors behind it: \"The United States reported close to 52,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, as the average number of infections being detected each day continues to trend downward. But that drop has been driven by steep declines in Florida, where Hurricane Isaias shut down dozens of testing sites, and California, where officials said technical problems with the state's reporting system were leading to an inaccurate tally,\" Antonia Noori Farzan reports.</p><p>Housing, auto demand continue to remain strong: \"Sales of new homes in June ran at their fastest pace in nearly 13 years ... While the motor-vehicle industry still isn't back to pre-pandemic levels, the pace of car and light-truck purchases accelerated a third straight month to an annualized pace of 14.5 million in July, exceeding economists' estimates,\" Bloomberg News's Vince Golle and Maeve Sheehey reports.</p><p>Republican senators push more help for airlines. David Shepardson of Reuters reports: \"A group of Senate Republicans on Wednesday backed extending a $25 billion payroll assistance program for U.S. airlines after warnings that carriers may be forced to cut tens of thousands of jobs without government action, according to a letter seen by Reuters.\"          </p><p>NCAA leaves divisions in control of championships: The governing body of college sports set specific guidelines for this fall, but punted decisions on whether or not to hold championships to each of its three divisions. Shortly after their announcement, Division II and III canceled their fall championships and stated they would not be made up. NCAA President Mark Emmert said the decision on whether or not to play college football made come down to individual schools instead of the powerful conferences, the Associated Press's Ralph D. Russo reports.</p><p>Boeing does not see immediate need to raise cash: \"Despite the pandemic decimating air travel, adding to the fallout from a 16-month-old crisis over the 737 MAX grounding after fatal crashes, [CFO Greg] Smith said the U.S. planemaker was still focused on future investments including new jet development,\" Reuters's Eric M. Johnson reports.</p><p>CVS says test delays are abating: \"The drugstore giant, the biggest retail chain conducting covid-19 tests in the U.S., said it temporarily reduced the amount of new tests it administered while adding additional labs to process backlogged results,\" WSJ's Sharon Terlep reports. CVS \"also disclosed financial results for the latest quarter, saying that profits in its insurance business were bolstered as Americans held off on elective procedures and regular health care amid the pandemic.\"          </p><p>J.C. Penney lenders seek higher bids: \"The lenders are pushing for offers closer to the approximately $2.2 billion of J.C. Penney's debt they hold,\" Bloomberg News's Eliza Ronalds-Hannon and Lauren Coleman-Lochner report. \"Earlier proposals from mall owners and retail firms added up to payments of about $1.8 billion.\"          </p><p>             Struggling manufacturers pivot to making masks: \"Companies are stitching them on repurposed manufacturing lines in New England and 3-D-printing them at workshops in California. Hundreds of Etsy entrepreneurs have stopped sewing bags and table linens and switched to full-time mask production,\" Jeanne Whalen reports.</p><p>The demands for documents from Deutsche Bank suggests Trump faces a wider probe: \"The New York prosecutors who are seeking [Trump's] tax records have also subpoenaed his longtime lender, a sign that their criminal investigation into [Trump's] business practices is more wide-ranging than previously known,\" the New York Times's David Enrich, Ben Protess, William K. Rashbaum and Benjamin Weiser report.</p><p>\"The Manhattan district attorney's office issued the subpoena last year to Deutsche Bank, which has been Trump's primary lender since the late 1990s, seeking financial records that he and his company provided to the bank ... The subpoena from the office of the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., appears to be the first instance of a criminal inquiry involving Trump and his dealings with the German bank, which lent him and his company more than $2 billion over the past two decades.\" The bank complied with the subpoena.</p><p>Traders were slightly optimistic after the Magic Kingdom's report: \"Walt Disney Co's shares jumped 8.80 percent, to put it among the biggest boosts to the S&amp;P 500 and Dow. The stock notched its biggest daily percentage gain since March 24 as revenue declines for Disney parks and media networks were not as bad as feared,\" Reuters's Chuck Mikolajczak reports.</p><p>\"The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 373.05 points, or 1.39 percent, to 27,201.52, the S&amp;P 500 gained 21.26 points, or 0.64 percent, to 3,327.77 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.23 points, or 0.52 percent to 10,998.40.\"</p><p>Goldman warns coronavirus vaccine could shake up markets. \"The increased probability of an approved vaccine by the end of November is underpriced by equity markets, wrote strategists including Kamakshya Trivedi in a note Wednesday,\" Bloomberg's Cormac Mullen reports. \"Over the next few months, the ramifications of the U.S. election and the evolution of the virus -- in part as schools reopen -- are also likely to be key drivers of the market, they said.\"</p><p>Analysts predict gold isn't over the hill yet: \"The speed at which gold has broken above $2,000 an ounce has left some in the market fearing a correction, but many analysts predict more gains as the coronavirus crisis spurs investors to buy into bullion's relative safety,\" Reuters's Peter Hobson reports.</p><p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire boosts its stake in Bank of America: The conglomerate won \"regulatory permission to increase what was already its largest common stock holding other than Apple Inc.,\" Reuters's Jonathan Stempel reports. \"In a regulatory filing on Tuesday night, Berkshire said it paid $337 million for about 13.6 million Bank of America shares between July 31 and Aug. 4.\" It now owns a 11.9 percent stake in the company.          </p><p>It would the first major change to the central bank's mandate in decades: \"Congressional Democrats introduced new legislation on that would make reducing racial inequality in the U.S. economy an official part of the Federal Reserve's mission,\" Heather Long reports.</p><p>\"The Federal Reserve Racial and Economic Equity Act requires the central bank to take action 'to minimize and eliminate racial disparities in employment, wages, wealth, and access to affordable credit.' While the legislation is not expected to pass Congress while Republicans control the Senate, it signals a growing consensus among Democrats that the Fed has played a role in deepening inequality and needs to be part of the solution to close gaps in employment and pay.\"</p><p>\"The legislation was written by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee. Warren and Gillibrand both ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary before dropping out and backing Biden. The bill is co-sponsored by 18 other Democrats, including former presidential candidates Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).\"</p><p>The president and Republicans broke a two-month losing streak: \"[Trump's] reelection fundraising in July outpaced that of Democratic presumptive nominee Joe Biden, with a staggering $165 million raised between the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and affiliated committees,\" Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports.</p><p>\"Biden, the Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising committees raised $140 million in July, comparable to the amount they raised the month prior ... Trump is slated to headline fundraising events in the Hamptons this week, according to CNBC. And Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and White House senior adviser, appeared at a virtual fundraiser Wednesday that reportedly drew $4 million.\"</p><p>Out of possible VPs, Susan Rice has the most corporate experience: \"Susan Rice is an Oxford-educated foreign policy specialist who-unlike the rest of those believed to be on [Biden's] running mate shortlist-has never held elected office. But she does have experience in an area most of those in the group don't: American corporations,\" WSJ's John McCormick reports.</p><p>\"The former national security adviser and United Nations ambassador for President Obama is a member of the board of directors at Netflix Inc. and, earlier in her career, worked at McKinsey &amp; Co. in Toronto.\"</p><p>The launch also comes at a curious time for Facebook: \"Facebook-owned Instagram released its new service, Reels, in the United States and dozens of other countries Wednesday, adding a tab to the existing app that will let users make and watch short-form videos - just like TikTok,\" Rachel Lerman reports.</p><p>\"Reels' U.S. launch is timed just a week after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by Congress about his company's allegedly anticompetitive practices, including whether it copies ideas from smaller competitors. Meanwhile, TikTok is facing political fallout, as the Trump administration has put pressure on its parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. assets or face a ban because of national security concerns.\"</p><p>The timing of the launch is coincidental, said Instagram's product chief Vishal Shah: \"Just like TikTok, Reels lets users shoot and edit videos, add music and scroll through a feed of others' clips. The biggest difference seems to be length of video - TikTok allows videos up to 60 seconds, and Instagram caps them at 15 seconds ... Shah conceded TikTok had done 'amazing work' but said it did not invent the short-form video market.\"</p><p>State attorneys general blast Facebook's civil rights record: \"Nearly two dozen state attorneys general demanded Facebook do more to stop the spread of disinformation, discrimination and hate in an open letter on, the latest volley in a growing campaign targeting the company's civil rights record,\" Elizabeth Dwoskin reports.</p><p>\"Citing a rise in hate crimes and online harassment, the attorneys general asked Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to step up enforcement of the social media company's hate speech policies. They also asked the company to allow independent audits of the hateful content on the site and of Facebook's measures to eliminate it. And they called for the company to improve its responsiveness to victims of hate-filled attacks.\"</p><p>Blackstone to acquire Ancestry.com for $4.7 billion: \"It's the first acquisition by Blackstone's largest ever private equity fund. Silver Lake and Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte have been the majority owners since 2016,\" Bloomberg News's Heather Perlberg reports.</p><p>\"New York-based Blackstone is flush with cash as investors continue to bet big on the firm amid the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs says will double hiring of junior bankers from black colleges by 2025: CEO David Solomon told employees \"in a staff email that after setting goals last year to hire more Black and Latino employees, the New York-based firm had the 'highest representation' of Black workers and a majority of women in its 2020 analyst class,\" CNBC's Hugh Son reports.</p><p>\"Analysts, typically recent college graduates, are on the lowest rung of Wall Street's hierarchy.

Griffiths   Fight Corporate Monopolies, a liberal political action committee, officially launched just over a month ago.   But the group of operatives with ties to Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has already claimed its first upset victory: It helped topple Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), chairman of the House Financial Services housing subcommittee, in his Tuesday primary against 44-year-old Black Lives Matter activist Cori Bush.   The organization spent $90,000 on an ad portraying Clay as siding with big banks over then-President Obama against the fiduciary rule, the obscure-outside-the-Beltway requirement that financial advisers give retirement savers advice free of conflicts of interest. (Watch the spot above or here.)   AD   And now the PAC is aiming to repeat the coup against an even more powerful figure. It is targeting House Ways and Means Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) by once again highlighting an incumbent Democrat\u2019s Wall Street backers. The group has spent $300,000 on a pair of ads tying Neal to the Blackstone Group, his top source of contributions.   AD   Neal\u2019s Sept. 1 race, against Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse, is emerging as the next major test for insurgent liberals. In anticipation of a potential Democratic sweep in November, they are working to pull the party\u2019s ideological center of gravity to the left, first by replacing business-friendly lawmakers and regulators with like-minded newcomers, then pressing them to embrace an agenda that fundamentally overhauls Washington\u2019s relationship with industry.   Left-wing advocates are on a hot streak lately.    In her win over Clay, Bush became \u201cthe fifth left-wing Democrat to oust an incumbent member of Congress from her party since the start of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 including three this year,\u201d Paul Kane and Dave Weigel note.   AD   Also Tuesday, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a member of the four-woman \u201cSquad\u201d of liberals elected in 2018, dispatched a more moderate challenger in her own primary. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the highest-profile member of that group, routed former CNBC anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera in a June matchup that drew big-dollar contributions from a who\u2019s who of Wall Street titans.   \u201cThe insurgents and establishment figures disagree over the impact of these races, some dismissing the anti-establishment wins as unique to each campaign,\u201d Paul and Dave write. \u201cBut both sides agree that this movement feeds off victories, boosting fundraising for a slew of relatively new liberal PACs, and that losses would have starved them of political oxygen.\u201d   Jason Rosenstock, a financial services lobbyist with Thorn Run Partners, says his clients are busy gaming out not only the implications of different election outcomes but also the effect the newly assertive left could have on the direction of the Democratic Party. \u201cThe financial services industry is perpetually going to be attacked by the far left,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is, \u2018How far does that bleed into the general ethos of the Democratic Party?\u2019\u201d   Liberal activists hope to redeem political victories for legislative ones.   In the case of Fight Corporate Monopolies, its sister organization, the American Economic Liberties Project, is laying the groundwork for an antitrust lobbying offensive. It will push Democratic lawmakers and regulators to break up big businesses the group argues are distorting markets while hurting workers and consumers \u201cin sectors from contact lenses to cat food.\u201d   AD   AD   \u201cThere\u2019s a huge list of things we need to do to dig ourselves out of 40 years of deferring to monopolies,\u201d Sarah Miller, executive director of the project and a leader of Fight Corporate Monopolies, tells me.   Miller, a former Obama Treasury Department aide, says the concentration of corporate power has been \u201csupercharged by the pandemic. We\u2019re seeing the largest corporations make out like bandits and get all the support they could ask for, while support for families is time-limited and insufficient to provide stability and security.\u201d   The American Economic Liberties Project is laying out an agenda, shared here for the first time, that calls for a \u201cholistic reorientation of government\u2019s relationship to private power.\u201d While acknowledging there is \u201cno one-size-fits-all solution,\u201d it recommends a number of steps, including:   AD   AD   creating a public bank along the lines of the Depression-era Reconstruction Finance Corporation to help pandemic-ravaged businesses go through quick reorganizations;   adopting Warren\u2019s proposal to remake the private equity business model by making firms responsible for the employee pensions and debt obligations of the companies they buy;   providing for more muscular antitrust enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission;   directing Congress to conduct a \u201cthorough study of market concentration in the U.S.\";   and assessing the Federal Reserve\u2019s role in inequality while diversifying the central bank's leadership.   The group aims to tell a story about how little decisions in Washington can have big consequences.    Antitrust advocates got a boost from the headline-grabbing House Judiciary Committee hearing last week featuring the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), who presided over the hearing as chairman of the panel\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, concluded it by declaring it had \u201cmade one fact clear to me: These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up.\u201d   Miller argues the effort needs to go beyond Big Tech. Financial interests have figured prominently in the ads Fight Corporate Monopolies has funded so far because \u201cas regulators and policymakers have stepped back from structuring markets, Wall Street has stepped into that role \u2026 Wall Street is the entity that\u2019s shaping the structure of commerce in America, and part of our overall goal is to make sure policymakers perform that role and perform it well.\u201d   AD   AD   The ads share a theme, seeking to connect little-noticed moves by lawmakers that earn them corporate favor with outcomes the group argues hurt their own voters.   In one of the ads targeting Neal, the group accuses the House\u2019s top tax writer of doing the Blackstone Group\u2019s bidding by blocking an effort to stop surprise medical billing, a profit generator for the private equity giant\u2019s hospital holdings. \u201cCorporate power is corrupting democracy, and Richie Neal is part of the problem,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says.   Neal campaign spokeswoman Kate Norton called it a false attack. \u201cThe inconvenient truth for this dark money group is that the surprise billing measure they support would actually HURT hospitals and workers in Western and Central Mass, so Richie proposed his own bill,\u201d Norton said in a statement. \u201cAnd it\u2019s ironic that Alex Morse has built his entire campaign message about outside money while this is the first attack ad out the gate. It\u2019s another hypocritical move that Morse hopes no one will notice, but if he was standing in his principles he would denounce ads like this.\u201d Blackstone didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.   AD   AD   Faiz Shakir \u2014 Sanders\u2019s former campaign manager, an outside consultant to Fight Corporate Monopolies, and Miller\u2019s husband \u2014 says the group is funded by donors and institutions that share its agenda but declined to name them.   Latest on the federal pandemic response   Trump renews threat of executive action as an agreement remains elusive.   The president is taking more concrete steps toward a legally questionable outcome: \u201cTrump threatened to take executive action to extend an eviction moratorium, suspend collection of the payroll tax and boost unemployment benefits unless a coronavirus relief deal can be reached quickly with Democrats on Capitol Hill,\u201d Erica Werner, Karoun Demirjian and Jeff Stein report.   AD   \"And in a sign the White House could be preparing to act, the Trump administration has asked federal agencies to identify all of the money they have not yet spent from the $2 trillion Cares Act, which passed in March \u2026 White House officials are trying to determine whether this money could be redirected and used for other purposes, such as temporary unemployment benefits or the eviction moratorium.   AD   White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has set a Friday deadline: Meadows said further negotiation would be pointless if a deal doesn't happen by then. \u201cBut Democrats insisted they wanted to keep negotiating until they could reach agreement on an overall relief bill.\u201d   Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) addressed the prospect of administrative action: She said \u201cthat Trump might be able to extend the moratorium on evictions \u2014 which expired last month \u2014 on his own, but she argued that would be of limited use without money attached. Democrats are pushing for rental assistance and housing assistance as part of the talks.\"   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is facing some rare blowback: \u201cI want to get an outcome,\u201d McConnell told Politico yesterday. \u201cAnd I think the best way to get an outcome and to maximize the potential on our side \u2014 and we are divided on this \u2014 is to make sure everybody knows what\u2019s going on.   Where talks stand: \u201cTrump administration officials proposed reducing the figure to $400 weekly through early December,\u201d my colleagues report of movement on the $600 in weekly enhanced unemployment payments. But Democrats so far aren't budging from their demand to extend the benefit at its current level. Negotiators are set to meet again at 5 p.m. tonight.   There's also some movement on state aid: \u201cDemocrats are seeking about $1 trillion in new aid for states and localities that have laid off more than 1 million workers since February \u2026 Trump repeated his argument that Democrats want a \u2018bailout\u2019 of poorly managed states. The Trump administration is now offering $150 billion in state and local aid \u2026 Republicans are also arguing that other money \u2014 such as the $105 billion they support for schools \u2014 should qualify as state aid, an argument Democrats reject.\u201d   Economists say the lapse in extra employment benefits is hurting the recovery.   Payments ended last Friday: \u201cMany economists expect last week\u2019s expiration of $600 in enhanced weekly unemployment benefits to lead to a sharp drop-off in household spending and a setback for the U.S. economy\u2019s near-term recovery, even if the lapse turns out to be temporary,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Kate Davidson reports.   AD   \u201cThe average unemployed worker in the U.S. earns a little more than $300 a week on traditional jobless benefits. That isn\u2019t enough for many people to keep up with routine bills, [Trevon Logan, an economics professor at Ohio State University]. Missing those payments could trigger evictions, fines and late fees\u2014costs that consumers will try to avoid by pulling back on other kinds of spending, he said.\u201d   Coronavirus fallout   New jobs data on deck as Fed policymakers say pickup in infections is slowing recovery.   The economy was growing in May and June: \u201cBut growth stalled in July as infections spiked in some parts of the country, leading to fresh restrictions, U.S. central bankers said,\u201d Reuters's Jonnelle Marte reports. \u201cThe increase in infections has raised the downside risks to the economic outlook and suggests the reopening of the U.S. economy may be more protracted than many initially anticipated, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in a speech for the Liberal Arts Macroeconomics Conference.\u201d   AD   And Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told CNN, \u201cThe issue with the resurgence in the virus is it slowed down or somewhat muted the recovery we\u2019ve been expecting.\"   Hiring slowed dramatically in July: Businesses added only 167,000 workers to their private payrolls, a steep drop from analysts\u2019 expectations. \u201cThe numbers reported by ADP mark a significant departure from the more than 1 million jobs that some economists had predicted and a sharp falloff from hiring gains reported just a month prior, suggesting almost no sector of the U.S. economy has been untouched by the apparent new slowdown,\u201d Tony Romm reports.   New weekly jobless claims, out at 8:30 a.m. this morning, are expected to show 1.4 million filers, per Bloomberg's consensus estimate. That would mark a negligible decline from the prior week.   The numbers have remained stubbornly high since late June. \u201cThat halted what had been a swift decline from a peak of 6.9 million in late March, when the pandemic and business closures shut down parts of the U.S. economy,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Eric Morath reports. The level recorded in recent weeks remains well above the highest on record before this year, which was 695,000 in 1982.\"   July jobs report out Friday will shed more light. \u201cEconomists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast the report to show 1.5 million jobs were added last month and the unemployment rate fell to 10.6% from 11.1% in June,\u201d Morath writes. \u201cWhile those would be historically strong gains, they would also be a marked slowdown from the pace of the prior two months with unemployment still well above pre-pandemic levels.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42775269575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HT-81W1-JCSC-J4C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2251\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002L7A</classCode><className>BLACKSTONE GROUP LP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS525990 OTHER FINANCIAL VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS523999 MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>BX (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Blackstone Group Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blackstone Group Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blackstone Group Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blackstone Group Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blackstone Group Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blackstone Group Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blackstone Group Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blackstone Group Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>BX</className><className>NYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>BX</className><className>MEX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>BBN1</className><className>MUN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>BBN1</className><className>BER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>BBN1</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>0HO8</className><className>LTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>BBN1</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>BBN1</className><className>DUS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

They turned the former New York mayor into an avatar for out-of-touch Wall Street wealth - and attacked him with more gusto than the president they are all ultimately aiming to replace.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) landed the most punishing blows, lighting into the multi-billionaire over a history of off-color remarks; failing so far to produce his tax returns; the treatment of women at his financial data company; the stop-and-frisk policing policy he instituted as New York mayor; and past comments suggesting red-lining reform, rather than the big banks, drove the financial crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"So I'd like to talk about who we're running against, a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians.' And, no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg,\" Warren said just minutes into the debate. \"Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop and frisk.\"</p><p>See some of Warren's opening salvo here:\u00a0</p><p>Bloomberg absorbed the blows more than he parried them. In the face of attacks from the Massachusetts Democrat, in particular, he conjured the image of             financiers who have withered             before her pointed questioning from the Senate Banking Committee.          </p><p>Indeed, at one point, Warren commandeered the role of the moderators to press Bloomberg on whether he would release female former employees from nondisclosure agreements signed after they sued him so they can discuss their experiences at his company. Here's how some of that went:</p><p>Warren: So, Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements, so we can hear their side of the story?Bloomberg: We have a very few nondisclosure agreements.Warren: How many is that?Bloomberg: Let me finish.Warren: How many is that?Bloomberg: None of them accuse me of doing anything, other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told. And let me just -- and let me -- there's agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet and that's up to them. They signed those agreements, and we'll live with it.</p><p>Bloomberg's response drew boos from the crowd and jeers on Twitter. There, a consensus emerged that the more than $400 million the candidate already has poured into his bid from his own pocket was a steep price for the privilege of enduring such abuse on national television.</p><p>From former Obama advisor David Axelrod:\u00a0</p><p>From the American Enterprise Institute's Jim Pethokoukis:\u00a0</p><p>From elections analyst Stu Rothenberg:</p><p>From Republican lobbyist Bruce Mehlman:\u00a0</p><p>And here's how it played on the front pages of Bloomberg's hometown tabloids. From the New York Post:\u00a0</p><p>And the New York Daily News:</p><p>             Warren's campaign highlighted the exchange online and in a fundraising blitz that her team             said             netted more than $1 million. \"Tonight, Elizabeth got on the debate stage, took on an arrogant billionaire, and won. And with your help, she'll do it again in November,\" a Warren email solicitation said.</p><p>             The question for Bloomberg in the coming days will be whether his formidable campaign operation can steam past the damage the candidate left on the debate stage. By one snap test, the answer is that the Bloomberg team has some cleanup work to do. My colleague Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports the candidate's performance alarmed one key constituency that has been torn between Bloomberg and former vice president Joe Biden:</p><p>Bloomberg arguably found firmer footing mixing it up with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who entered the night leading the official delegate count and in the latest Washington Post-ABC News national poll.</p><p>Sanders, defending his comment that billionaires shouldn't exist, took aim again at Bloomberg. \"We have enormous problems facing this country, and we cannot continue seeing a situation where, in the last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth - congratulations, Mr. Bloomberg - but the average American last year saw less than a 1 percent increase in his or her income,\" he said.</p><p>Bloomberg replied that he couldn't \"speak for all billionaires. All I know is I've been very lucky, made a lot of money, and I'm giving it all away to make this country better.\" And he defended how much he's made. \"I worked very hard for it,\" he said.\u00a0          </p><p>             It was a missed opportunity for Bloomberg to             talk up his plan             to raise $5 trillion from higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations or             plug the Wall Street reform plan             he released this week to qualified but mostly positive reviews from industry critics.          </p><p>But he returned to the broader issue of inequality and Democratic prescriptions for it several minutes later. \"What a wonderful country we have. The best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses,\" he said of Sanders. \"What did I miss here?\"</p><p>And he said while he disagrees with Warren's proposal to impose a wealth tax on net worths greater than $50 million - with a surcharge on those worth more than $1 billion - he does back higher taxes on top incomes. \"We should raise taxes on the rich. I did that as mayor in New York City. I raised taxes,\" he said. \"And if you take a look at my plans, the first thing I would do is try to convince Congress, because they've got to do it, we can't just order it, to roll back\" Trump's tax cuts.\u00a0</p><p>             Mostly, though, Bloomberg's presence served to unify a cast of candidates that was otherwise as fractious as ever on one point: That he is wrong person to lead the party into its fight for the White House. Bloomberg reflected his isolation midway through the debate. \"I can't think of a way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get re-elected than listening to this conversation,\" he said.</p><p>Trump, who has focused his attention on Bloomberg in recent days, dedicated his one comment about the debate to trashing the candidate's debut:</p><p>             Prediction markets registered a steep drop in Bloomberg's perceived chances, with the site Election Betting Odds showing a 12.5 percent falloff in his odds of capturing the nomination. The Bloomberg camp itself indicated he has to improve when he appears in the next debate, set for Tuesday in South Carolina. \"Everyone wanted him to lose his cool. He didn't do it,\" Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a post-debate statement, adding, \"He was just warming up tonight.\"       </p><p>You are reading              The Finance 202          , our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.</p><p>- Investors eye coronavirus spread beyond China.Bloomberg News's Tom Redmond and Abhishek Vishnoi: \"Investors are growing increasingly concerned about the rise in coronavirus cases outside China, threatening gains in riskier assets that propelled the S&amp;P 500 Index to an all-time high this week. A spike in confirmed infections in South Korea and two more deaths in Japan jolted markets on Thursday, sending the won and Singapore dollar down as much as 1%. Asian shares slid to a two-week low, and some money managers said they're bracing for further losses...\u00a0</p><p>          \"While China reported a sharp decline in new infections, the country's shifting reporting guidelines have raised doubts about the reliability of data from the center of the outbreak. South Korea reported its first death from the virus Thursday while cases surged to 104, and infections in Japan shot up in the past week. In Singapore, more than 80 people have contracted the virus.\"       </p><p>             Fed flagged the virus at January meeting.NYT's Jeanna Smialek: \"Federal Reserve officials left interest rates unchanged at their January meeting as the economy grew steadily, but they spent their meeting reviewing risks to the outlook - including fresh concerns about the coronavirus that had begun to take hold in China.</p><p>\"Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's Jan. 28 and 29 meeting showed that officials called the new coronavirus 'a new risk to the global growth outlook.' At the time, the outbreak had killed more than 100 people and sickened about 5,000. It has continued to spread since, causing more than 2,000 deaths and infecting more than 75,000 people. Central bankers have been cautious about predicting how much the virus will affect the United States economy, though they have made it clear that they expect some spillover.\"</p><p>             Oxford Economics: Virus will cause global growth to skid this year. The macroeconomic forecasting firm projects the outbreak will cut global GDP growth to 2.3 percent this year, \"its weakest since 2009.\" In the firm's worst-case scenario, the firm says in a new research note, \"the US and eurozone would enter technical recessions in the first half of 2020... However, we find this would be followed by a rapid recovery so that such a worldwide pandemic inflicts a short, but very sharp, shock on the world economy.\"</p><p>- Housing market remains strong: \"U.S. homebuilding fell less than expected in January while permits surged to a near 13-year high, pointing to sustained housing market strength that could help keep the longest economic expansion in history on track,\" Reuters's Lucia Mutikani reports.</p><p>\"Other data ... showed producer prices increasing by the most in more than a year last month, boosted by rises in the cost of services such as healthcare and hotel accommodation. The reports could support the Federal Reserve's desire to keep interest rates unchanged at least through this year after lowering borrowing costs three times in 2019.\"</p><p>             TRUMP WATCH:          </p><p>- White House advisers float minimum tax on corporations: \"Economic advisers to the White House have suggested [Trump] propose a new minimum tax on corporations as part of his election year 'tax cut 2.0' package, two people briefed on the planning said, hoping to address criticism that the 2017 tax law allowed many of the country's largest firms to virtually eliminate their federal tax burden,\" my colleague Jeff Stein reports.</p><p>\"The idea, which is part of preliminary discussions and has not been officially endorsed, could attempt to blunt criticism from Democrats that the GOP tax law allowed many large corporations to wipe out their federal corporate taxes altogether. The plan could also help generate revenue that might be used to offset the impact of new, middle class tax cuts. Trump has promised he would roll out a middle class tax plan before the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0</p><p> \"The 2017 tax law lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, but it allowed companies to continuing using loopholes and tax breaks to lower their taxes even further. The tax law also eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was supposed to prevent companies from overusing deductions to avoid paying any taxes.\"</p><p>- Barr raises possibility tech companies may be held liable for dangerous posts: \"U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr blasted Big Tech, raising the specter that Silicon Valley might soon be held accountable for a wide array of dangerous, harmful content that critics say has flourished on their sites and services,\" my colleague Tony Romm reports.</p><p>\"At an event that laid bare tech's broad troubles - including the spread of terrorism, illicit drug sales and child sexual exploitation online - Barr said it may be time for the government to seek sweeping changes to a key portion of federal law, known as Section 230, that long has spared tech companies from liability for content posted by their users. Barr's shot at Silicon Valley offers the latest evidence that regulators in Washington - Democrats and Republicans alike - believe some of the federal safeguards that helped incubate the Internet have become hindrances, preventing law enforcement and aggrieved users from obtaining justice when people are harmed.\"</p><p>TRADE FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>- India\u00a0looms\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0trade\u00a0conversation:\u00a0\"\u00a0You may have missed it amid headlines of the U.S. trade war with China, but a low-intensity trade conflict with Asia's other emerging giant is also smoldering. It began a year ago when the U.S. stripped India of special low-tariff status over claims it discriminated against American companies. India responded by implementing tariffs it had previously threatened over U.S. steel duties,\" Greg Ip writes in the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>\"Trump travels to India next week where he may reach some sort of truce with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the underlying conflict will likely persist, because it is driven by forces similar to those behind the trade war with China. In essence, Modi seeks to replicate the formula that made China the world's No. 2 economy by welcoming foreign investment while protecting more of the domestic market for Indian companies.\"</p><p>- WH: Trade uncertainty weighed on growth.Bloomberg News's Rich Miller: \"The White House acknowledged what many economists considered obvious through much of last year: [Trump's] trade stance depressed economic growth and business investment. 'Uncertainty generated by trade negotiations dampened investment,' Trump chief economist Tomas Philipson told reporters in a briefing on the annual Economic Report of the President released on Thursday. The admission contrasted with Trump's repeated assertions that his tariff tactics hadn't hurt the economy while swelling the government's tax coffers.\"       </p><p>- China expels three WSJ reporters: \"China revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing, the first time the Chinese government has expelled multiple journalists simultaneously from one international news organization since the country began re-engaging with the world in the post-Mao era,\" the WSJ reports.</p><p>China's Foreign Ministry said the move \"was punishment for a recent opinion piece published by the Journal. The expulsions by China's Foreign Ministry followed widespread public anger at the headline on the Feb. 3 opinion piece, which referred to China as 'the real sick man of Asia.' The ministry and state-media outlets had repeatedly called attention to the headline in statements and posts on social media and had threatened unspecified consequences.\"</p><p>- Breaking: Morgan Stanley is buying E*Trade.WSJ's Liz Hoffman: \"Morgan Stanley is buying E*Trade Financial Corp. in a $13 billion deal that will reshape the storied investment bank and firmly stake its future on managing money for regular people. The all-stock takeover, set to be announced Thursday, will combine a Wall Street firm in the late innings of a decade-long turnaround with a discount broker built on the backs of dot-com day traders. It is the biggest takeover by a giant U.S. bank since the 2008 crisis.</p><p>\"E*Trade brings five million retail customers, their $360 billion in assets and an online bank with cheap deposits that Morgan Stanley can funnel into loans. Its CEO, Michael Pizzi, is coming along to run the e-brokerage business, which will keep its brand, its handful of retail storefronts and its buzzy and well-funded ad campaigns, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said.\"</p><p>- T-Mobile owner wants company to lead U.S. market: \"Deutsche Telekom is aiming to become market leader in the United States, CEO Tim Hoettges said ... now that a deal for its T-Mobile U.S. unit to take over Sprint is within reach,\" Reuters's Douglas Busvine reports.</p><p>\"Striking a bullish tone after a New York judge threw out a petition brought by a dozen U.S. states to block the deal, Hoettges said the 'new' T-Mobile would go on the attack and look to close a valuation gap with AT&amp;T and Verizon. Hoettges, 57, has campaigned for seven years to do a U.S. deal that, on completion, would create a transatlantic business with $120 billion in revenues and 270 million customers.\"</p><p>- UBS names new CEO: \"UBS Group AG Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti is stepping down and will be succeeded by current ING Groep NV boss Ralph Hamers, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday, marking another leadership change at a major Swiss bank,\" WSJ's Margot Patrick reports.</p><p>\"Ermotti has been UBS's CEO since 2011 and was expected to announce his departure\u00a0this year or next. He led UBS through a post-financial-crisis restructuring and repositioned it as a global wealth manager serving billionaires and entrepreneurs. Hamers, an ING veteran, has been that bank's chief executive since 2013.\"</p><p>- Investment funds distance themselves from Sacklers: \"Two hedge funds are reducing their ties to the embattled Sackler family that owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP,\" WSJ's Juliet Chung and Jared S. Hopkins reports.</p><p>\"DeepCurrents Investment Group LLC and Sunriver Management LLC have each redeemed investments by a private Sackler investment firm, Kokino LLC, according to people familiar with the changes. Kokino is the family office of Jonathan Sackler, a former Purdue board director and the son of a Purdue co-founder ... Sunriver's relocation was at least partly driven by a desire to reduce ties with the Sacklers, according to people familiar with the fund's management.\"</p><p>- Big Pharma looks a little smaller now: \"The drug industry doesn't pack the lobbying punch it once did, and one sign is something rare in the capital today-a dose of bipartisanship,\" WSJ's Brody Mullins and Stephanie Armour report.</p><p>\"Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) joined Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to write a bill last July to regulate prescription-drug prices, an idea the industry has bottled up since the 1960s. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sponsored a bill in May to block drug companies from using patent laws to delay lower-priced drugs ... A growing rift between the GOP and longtime drug-industry allies is shaking up pharmaceutical policy, and for the first time in a generation, some Republicans and Democrats are joining to overhaul drug-price regulation.\"</p><p>How the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls compare when it comes to proposed tax hikes on corporations, via Bloomberg News's Laura Davison:\u00a0</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Friday:          </p><p>Via the Post's Tom Toles:\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-411dabcf210f40b999bc1a4658bdee2d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y81-2511-JB4M-V05M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3065\"/><timeReceived>1:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001RFI</classCode><className>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC8733 NONCOMMERCIAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Alternative Minimum Tax</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OENENEIwOTM4MDNBNDY5QjlCN0VEMzEyRUEyMkZBM0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgzOTg4MERGN0Y4NEU5MEI1QkQyMDgzNTE0QzRGMjM</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Minimum &amp;

And how companies connected to the political elite, members of Congress and President Trump benefited from the program.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Treasury and Small Business Administration officials say the program, which had an average loan size of $107,000, helped save 51 million jobs. That's according to self-reported data provided by borrowers. Yesterday's \"PPP disclosure           includes the names of 660,000 small businesses and nonprofit organizations that received at least $150,000 in funding. Although that is less than 15 percent of the total number of loans, it is the most detailed disclosure yet on one of the largest economic stimulus packages created by the federal government, part of the $2 trillion Cares Act,\" Jonathan O'Connell, Aaron Gregg, Steven Rich and Anu Narayanswamy report. (You can search through all loans larger than $1 million here.)\u00a0</p><p>             But don't celebrate just yet: About             90,000 employers either said they would not retain any jobs despite the loans or declined to say how many they'd retain             . \"Among the loan recipients, 48,922 reported zero as the number of jobs they would retain with the money and 40,506 appeared to leave that section blank,\" my colleagues write. \"It appeared that 10 other companies received between $5 million and $10 million but reported retaining only one job with the money.\"\u00a0</p><p>             The data exposed some political land mines as both Republican and Democratic allies and targets accepted federal support.\u00a0</p><p>\"Several members of Congress are benefiting from loans, including some who were directly involved in shaping regulations and some who benefited from a blanket waiver of ethics concerns for some federal officials seeking loans,\" my Post colleagues write.\u00a0</p><p>             \"             Other lawmakers have family members who work for companies that, at some point, reaped benefits from the small business loans program,\" per Politico. For instance, \"Rep. Susie Lee's (D-Nev.) husband is the CEO of a regional casino developer, Full House Resorts, which took a $5.6 million Paycheck Protection Program loan.\"</p><p>             Businesses tied to President Trump's inner circle received as much as $21 million in government loans, ProPublica's\u00a0 Jack Gillum, Isaac Arnsdorf, Jake Pearson and Mike Spies report.\u00a0</p><p>             That includes son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner's family: Per the Daily Beast: \"Records show $350,000 to $1 million went to Observer Holdings LLC, the parent entity of Observer Media - the publishing company formerly owned [Kushner]. Kushner resigned from the news organization before decamping to Washington, D.C. in 2017, but it has remained in the family: Joseph Meyer, wedded to Kushner's sister, Nicole, lists it among the holdings of his Observer Capital investment firm. The federal assistance preserved 41 jobs, according to the SBA.\"</p><p>             \"Dozens of tenants of [Trump's] real estate company also received funds, reviving questions about conflicts of interest brought by the president's continued ownership of his company while in office,\" my Post colleagues report.\u00a0</p><p>             And \"             Monday's list included a Manhattan law firm whose marquee attorney has fiercely defended Trump for almost two decades,\" per ProPublica. \"Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP - whose managing partner, Marc Kasowitz, was at one point the president's top lawyer in the special counsel's Russia investigation - was set to receive between $5 million and $10 million from Citibank, data show.\"\u00a0       </p><p>             Other notable loan recipients include ...\u00a0          </p><p>             A number of political organizations: \"The Ohio Democratic Party got at least $150,000 and the Florida Democratic Party Building Fund got at least $350,000, while the Women's National Republican Club of New York got at least $350,000 and the Black Republican Caucus in Florida got at least $150,000,\" CNBC's Lauren Hirsch and Jacob Pramuk report.\u00a0</p><p>             Organizations tied to three congressional caucuses: \"The educational arms for the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus each took loans between $350,000 and $1 million, according to the Small Business Administration,\" per Politico. \"Both of the nonprofits have members of Congress on their board of directors.\"\u00a0</p><p>             More than two dozen Washington lobbying, public affairs and consulting firms, per Politico's Theodoric Meyer. \"Firms that derive more than 50 percent of their revenue from lobbying or political work are barred from receiving the loans - which can be forgiven if companies meet certain benchmarks - under the agency's rules... But several lobbying firms secured loans through the Paycheck Protection Program despite the rules, including Van Scoyoc Associates, the No. 10 lobbying firm in town last year by revenue.\"\u00a0       </p><p>             Numerous news organizations: \"Forbes Media got at least $5 million; The Washington Times got at least $1 million; The Washingtonian got at least $350,000; The Daily Caller received at least $350,000 and The Daily Caller News Foundation got at least $150,000; The American Prospect received at least $150,000,\" per CBNC.\u00a0</p><p>             Politically-connected companies: \"The law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, whose chairman David Boies has represented powerful clients such as former Vice President Al Gore in the Bush v. Gore Supreme Court case, received between $5 million and $10 million ... Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao's family's business, Foremost Maritime, got a loan valued at between $350,000 and $1 million. Chao is the wife of [McConnell] ... Perdue Inc., a trucking company co-founded by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, was approved for $150,000 to $350,000 in loan money,\" CNBC's Lauren Hirsch and Jacob Pramuk report. (The Transportation Department said in a statement to my Post colleagues: \"[Chao] has no connection to the business and she had no idea a loan was obtained.\")\u00a0</p><p>Planned Parenthood: The Trump administration and GOP lawmakers previously signaled a political fight over Planned Parenthood's acceptance of loans. Per my Post colleagues, \"the data lists 43 Planned Parenthood locations across the country that received a combined $60 million in loans.\"</p><p>             A foundation connected to Grover Norquist: \"The Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, a conservative-allied group headed by anti-tax activist Grover Norquist\" took a loan between $150,000 and $350,000, Bloomberg News's Ben Brody reports. The Ayn Rand Institute was approved for $350,000 to $1 million.</p><p>             Many in the Twitterverse cautioned against shaming those who accepted support.          </p><p>             MSNBC's Chris Hayes:          </p><p>             Former Senate GOP aide Liam Donovan:          </p><p>             Still, some pointed out the relative irony of some politicos taking federal money. From Axios's Jonathan Swan:\u00a0</p><p>There's no question the data will affect the discussion when lawmakers return from recess.\u00a0</p><p>McConnell said that lawmakers will consider the next and potentially final phase of stimulus when Congress reconvenes later this month, The Post's Erica Werner, Jeff Stein and Rachael Bade report.\u00a0</p><p>             Big companies did not shy away from the program.          </p><p>             Early headlines about             Shake Shack             and the Lakers returning money didn't scare everyone away: \"Recipients of loans between $5 million and $10 million include several prominent restaurant owners: PF Changs, a chain of more than 200 U.S. restaurants acquired by Paulson &amp; Co and Triartisan Capital Advisors last year; Legal Sea Foods, a chain whose investors include Graycliff Partners; and Silver Diner, the chain of diners listed as part of the portfolio of Goode Partners,\" per my colleagues.</p><p>             And some ultrarich politicians got in on the action: West Virginia's billionaire governor and his family received millions: Gov. Jim Justice (R) received up to $24 million in loans for his luxury hotel and an adjacent residential development along with two coal companies owned by his family, ProPublica's Ken Ward Jr. reports. Justice, according to Forbes, is the richest man in his state.\u00a0</p><p>             So did musician and designer Kanye: Yeezy, the clothing brand founded by West that was valued as much as $3 billion, who said he was running for president over the holiday weekend, received a loan between $2 million and 5 million.\u00a0</p><p>But coronavirus isn't over yet - and it's still unclear whether small businesses can weather the storm.\u00a0</p><p>\"More local and state leaders on Monday embraced new restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus as the United States entered its 28th day reporting record-high average infections,\" Joshua Partlow and Nick Miroff report. Some state and local officials are considering slowing or reversing their plans to open. \"In Miami-Dade County, authorities reversed course on a reopening plan, issuing an emergency order that shut down gyms, party venues and restaurants, with exceptions for takeout and delivery.\"       </p><p>             People are wary about resuming normal life: A Gallup tracking poll found last week that 72 percent of Americans said the better advice for healthy people is to stay home as much as possible - a number that hasn't been this high since early May. The survey also found a growing number of Americans (62 percent) said they avoided going to public places such as stores or restaurants in the last week, a number far below its late March peak but still managed to be the worst for June.</p><p>From the U.S.:</p><p>From the corporate front:</p><p>Around the world:</p><p>U.S. business groups urge Beijing to implement trade deal.</p><p>             China's commitment is being questioned as relations worsen: \"As senior U.S. and Chinese economic officials plan to discuss China's compliance with a trade deal signed early this year, more than 40 American business groups called on Beijing to step up purchases of U.S. manufactured goods as well as energy and other products as part of the agreement,\" the WSJ's Lingling Wei and Bob Davis report.</p><p>\"In a letter sent ... to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the business associations, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, voiced strong support for the 'Phase One' trade pact but pressed both sides-especially China-to 'redouble efforts to implement all aspects of the Agreement.' Beijing has focused on agricultural purchases, which [Trump] made the core of his demands during two years of negotiations. Chinese officials believe that if they keep ramping up such purchases, that will help keep the deal alive, according to people with knowledge of Beijing's thinking.\"</p><p>             Big tech companies suspend cooperation with Hong Kong law enforcement: \"Google, Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. are among tech companies that have suspended processing requests for user data from Hong Kong law-enforcement agencies following China's imposition of a national-security law on the city,\" the WSJ's Newley Purnell reports.</p><p>\"The moves have put U.S. technology titans on a potential collision course with Beijing, after China fast-tracked the national-security legislation that includes a provision mandating local authorities to take measures to supervise and regulate the city's previously unfettered internet.\"</p><p>Britain may hand the U.S. another win in Huawei battle: \"Prime Minister Boris Johnson signaled that his government may be shifting its stance on Huawei and moving to further limit the Chinese telecom giant's role in building Britain's fifth-generation mobile phone network,\" William Booth reports from London.</p><p>\"Any decision to phase out Huawei products would represent a significant win for the United States, which has lobbied for Britain and Europe to avoid Huawei on the grounds that the Chinese technology could leave allied countries vulnerable to espionage. A British U-turn on Huawei would also add another point of friction with China. The two countries have already been clashing over Beijing's \u00adcrackdown on political freedoms and a strict new security law for Hong Kong.\"</p><p>             E.U. lawmakers make it easier to retaliate in trade disputes.          </p><p>             Officials are taking notice of U.S. actions: \"EU trade chief Phil Hogan said the recent launch of a series of new U.S. trade investigations was totally unacceptable,\" Reuters's Philip Blenkinsop reports.</p><p>\"The proposal could be watered down after negotiations with EU governments, but clearly signals a willingness in Brussels to get tougher on trade.\"</p><p>             Uber acquires Postmates for $2.6 billion.          </p><p>             The move expands the ride-hailing company's second-biggest venture: \"The $2.65 billion all-stock deal announced streamlines the industry to three major competitors: Uber, DoorDash and Grubhub. In a conference call announcing the deal, Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said there is 'plenty of room' for three players in the U.S. delivery market, and the Postmates deal would allow Uber Eats to become more efficient, lower costs and increase options for customers,\" Faiz Siddiqui and Taylor Telford report.</p><p>\"The deal comes after weeks of speculation that Uber was in talks to acquire a rival food delivery app after it first expressed interest in Chicago-based Grubhub. That possibility was put to rest last month when the app company was bought by Netherlands-based Just Eat Takeaway in a deal valued at $7.3 billion, far more than Uber is paying for the much smaller Postmates ... \u00a0With Postmates under its belt, Ives estimates Uber Eats will control about a third of the delivery market - far behind DoorDash's 44 percent.\"</p><p>             SiriusXM to buy Stitcher podcasting platform: \"Sirius XM Holdings Inc. is near a deal to buy E.W. Scripps Co.'s Stitcher Inc. podcasting unit for around $300 million ...,\" the WSJ's Anne Steele reports.</p><p>\"The satellite-radio giant is working to expand into the rapidly growing podcasting industry, following similar moves by media and tech companies including Spotify Technology SA and iHeartMedia Inc.Stitcher runs a free podcast listening app and a premium $4.99 monthly service that lets subscribers listen to podcasts without ads. It also owns podcast networks including Earwolf and Stitcher Podcasts, with 50 shows including 'Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend' and 'Freakonomics Radio.'\"</p><p>Walmart, Target dropping Redskins merchandise: \"Retail giant Walmart announced it will no longer sell merchandise for Washington's NFL team, following the franchise's move to reevaluate its name, a dictionary-defined racial slur,\" Hamza Shaban reports.</p><p>\"The moves come as controversy over the team's name, and the owner's longtime refusal to change it, has received renewed attention.

Griffiths   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is pushing ahead with a slimmed-down economic relief package, setting up a Thursday vote for a bill he unveiled yesterday.    But prospects for a bipartisan breakthrough remain remote, even as the legislative window on Capitol Hill narrows and economists warn a sputtering recovery demands new Washington spending.   \u201cThe legislation is not expected to advance, since that would require support from Democrats, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the measure \u2018pathetic,\u2019\u201d Erica Werner writes of the state-of-play on the effort to provide more support for an economy rocked by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cMcConnell has struggled even to unite Republicans behind the measure, and is likely to suffer some GOP defections.\u201d   So what might look like earnest efforts to reach agreement in coming days will amount to political positioning . Meanwhile, 29 million jobless Americans are still relying on some form on unemployment insurance. Enhanced federal benefits to help those out of work make ends meet expired at the end of July, and only six states are handing out $300 a week meant as a temporary patch. The unemployment rate ticked down to 8.4 percent in August, but the economy has replaced roughly half of the 22 million jobs it has lost since the pandemic struck. And measures of sentiment show consumer and small business confidence turning increasingly pessimistic.    \u201cWe do think it will get harder from here, because of those areas of the economy that are so directly affected by the pandemic still,\u201d Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell told NPR in an interview Friday. \u201cThere \u2019 s going to be a long period, we believe, where we \u2019 ll have to take our time and see those people get back to work.\u201d   Yet the White House is playing down the need for a new relief package as President Trump touts an economy he says is already roaring back . \u201cThis will be a self-sustaining economic recovery with very big numbers in Q3 and Q4,\u201d Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, told Fox News.   One development that could grab some attention in the White House: The stock market, one of Trump\u2019s preferred gauges, continued a dramatic three-day slide. There\u2019s little evidence investor fear of a backsliding recovery is fueling the sell-off. (Rather, a collapse in big tech names is dragging the major indexes lower.) But some top Wall Street economists continue to predict lawmakers will reach a deal on a relief package by the end of the month.  McConnell is aiming to use the package to put pressure on Democrats.  \u201cSenate Republicans and administration officials believe Pelosi will come under growing pressure from moderate members of her own caucus who face tough reelections and have been uneasy about the failure to act on additional economic stimulus,\u201d Werner writes. \u201cMcConnell\u2019s new legislation is partly an attempt to attract the attention of such lawmakers.\u201d   But Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) were quick to dismiss the Republican leader\u2019s proposal , with Schumer calling it \u201cone of the most cynical moves I have ever seen.\u201d   McConnell\u2019s bill, which comes with an approximately $500 billion price tag, would:  Provide jobless Americans with an extra $300 a week in extra federal benefits through the end of the year, down from the $600 boost they received through July. Resupply the Paycheck Protection Program with an additional $250 billion to fund a second round of forgivable loans to small businesses. And offer $150 billion for schools; $47 billion for testing, tracing and vaccine development; $20 billion for farmers; and $10 billion each for child-care support services and to forgive a loan to the U.S. Postal Service, per Werner.  It would not provide state and local governments with money to relieve budget crunches they are facing \u2014 nor would it fund another round of relief checks to lower- and middle-income Americans. McConnell proposes to offset some of the cost of the package by repurposing $350 billion in unspent funds from the first Cares Act.   But there is no sign yet of bipartisan talks reviving. And the top line of McConnell's offer marks a major step back from the $1.5 trillion the Trump administration signaled it could support before its own negotiations with congressional Democrats broke down last month , Werner notes. The Republican leader's proposal highlights how far apart the two sides remain:  Wall Street hasn\u2019t reckoned with the likelihood that Washington remains deadlocked on economic relief.  Goldman Sachs economists acknowledged in a Tuesday note that \u201cfiscal stimulus looks like a much closer call than it did a couple of months ago amid mounting signs of trouble.\u201d Yet the team still thinks Congress is \u201cslightly more likely than not to enact a stimulus package by the end of the September.\u201d And Morgan Stanley is projecting lawmakers adopt a $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion package this month that reduces unemployment to 7.6 percent by the end of the year.   Not all Wall Street strategists are as bullish.   David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, is dialing back his expectations for an agreement. \u201cMany Senate Republicans seem unwilling to support a big bill, perhaps because it would seem to contradict their narrative that the economy is well on the road to recovery,\u201d he writes in a note. \u201cMeanwhile, House Democrats appear unwilling to compromise in favor of a skinny bill for fear that it would allow the President to goose up the economy just before election day and suggest that the status quo in Washington is working.\u201d   Market movers U.S. stocks continue slide after holiday weekend.  Big tech lost particularly big: \u201cThe Dow Jones industrial average shed 632.42 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 27,500.89. The Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 index dropped 95.12 points, or 2.8 percent, to settle at 3,331.84, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 465.44 points, or 4.1 percent, to end at 10,847.69,\u201d Hamza Shaban and Hannah Denham report .   \u201cAmazon gave up 4.4 percent, Facebook shed 4.1 percent and Alphabet fell 3.6 percent. And biotechnological firm Moderna, which is working on a coronavirus vaccine candidate, lost nearly 13.2 percent.\u201d (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)  Tesla experienced its worst single-day loss in its history: \u201cShares tumbled, after Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker was left out of the S&amp;P 500 by the committee that decides on new additions to the index,\u201d CNBC \u2019 s Ryan Browne and Jessica Bursztynsky report . Coronavirus fallout From the U.S.: AstraZeneca pauses vaccine study . \u201cLate-stage studies of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine candidate are on temporary hold while the company investigates whether a recipient\u2019s \u2018potentially unexplained\u2019 illness is a side effect of the shot,\u201d the Associated Press reports . \"In a statement issued Tuesday evening, the company said its \u2018standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data.\u2019\u201d Fauci says a vaccine is \u201cunlikely\u201d by the election: Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said \u201ci t\u2019s more likely a vaccine will be ready by \u2018the end of the year\u2019 as drug companies Moderna and Pfizer race to complete patient enrollment for their late-stage vaccine trials by the end of September,\u201d CNBC's Berkeley Lovelace Jr. reports . Doctors are shifting their approach: \u201cThey are shifting large portions of their patients to virtual telehealth visits. They are being forced to make do with less revenue, some of which may never come back. Medical associations say some doctors are retiring early or joining larger groups as they seek strength in numbers,\u201d Christopher Rowland reports . Los Angeles County has banned trick or treating this year: \u201cDoor-to-door trick-or-treating is banned because it can be very difficult to maintain proper social distancing on porches and at front doors especially in neighborhoods that are popular with trick or treaters,' the county's Department of Public Health said in a news release,\" CNN's Sarah Moon and Madeline Holcombe report . From the corporate front: Boston Fed chief: Congress needs to clarify whether Main Street lending program can take bigger risks . The move could make it easier for the Fed to get more money to struggling businesses. \u201c Of the program\u2019s $600 billion pot, $1.2 billion in loans had been completed as of Thursday, [Boston Fed president Eric] Rosengren told The Washington Post last week,\u201d Rachel Siegel reports .  Bankrupt retailers struggle to clear inventory: \u201cFirms that specialize in winding down stores say liquidating now is markedly different from what it was before the pandemic. Companies are offering deeper discounts to win over consumers \u2014 with sales starting at 40 percent off instead of the usual 20 percent \u2014 as well as other incentives. Even then, results can be spotty,\u201d Abha Bhattarai reports . Shopify is suddenly worth $117 billion: The company \u201ccharges sellers a monthly fee and takes a percentage of every transaction on its platform. Its revenue nearly doubled to $714.3 million in the second quarter as the number of new stores created on Shopify increased 71 percent compared with the previous quarter,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Inti Pacheco reports . Lululemon quarterly sales top expectations: \u201cBut its stock fell by more than 6 percent in after-hours trading as investors looked for more \u2026CEO Calvin McDonald said the retailer is \u2018cautiously optimistic\u2019 about the rest of the year,\u201d CNBC's Lauren Thomas reports . Campaign 2020 Trump weighs opening up his wallet for his campaign.  The president has discussed the matter, but many are skeptical he'll follow through: \u201cThe billionaire president has talked about the idea with multiple people, though he hasn\u2019t yet committed to any self-funding \u2026 Though Trump personally contributed $66 million to his 2016 campaign, it would be unprecedented for an incumbent president to put his own money toward winning a second term,\u201d Bloomberg News's Jennifer Jacobs, Mario Parker, and Bill Allison report .   \u201cIf I have to, I would,\u201d Trump said Tuesday of putting money into his campaign. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have to,\u201d he told reporters.  Trump flips on banning oil drilling amid a sensitive political environment.  The president is trying to fashion himself into an environmentalist: \u201cTrump, who barely two years ago proposed a vast expansion of oil and gas drilling in U.S. continental waters, on Tuesday made clear there is at least part of the nation\u2019s coastline he is eager to protect: the crucial electoral battleground of Florida,\u201d Brady Dennis and Dino Grandoni report .   \u201cTrump announced plans to extend a moratorium on oil drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, an area that includes the Sunshine State\u2019s west coast, as well as expanding it to include the Atlantic coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina \u2026 For a president who has spent much of his first term working to expand U.S. oil and gas drilling and scale back Obama-era regulations on the fossil fuel industry, the move also underscores the political reality in Florida, where Republican governors have opposed oil exploration off their shores, fearing it could imperil beaches and harm the tourism-dependent economy.\u201d  Biden set to unveil plan to stop offshoring: The former vice president stumps in Michigan today where \u201che\u2019ll unveil a new policy aimed at tackling offshoring -- the practice of U.S. companies basing some operations in lower-tax countries -- and hammer at what he sees as [Trump\u2019s] broken promises on improving U.S. manufacturing and reducing offshoring, senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said,\u201d Bloomberg News's Jennifer Epstein reports . When superpowers collide Disney is under fire for thanking groups tied to Uighur detention camps.  Filmmakers cooperated with authorities in China\u2019s Xinjiang region while filming the new \u201cMulan\u201d: \u201c The movie\u2019s credits offer \u2018special thanks\u2019 to a number of Chinese Communist Party and government agencies, including eight in Xinjiang, a mountainous frontier abutting Central Asia that about 12 million Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs regard as their homeland,\u201d WSJ's Chun Han Wong and R.T. Watson report .   \u201cGrant Major, the Oscar-winning production designer who worked on the film, said a small portion of the shooting took place in Xinjiang. Film shoots anywhere in China require permission from local authorities \u2026 Human-rights watchdogs, exiled Uighur activists and foreign academics have criticized Disney over the film\u2019s connection to Xinjiang, as has U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) on Twitter.\u201d  Pocket change JPMorgan is probing abuses of government relief funds.  The bank says some employees have \u201cfallen short\u201d: \u201cThe bank\u2019s operating committee, led by CEO Jamie Dimon, sent an email to 256,710 employees saying that while the pandemic has brought out the best in many workers, there have been instances where customers abused the government\u2019s coronavirus relief programs,\u201d CNBC \u2019 s Hugh Son reports .   \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve also seen conduct that does not live up to our business and ethical principles \u2014 and may even be illegal,\u201d the bank\u2019s committee said. \u201cThis includes instances of customers misusing Paycheck Protection Program loans, unemployment benefits and other government programs. Some employees have fallen short, too.\u201d   GM CEO Mary Barra moves to remake automaker for EV future: \u201cBarra has reeled off two significant deals in the past week in response to investor concerns the No. 1 U.S. automaker is stuck in neutral while Tesla Inc and other electric vehicle makers are leaving legacy automakers behind,\u201d Reuters \u2019 s Ben Klayman reports .   \u201cBut investors want her to go further. A 10 percent jump in GM\u2019s shares on Tuesday helped the stock top its post-financial crisis 2010 initial public offering of $33. Some investors want Barra to split up the company so its EV assets can be valued at headier levels like Tesla and other newly public EV automakers.\u201d  Ford \u2019 s incoming CEO Jim Farley is positioning his company for the future: \u201c But it\u2019s not just more trucks and vans that Farley wants to sell. As Jim Farley prepares to takes over as chief executive on Oct. 1, he is betting Ford can transform its commercial vehicle business to generate recurring revenue through sales of services that take advantage of the software, data and connectivity in its F-Series pickup truck and Transit vans.\u201d Chart topper  Salaries for congressional staffers keep dropping, via Vox's Ian Millhiser:   The

Griffiths   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is pushing ahead with a slimmed-down economic relief package, setting up a Thursday vote for a bill he unveiled yesterday.    But prospects for a bipartisan breakthrough remain remote, even as the legislative window on Capitol Hill narrows and economists warn a sputtering recovery demands new Washington spending.   \u201cThe legislation is not expected to advance, since that would require support from Democrats, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the measure \u2018pathetic,\u2019\u201d Erica Werner writes of the state-of-play on the effort to provide more support for an economy rocked by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cMcConnell has struggled even to unite Republicans behind the measure, and is likely to suffer some GOP defections.\u201d   So what might look like earnest efforts to reach agreement in coming days will amount to political positioning . Meanwhile, 29 million jobless Americans are still relying on some form on unemployment insurance. Enhanced federal benefits to help those out of work make ends meet expired at the end of July, and only six states are handing out $300 a week meant as a temporary patch. The unemployment rate ticked down to 8.4 percent in August, but the economy has replaced roughly half of the 22 million jobs it has lost since the pandemic struck. And measures of sentiment show consumer and small business confidence turning increasingly pessimistic.    \u201cWe do think it will get harder from here, because of those areas of the economy that are so directly affected by the pandemic still,\u201d Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell told NPR in an interview Friday. \u201cThere \u2019 s going to be a long period, we believe, where we \u2019 ll have to take our time and see those people get back to work.\u201d   Yet the White House is playing down the need for a new relief package as President Trump touts an economy he says is already roaring back . \u201cThis will be a self-sustaining economic recovery with very big numbers in Q3 and Q4,\u201d Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, told Fox News.   One development that could grab some attention in the White House: The stock market, one of Trump\u2019s preferred gauges, continued a dramatic three-day slide. There\u2019s little evidence investor fear of a backsliding recovery is fueling the sell-off. (Rather, a collapse in big tech names is dragging the major indexes lower.) But some top Wall Street economists continue to predict lawmakers will reach a deal on a relief package by the end of the month.  McConnell is aiming to use the package to put pressure on Democrats.  \u201cSenate Republicans and administration officials believe Pelosi will come under growing pressure from moderate members of her own caucus who face tough reelections and have been uneasy about the failure to act on additional economic stimulus,\u201d Werner writes. \u201cMcConnell\u2019s new legislation is partly an attempt to attract the attention of such lawmakers.\u201d   But Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) were quick to dismiss the Republican leader\u2019s proposal , with Schumer calling it \u201cone of the most cynical moves I have ever seen.\u201d   McConnell\u2019s bill, which comes with an approximately $500 billion price tag, would:  Provide jobless Americans with an extra $300 a week in extra federal benefits through the end of the year, down from the $600 boost they received through July. Resupply the Paycheck Protection Program with an additional $250 billion to fund a second round of forgivable loans to small businesses. And offer $150 billion for schools; $47 billion for testing, tracing and vaccine development; $20 billion for farmers; and $10 billion each for child-care support services and to forgive a loan to the U.S. Postal Service, per Werner.  It would not provide state and local governments with money to relieve budget crunches they are facing \u2014 nor would it fund another round of relief checks to lower- and middle-income Americans. McConnell proposes to offset some of the cost of the package by repurposing $350 billion in unspent funds from the first Cares Act.   But there is no sign yet of bipartisan talks reviving. And the top line of McConnell's offer marks a major step back from the $1.5 trillion the Trump administration signaled it could support before its own negotiations with congressional Democrats broke down last month , Werner notes. The Republican leader's proposal highlights how far apart the two sides remain:  Wall Street hasn\u2019t reckoned with the likelihood that Washington remains deadlocked on economic relief.  Goldman Sachs economists acknowledged in a Tuesday note that \u201cfiscal stimulus looks like a much closer call than it did a couple of months ago amid mounting signs of trouble.\u201d Yet the team still thinks Congress is \u201cslightly more likely than not to enact a stimulus package by the end of the September.\u201d And Morgan Stanley is projecting lawmakers adopt a $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion package this month that reduces unemployment to 7.6 percent by the end of the year.   Not all Wall Street strategists are as bullish.   David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, is dialing back his expectations for an agreement. \u201cMany Senate Republicans seem unwilling to support a big bill, perhaps because it would seem to contradict their narrative that the economy is well on the road to recovery,\u201d he writes in a note. \u201cMeanwhile, House Democrats appear unwilling to compromise in favor of a skinny bill for fear that it would allow the President to goose up the economy just before election day and suggest that the status quo in Washington is working.\u201d   Market movers U.S. stocks continue slide after holiday weekend.

Los Angeles County has banned trick or treating this year: \u201cDoor-to-door trick-or-treating is banned because it can be very difficult to maintain proper social distancing on porches and at front doors especially in neighborhoods that are popular with trick or treaters,' the county's Department of Public Health said in a news release,\" CNN's Sarah Moon and Madeline Holcombe report .

Griffiths   With 56 days until the election, not even Joe Biden's supporters know what his victory would mean for Wall Street.     Even after building a 36-year track record of service in Washington, participating in 11 presidential primary debates this cycle, and releasing relatively detailed proposals, Biden has left plenty of room for interpretation about his ideological orientation now.    The Democratic nominee and his aides are now compounding the confusion: While Biden publicly calls out Wall Street excesses and promises to rein them in, Biden staffers privately are reassuring industry leaders that he won\u2019t focus on the issue in office , Annie Linskey reports .   As one investment banker described Biden campaign calls to financiers, \u201cThey basically said, \u2018 Listen, this is just an exercise to keep the [Elizabeth] Warren people happy, and don\u2019t read too much into it.\u2019\u201d    Specifically, the campaign appears to be throwing cold water on some progressive policy proposals that have riled the big banks, including setting up bank accounts through the Federal Reserve and enabling people to access banking services through the Post Office.  The mixed signals on financial regulation highlight an intraparty split that could crack open post-election.  Democrats are already divided on basics of the party\u2019s economic vision . During the Democratic National Convention last month, a family fight over how much more the government can afford to spend on a rescue package for the coronavirus-ravaged economy spilled into public view, as we wrote here at the time. And Biden did little to clarify where he would land, as he continues to weigh how ambitious his agenda will be.   The dynamic extends to other planks of his economic platform. The strategy \u201chas helped him unify the party\u2019s liberal and moderate wings behind the shared goal of defeating President Trump,\u201d Linskey writes. \u201cBut it also is laying the groundwork for bitter internal battles, should Biden win the presidency, on topics from race to climate to trade, while Wall Street leaders plan to have their way with a president many expect to be unusually susceptible to outside pressure.\u201d  The Biden campaign\u2019s joint policy-drafting effort with the Bernie Sanders team has also muddled the picture.  A task force bringing together Biden aides with counterparts from Sanders\u2019s orbit produced a set of surprisingly progressive economic policy plans. The Sanders camp believed the Biden campaign was adopting it as official policy. But a Biden campaign spokesman tells Linskey they were merely recommendations.   Either way, there\u2019s a limit to how far white papers can go toward predicting a Biden administration\u2019s approach to these matters in an uncertain political environment.   Potentially as important, some analysts note: the appointees Biden chooses for top financial regulatory posts. For example, if Democrats retake the Senate but only with a thin margin , there will be limits to what a Biden White House could accomplish legislatively, leaving most of the action to the agencies.   \u201cI continue to point my clients to the cohort of red-state centrist Democrats, as I believe they will moderate the legislative discussion in a Blue Wave scenario even before the White House becomes a factor,\u201d Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky said in an email. But \u201cfinancial regulators have considerable day-to-day policymaking authority and we expect Sen. Warren to have a say in those posts no matter where her seat may be in a potential Biden administration.\u201d   Carter Dougherty, spokesman for Americans for Financial Reform, a liberal group that advocates stricter financial regulation, says the Biden campaign has released some \u201cpromising\u201d proposals. \u201cWe want to see more,\u201d he said, while also emphasizing the importance of Biden\u2019s appointed regulators, \u201cgiven the discretion they have.\u201d   Market movers Futures signal another rough day after massive sell-off.  Stocks look primed to continue last week's losses : \u201c Nasdaq futures were set to fall sharply early Tuesday after technology shares suffered their worst sell-off in more than five months,\" CNBC's Yun Li and Eustance Huang report . \u201cThe Nasdaq-100 futures implied an open drop of about 3%. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average the S&amp;P 500 were slightly in early morning trade\u2026   \u201c On Friday, stocks snapped a five-week winning streak after a big reversal in major technology stocks last week. Steep losses in Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook \u2014 2020\u2032s market leaders \u2014 drove the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down 3.3 percent to suffer its worst week since March 20. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8 percent and 2.3 percent last week, respectively, posting their biggest weekly losses since June.\u201d (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post)   Sudden volatility in tech stocks unnerves investors: \u201cThe Nasdaq Composite slid more than 6 percent over two days last week after hitting a fresh high, led by Thursday\u2019s record one-day decline in market value at Apple Inc., the most-valuable U.S. listed company. Selling intensified Friday, at one point pushing the index down almost 10 percent from its record and spreading to markets including crude oil and gold, before a broad reversal narrowed losses in some stocks and sent others back into more familiar, green territory,\u201d the Wall Street Journal \u2019 s Amrith Ramkumar reports .   \u201cFew investors believe the late-week rout signals the end of a rally that has taken the Nasdaq to 43 record closes and pushed the S&amp;P 500 up more than 6 percent for the year. The economy continues to show signs of improvement and with interest rates near record lows, the investor mantra that \u2018there is no alternative\u2019 to purchasing the shares of major U.S. corporations remains very much intact.\u201d  Doubts are raising over one theory for the big tech surge: \u201cA report that SoftBank Group Corp. is making billions by using options to bet on technology stocks has stirred speculation the Japanese conglomerate could have been a driving force behind the rally \u2014 but not everyone is convinced,\u201d Bloomberg News \u2019 s Yakob Peterseil and Joanna Ossinger report . Fed\u2019s strategy shift will ripple across the world of central banks.  Greater tolerance for inflation will be a drag on the dollar for years: \u201cSuch a reinterpretation of the Fed\u2019s mandate could be seen as a foray into social policy, a vital precedent for others as they reexamine their own roles after years of unconventional moves that already impact wealth and income distribution,\u201d Balazs Koranyi and Leika Kihara of Reuters report .   \u201cThe second, more immediate concern will be the dollar \u2019 s weakness, which hurts exporters from Europe to Asia. This is bound to feature prominently at the European Central Bank \u2019 s policy meeting on Thursday, as a strong euro will make it more difficult for exporting nations in the euro zone to climb out of their deepest recession in living memory. Countries like Germany and France, or Japan, traditionally generate growth from net exports, which take a hit when their currencies firm.\u201d   Money on the Hill Mnuchin says he will work with Nancy Pelosi to avoid a government shutdown.   The Treasury secretary's comments come as talks toward a relief package remain stalled: \u201cMnuchin said his expectation is that this so-called \u2018continuing resolution\u2019 would extend government funding into December \u2014 although the date has not yet been agreed on,\u201d Erica Werner reports .   \u201cWithout action by Congress, agency funding would expire at midnight Sept. 30, and the government would begin to shut down. \u2026 Mnuchin\u2019s comments appear to suggest that the White House is not girding for a clash over this spending deadline, though White House officials have in the past tried to negotiate deals with Democrats in Congress, only to have [Trump] announce that he is opposed at the last moment.\u201d  ICYMI: Here \u2019 s where relief plan talks stand: \u201cA fight over Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s plan to subsidize private school tuition is threatening to derail a Senate GOP effort to write a slimmed-down coronavirus relief bill,\u201d Erica Werner and Laura Meckler reported last week of efforts by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to include a $5 billion tax credit in the GOP \u2019 s bill. Morgan Stanley analysts now see hope for a breakthrough on stimulus talks. Here is their latest projection for economic growth, via Heather Long:  House Democrats will probe Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.  Lawmakers are seizing on a Post report about a possible straw donor scheme: \u201cHouse Democrats are launching an investigation of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and called for his immediate suspension following accusations that he reimbursed employees for campaign contributions they made to his preferred GOP politicians, an arrangement that would be unlawful,\u201d Amy Gardner reports .   \u201cRep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in a statement late last night that the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which she chairs, would begin an investigation, saying that DeJoy may have lied to her committee under oath \u2026 Maloney\u2019s announcement came a day after The Post reported allegations that DeJoy and his aides urged employees at his former North Carolina-based logistics company to write checks and attend fundraisers on behalf of Republican candidates.\u201d  Coronavirus fallout CEOs issue safety pledge amid Trump's quest for pre-election approval.  The title of their statement makes their intent abundantly clear: \u201cThe chief executives of nine drug companies pledged not to seek regulatory approval before the safety and efficacy of their experimental coronavirus vaccines has been established in Phase 3 clinical trials, an extraordinary effort to bolster public faith in a vaccine amid [Trump\u2019s] public rush to introduce a vaccine before Election Day,\u201d Christopher Rowland reports this morning.   \u201cIn most contexts, pledges by drug companies that they will adhere to safety and efficacy standards would be unremarkable. But their joint resolve in the current political environment \u2014 and the headline pasted on their statement: \u201cBIOPHARMA LEADERS UNITE TO STAND WITH SCIENCE\u201d \u2014 make clear their intent to ease growing worries about the race for a vaccine amid intense White House pressure.\u201d  The companies involved: \u201cAstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Moderna, and Novavax, as well as those heading two joint vaccine projects, Pfizer and BioNTech, and Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline.\u201d Cases almost quadrupled during summer season: \u201c From Memorial Day weekend through the unofficial end of the season Monday, the number of Americans who died of covid-19 shot up from just under 100,000 to more than 186,000, according to data tracked by The Washington Post, as infections nearly quadrupled to upward of 6.2 million ,\u201d Teo Armus reports . The latest tallies, via The Atlantic's covid-19 tracking project : New York's infection rate has been below 1 percent for 30 days: \u201cAs of Sunday, New York reported 720 new infections, four deaths and 410 hospitalizations \u2014 another low since mid-March \u2014 related to the virus,\u201d Lateshia Beachum reports . Experts worry about sanitization theater: \u201cS ix months into the pandemic, Americans seem determined to Clorox their way to absolution. They\u2019re wiping down soccer balls, Lysoling beach chairs, touching PIN pads with \u2018touch tools\u2019 and gloves, and cleaning bags of Tostitos with diluted bleach,\u201d Maura Judkis reports . When superpowers collide China lashes out after administration threatens to sanction chipmaker.  SMIC becomes the latest company to get caught up in the trade war: \u201cThe U.S. Department of Defense said Saturday that it was considering adding SMIC to the Commerce Department\u2019s so-called Entity List, which would make it more difficult for the company to obtain parts made in the U.S., potentially hurting production,\u201d CNBC \u2019 s Ryan Browne reports .   \u201cOn Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused Washington of \u2018blatant hegemony,\u2019 adding that Beijing was \u2018firmly opposed\u2019 to such actions.\u201d   Trump vows to cut back U.S.-China ties . \u201cTrump said he intends to curb the U.S. economic relationship with China, contrasting himself with Joe Biden by threatening to punish any American companies that create jobs overseas and to forbid those that do business in China from winning federal contracts,\u201d Bloomberg's Emma Kinery and Josh Wingrove report .    \u201c'We\u2019ll manufacture our critical manufacturing supplies in the United States, we\u2019ll create \u201cmade in America\u201d tax credits and bring our jobs back to the United States and we\u2019ll impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries,' Trump said at a White House news conference on Monday where he complained at length about his Democratic re-election opponent.\"   FBI sweep of China researchers leads to cat-and-mouse tactics: \u201cFBI agents have questioned dozens of researchers this summer about their work and military affiliations. In recent weeks, the widening operation has triggered efforts by some suspects to evade authorities and led to the arrest of at least two researchers whose work is allegedly tied to China\u2019s military development, according to court filings by prosecutors,\u201d WSJ \u2019 s Kate O\u2019Keeffe and Aruna Viswanatha report .        Pocket change Oil falls after Saudis cut prices.  The mood has turned \u201cpessimistic,\u201d one broker says: \u201cBrent crude was trading at $42.03 a barrel, down 63 cents or 1.5 percent, by 1555 GMT, after earlier sliding to $41.51, its lowest since July 30. West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude fell 67 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $39.10 per barrel after hitting $38.55, its lowest since July 10,\u201d Reuters reports .   \u201cThe world\u2019s top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, cut the October official selling price for Arab Light crude it sells to Asia by the most since May. \u2026 China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, which has been supporting prices with record purchases, slowed its intake in August and increased its products exports, customs data showed. \u2026 The Labor Day holiday marks the traditional end of the peak summer demand season in the United States and that renewed investors\u2019 focus on the current lackluster fuel demand in the world\u2019s biggest oil user.\u201d   Citigroup feuds with hedge funds: \u201cAt the root of the dispute: Citi\u2019s role helping billionaire investor Ron Perelman restructure the corporate loans of cosmetics company Revlon Inc. Some investors wanted Citi to bow out of the transaction; when it didn\u2019t, they blamed the bank for facilitating a deal that hurt their investments,\u201d WSJ \u2019 s Matt Wirz, Becky Yerak and Alexander Gladstone report .   \u201cChief among those investors: $28 billion money manager Brigade Capital Management LP. Until recently, Brigade and its founder, Donald Morgan, had worked closely with Citi. \u2026 Now Citi and Brigade are slugging it out in court, cutting ties and arguing over the return of around $170 million the fund received when the bank accidentally paid Revlon lenders about $900 million.\u201d   AB InBev plans to replace longtime CEO Carlos Brito: \u201cThe brewing company is considering external candidates to replace Brito, who has been at the helm for 16 years, a Financial Times report said,\u201d according to Reuters.  Campaign 2020 Money, money, money?  Trump \u2019 s reelection was supposed to be a financial juggernaut, but an early advantage has evaporated: \u201cFive months later, [Trump\u2019s] financial supremacy has evaporated.

But on Sunday, he said he will block Trump's judicial nominees until the Senate votes on a bill to\u00a0limit\u00a0the president's power to levy tariffs.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I do think that unless we can actually exercise something other than just approving the president's executive calendar, his nominees, judges, that we have no reason to be there,\" Flake said in an interview on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I think myself and a number of senators, at least a few of us, will stand up and say - let's not move any more judges until we get a vote, for example, on tariffs.\"          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump, meanwhile, is only ratcheting up his threats to slap levies on imports from around the globe. On Sunday he tweeted that \"all countries\" will face new tariffs if they don't lower their own trade barriers:</p><p>             The escalating tension - the administration is also planning to ramp up its crackdown on China, as Europe pledges retaliation against auto tariffs (see our Trade Fly-Around section below for more on both those stories)\u00a0- suggests a reckoning between Trump and pro-trade Republicans on the Hill could finally be at hand.\u00a0Among the latest signs Trump's\u00a0trade war is producing real-world pain, Harley-Davidson announced this morning it's shifting some motorcycle production abroad in response to retaliatory European Union tariffs.</p><p>             Flake's\u00a0threat to take matters in his own hands is real enough:\u00a0He serves on the Judiciary Committee, where Republicans claim only an 11-to-10 advantage. And the party has no votes to spare in the full Senate, since the GOP's majority\u00a0stands at 51 and Flake's senior colleague, John McCain, is home for brain cancer treatment.\u00a0</p><p>Flake has made similar noises without following through, as my colleague Dave Weigel notes, including in April when toyed with sinking the nomination of Jim Bridenstine to lead NASA. But he signaled last week he's considering plugging the pipeline of judges that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is eager to keep flowing through the chamber -\u00a0to protest Trump's tariffs and his Cuba policy. And he delayed a vote on an appeals court nominee but declined to say why, telling reporters it is \"just something I'm working out.\"</p><p>There's some evidence he's not alone. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), another Trump critic emboldened by his impending retirement, said Sunday there's a \"jailbreak brewing\" among congressional Republicans on the trade front.\u00a0          </p><p>Flake, on ABC, called for Republicans to \"stand up on issues like tariffs facing us right now. We're if the nascent stages of a full-scale trade war. And the president simply seems to want to escalate. And it all stems to the steel and aluminum tariffs. Congress ought to stand up and say, no, we're not going to do that. You can't use section 232 to claim that Canada is a national security threat. That's not who we are.\"</p><p>             Corker has drawn eight Republican cosponsors - and five Democrats - for a bill that would force the president to get congressional approval before imposing tariffs in the name of national security. Trump has taken the proposal seriously enough to get involved personally in lobbying against it, working the phones from his nuclear summit in Singapore earlier this month and inviting Senate Republicans to the White House to urge them to back off.\u00a0</p><p>Corker failed\u00a0attach the measure\u00a0to the defense authorization bill, as he had aimed. But Senate Republicans demonstrated during that debate that they're willing, in some circumstances at least, to stand up to the president on trade matters: They added language to the bill reinstating penalties on Chinese telecom company ZTE.\u00a0          </p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>             - Trump wants to limit Chinese investment in U.S. tech companies.WSJ's Bob Davis:\u00a0\"Trump, already embroiled in a trade battle with China, plans to ratchet commercial tensions higher by barring many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms, and by blocking additional technology exports to Beijing... The twin initiatives, set to be announced by the end of the week, are designed to prevent Beijing from moving ahead with plans outlined in its \"Made in China 2025\" report to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology, including information technology, aerospace, electric vehicles and biotechnology.</p><p> \"The Treasury Department is crafting rules that would block firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in what the White House calls 'industrially significant technology.' ...\u00a0In addition, the National Security Council and the Commerce Department are putting together plans for 'enhanced'\u00a0export controls, designed to keep such technologies from being shipped to China.\"</p><p>             China\u00a0doesn't intend to punish U.S. companies that operate\u00a0on Chinese soil.\u00a0Bloomberg News's Tian Chen: \"China has no plan to target U.S. companies operating in the nation amid escalating trade tensions, as that would run counter to Beijing's goal of attracting foreign investments, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday . . .\u00a0The policy makers sought to reassure foreign businesses in China amid fears that the Beijing government would retaliate for . . . Trump's proposed tariffs on Chinese goods by harassing American firms or depriving them of commercial opportunities, the Hong Kong-based newspaper reported, citing 'two Chinese government sources.'\u00a0The option of targeting these business 'has never been on the cards,'\u00a0according to one of the people.\"</p><p>Trump will feel the pressure when the tariffs\u00a0on Chinese goods kick in.\u00a0The Post's David J. Lynch: \"Once the U.S. tariffs on the first $34 billion in Chinese goods take effect on July 6 - and trigger Chinese retaliation against American farmers and exporters - the political pain will mount for the president, according to several former U.S. negotiators and trade analysts. Complaints from affected voters could push Trump to settle for a limited deal involving higher Chinese purchases of American products and promises of future market openings and leave the president vulnerable to charges of having blinked in his confrontation with China, the former officials said. 'He's set himself up perfectly for that attack,'\u00a0said Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute, who has advised U.S. officials on China policy. 'There's a group inside the administration that very, very much wants a deal. . . . But I'm talking about a Band-Aid.' \"</p><p>             ZTE is about to meet U.S. conditions.Reuters: \"ZTE Corp . . . is expected to deposit $400 million in an escrow account in a U.S. bank in the 'next couple of days,' the last step the Chinese company must take before a ban on U.S. suppliers can be lifted, a U.S. Department of Commerce official told Reuters on Friday.\u00a0ZTE, which makes smart phones and networking gear, agreed to pay a $1 billion penalty and put $400 million in escrow as part of a settlement it reached on June 7 with the Commerce Department to regain access to the U.S. market, which it needs for components. . . .\u00a0The escrow account in the new settlement is designed to allow the U.S. government access to the $400 million if ZTE violates the latest deal.\"</p><p>             - Trump threatens Europe with car tariffs.The Washington Post's Damian Paletta and James McAuley:\u00a0\"Trump on Friday threatened in a tweet to unilaterally impose a 20 percent tariff on all automobile imports from Europe, further breaking from Republicans in Congress and front-running an investigation he had ordered from the Commerce Department into whether these imports harm the U.S.'s national security. It was the first time he had threatened to impose a specific level of tariffs on automobiles from Europe. The tweet came as Europe imposed tariffs on goods worth 2.8 billion euros ($3.2 billion) - including Harley Davidson motorcycles and Levi's jeans - which are themselves a targeted response to Trump's earlier decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on European exports to the United States. . . .\u00a0The E.U. charges a 10 percent tariff on auto imports from the United States. Trump is threatening to impose a tariff double that size if the E.U. doesn't remove its barriers.\"</p><p>             And Europe says it would retaliate.Reuters's Mathieu Rosemain: \"The European Union will respond to any U.S. move to raise tariffs on cars made in the bloc, a senior European Commission official said, the latest comments in an escalating trade row. . . . 'If they decide to raise their import tariffs, we'll have no choice, again, but to react,'\u00a0EU Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen told French newspaper Le Monde. 'We don't want to fight (over trade) in public via Twitter. We should end the escalation,'\u00a0he said in the comments published on Saturday.\"</p><p>             The Mood:\u00a0E.U. says the future of trade is\u00a0bleak.Bloomberg News's\u00a0Nikos Chrysoloras and Richard Bravo:\u00a0\"The global trade war is about to get worse, as the rules-based system of international commerce is poised to revert to an environment where the strong impose their will upon the weak, according to an internal memo circulated among European Union governments. The disputes between the U.S. and its closest trading partners are set to escalate 'in the coming months, as more unilateral measures are threatened and imposed, leading, in some cases, to countermeasures, or to mercantilist deals,'\u00a0according to the memo drafted by the European Commission, which manages trade policy for the entire bloc. . . .\u00a0Our world will go back 'to a trading environment where rules are only enforced where convenient and where strength replaces rules as the basis for trade relations,'\u00a0according to the memo.\"</p><p>             - Meanwhile,\u00a0the dispute over steel and aluminum tariffs continues.Bloomberg News's\u00a0Olga Tanas,\u00a0Stepan Kravchenko and Andrey Biryukov: \"Russia is the latest country to threaten the U.S. with retaliation for tariffs on metals imports, warning Friday that American cars could soon face higher taxes. Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said autos from the U.S. could be targeted, just days after saying that the government also is likely to hit American road-building equipment with higher levies. Both moves are in response to new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, important Russian exports.\"</p><p>             - Russia backs plan to increase oil production.The Wall Street Journal's Christopher Alessi and Summer Said: \"Russia on Saturday threw its support behind Saudi Arabia's plan to ramp up global oil production in the face of higher prices, after more than a year of holding back output in coordination with OPEC. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said his country backed a plan by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise crude production by a nominal one million barrels a day starting next month. Though, the actual increase is expected to be around 600,000 barrels a day . . . due to some producers being unable to increase output. That is far lower than the 1.5 million barrel a day increase Russia had been targeting ahead of a series of OPEC-led meetings in Vienna this week.\"</p><p>             - $39 billion in stocks traded in less than one second.\u00a0WSJ's Asjylyn\u00a0Loder: \"A record 1.2 million shares worth more than $39 billion traded in less than a second on Friday during Nasdaq 's closing auction. The reason: the end of this year's rebalancing of FTSE Russell's widely followed stock indexes. There are $9.2 trillion pegged to Russell U.S. benchmarks, dwarfing the $29.5 billion linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which made headlines last week by ejecting General Electric Co. after more than a century. When Russell adds and removes stocks each year to and from its indexes, stocks that are part of the revisions typically experience a trading volume spike 45 times higher than average, according to research from Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. This year, nearly 300 companies were added or dropped from the Russell 2000 alone.\"</p><p>             - The Chinese\u00a0central bank is easing\u00a0credit rules.WSJ's Lingling Wei and Chao Deng: \"China's central bank is freeing up more than $100 billion for commercial banks to boost lending and restructure debt, as the Chinese leadership tries to shore up growth amid slowing momentum for economic expansion and an intensifying trade brawl with the U.S. In a statement Sunday, the People's Bank of China announced that it is reducing the amount of reserves banks are required to keep with the central bank by half a percentage point starting July 5. That is the day before a U.S. deadline to slap punitive tariffs on tens of billions of dollars in Chinese goods. Under the reserve cut, some 500 billion yuan ($76.86 billion) will be released for 17 large banks, including the Big Five state-owned banks, the central bank said. It said the banks are to use the freed-up funds by converting bad loans into equity in companies that default on their debts.\"</p><p>             - Amazon employees say the\u00a0company shouldn't sell facial recognition to law enforcement.The Post's Hamza Shaban: \"Employees at Amazon.com are calling on chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos to end the sale of facial-recognition technology to law enforcement agencies and to discontinue partnerships with companies that work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\u00a0In a letter, a group of Amazon workers said they are also troubled by a recent report from the American Civil Liberties Union revealing the company's sale and marketing of Rekognition, its facial-recognition technology, to police departments and government agencies. Workers at Amazon are protesting the recently halted Trump administration policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.\" (Bezos is also the owner of The Post.)</p><p>             - Board members of tech giants\u00a0don't attend shareholder meetings.\u00a0Reuters's Ross Kerber: \"Some small investors who want to give a piece of their minds to big tech company directors are losing their only chance: many board members are skipping annual shareholder meetings. Companies that hold meetings online have some of the worst records for attendance. A large portion of Alphabet Inc . . . Facebook Inc . . . Netflix Inc . . . and Twitter Inc . . . directors have not attended annual shareholder meetings in recent years, company records and securities filings show, in some cases in growing numbers. Recent high-profile no-shows at the meetings - which are often the only chance 'mom-and-pop'\u00a0retail investors get to ask directors questions - include Alphabet Chief Executive Larry Page and Facebook board member Peter Thiel. The companies declined to discuss the absences in detail.\"</p><p>             - Some financial services companies are cutting ties with the gun industry.The Associated Press's Lisa Marie Pane: \"In the wake of high-profile mass shootings, corporate America has been taking a stand against the firearms industry amid a lack of action by lawmakers on gun control. Payment processing firms are limiting transactions, Bank of America stopped providing financing to companies that make AR-style guns, and retailers like Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods imposed age restrictions on gun purchases. The moves are lauded by gun-safety advocates but criticized by the gun industry that views them as a backhanded way of undermining the Second Amendment. Gun industry leaders see the backlash as a real threat to their industry and are coming to the conclusion that they need additional protections in Congress to prevent financial retaliation from banks.\"</p><p>             - The GOP wants to show that it worries about the deficit.\u00a0The Hill's Niv Elis: \"Six months after passing a tax bill that is projected to blow a $1.9 trillion hole in the deficit, Republicans on the House Budget Committee are scrambling to regain fiscal credibility with their 2019 spending plan. The plan would cut over $8 trillion in spending over the course of a decade, according to estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, including $5.4 trillion in mandatory spending. . . . Republicans, who have traditionally defined themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility, have been playing defense on the issue. They've faced accusations from Democrats that they've mortgaged America's future for the sake of the tax cut.\"</p><p>             - Mulvaney\u00a0backs\u00a0Kraninger\u00a0to lead the\u00a0CFPB.The Hill's Sylvan Lane: \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) acting Director Mick Mulvaney is going to bat for his potential successor, and in doing so he's poised to extend his influence at the watchdog agency.\u00a0Mulvaney, who doubles as head of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has emerged as a key proponent of Kathy Kraninger\u00a0. . .\u00a0Trump's pick to be the CFPB's full-time director, despite his previous reluctance to influence the selection process. . . .\u00a0Congressional Republicans have praised Mulvaney's efforts to rein in the CFPB's regulatory actions and are expected to support Kraninger, who they see as building on Mulvaney's legacy. That, in turn, has raised concerns among Democratic lawmakers and other White House critics who say her nomination is an attempt to extend Mulvaney's influence over the CFPB.\"</p><p>             - The fiduciary rule is essentially gone.\u00a0The New York Times's\u00a0Tara Siegel\u00a0Bernard:\u00a0\"Retirement investors, you're back on your own. Just a year after it took partial effect, the so-called fiduciary rule - a requirement that financial professionals put their customers' interests ahead of their own with retirement accounts - has effectively died. On Thursday, a federal appeals court dealt a final blow to the rule, legal experts said. The court made effective its decision in March voiding the Obama era rule. That decision said the Department of Labor, which oversees retirement accounts, overstepped its authority. The department did not try to defend the rule after the appeals court's initial decision, experts said, and it let a deadline pass to petition the Supreme Court to hear the case.\"</p><p>From Bloomberg News:</p><p>             Coming soon          </p><p>- From the New Yorker's Joe Dator:</p><p>Trump dismisses statistics showing low immigrant criminality:</p><p>Poverty in the U.S., by the numbers:</p><p>Restaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave speaks out:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-490904a2423b4db5a0f503e9374416a3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SN0-HG81-JB4M-V3W8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3126\"/><timeReceived>12:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 25, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Now, they need to make room for one of those hyper-rich people in their own ranks.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Tom Steyer, the hedge fund billionaire and second-most prolific political donor of all time, made it official Tuesday: He is jumping into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Steyer will have to overcome more than a late start. In his four-minute announcement video, he decried a broken government that represents corporate interests and those of the hyper-wealthy rather than everyday Americans. Watch it here:\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             But to push his message that he is the right leader to get big money out of politics, Steyer will be leaning on more of his own big money. He has pledged to spend up to $100 million of his personal fortune on the race.\u00a0</p><p>A couple of his rivals for the nod seized on that fact Tuesday. In an appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he likes Steyer personally but added he's getting \"a bit tired of billionaires trying to buy political power.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) drew a contrast between Steyer's plan to self-fund and her own $19 million second-quarter fundraising haul drawn from a grass-roots network:\u00a0</p><p>             Steyer, 62, cut his teeth on Wall Street, working under future Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Goldman Sachs's risk arbitrage desk. But he amassed his estimated $1.6 billion fortune at the helm of a hedge fund called Farallon Capital Management, which he founded in 1986. By the time Steyer gave up his ownership in late 2012, it had grown to one of the largest in the world, with about\u00a0$20 billion under management. The firm profited from investments in every sector of the economy, including fossil fuels, maintaining stakes in BP, oil-and-gas giant Nexen, and mining companies, among others.\u00a0</p><p>By Steyer's account, a percolating crisis of conscience over those holdings reached full boil during a mountain hike in the summer of 2012 with environmentalist Bill McKibben. Afterward, he decided to personally divest from \"ecologically unsound\" investments. That translated into dumping stakes in tar sands and coal, two of the dirtiest energy sources.\u00a0</p><p>             But he drew criticism for moving more slowly to divest from all fossil fuel interests. And the New York Times in 2014 found\u00a0that \"despite his highly public declaration, Mr.\u00a0Steyer's divestment will do little to impede the coal-related projects his firm bankrolled, which will generate tens of millions of tons of carbon pollution for years, if not decades, to come. Over the past 15 years, Mr.\u00a0Steyer's fund,\u00a0Farallon Capital\u00a0Management, has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China.\"</p><p>Steyer's record since of putting his money where his mouth is may blunt charges of hypocrisy as he becomes an official candidate. His organization NextGen Climate Action has plowed about $234 million into boosting Democratic candidates over the past three election cycles - with about $209 million of that sum coming from Steyer's own pocket, according to figures from the Center for Responsive Politics.\u00a0</p><p>             The bigger problem he faces is whether Democratic voters will embrace a billionaire at a time when populist animus is energizing the party's base.\u00a0          </p><p>             Michael Bloomberg - a fellow billionaire who has funded climate change activism and other progressive causes while spending big to elect Democrats - surveyed the same landscape earlier this year and decided it would be hostile to his own presidential bid. In a Bloomberg News editorial announcing his decision, Bloomberg said he concluded he could never win the Democratic primary - beacuse though he worries the primary will \"drag the party to an extreme,\" he would refuse to \"change my views to match the polls.\"\u00a0</p><p>That may distinguish Steyer from Bloomberg - and, to a lesser extent, Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO who looks to have given up on a potential independent bid that was based on the idea both parties had abandoned the center. Bloomberg has been an outspoken critic of some Democratic candidates' proposals to hike taxes on the rich, comparing Warren's plan for a wealth tax to socialism, for example. Steyer has called for raising taxes on upper-income earners, though he hasn't gotten specific yet.\u00a0          </p><p>But the issue points to a box Steyer could soon find himself in: Promote a more moderate economic program, and his rivals on the left will have an easy time lambasting him for seeking to protect his self-interest and that of his class; adopt the stridently liberal line, and the question arises why Steyer is better suited to carry that banner than candidates like Warren or Sanders who have already detailed their plans and developed major grassroots followings.\u00a0</p><p>As The Post's Dave Weigel noted Wednesday, last month's\u00a0AP-NORC poll found just 26 percent of Democrats said they favored a candidate with experience running a business, while 73 percent said they preferred one with experience in public office. Yet Steyer\u00a0is emphasizing his lack of experience in office. \"I am an outsider from outside the system, and\u00a0I've been doing this for 10 years,\" he told Weigel, referring to his activism. \"I think the question here for every single person who's running is: Who can connect with Americans? Who can rewrite the electorate and get us organized?\u00a0That is the question. You can't buy that.\"</p><p>             Steyer\u00a0is right that he can't buy voter support. But he's launching his bid by trying, spending nearly $1 million on a\u00a0TV ad campaign in states with early primary contests.\u00a0          </p><p>-\u00a0Powell faces tough task in Hill testimony: \"When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell testifies before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, he is expected to talk about slowing economic activity and increased risks, showing that the Fed is ready to cut interest rates as needed,\" CNBC's Patti Domm reports. \"But Powell is also likely to keep the markets - and the White House - guessing about how soon and how deep the Fed intends to trim rates, when it meets at the end of July. The prevailing view, priced into the futures market, is for a 100% chance of a quarter-point rate cut July 31.\"</p><p>\"'There is no part of what he has to do over the next two days that does not resemble walking a tightrope over Niagara Falls,' said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.\"</p><p>Bespoke Investment Group notes expectations for a rate cut this month have collapsed.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, via CNBC's Carl Quintanilla,\u00a0top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested yesterday that the Fed should heed advice from\u00a0the White House:\u00a0</p><p>- Job openings outnumber workers by 1.4 million. WSJ's Eric Morath: \"The number of unfilled jobs in the U.S. fell slightly in May, but remained near record levels, suggesting demand for workers was strong even during a month when hiring slowed sharply. There were a seasonally adjusted 7.323 million unfilled jobs at the end of May, down 49,000 from the prior month's revised figure, the Labor Department said Tuesday...\u00a0Openings have exceeded the number of unemployed for 15 straight months. Before last year, that had never occurred in nearly two decades of monthly records.\"</p><p>-\u00a0The housing market is about to turn against buyers again: \"Competition in the housing market finally began to cool this year, as listings multiplied and price gains moderated. Bidding wars became less frequent and spring sales perked up a bit. Well, forget that. The heat is on yet again,\" CNBC's Diana Olick reports.</p><p>\"The housing shortage that fueled competition and resulted in sky-high price gains throughout 2017 and the first half of 2018 is on the horizon yet again. Supply is soon expected to drop and potentially hit a new low, according to realtor.com, after increasing in the second half of last year.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>-\u00a0Kudlow says U.S. and China may never reach a deal: \"The United States and China may never be able to reach a trade deal because of the difficulty in resolving the relatively few remaining issues on the table, a top U.S. official said Tuesday,\" Politico's Doug Palmer reports.</p><p>\"During an interview at CNBC's Capital Exchange event in Washington, [Kudlow] said he was an optimist by nature and still believed a deal was possible. But he used a football analogy involving his favorite team to illustrate the potential for the Trump administration to fall short. 'It's like being on the seven-yard line at a football game,' Kudlow said. 'And as a long-suffering New York Giants fan, they could be on the seven and they never get the ball to the end zone.'\"</p><p>             Meanwhile, talks have resumed: \"U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and Minister Zhong Shan on Tuesday to continue negotiations to resolve outstanding trade issues, a U.S. official said,\" Reuters's Chris Prentice reports.</p><p>             Trump administration allows sales to Huawei to resume.\u00a0NYT's Jim Tankersley and Ana Swanson: \"The Trump administration is following through with plans to allow American companies to continue doing business with Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment giant, just weeks after placing the company on a Commerce Department blacklist.</p><p> \"On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the administration will issue licenses for American companies that want to do business with Huawei 'where there is no threat to national security.' And another top official suggested the move would allow chip makers to continue selling certain technology to Huawei.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Trump praises Acosta as he faces growing calls to resign: \"[Trump] praised Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta on Tuesday and said he felt 'very badly'\u00a0for him, as calls mounted for his Cabinet member to resign over his handling, as a U.S. attorney, of an earlier sex crimes case involving financier Jeffrey Epstein,\" my colleague John Wagner reports.</p><p>\"Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump also said the White House would look closely at the circumstances surrounding a 2007 plea deal overseen by Acosta that a growing number of Democrats argued Tuesday was far too lenient on Epstein ... Shortly before, Acosta said in a tweet that he was pleased that federal prosecutors in New York are pursing a new sex trafficking case against Epstein involving minors.\"</p><p>             Epstein recently tried to discuss damage control with a PR professional: \"Private as he was, he was apparently concerned about what the public thought of him. A mutual friend arranged for him to meet R. Couri Hay, a public relations consultant. Mr. Hay said on Monday that their first meeting, at Mr. Epstein's townhouse, took place three years ago,\" the New York Times's James Barron reports.\u00a0</p><p>\"Mr. Epstein was not ready to re-emerge in the public eye - not then, anyway. Three months ago, Mr. Epstein called and invited him over to discuss damage control, Mr. Hay said. 'He hates every story starting with 'billionaire pervert,'\" Mr. Hay said. 'Jeffrey had long stories about the difference between pedophilia with very young children and tweens and teens a little older.' He added, 'It was his way of trying to talk his way around it.' \"</p><p>-\u00a0Boeing set to lose biggest plane-maker title: \"Boeing Co is set to lose the title of being the world's biggest plane maker after reporting a 37% drop in deliveries for the first half of the year due to the prolonged grounding of its best-selling MAX jets,\" Reuters's\u00a0Ankit Ajmera reports.</p><p>\"Boeing deliveries lagged those of Airbus SE, which on Tuesday said it handed over 389 planes in the same period, up 28% from a year earlier. Reuters had reported Airbus delivery numbers on Friday, citing sources. The numbers indicate that Boeing's full-year deliveries are likely to fall behind its European rival for the first time in eight years.\"</p><p>-\u00a0PepsiCo's earnings are on the rise: \"PepsiCo Inc. posted higher quarterly profit and sales as the food-and-beverage giant rolled out new products such as Pepsi Mango and ramped up marketing for some of its more established brands,\" the Wall Street Journal's Jennifer Maloney and Kimberly Chin report.</p><p>\"Under Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta, who took over from longtime chief Indra Nooyi in October, the company has been increasing spending on advertising and distribution networks, broadening its product lines and changing its packaging. Revenue in the company's North America beverages division increased 2.5% in the second quarter, as volume rose in ready-to-drink coffee and water brands such as Lifewtr and Bubly. The Pepsi and Mountain Dew brands, which slumped last year, continued to turn around, executives said.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Virgin Galactic announces it will take its space tourism venture public: \"Before Virgin Galactic starts bringing human beings closer to the cosmos, Richard Branson's space tourism company has set its sights on another new frontier: the New York Stock Exchange,\" my colleagues Taylor Telford and Christian Davenport report.</p><p>\"The British billionaire announced Tuesday that Virgin Galactic planned to become the first human spaceflight company to go public via a merger with a New York investment firm. Social Capital Hedosophia will take a 49 percent stake in the company, which will be valued at roughly $1.5 billion. The firm's chief executive, Chamath Palihapitiya, will invest an additional $100 million in the combined enterprise at $10 per share and become its chairman. The listing is expected before the end of the year.\"</p><p>- Saudi lobbying whirs on. The Post's Beth Reinhard, Jonathan O'Connell and Tom Hamburger: \"After the killing in October of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, a handful of lobbying firms and think tanks made a move rare in Washington: They publicly severed ties with Saudi Arabia, swearing off the kingdom's money. But nine months later, Saudi Arabia's efforts to influence U.S. policy continue unabated - bolstered by President Trump's embrace of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite\u00a0a recent United Nations report that the prince was complicit in the grisly killing and dismemberment of the Washington Post contributing columnist and political dissident.\u00a0</p><p> \"Since fall 2018,\u00a0high-powered lobbyists and lawyers have reaped\u00a0millions of dollars for assisting the kingdom as it works to\u00a0develop nuclear power, buy American-made weapons and prolong U.S. assistance to the Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen,\u00a0foreign lobbying records show.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google to testify to Congress on antitrust: \"Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google have been summoned to Capitol Hill to testify next week as part of House lawmakers' wide-ranging investigation into big tech companies and the threats they may pose to competition,\" my colleague Tony Romm reports.</p><p>\"The hearing, scheduled for July 16 in front of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee that deals with antitrust, will bring simmering Democratic and Republican frustrations with Silicon Valley into public view, potentially setting the stage for further scrutiny - or regulation - of an industry that has long insisted that its size doesn't harm rivals or consumers.\"\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0Joe Biden raked it in after leaving office: \"Joe Biden on Tuesday afternoon reported earning $15.6 million in income over the past two years, making him the wealthiest among his chief competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination,\" my colleagues Matt Viser and Anu Narayanswamy report.</p><p>\"The vast majority of the former vice president's income - which totaled $11 million in 2017 and $4.6 million in 2018 - came from book payments and speaking fees. Biden was also a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was paid $371,159 in 2017 and $405,368 in 2018. The tax returns and financial disclosure statements Biden released Tuesday provided the first picture of the wealth he has accumulated since leaving a 44-year career in government.\"</p><p>- Powell: Stress tests must evolve. WSJ's Lalita Clozel: \"\u00a0Powell said stress tests of the nation's largest banks must adapt and keep firms on their toes, or the annual exam could fail to prepare the financial system for the next downturn. 'If the stress tests do not evolve, they risk becoming a compliance exercise, breeding complacency from both supervisors and banks,'\u00a0Mr. Powell said Tuesday in prepared remarks for a stress-testing conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\"</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Upcoming:          </p><p>             From The Post's Tom Toles:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-883116ca99a14dafac497ac686d48adb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ0-4HB1-JB4M-V0TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2800\"/><timeReceived>11:34 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

The Dow Jones industrial average also surged 2.2 percent Tuesday, spending most of the day above 25,000 before dipping slightly at the close. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which nosed up 0.2 percent, is flirting with all-time highs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several pieces of good news are fueling the latest bout of investor optimism: Merck became the latest drug company to announce progress developing a coronavirus vaccine; economic activity is restarting as shelter-in-place restrictions lift; and the daily number of new infections continues to slide nationally.</p><p>Yet the market's march higher, which defies easy explanation in the context of the ongoing public health and economic calamity, has investors questioning whether it can keep going - or if it's due for another correction if and when the scale of the damage comes into focus.\u00a0</p><p>Here are four arguments for the durability of the rally.\u00a0</p><p>1. The country's economic recovery could be faster than expected.</p><p>The bad news is undeniable - and staggering. Nearly 39 million people have lost their jobs in the past nine weeks. The official unemployment rate of 14.7 percent in April, a toll not seen since the Great Depression, is likely to surpass 20 percent this month. And it has come with a wave of bankruptcies wiping out household names - JC Penney, Hertz and J. Crew, among others - and mom-and-pop operations alike.</p><p>             Yet some authorities see a relatively sharp bounce back taking shape.             \"You could see a fairly rapid recovery,\"\u00a0JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon             said Tuesday at a virtual conference hosted by Deutsche Bank. \"The government has been pretty responsive, large companies have the wherewithal, hopefully we're keeping the small ones alive.\"</p><p>The bank chief \"pointed to economists' forecasts that show unemployment spiking to around 18% this quarter, then falling to 14% in the third quarter and declining to about 10% or 11% by the end of the year,\" Bloomberg News's Michelle Davis reports.</p><p>Dimon added a hint of caution about the possibility of an extended economic collapse. \"If it does go on for a year, it won't be very good,\" he said. \"You can't prop up the stock market forever.\"</p><p>             St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard likewise             presented             a relatively sunny outlook, telling Fox Business Network he sees a rapid recovery that drives the jobless rate back into the single digits by the end of the year.          </p><p>Evidence that consumer confidence is recovering and home sales are picking up bolstered the view that the economy has already seen the worst of the pandemic shock and is now beginning to recover.</p><p>2. The Fed's unprecedented intervention has backstopped stocks.</p><p>As ugly as the economic downturn has been on Main Street, the Fed has pulled out all the stops, helping reverse the damage on Wall Street. The central bank's actions - slashing interest rates to zero and moving to buy trillions of dollars in assets - are providing a massive amount of support to financial markets. Rosenberg Research's David Rosenberg noted a symmetry between the Fed's intervention and the market's gains:</p><p>University of Oregon economist Tim Duy also gives the Fed credit for powering the rally:</p><p>Goldman Sachs analysts, observing the scale of the Fed's moves last month, reversed their bearish projections for stocks. Along with the economic rescue package Congress approved, monetary policymakers' relief measures \"mean our previous near-term downside of 2000 is no longer likely,\" they wrote in a client note. \"If the U.S. does not experience a second surge in infections after the economy reopens, the 'do whatever it takes' stance of policymakers means the equity market is unlikely to make new lows.\"\u00a0</p><p>3. A surging tech sector is pulling the rest of the market up with it.</p><p>There's a reason the Nasdaq, alone among the major indexes, is in the green for the year. Technology companies have dramatically outpaced their rivals, as a number benefit from quarantine restrictions forcing more commercial and social interactions online.          </p><p>\"Big technology companies, which are heavily weighted in the indexes, have driven much of the rebound, continuing a trend that was prevalent during the nearly 11-year bull market,\" the Wall Street Journal's Gunjan Banerji noted earlier this month. \"Five big tech stocks - Microsoft Corp., Apple\u00a0Inc.,\u00a0Amazon.com\u00a0Inc.,\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0Inc. and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Inc. - together make up about 20% of the S&amp;P 500.\"</p><p>4. The economy is experiencing a supply shock, which is less damaging than a demand shock.</p><p>New York magazine writer Josh Barro last week made the case that the nature of this economic crisis could make it easier to recover from than the Great Recession, a fact underlying investors' bet in a turnaround. In the last downturn, he noted, the bursting of the housing bubble prompted people to stop spending, with effects that cascaded through the economy. Now, there's evidence the constraint on consumers is coming at least in part from the other direction, as lockdowns ravage their ability to spend on activities like air travel and hotels.          </p><p> \"Negative supply shocks are bad for the economy,\" Barro wrote. \"But if you believe the supply shock will reverse itself in pretty short order - that much of normal life will resume in a few months, that it will be possible to fly to Cancun next winter and party on the beach - then you might be able to tell a better story about the economic outlook than you could if the recession were driven by a demand shock.\"</p><p>Of course, coronavirus hasn't gone away - and a second wave of outbreaks could scramble the outlook.</p><p>But in the meantime, those trying to assess stocks' values are facing challenges made even more difficult by companies             withdrawing             their earnings guidance.\u00a0          </p><p>\"The market rebound has pushed the S&amp;P 500's forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio to 23.36, its highest level since 2002,\" the WSJ's Paul Vigna and Alexander Osipovich write. \"But corporate profits are expected to remain under pressure until next year as sales tumble and expenses rise.\"</p><p>As S&amp;PDow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt told the paper, \"If we see the upward turn in earnings, then the current levels may be justified. If not, the Street will need to reprice.\"</p><p>             Mitch McConnell signals openness to new stimulus package.          </p><p>             But the details of his offer haven't really changed: \"Congress will 'probably' have to pass more legislation ... Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said,\" CNBC's Jacob Pramuk reports.\u00a0</p><p>\"The Kentucky Republican said a measure to lift the U.S. economy would have a more narrow scope than the $3 trillion package House Democrats approved earlier this month.\u00a0He said states' progress in restarting their economies in the coming weeks will help to inform what Congress does. McConnell noted that 'we need to make sure we have unemployment insurance properly funded for as long as we need,' as tens of millions of people lose paychecks.\"</p><p>             The focus is on small businesses for now: \"Bipartisan legislation that would give small employers more time to take advantage of federal subsidies for payroll and other costs is expected to pass the House this week, as lawmakers return to Washington for an abbreviated two-day session,\" the Associated Press's Andrew Taylor and Lisa Mascaro report.</p><p>\"Senate Republicans are divided on the next steps and wary of another sprawling negotiation where Democrats and the White House call the shots. They are also split on a central element - how much aid to provide state and local governments and other coronavirus response after earlier relief bills totaled almost $3 trillion.\"</p><p>             A tax credit for businesses that keep workers is drawing bipartisan interest: \"The House plan would give employers enough money to cover up to 80 percent of their wages and benefits, up to $45,000 per worker, plus a credit for fixed expenses like rent. Eligible companies would simply keep taxes withheld from employees' paychecks. If that isn't enough to equal the credit, they could get additional money from the Internal Revenue Service,\" the WSJ's Richard Rubin reports.</p><p>\"Smaller businesses would get the subsidy for all workers, while larger ones would get it only for furloughed workers still receiving wages or benefits. The break would be scaled to each employer's revenue loss during the pandemic ... A stand-alone tax-credit bill proposed by Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), largely incorporated into the House package, has support from six House Republicans. Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), have proposed an even larger version that would offer up to 100 percent of wages and benefits up to $90,000.\"</p><p>             Landlords received PPP money. They weren't supposed to: \"The Small Business Administration specifically excluded companies that primarily develop or lease real estate ... But they are aware of at least dozens of property companies that have received in aggregate tens of millions of dollars or more because of a legal loophole that allows them to apply through related business units, such as management companies or construction companies,\" the WSJ's Will Parker and Konrad Putzier report.</p><p>\"This means SBA funds could flow to property investors, something that was never intended.\"\u00a0          </p><p>From the U.S.:</p><p>The corporate front:\u00a0</p><p>Around the world:</p><p>             Whistleblowers allege Facebook isn't telling shareholders about illegal activity.          </p><p>             They level the allegations in a complaint filed late last night: \" A consortium of Facebook insiders and critics filed a confidential whistleblower's complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, claiming the social media giant is aware of illegal activity on its platform, such as the sale of opioids, and has failed to properly police it,\" Nitasha Tiku reports.</p><p>\"The complaint, which was obtained by The Washington Post, includes dozens of pages of screenshots of opioids and other drugs for sale on Facebook and its photo-sharing site Instagram, with some having seemingly obvious tags such as '#buydrugsonline.' It also notes that Facebook has a pattern of taking down content when it is pointed out by media or activists, only to have it reappear later. The filing is part of a campaign by the National Whistleblowers Center to hold Facebook accountable for unchecked criminal activity on its properties. By petitioning the SEC, the consortium is attempting to get around a bedrock law - Section 230 of the Communications and Decency Act - that exempts Internet companies from liability for the user-generated content on their platform.\"</p><p>             Warner Music set to kick off $1.8 billion IPO: \"Warner Music, the world's third-largest recording label and home to artists including Cardi B, Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars, set a price target of $23-$26 per share for 70 million Class A shares, the company said in a regulatory filing. At the top end of the range, the IPO would value Warner Music at $13.26 billion,\" Joshua Franklin and Noor Zainab Hussain report.</p><p>\"Warner Music, majority owned by billionaire Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, is not selling any shares in the listing, with the offering made up entirely of existing shareholders selling stock, a rarity in IPOs.\"</p><p>             Aston Martin replaces CEO amid struggles: \"The replacement of Chief Executive Andy Palmer with Tobias Moers, the chief of Daimler AG 's AMG performance brand, follows a string of disappointments at Aston Martin. Palmer's efforts to revive the brand had faltered and the company's share price has slumped since a lackluster initial public offering in October 2018,\" the WSJ's William Boston reports. \"After Tuesday's announcement, the company's shares surged 43 percent.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Wednesday:          </p><p>             Thursday:          </p><p>             Friday:          </p><p>             From The Post's Tom Toles:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-ba496bcd34244953a77ae1f28ec2a070</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600P-2JH1-DXKP-J368-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2094\"/><timeReceived>11:52 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

The Dow Jones industrial average shed 6.9 percent. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq, a day after it closed above 10,000 for the first time, fell 5.3 percent. Meanwhile, the VIX, Wall Street's fear gauge, leaped nearly 50 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Traders pointed to             rising infections             in at least 20 states, the Federal Reserve's             gloomy economic forecast             , and another 1.5 million Americans             lining up             for jobless insurance.\u00a0          </p><p>Taken together, the developments served as evidence the economy won't mount a sharp, swift rebound that some started taking for granted - and they tossed a bucket of cold water on the rally's cheerleading squad that extends from Wall Street to the White House and beyond.\u00a0       </p><p>             Just as likely a culprit, though, were traders who pushed stocks to extreme valuations looking for an excuse to sell off.           \"One common metric for stocks, known as the price-to-earnings ratio, showed stock prices were way ahead of their historical averages,\" Rachel Siegel and Tom Heath report. \"The S&amp;P 500 had been trading at more than 25 times earnings for the next 12 months compared to its historical average in the 15- to 16-times range.\"</p><p>             The market was \"was overbought by several indicators,\" Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, tells me, and likely \"looking for an alibi,\" since none of the headlines themselves were especially surprising. He noted the S&amp;P 500 closed the session just below its 200-day moving average, a closely tracked gauge of the index's longer-term momentum.</p><p>One lesson: Stocks don't \"only go up.\"\u00a0</p><p>This shouldn't need to be said. But it's increasingly necessary given the that newly-minted day traders, compelled to start investing out of boredom since professional sports went on hiatus, have emerged as a force driving stocks higher.\u00a0</p><p>Barstool Sports CEO Dave Portnoy is the de facto captain of this squad, and he boiled down his strategy to a four-word maxim last month: \"Stocks only go up.\" \u00a0</p><p>             This week, he             called             Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett \"an idiot\" for dumping airline stocks amid the pandemic. \"I'm just printing money,\" Portnoy said. \"Why take profits when every airline goes up 20% every day? Losers take profits... I should be up a billion dollars.\" (Airline stocks tanked on Thursday: \"United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta all dropped more than 14 percent,\" my colleagues noted.)</p><p>Portnoy has cultivated a profile as a provocateur, but he is commanding serious attention with his new hobby. Without mentioning his name, CNBC's Kelly Evans asked White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow about his take on Buffett this week. And the network's Jim Cramer went a lot further, calling Portnoy the \"most important guru in the market, and I'm not exaggerating.\"</p><p>Portnoy speaks for a legion of new traders with seemingly unbridled risk appetites as they chase profits.</p><p>It's difficult to nail down the volume of the trading these investors account for, but there is no doubt there are a lot of them all of a sudden. \"Online brokers are being flooded with new customers. About 1.2 million retail clients started new brokerage accounts at Fidelity Investments between March and May, a 77% increase from the same period last year,\" the Wall Street Journal's Gregory Zuckerman and Mischa Frankl-Duval wrote earlier this week. \"TD Ameritrade\u00a0Holding Corp. reported 608,000 new funded accounts in the three-month period ending March 31, a 249% increase from the year-earlier period. In March alone, new and existing retail clients opened 426,000 funded accounts, the company said.\"</p><p>             They have piled into the market's last perceived bargains as traditional investors kept their distance - airline and cruise stocks, and even those of bankrupt companies, including Hertz and Pier 1. The selloff proved a reckoning. The most popular stocks over the last 24 hours on Robinhood, a free-trading app favored by day traders \"were all in the red Thursday, according to RobinTrack, which follows trading volume on Robinhood. The most bought name - Ford\u00a0Motor Company - was down 9%, with some other top picks down double digits,\" per CNBC's Kate Rooney.\u00a0</p><p>President Trump may not be a day trader, but he talks like one.</p><p>The president was cheerleading the rally in tech stocks as recently as Wednesday:</p><p>As the pullback gained steam Thursday, he blamed the Federal Reserve:</p><p>Kudlow joined the pile-on, pointing at Fed chair Jerome Powell for not being sunny enough this week as he forecast GDP will shrink 6.5 percent this year:</p><p>It was an odd critique, especially since Powell is mostly taking heat for deploying rescue measures perceived as prioritizing financial markets over Main Street. And at his press conference following Fed meetings this week, Powell indicated he wouldn't prick any emerging asset bubbles.</p><p>             Amid the market tumult, \"this is an opportunity for those who are investing for years, and not months or days,\" says Yana Barton, equity portfolio manager at Eaton Vance Management. She argues the Fed's moves should support higher share prices broadly: \"When we try to assess the fair value of S&amp;P 500, what's the true longterm value of an equity security when interest rates are zero or near-zero? It's certainly higher. You can't just dismiss that.\"</p><p>             Futures signal a bounce back on Wall Street.          </p><p>             Volatility remains high: \"Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 478 points, or 2% on Friday. The move implied an opening gain of about 520 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.6%.\u00a0Nasdaq-100 futures added 1.4%,\" CNBC's Fred Imbert and Eustance Huang report.</p><p> \"Even after Friday morning's bounce, Morgan Stanley Investment Management's Andrew Slimmon said: 'Given the magnitude of the rally, it would shock me if we had a one day sell-off and that's it.'\"</p><p>             Senators weigh allowing corporations to accelerate tax breaks.          </p><p>             The lobbying over the next phase of pandemic relief is well under way: \"Some members of the Senate Finance Committee are studying a proposal that would allow corporations to claim a bevy of federal tax credits in 2020 that they would otherwise be ineligible to receive until future years,\" Jeff Stein reports this morning.</p><p>\"Powerful members of Washington's business lobby, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are asking lawmakers to include the tax change in the next congressional legislation being taken up to combat the virus, these people said. Under current law, corporations are generally not allowed to claim federal tax credits if the credits exceed their overall tax liability, meaning they cannot receive more from the government than they pay in. If corporations cannot claim their federal tax credits, they can roll them into future years. The current proposal being discussed by several Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee would void that limit, allowing firms to 'cash out' on all their credits this year.\"</p><p>             Black Lives Matter could change facial recognition forever.          </p><p>             The question is how long will it last: \"Microsoft has joined the list of tech giants that have decided to limit the use of its facial-recognition systems, announcing that it will not sell the controversial technology to police departments until there is a federal law regulating it,\" Jay Greene writes.\u00a0</p><p>\"The move, which Microsoft President Brad Smith confirmed at a Washington Post Live event Thursday, follows similar decisions by Amazon and IBM as protesters nationwide press for an end to police brutality and racial profiling. Smith said Microsoft has not sold its facial-recognition technology to police departments. And the company has backed legislation in California that would allow police use of the technology with some restrictions.\"</p><p>             Dockworkers to shut down West Coast ports: \"On June 19th, members of the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union (ILWU) will shut down 29 ports across the West coast in solidarity with ongoing protests over the murder of George Floyd. The day of action is slated for Juneteenth, the day celebrating the heralding of the emancipation proclamation to Texan slaves more than two years after the proclamation took effect in 1863,\" the Nation's Daniel Boguslaw reports.</p><p>Apple will increase spending with black-owned suppliers:           Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook \"made the remarks in a video posted to Twitter announcing a $100 million racial equity and justice initiative in the wake of the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis,\" Reuters's Stephen Nellis reports.</p><p>             Google's new rules clamp down on discriminatory ads: Alphabet Inc's Google said \"it was tackling unlawful discrimination by barring housing, employment and credit ads from being targeted to its users based on their postal code, gender, age, parental status or marital status,\" Reuters's Paresh Dave reports.</p><p>\"The new policy, which will take effect by the end of the year in the United States and Canada, comes more than a year after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development sued Facebook Inc for selling discriminatory housing ads and said that it was looking into similar concerns about Google and Twitter Inc. Google and Facebook together account for just over half of internet ad sales globally, making their policy actions influential in the industry.\"</p><p>             Snap CEO defends to decision to restrict Trump: \"We've always said Discover is a closed platform, and we choose the types of content we want to promote on our platform. We're well within our First Amendment rights to decide what shows up on there,\" Evan Spiegel told CNBC, Jessica Bursztynsky reports.</p><p>\"Snap announced last week it will no longer promote [Trump's] content within Snapchat's Discover feature. It took the step after Trump on social media addressed riots in the aftermath of the death of [Floyd], saying, 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts.' \"       </p><p>Walmart will stop locking \"multicultural\" products: The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer \"said it will stop locking up 'multicultural' hair and beauty products in display cases in a move that civil rights activists and academics say is long overdue,\" Abha Bhattarai reports.</p><p>\"Major retailers have taken steps to publicly support the Black Lives Matter movement and fund anti-racism initiatives. Others are making incremental changes to address racial disparities. Cosmetics giant Sephora, for example, has pledged to devote at least 15 percent of its shelf space to black-owned businesses.\"       </p><p>             The corporate front:\u00a0          </p><p>             From the U.S.:          </p><p>             Twitter cracks down on accounts it says are linked to China's Communist Party.          </p><p>             Experts say it's noteworthy Beijing is trying stealthy push propaganda: \"Twitter has suspended more than 23,000 accounts it says were linked to the Chinese Communist Party and covertly spreading \u00adpropaganda to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and counter criticism of Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak that grew to a global pandemic,\" Ellen Nakashima, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Anna Fifield report.</p><p>\"The campaign recently has broadened to exploit racial unrest in the United States ... One account, for instance, tweeted an image of Lady Liberty with a knee on the neck of George Floyd, the unarmed black man whose death last month after a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck has sparked global protests and calls for police reform.\"</p><p>             E.U. to level antitrust charges against Amazon.          </p><p>             Charges come as big tech companies face scrutiny in the U.S.: \"The charges-the EU's first set of formal antitrust accusations against the company-could officially be filed as early as next week or the week after ... The European Commission, the bloc's top antitrust regulator, has been honing its case, and the case team has been circulating a draft of the charge sheet for a couple of months ...,\" the WSJ's Valentina Pop and Sam Schechner report.</p><p>\"The charges-called a statement of objections-stem from Amazon's dual role as a marketplace operator and a seller of its own products, the people said. In them, the EU accuses Amazon of scooping up data from third-party sellers and using that information to compete against them, for instance by launching similar products.\"       </p><p>Taco Bell parent Yum sues GrubHub: \"Yum bought a 3 percent stake in the third-party delivery app in 2018 as more national chains looked to lift sales by offering delivery. As part of the deal, the two signed a contract that required the delivery app to give Yum favorable pricing and service levels for thousands of Taco Bell and KFC restaurants, which are largely operated by franchisees,\" CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports.</p><p>\"The new fees will mean that consumers will have to pay nearly 40 percent more for GrubHub deliveries of food from Yum's restaurants.\"</p><p>Biden campaign is keeping his economic brain trust under wraps.</p><p>             The former vice president's team mostly refuses to divulge who is advising him: \"Some broad contours have become clear. Biden plays down concerns about the deficit during this recession ... and he has begun soliciting ambitious plans to bridge the gap in earnings and wealth between black and white Americans. His regular briefings are by a small group of liberal economists and others with roots in the Obama White House and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. And he sees the economic recovery as his foremost duty if he wins the presidency,\" the New York Times's Jim Tankersley and Thomas Kaplan report.</p><p>\"Yet the details of the policymaking process are closely held. Biden is now seeking input from more than 100 left-leaning economists and other researchers, but there is little clarity on who has true influence. The Biden campaign recently formed an economic policy committee, which includes these outside experts, and imposed strict rules to ensure their public silence.\"</p><p>             Biden outlined how he would reopen the economy amid the coronavirus:           \"Trump has basically had a one-point plan: Open businesses,\" Biden said at an economic roundtable in Philadelphia, where he announced a plan to reopen the economy, the Associated Press's Will Weissert and Alexandra Jaffe report.</p><p>\"If elected, Biden promised to guarantee testing and protective equipment for people called back to work, while prohibiting discrimination against elderly Americans and others at high risk of contracting the virus. He also wants to use federal funds to ensure paid leave for anyone who falls ill or cares for those who do. He proposed a national contact tracing workforce or 'job corps' of at least 100,000 to call people who test positive, track down their contacts and get them into quarantine. That figure aligns with an estimate from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\"</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>From The Post's \u00a0Ann Telnaes\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-1cedf646836e4cc8904dd3d669ed9a1c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6043-KD71-DXKP-J188-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2620\"/><timeReceived>12:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 12, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001NW4</classCode><className>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS524210 INSURANCE AGENCIES &amp;

Further, the Chinese foreign ministry said Tuesday it will follow through with an April pledge\u00a0to slash tariffs on American cars, cutting\u00a0the import duties from 25 to 15 percent.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two sides are still working out the terms of the ZTE agreement, The Wall Street Journal's Lingling Wei and Bob Davis report. But the rough outline revolves around the U.S. removing a seven-year ban on the export of parts the company needs to stay in business in return for ZTE shaking up its management and potentially paying steep fines. The decision on autos, meanwhile, is likely to offer limited upside to American carmakers, since imports only account for about 4 percent of car sales in China and the move will also benefit \"European and Asian manufacturers from Daimler AG to Toyota Motor Corp,\"\u00a0Bloomberg notes.</p><p>             What's notable in the flurry of activity is what\u00a0the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is not prying from the Chinese: Namely, any changes to its deep-rooted program of abusing U.S. intellectual property, otherwise strong-arming American companies doing business there and providing anti-competitive support to domestic industries. Demands that China curb those practices lay at the heart of the case the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>had been building.</p><p>             Even before the overnight developments, Trump supporters -\u00a0and those cheerleading his get-tough approach to trade with China - began\u00a0reckoning with the likelihood that the president is abandoning the cause.\u00a0          </p><p>Trump all but confirmed he's backing away from a showdown with the nation's leading economic rival in a series of tweets Monday. Trump's tell: Rather than pledging to keep up the pressure on Beijing, the president began declaring a premature victory over a deal not yet sketched in pencil.\u00a0</p><p>             \"It gives the appearance of waffling,\" says Dan DiMicco,\u00a0the former chief executive\u00a0of steel producer Nucor and a Trump trade adviser who oversaw the transition team's work on the issue. DeMicco pointed\u00a0as the first signs of trouble to the president's decision to back off the crackdown on ZTE and then naming Treasury Secretary <person><nameText>Steven Mnuchin </nameText></person>to lead talks with Beijing.\u00a0</p><p>\"All the Chinese want to do is maintain the status quo, so they can keep stealing and cheating,\" he says. \"<person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>was elected to stop that ... I still believe he's going to take care of it. But these delays seem to be playing into China's hand. We've been doing the same thing for 25 years.\"</p><p><person><nameText>Stephen K. Bannon, </nameText></person>Trump's former political strategist, expressed similar alarm.In a Monday interview with Bloomberg News's Kevin Cirilli, the onetime keeper of the \"America First\" flame also blamed Mnuchin for the administration's turn toward\u00a0Beijing. Trump \"changed the dynamic regarding China, but in one weekend Secretary Mnuchin has given it away,\" Bannon said. \"You might as well have Hank Paulson doing this.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"For him to say the trade war is 'on hold?' It misses the central point,\" Bannon continued. \"They're in a trade war with us and it hasn't stopped. Mnuchin has completely misread the geopolitical military and historical precedence, and what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>had done was finally put the Chinese on their back heels.\"</p><p>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) likewise criticized the Trump's accommodation and said he will push congressional action to head it off:\u00a0</p><p>Other critics of the administration's softening say the rapproachment\u00a0fails to make a dent in rampant Chinese trade abuses.</p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer catalogued those practices in a March report. It described a Chinese campaign of plundering American intellectual property to assist the country's bid to dominate the fields of robotics, electric vehicles, aerospace, artificial intelligence and others. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing and a champion of a tougher approach to China, said he \"can't escape the feeling that the administration got somewhat played this round.\"\u00a0          </p><p>\"The question for me is what did we get out of it?\" Paul says. \"There's a lot of work to be done and we may have given away the best leverage point we had for a long time, which is the threat of tariffs.\" And he said if Trump has lost DiMicco, \"he's lost his base on trade.\"\u00a0</p><p>That depends on the definition of Trump's base. Fred Bergsten, founding director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, agrees the administration is missing an opportunity to confront\u00a0structural issues. But he sees the president maneuvering toward a political win as Beijing looks primed to break out a checkbook for more American agricultural and energy products. \"He'll be able to go to Des Moines and say to the farmers, 'You were afraid you were going to lose sales because of tariffs. Now you're going to gain sales.' \"          </p><p>Bergsten gives credit to China for accurately assessing that Trump is mostly concerned with narrowing the bilateral trade deficit. \"They've read him correctly in terms of what they can do to assuage him at the least cost to themselves. We're talking about a managed trade solution, where the Chinese buy more soybeans from the U.S. and fewer from Brazil, more aircraft from the U.S. and fewer from Europe, more semiconductors from the U.S. and fewer from Japan. That's relatively easy for them to do,\" he says.</p><p>For the United States, Bersgsten\u00a0says that it has the virtue of averting an\u00a0escalation of the conflict. \"Any serious effort to get the Chinese to abandon [its industrial policy] would have failed, Trump would have retaliated, and we would have had a trade war. Given the realistic counterfactual, this is not a bad outcome.\"</p><p>The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip writes that China is winning, in part because Trump's \"own tolerance for pain appears limited. Though the U.S. depends much less on exports to China than the reverse, China targeted farm exports from Republican states important to the outcome of November's midterm elections. That may explain why U.S. officials have prioritized avoiding Chinese retaliation. China still holds the weaker hand in this trade dispute-but it has played that hand far better.\"</p><p>- Stocks jump as trade war fears ebb. WSJ's\u00a0Gunjan Banerji\u00a0and Jon Sindreu: \"The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged nearly 300 points Monday to its highest level in more than two months as concerns about a possible trade war between the U.S. and China temporarily eased ...\u00a0Analysts cautioned, though, that the two countries haven't reached a final resolution and that investor optimism could be short-lived. 'I'm very skeptical that we're anywhere near a resolution on China,'\u00a0said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald ...\u00a0The Dow industrials jumped 298.20 points, or 1.2%, to 25013.29 - the first time the blue-chip index topped the 25000 milestone since March 16, before\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Inc.'s\u00a0data-privacy scandal sparked a big selloff in technology stocks that spread to the broader market.\"</p><p>             Mnuchin's\u00a0\"very bullish\" on stocks. CNBC's Berkeley Lovelace Jr.: \"Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that he would be willing to bet that gross domestic product\u00a0can sustain at least 3 percent growth later this year. 'That's really been the focus. That's what everyone should be focused on. That's our scorecard,\" he said in a 'Squawk Box'\u00a0interview. 'We are well on our way to 3 percent or higher sustained growth,'\u00a0he predicted ...\u00a0Mnuchin said the stock market is reflecting an improving economy ... 'There have obviously been various different world events and things that have created some volatility,'\u00a0he said. 'But the stock market is up an enormous amount since the election.'\"</p><p>- Corporate bonds tank. Bloomberg's Cecile Gutscher: \"You need to rifle through 18 years of history to find selloffs that compare to the one corporate bond investors are now enduring. Debt of American companies just posted their third-worst 100-day returns since 2000, according to a JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. index, as tighter monetary conditions leave their mark on high-quality bonds with longer maturities. With negative returns likely to scare off retail investors, the outlook for the asset class looks grim, JPMorgan strategists said in a Friday note. But they find a silver lining: the highest yields in almost five years are likely to discourage new bond supply, which would at least help the technical picture.\"</p><p>- Mnuchin: Justice Department should scrutinize Big Tech. Axios's\u00a0David McCabe: \"Mnuchin said Monday that the Justice Department should look at the increasing dominance of major tech companies ... 'These are issues that the Justice Department needs to look at seriously - not for any one company - but obviously as these technology companies have a greater and greater impact on the economy, I think that you have to look at the power they have,'\u00a0Mnuchin said\u00a0on CNBC following a 60 Minutes segment Sunday night on concerns about Google's power.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:\u00a0          </p><p>- Trump team divisions undercut progress against China. NYT's Mark Landler and Ana Swanson: \"Ceaseless infighting and jockeying for influence on the White House's trade team helped deprive Mr. Trump of a quick victory on his most cherished policy agenda, several people involved in the talks said. The deep internal divisions carried over into how officials characterized the agreement and muddied the outlook for the next phase of the negotiations between Washington and Beijing... The Chinese were well aware of the divisions in the administration's trade team - and set out to exploit them, according to people briefed on the deliberations.\"</p><p>- Photo of trade negotiators goes viral in China. NYT's Raymond Zhong: \"During trade talks in Washington last week, some people in China saw an exorcism of bitter, century-old ghosts. After Chinese delegates met with American lawmakers on Thursday, a photograph taken from one end of the table circulated on the popular Chinese social media service Weibo. It was shared alongside one from 1901, when representatives from China and colonial powers signed an accord to end the Boxer Rebellion, a violent uprising against foreign influence in China.\u00a0In the earlier black-and-white photo from Beijing, the representatives from the West cut a striking contrast with the elderly envoys of the Qing dynasty.\u00a0But in the photo from Washington, it is the Americans who appear to be older. 'Over the past 100 years, American officials have gone from young to old, and Chinese officials have gone from old to young,'\u00a0one Weibo user wrote. 'This has a lot to do with the current state of the two countries. America today is just as closed off as China was 100 years ago.'\"\u00a0</p><p>The photo:</p><p>- Commodities set for a win. Bloomberg runs down the American products that stand to win from easing trade war fears - everything from cotton to crude oil. Reuters notes there's a limit to the benefits for producers of those goods China looks likely to buy more of: \"Infrastructure bottlenecks mean energy and commodity exports can grow only gradually, and only if U.S. oil, gas and other goods remain cost attractive against global competition. Morgan Stanley estimates it could take up to three years to increase Chinese purchases of U.S. goods by $60 billion to $90 billion, with a rise in agricultural imports in the near term followed by energy.\"</p><p>             MELTDOWN WATCH:\u00a0          </p><p>- WH will review classified info with GOP lawmakers. The Post's Matt Zapotosky, Seung Min Kim, Carol Leonnig, and Devlin Barrett: \"The White House and the Justice Department have put off a high-stakes confrontation over the FBI's use of a confidential source to aid an investigation into the Trump campaign, after top law enforcement and intelligence officials met with... Trump on Monday to discuss the brewing controversy. A White House spokeswoman said Chief of Staff John F. Kelly plans to convene another gathering between the officials and congressional leaders to 'review highly classified and other information'\u00a0about the source and intelligence he provided. That could be viewed as something of a concession from the Justice Department, which had been reluctant to turn over materials on the source to GOP lawmakers demanding them. But it also could be a bureaucratic maneuver to buy time and shield actual documents.\"</p><p>- GOP wounds Dodd-Frank, but it will survive. Politico's Victoria Guida and Zachary Warmbrodt: \"Congress is expected to send to Trump's desk this week a bank deregulation\u00a0bill\u00a0rolling back several pieces of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which imposed sweeping new rules on banks in the wake of the financial crisis. But despite Trump's promises to \"do a big number\" on Dodd-Frank, the bipartisan bill that is likely to be approved by the House as early as Tuesday leaves many of the Republicans' most-hated provisions of the law in place, including the foundations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the government's power to unwind failing megabanks...\u00a0</p><p> \"The bill would scale back key sections of Dodd-Frank. Regional banks scored a huge victory by lifting a regulatory threshold that subjects them to stricter oversight by the Federal Reserve. Small banks secured streamlined capital requirements and exemptions from mortgage-lending rules. But most of the nation's biggest global banks - including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs - will get little from the legislation.\"</p><p>The administration has more ammo to aim at financial industry regulations. On Monday, Trump signed a repeal of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that targeted racial discrimination in auto lending. \"Trump's signature on a congressional resolution erases the CFPB's 2013 guidance targeting 'dealer markups,'\u00a0the additional interest that is added to a customer's third-party auto loan as compensation for the dealer,\" The Hill's Sylvan Lane writes. \"The president\u00a0signed the resolution in a private White House signing ceremony. Auto dealers, banks and their allies in Congress said the CFPB policy was an unfair and unfounded attack on an essential and harmless financing tool.\"</p><p>             Up next: A rollback of the Volcker Rule.\u00a0\"The Fed and other federal banking regulators are poised to soften the Volcker Rule, making it easier for giant banks to engage in a wider range of trading that can be highly profitable, but also very risky,\" NYT's Emily Flitter and Alan Rappeport write. \"The changes, which are expected to be proposed later this month, are emblematic of the larger deregulatory effort underway in Washington... The real action is at the financial regulatory agencies, like the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which have broad powers over the banking system.\"</p><p>- Dems make anti-corruption pitch. The Post's Mike DeBonis: \"Democrats plan to highlight allegations of corruption surrounding the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>- and a legislative agenda to prevent future abuses - as they continue rolling out their party platform ahead of November's midterm elections. The first planks of the 'A Better Deal'\u00a0platform,\u00a0released last year,\u00a0focused on the party's economic agenda. Now, with questions about pay-to-play politics swirling around...\u00a0Trump and his current and former aides, Democrats\u00a0introduced new anti-corruption proposals Monday billed as 'A Better Deal for Our Democracy.' 'Instead of delivering on his promise to drain the swamp, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has become the swamp,'\u00a0said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a rollout event on the Capitol steps.\"</p><p>- Mulvaney\u00a0has talked to McCarthy about replacing Ryan. The Post's Mike DeBonis: \"White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged having\u00a0discussions with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about replacing House Speaker Paul D. Ryan before Ryan retires from Congress next year, a conservative newsmagazine reported Monday. The\u00a0Weekly Standard reported\u00a0that Mulvaney\u00a0made the remarks\u00a0Sunday during a conference sponsored by the publication in Colorado Springs. Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier asked Mulvaney\u00a0about the prospect of McCarthy succeeding Ryan this year, before the midterm elections, and Mulvaney suggested that\u00a0it would become a referendum on the top Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi.</p><p> \"'I've talked with Kevin about this privately but not as much publicly,'\u00a0Mulvaney said, according to the Weekly Standard. 'Wouldn't it be great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election? That's a really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do it.'\u00a0The comment constitutes a\u00a0remarkable admission from a\u00a0member of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>Cabinet that could be interpreted as conspiring to remove a sitting House speaker belonging to the president's own party.\"</p><p>As for forcing a vote on Pelosi, The Post's Dave Weigel runs down why that gambit makes no sense.\u00a0</p><p>- SCOTUS: Companies can force workers into individual arbitration. The Post's Robert Barnes: \"An ideologically divided Supreme Court ruled Monday that companies may require workers to settle employment disputes through individual arbitration rather than joining to press their complaints, a decision affecting as many as 25\u00a0million workers. The court's conservative majority said that the\u00a05-to-4 ruling\u00a0was a logical reading of federal law, and Congress's preference for using arbitration to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation. But the decision, involving a wage dispute, was roundly criticized on the left, and advocates said it could make it harder to press other workplace complaints such as discrimination and sexual harassment.\"</p><p>- NYSE to get first female leader. WSJ's\u00a0Bradley Hope\u00a0and Alexander Osipovich: \"The New York Stock Exchange is set to get its first female leader in its 226-year history. Stacey Cunningham, the NYSE's chief operating officer, will become the Big Board's 67th president, the exchange's parent\u00a0Intercontinental Exchange\u00a0Inc.\u00a0told The Wall Street Journal. She will start her new role Friday, succeeding Thomas Farley, an ICE veteran who is leaving the Atlanta-based company.\"</p><p>- U.S., Canada launch crypto probes. Reuters's Pete Schroeder: \"U.S. and Canadian state securities regulators announced Monday they have launched dozens of investigations into cryptocurrency scams.\u00a0The North American Securities Administrators Association announced the wide-ranging series of probes on Monday, dubbed 'Operation Crypto-Sweep.'\u00a0The investigations, some of which have already concluded, are aimed at unregistered securities offerings and initial coin offerings that promise significant returns without informing investors of the risks. A task force convened by the group of state regulators in April has launched 70 investigations, with 35 already facing completed or pending enforcement actions.\"</p><p>             Today          </p><p>             Coming Up          </p><p>From The Post's Tom Toles:\u00a0</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>calls the\u00a0$20 million Russia probe\u00a0a \"witch hunt\" and a waste of taxpayer money:\u00a0</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said he will ask the Justice Department to look into whether the Obama administration surveilled his 2016 campaign</p><p>Stephen Colbert on the leaks coming out of the White House:\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-f2ade49244e74953b5736facf48d3710</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SCR-H641-JB4M-V0RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3259\"/><timeReceived>12:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 22, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC0002C6N</classCode><className>DAIMLER AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC0002KW1</classCode><className>TOYOTA MOTOR CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>DAI (FRA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>DAI (BIT)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>TYT (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>TM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>7203 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDNBODg4OUE4OERBNDYzMjhBNjhEQjYyOTU3QkYxMTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

We have another $325 billion we can put a tariff on, if we want,\" Trump said at a Tuesday morning cabinet meeting. \"So, we're talking to China about a deal, but I wish they didn't break the deal that we had.\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The comments spooked the market, knocking stocks off record highs and snapping a five-day rally by the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>But the president's remarks were just the latest in a series of recent signals he's given indicating he wants to keep the heat on the Chinese government. Trump has sent several tweets this week, for example, suggesting the tariffs he has already imposed on Chinese imports has Beijing on the ropes:\u00a0</p><p>And Tuesday morning, he tweeted that his administration will \"take a look\" into whether Google is guilty of treason for working with the Chinese government, despite no evidence to support the claim besides an accusation leveled by billionaire investor and Trump backer Peter Thiel:\u00a0</p><p>             While Trump plays bad cop, others in his inner circle are promoting the potential resumption of negotiations. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday the two sides are set to hold a \"principal-level call\" this week. If all goes well, Mnuchin said, he will travel to Beijing with U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer to continue talks.\u00a0</p><p>But some China watchers say there may be less to the administration's latest China maneuverings than meets the eye. \"I think our side is gradually coming to recognize that they've painted themselves into a corner here,\" says Bill Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The Chinese are not going to do everything we want. And the president's choice at some point is going to be accept an agreement that's weaker than he wants or restart the trade war... Those are not great options and they're certainly not great political options.\"</p><p>Given the stakes, the Eurasia Group in a Tuesday report pointed to \"the rising probability that trade negotiations do not produce a deal in 2019 and the parties instead maintain an uneasy status quo that keeps tariffs in place but avoids further escalation.\" The firm sees a \"muddle-through strategy\" as \"the new base case for 2019, and perhaps through the US presidential election cycle.\"</p><p>Then again, the direction of U.S. trade policy toward China remains entirely in Trump's hands. And the president has demonstrated his willingness to turn that policy on a dime, most recently in May, when he blew up expectations of an imminent deal and ramped up existing tariffs on Chinese imports instead.\u00a0</p><p>             If Trump makes good on his Tuesday threat to slap levies on as-yet-untaxed Chinese goods, consumers would see higher prices on staples including apparel, electronics and furniture. So the move would invite considerable political peril. \"That said, we have seen [Trump's] affinity for tariffs, and we have seen how he likes to use plenty of leverage in his negotiations,\" Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold &amp; Porter in Washington and a former assistant U.S. trade representative for China, tells me in an email. \"Perhaps he would choose a subset of products out of the $300 billion and wait until after major seasonal sales were over to impose tariffs, or perhaps he would impose a low level tariff.\"          </p><p>Despite Trump's argument that a slowing Chinese economy is stoking urgency among its leadership to cut a deal, Beijing has taken a harder line toward the U.S. in recent days. That includes the promotion of Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, considered a trade hawk, to a more prominent role in negotiations. Plus, the Chinese have balked at making major purchases of American agricultural goods, leaving Trump hanging on a commitment believe he secured at the G-20. Those developments have stirred concern among Trump allies that \"the Chinese are digging in and avoiding firm commitments,\" my colleagues Bob Costa and David Lynch reported last week.\u00a0</p><p>If that is in fact the case, Trump imposing more tariffs in an attempt to break the Chinese could backfire. Says Reade, \"China's interest in a deal seems likely to depend on a strategic calculus about the costs versus the benefits, understanding that China will not enter an agreement where there is a serious risk of losing face.\"</p><p>- Trump's policies could help him secure Fed cuts. The New York Times's Jeanna\u00a0Smialek: \"Trump lacks official power to make the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, but he may have found a way to force its hand: stoking economic uncertainty. The Fed's chair, Jerome H. Powell, has signaled that he and his colleagues could cut interest rates at their upcoming meeting as inflation remains stubbornly low and risks, including Mr. Trump's trade war with China, threaten economic growth. Mr. Powell, speaking in Paris on Tuesday,\u00a0reiterated that the Fed\u00a0would act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion.\"</p><p>             And the Fed appears to be ignoring encouraging news. The Wall Street Journal's Justin Lahart: \"As the Fed has been busy sharpening its shears, its reasons for cutting rates have become less and less compelling. A couple of reports Tuesday added to the evidence. First, the Commerce Department reported that\u00a0retail sales rose\u00a00.4% in June from May. That was better than the 0.1% economists had expected... Consumer spending now looks to have grown at a 4.3% annual rate in the second quarter... which would count as the fastest pace since 2014.\u00a0Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that\u00a0manufacturing output increased\u00a0by 0.4% in June from May.\"</p><p>             Dallas Fed prez: One rate cut could be enough. The Post's Heather Long: \"Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan has joined the chorus of central bank leaders hinting strongly that an interest-rate cut is coming at the end of July, but he does not see the need for additional cuts this year. Kaplan said Tuesday that he could support a 'modest tactical adjustment'\u00a0down in interest rates. 'Not the start of a rate-cutting cycle, but a tactical adjustment that's restrained and modest? That might be appropriate. I could see an argument for that,'\u00a0Kaplan told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:\u00a0          </p><p>- Lighthizer struggles to sell USMCA. WSJ's Natalie Andrews: \"Despite winning friends in Congress, [Lighthizer] is struggling to overcome resistance to ratifying the deal struck by [Trump] last year. 'We're all frustrated,'\u00a0House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal said on Tuesday after leaving a meeting with Mr. Lighthizer where lawmakers presented their objections to the agreement...</p><p> \"Democrats, who took control of the House this year, are asking for stricter enforcement provisions-especially for new labor rules aimed at Mexico-and stronger environmental protections, as well as a shorter term on the 10-year exclusivity for costly biologic drugs. Lawmakers say that while Mr. Lighthizer has listened to their concerns, he needs to start taking concrete steps to reopen negotiations with Mexico and Canada.\"</p><p>             NAM swarms Hill to push USMCA:\u00a0The National Association of Manufacturers is hosting a fly-in on Capitol Hill today featuring more than 132 participants taking over 120 meetings with key House Democrats and Republicans to push for the passage of Trump's NAFTA 2.0 deal. Per the group, NAM\u00a0president and CEO\u00a0Jay Timmons will be on hand as well.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Consumer lending\u00a0boost big banks:\u00a0 \"U.S. consumers are taking advantage of low interest rates to borrow and spend, boosting banks that cater to Main Street and leaving behind those that don't,\" WSJ's\u00a0David Benoit, Liz Hoffman and Rachel Louise Ensign report.</p><p> \"Booming consumer businesses drove quarterly profits higher at JPMorgan Chase,\u00a0Wells Fargo\u00a0and Citigroup Inc. while trading and deal fees shrank. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which lacks a big consumer operation, was the only large U.S. bank to report lower profit in the second quarter than it did a year ago.\"</p><p>             Meanwhile, lower interest rates are weighing on their revenue. Bloomberg's Michelle Davis and Elizabeth Rembert: \"Jamie Dimon compared the fickleness of banks' biggest revenue source to the wind. For the first time in years, it's blowing against them. Dimon's bank,\u00a0JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., snapped a three-year streak of quarterly increases in net interest income -- revenue from customers' loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors -- and said it will fall further in the second half of 2019.\u00a0Wells Fargo &amp; Co.\u00a0posted its smallest lending income since 2016, while\u00a0Citigroup Inc.'s\u00a0net interest margin hit the lowest in five quarters.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Pelosi 'hopeful' budget deal will happen this month: \"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested on Tuesday that she and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin may be within striking distance of a two-year agreement to avoid billions in automatic spending cuts and a default on the nation's debt,\"\u00a0Politico's Caitlin Emma and Sarah Ferris report.</p><p>\"'We have a clear understanding of what we want to agree to and I think that's progress,'\u00a0the California Democrat told reporters after speaking by phone to Mnuchin. The two plan to talk again on Wednesday after days of ongoing negotiations ...\u00a0Pelosi's comments to reporters - just hours after she said she was 'hopeful'\u00a0for a deal by next week - come amid a flurry of negotiations with Mnuchin, who has led the talks for Republicans, over the last week.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Big Tech on the hot seat:\u00a0\"House lawmakers grilled executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in a hearing Tuesday as part of their wide-ranging investigation into big tech companies and the threats they may pose to competition,\" my colleagues Marie C. Baca and\u00a0Cat Zakrzewski report.\u00a0</p><p>\"The hearing, held by the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee that deals with antitrust, allowed for a bipartisan showing by lawmakers as they quizzed executives on the size and scope of their businesses and put on public display the increasing frustration in the nation's capital with Silicon Valley...\u00a0Lawmakers asked about a range of topics from digital piracy to the disappearance of Facebook competitor MySpace to Amazon's competition with sellers that do business on its website -- all with the aim of uncovering how the big tech companies have become so dominant.\"</p><p>Facebook also faced a Senate grilling over Libra.The Post's Renae Merle: \"Skeptical lawmakers on Tuesday questioned Facebook's plan to help create a global currency, arguing that the Silicon Valley giant is seeking unprecedented influence over the financial system.

But if the Federal Reserve continues to frustrate him by declining to cut them deeply and quickly enough, he could soon fire at a different target: the U.S. dollar.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday affirmed his support for a strong dollar. \"I do believe in a strong dollar, which signifies a strong U.S. economy, a strong stock market and particularly, because of the president's economic policies, we have growth in the U.S. that has outpaced everywhere else,\"\u00a0he said in a CNBC interview. See him here:\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The president and his team elsewhere have sent a number of recent signals that a policy shift isn't off the table. Mnuchin, speaking last week at the Group of Seven meeting of finance ministers, said an intervention to weaken the dollar is \"something we could consider in the future.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump has fired off several tweets in recent weeks complaining that trading partners from China to Europe are gaining an unfair advantage over the United States by manipulating their\u00a0currencies.\u00a0</p><p>The United States could join in by selling the dollar. The move would weaken it against other currencies, making American goods cheaper to foreign buyers, thereby boosting exports             and giving a lift to a domestic manufacturing sector struggling, in part, under the weight of Trump's trade war. It would also improve the value of sales that multinational companies book abroad, goosing earnings: The strong greenback\u00a0cut 1.7 percent from S&amp;P 500 sales in the second quarter, according to a Bank of America analysis.\u00a0</p><p>             But a weak dollar also translates into higher prices on imports for consumers and manufacturers buying foreign components.\u00a0And it dings the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency, a status the administration wants to protect,\u00a0Mnuchin said on CNBC. \"I think the dollar is the reserve currency of the world. It's in our interest; we want to maintain it,\" he said.\u00a0Administrations have hewed to a strong-dollar position since the Clinton era.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, Trump has broadcast his desire for a weaker dollar from the earliest days of his presidency (though he also reportedly struggled back then to determine whether he preferred a stronger or weaker currency).\u00a0Now, a strengthening currency and his desire to pump up the economy as his reelection campaign ramps up\u00a0appear to have sharpened his focus on it.          </p><p>The president quizzed his two most recent Fed board nominees in interviews for the posts earlier this month, according to Bloomberg News. Per that report, Larry Kudlow - the top White House economic adviser, who was sitting in on one of the meetings - reminded Trump that Treasury, rather than the Fed, is responsible for setting dollar policy.\u00a0He has also reportedly asked aides to explore ways to weaken the dollar.\u00a0</p><p>The buzz around Trump's renewed interest has prompted Wall Street banks to study what an intervention could look like and what it would mean. A UBS report last week, for example, found that Trump has broad authority to set dollar policy. \"While we do not think the US is likely to intervene, the President has the power and resources to do so,\" the report said. And when it comes to trying to level the playing field with trading partners, UBS economists said they think Trump \"is likely to stick to tariff policy.\"</p><p>Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group came to a similar conclusion earlier this month. \"It remains unclear if Trump is simply creating scapegoats for 2020 by preparing the ground for the Fed and the dollar to take the blame for a weakening economy, or edging inevitably toward action,\" he wrote. \"Even his advisers don't seem to know.\"          </p><p>So Trump, as on most major issues that give him unilateral authority, remains both the only relevant decision-maker and a wild card. As the Wall Street Journal's Justin Lahart put it, \"Just because intervention might be largely symbolic and would be a break with precedent doesn't mean it won't happen.\"</p><p>- Some stocks reach record highs. CNBC's Fred Imbert: \"The\u00a0S&amp;P 500\u00a0and\u00a0Nasdaq Composite\u00a0reached all-time highs on Wednesday, propelled by a rally in chip stocks as investors shook off regulatory concerns facing Big Tech. The broad index rose 0.5% to 3,019.56, a record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped nearly 0.9% to end the day at 8,321.50... Other companies such as UPS and AT&amp;T also got a boost from strong results...\u00a0However, the\u00a0Dow Jones Industrial Average\u00a0closed 79.22 points lower at 27,269.97 as investors pored through disappointing earnings from Boeing and Caterpillar.\"</p><p>- Johnson doubles down on Brexit. Bloomberg: \"Boris Johnson stressed his 'absolute commitment'\u00a0to leaving the EU on Oct. 31 and said he would 'turbo-charge'\u00a0preparations for a no-deal divorce as he set out his priorities for government. He made the comments in a speech to Parliament after the first meeting of his new cabinet on Thursday morning...\u00a0Johnson sought to establish the idea that preparing for a no-deal Brexit should be a national effort to reduce disruption. 'I believe that is possible with the kind of national effort that the British people have made before and will make again,'\u00a0he said.\"</p><p>- ECB might ease.WSJ's Tom Fairless: \"The eurozone's $13 trillion economy is faltering, buffeted by trade tensions and international uncertainties. Germany's mighty export machine is stalling and the political situation in Italy remains volatile. European Central Bank officials are preparing to step up with fresh stimulus, echoing\u00a0similar signals by the Federal Reserve\u00a0and other central banks. The question for investors is, when, and how, will the ECB act?</p><p> \"Financial markets are evenly split\u00a0over whether the ECB will move Thursday to support sluggish growth, by cutting its key interest rate for the first time since March 2016, or wait until its following policy meeting on Sept. 12.\"</p><p>- No recession looming, according to Google search trends. Bloomberg's Jeff Kearns: \"Google search terms that were leading indicators of the Great Recession aren't signaling that the current record U.S. expansion is poised to end any time soon. That's according to DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas, based on his reading of Google Trends data tracking queries for coupons, unemployment and television.</p><p> \"Coupon searches are a leading indicator that U.S. consumers will seek product and service discounts as economic uncertainty increases, and they precede the actual deferral of purchases that traditional indicators measure because that doesn't start to show in the data until unemployment is rising, Colas said in a\u00a0note\u00a0to clients Wednesday.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:\u00a0          </p><p>-\u00a0Europe is caught in the middle of the trade war: \"Europe's export engine is losing steam,\" the Wall Street Journal Paul Hannon and Nick Kostov report.</p><p>\"Today, Europe is emerging as a big loser from trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which are compounding a wider slowdown in global trade. Even though European companies might seem out of the line of fire, they are suffering from a lull in their own exports to China as that country's manufacturing base curbs investments. And their customers elsewhere are flashing caution lights on spending.\"</p><p>-\u00a0... And the trade war is also costing China: \"China's industrial sector has lost 5 million jobs in the last year, including 1.8 to 1.9 million jobs because of the trade war with the United States, a leading Chinese investment bank estimated on Wednesday,\" Frank Tang of\u00a0the South China Morning Post\u00a0reports.</p><p>\"The total job losses represent 3.4 per cent of total employment in the industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing and public utilities, and 0.7 per cent of total national employment, said China International Capital Corp (CICC) economists Liang Hong and Yi Huan.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Top U.S., China trade negotiators to meet in Shanghai next week: \" Top U.S. and Chinese negotiators will meet face-to-face next week for the first time since Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to revive talks to end their year-long trade war,\" Makini Brice, Susan Heavey and Chris Prentice of Reuters\u00a0report.</p><p>\"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for talks in Shanghai starting on July 30, the White House said in a statement on Wednesday.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Study says private equity is killing retail: \"More than 1.3 million Americans have lost their jobs in the past decade as a result of private equity ownership in retail, according to a report released Wednesday,\" my colleague Abha Bhattarai reports. \"That includes 600,000 retail workers, as well as 728,000 employees in related industries. Overall, the sector added more than 1 million jobs during that period.\u00a0</p><p> \"Women and people of color have been disproportionately affected by the layoffs as debt-ridden retailers closed thousands of stores, according to the report by six progressive nonprofit organizations and workers' advocacy groups, including Americans for Financial Reform and the Center for Popular Democracy.\"</p><p>             Speaking of retail, Mnuchin says Amazon \"destroyed\" the sector. And he backs the Justice Department'             s look into the company.\u00a0\"Mnuchin said Wednesday that he supported the Justice Department's efforts to look into Amazon\u00a0because the tech giant has 'destroyed the retail industry,'\" Bhattarai reports. \"Mnuchin made the comments one day after the Justice Department announced it was opening a wide-ranging antitrust review of 'market-leading online platforms,' an unprecedented inquiry that could heighten calls for Amazon, Facebook and Google to be broken up. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)\"</p><p>-\u00a0Zuckerberg could be under the microscope now:\u00a0 \"A wide-ranging federal investigation into Facebook for its privacy missteps concluded Wednesday with a settlement that threatens to saddle the tech giant's powerful chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, with sustained Washington scrutiny for the next two decades,\" my colleagues\u00a0\u00a0Tony Romm and Elizabeth Dwoskin report.\u00a0</p><p> \"In addition to fining Facebook $5 billion, the Federal Trade Commission, the nation's chief privacy watchdog, required that Zuckerberg every three months answer to the government for the decisions he makes about privacy and the company's future data-driven gambits - a rare form of oversight that could expose him to civil and criminal penalties if Facebook errs again in handling its users' personal information.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Dem committees won't say what will happen to Epstein donations: \"Three weeks after Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on child sex-trafficking charges, Democratic fundraising groups have remained silent on whether they will donate or give back contributions from the wealthy financier,\" CNBC's Brian Schwartz reports.</p><p>\"Epstein gave at least $80,000 combined to the DNC and the DSCC from the late 1990s through the early 2000s, according to Federal Election Commission records. Epstein's donations to the committees were given either directly or through Democratic joint fundraising operations, including one in part led by Hillary Clinton's U.S. Senate exploratory committee called New York Senate 2000.\"</p><p>- Big bank lobby eyes shakeup. Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt: \"A trade group representing many of the largest U.S. banks is weighing a major expansion of its membership that may include a number of Wall Street giants and global institutions like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. Several sources familiar with the matter told POLITICO that members of the Bank Policy Institute were considering the move, which could inflame tensions between the international megabanks and regional, U.S.-focused lenders over the direction of the association...</p><p> \"The addition of the investment banking powerhouses and other big institutions would bring with it a new source of dues and a broader industry perspective. But it could also put new strains on the group, with representatives of some regional lenders already skeptical about the extent to which the association's agenda is controlled by several of the world's largest, most complex banks.\"</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Upcoming:          </p><p>From The Post's Tom Toles:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-65972f5344a94caa944ed1bdc3b48f47</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN5-PD31-DXKP-J3R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2056\"/><timeReceived>11:26 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC6712 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>BAC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>BAC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>8648 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000436</classCode><className>CURRENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001959</classCode><className>PUBLIC FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001768</classCode><className>US DOLLAR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

The stock market keeps             setting records             . His 2017 tax cut is still delivering windfalls to the biggest banks, which posted record profits last year, as his regulators ease their federal oversight. And his             phase-one trade agreement             with China was packed with goodies for the financial services sector, though it fell short on addressing the administration's core complaints.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's how The Post's Heather Long summed up the high notes of his address:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From the New York Times's Annie Karni:\u00a0</p><p>             At home, though he campaigned \u00a0in 2016 as a Wall Street scourge, he is now pointing out what a boon his presidency has been for the industry. \"Mary Erdoes, JPMorgan Chase,\" Trump said last week at the East Room signing ceremony for the trade truce with Beijing. \"They just announced earnings, and they were incredible. ... Will you say 'thank you Mr. President,' at least? Huh? I made a lot of bankers look very good.\"          </p><p>             That event was packed with uber-rich financiers, several of whom will also be on hand in Davos this week. Besides Erdoes, the head of JPMorgan's asset and wealth management division, they included Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, who has served as an unofficial go-between for the Trump administration in Beijing; casino magnate and major GOP donor Sheldon Adelson; former American International Group chief Hank Greenberg, billionaire investor Nelson Peltz; Ken Griffin, the billionaire CEO of Citadel; Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga; Visa CEO Al Kelly; Moody's CEO Raymond McDaniel; and Alan MacDonald, a top executive at Citi.</p><p>Chief executives of a number of other Fortune 100 companies were also on hand - including those of Boeing, Honeywell, and UPS - though no labor leaders attended, as my colleague David Lynch noted over the weekend. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Lynch the China agreement represented \"another big giveaway to Wall Street and Big Pharma and prioritizes new protections for companies that move to China, creating even more incentives for outsourcing.\"          </p><p>Of seven chapters in the U. S-China trade deal, one is devoted to enumerating how Beijing will open access to its market to American financial services firms. \"The deal contains detailed provisions governing treatment of banks, credit-rating agencies, electronic payment providers like Visa and Mastercard, insurers, and securities firms,\" Lynch writes. \"While China has often discussed plans to loosen restrictions on foreign financial institutions, it has never before committed to specific short-term deadlines. 'So the banks are going to be doing great,' Trump said shortly before signing the agreement. By April 1 - little more than 10 weeks from now - Chinese officials must allow foreign companies to take majority stakes in fund management companies, insurers, futures traders and other securities firms.\"</p><p>             The benefits for workers are harder to identify. \"The fundamental question for the vast majority of Americans who are not looking to set up a corporate entity in China is whether this deal - or more broadly, the Trump administration's trade policy in general - helps them,\" Jared Bernstein, chief economist to former vice president Joe Biden, argues. \"For our manufacturers, who were supposed to be the beneficiaries of all this, the answer is a hard no, and this deal, which leaves most of the tariffs in\u00a0place, doesn't change that.\"</p><p>             Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)             agrees             the deal delivers Wall Street a win at the expense of the national interest. \"It's no secret that Wall Street hated [Trump's] aggressive trade tactics toward China. But its executives are very happy with the financial services section\" of the agreement, the erstwhile Trump ally wrote in a New York Times opinion piece over the weekend. \"This accord will result in American capital flowing to the government-owned companies that China props up to undermine our country. This is not a win.\"</p><p>             Meanwhile, the six biggest U.S. banks - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley - collectively saved $18 billion on their tax bills last year thanks to the Trump tax cuts, Bloomberg News's Yalman Onaran finds: \"The tax savings have spurred the banks to record profit. The six firms posted\u00a0$120 billion\u00a0in net income for 2019, inching past 2018's mark. They had never surpassed\u00a0$100 billion\u00a0before the tax cuts.\"</p><p>             The banks have even more Washington wind in their sales, as Trump's regulators continue their push to roll back post-crisis strictures on the industry. Randal Quarles, a Trump pick serving as the Federal Reserve's vice chairman for supervision, just outlined a lighter-touch approach to oversight. Among other goals, he discussed making annual bank stress tests easier to understand and giving the banks longer to review the results; and he pitched giving Congress a greater role in setting regulatory guidance for the industry.</p><p>\"Virtually all of the proposed changes would weaken the Fed's supervision of the country's banks and come straight off the wish list of Wall Street's biggest banks,\" Better Markets chief Dennis Kelleher said in a statement.</p><p>You are reading              The Finance 202          , our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.</p><p>- Panic as Chinese mystery virus spreads. The Post's Anna Fifield, reporting from Beijing: \"Chinese health authorities sought to impose a quasi-quarantine Tuesday around Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, as they stepped up efforts to stop the spread of a mystery virus that has now claimed six lives.</p><p> \"With confirmation that the pneumonialike coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person, and with hundreds of millions of Chinese packing onto public transport to make their annual pilgrimages home for the Lunar New Year, a new sense of panic has erupted here...\u00a0</p><p> \"The Geneva-based World Health Organization said it would call an emergency meeting Wednesday to decide whether to designate the outbreak as an international public health emergency. Australia and the Philippines are the latest countries with suspected cases of infection.\"</p><p>             The outbreak is sending fear through global markets.Bloomberg News: \"A deadly virus emanating from China helped bring this year's global risk rally to a halt on Tuesday, hammering Asian equities and helping drag both European stocks and U.S. futures lower.\u00a0</p><p> \"Traders closing out positions in the run-up to Lunar New Year holidays may have accelerated moves in Asia, where Hong Kong equities slumped 2.8% and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index dropped more than 1%. Luxury stocks in Europe, many heavily exposed to the Chinese market, slid on concern the outbreak will disrupt travel and spending in the key holiday period.\"</p><p>- IMF sees modest global rebound. WSJ's Josh Zumbrun: \"Global gross domestic product will expand by 3.3% in 2020, up from 2.9% in 2019, the International Monetary Fund predicted in a quarterly update to its World Economic Outlook, released Monday in Davos, Switzerland. The improved outlook is driven by a combination of aggressive monetary policy easing in 2019 and detente in America's nearly two-year trade war with China.\"</p><p>             But foreign investment is down as globalization slows, WSJ's Paul Hannon writes: \"New overseas investment by businesses around the world fell for the fourth-straight year in 2019 to its lowest level in almost a decade, pointing to a slowdown in globalization as the world-wide economy cooled. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said foreign direct investment, or FDI, last year fell to $1.39 trillion from $1.41 trillion. The 1% drop puts global FDI at its lowest level since 2010...\u00a0</p><p> \"Many economists say globalization provided a triple boost to global economic growth: locating production where labor is cheapest; supercharging competition; and disseminating new technologies and know-how across the world. But globalization's critics say the benefits of the process haven't been shared equally, with low-skilled workers in developed economies seeing their incomes stagnate.\"</p><p>             TRADE FLY-AROUND:          </p><p>- U.S.-France pause tech/tariff fight: \"France and the U.S. have struck a truce on the divisive issue of taxing digital giants like Google parent\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0Inc.,\u00a0averting a trade war on the matter - at least for now,\" the Wall Street Journal's Bojan Pancevski and Sam Schechner report.</p><p>\"The detente comes after the French President Emmanuel Macron reached out by phone to [Trump] on Sunday seeking a way to end the threat of tariffs while they work out a broader accord on digital taxation, according to U.S. and French officials. As part of the truce, Macron agreed to postpone until the end of 2020 a tax that France levied on big tech companies last year, one U.S. official said. In return, the U.S. will postpone\u00a0retaliatory tariffs\u00a0this year, the official said. The U.S. official said Macron had buckled under pressure from Trump.\"</p><p>- Where the U.S. and China are headed on tech:\u00a0\"In terms of technology, the world had been unifying for years. Now it is reverting back to the likes of the VHS-versus-Betamax era, with much bigger consequences,\" the WSJ's Stu Woo and Asa Fitch report.</p><p>\"Imagine two countries with completely different sets of hardware and software for the internet, electronic devices, telecommunications, and even social media and dating apps. That is the direction the U.S. and China are headed in - a world where the two global powers have mutually exclusive technology systems. The wedge being driven between the two countries alarms tech's biggest names, with the likes of Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma calling it counterproductive for both sides. While this month's signing of a phase-one trade deal between the U.S. and China may have eased broad, short-term economic concerns, deeply held suspicions in both countries suggest the technology gap\u00a0will only widen\u00a0in the coming decade.\"</p><p>             That could leave U.S. tech firms worse off in the long run, the NYT's Ana Swanson and Cecilia Kang             write             .\u00a0          </p><p>- Huawei CFO blasts charges: \"Huawei Technologies Co.\u00a0Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou shouldn't be dispatched to the U.S. because her alleged crimes don't meet Canada's legal tests for extradition, her defense lawyers said at the opening of hearings,\" News's Natalie Obiko Pearson reports.</p><p>\"At issue in a legal battle that has\u00a0severely strained\u00a0Canada-China relations is whether her extradition request meets the crucial test of double criminality: Would her alleged crime have also been a crime in Canada? If the judge rules it doesn't meet that standard, she could be discharged, according to Canada's\u00a0extradition rules ... The hearings that began Monday offer Meng's first opportunity to avoid handover to the U.S., which accuses her of fraud, saying she lied to\u00a0HSBC Holdings Plc\u00a0and tricked it into transactions that violated U.S. sanctions on Iran.\"</p><p>             IMPEACHMENT MINUTE: A speed read on the latest from the congressional impeachment process.</p><p> \"White House calls for Trump acquittal in 'rigged' impeachment as Senate prepares for swift trial.\" By The Post's Seung Min Kim and Karoun Demirjian\u00a0</p><p> \"Trump's lawyers, Senate GOP allies work privately to ensure Bolton does not testify publicly. \" By The Post's Robert Costa and Rachael Bade\u00a0</p><p> \"Lawyer for Lev Parnas says Barr has a conflict of interest and should recuse himself from criminal case. \" By The Post's Shayna Jacobs\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0Boeing looking for $10 billion loan: \"Boeing\u00a0is in talks with banks to secure a loan of $10 billion or more, according to people familiar with the matter, as the company faces rising costs stemming from two fatal 737 Max crashes,\" CNBC's Leslie Josephs reports.</p><p>\"The company has secured at least $6 billion from banks so far, the people said, and is talking to other lenders for more contributions. The total amount could rise if there is additional demand from banks, one person familiar with the matter said. Liquidity isn't an immediate concern, analysts have said, but the new debt shows Boeing is shoring up its finances amid the\u00a0cash-sapping fallout\u00a0of the two crashes\u00a0...\"</p><p>-\u00a0Investors clash over Telsa's valuation:\u00a0Tesla \"shares have soared 22% in just the first few weeks of 2020 alone, catapulting the company's market capitalization to more than $90 billion in a rally that had made it the most valuable U.S. auto maker,\" the WSJ's Gunjan Banerji and Julia-Ambra Verlaine report.</p><p>\"The leap has turbocharged a long-running war over the proper value of Tesla stock. This has split investors large and small into warring camps - both sides digging in with quasi-religious fervor. Trading volumes have skyrocketed, with shares and options changing hands at a level not seen in at least five years. For many investors, Tesla marks a test case for the broader stock-market rally that has sent shares to records and driven the Dow Jones Industrial Average toward 30000 in recent sessions. Fears of recession have abated, eased by a series of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and a trade truce between the U.S. and China.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Cook says global tax overhaul needed: \"Everyone knows that the global corporate tax system needs to be overhauled, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said ... backing changes to global rules that are currently under consideration,\" Reuters's Padraic Halpin reports.</p><p>\"The reforms being examined center around the booking of profits by multinational firms in low-tax countries such as Ireland where they have bases - and where Cook was speaking on - ... rather than where most of their customers are. 'I think logically everybody knows it needs to be rehauled, I would certainly be the last person to say that the current system or the past system was the perfect system. I'm hopeful and optimistic that they (the OECD) will find something,' Cook said.\"</p><p>-\u00a0Combined 2020 Democrats are outraising Trump:\u00a0\"The president has blown past individual Democratic presidential campaigns in fundraising for his 2020 reelection bid. But the crowded primary field together more than tripled his 2019 cash haul, according to a CNBC analysis of Federal Election Commission filings and campaign statements,\" CNBC's Jacob Pramuk reports.</p><p>\"No incumbent president this century has been so thoroughly outraised by a field of challengers in the year before a reelection contest. The main Republican challengers to President Barack Obama in 2012 barely took in more than the incumbent in 2011. Meanwhile, President George W.
