It required broadcasters \"to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance.\" ...<br/>Presidential administrations from Kennedy to Nixon used the Fairness Doctrine to maximum effect. The administration could use the doctrine to demand equal air time any time one of the president's policies was criticized. This not only allowed the president nearly endless opportunities to express his viewpoint, but took time away from his opposition. Eventually, wary of the burdensome government demands, many stations simply stopped airing political commentary altogether.</p><p><br/>As one member of the Johnson administration put it: \"Our massive strategy was to use the Fairness Doctrine to challenge and harass right-wing broadcasters and hope that the challenges would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited and decide it was too expensive to continue.\" ...<br/>Today, many on the right seem to want a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet. Creating one would demean one of Reagan's great achievements and give government yet another tool to crack down on its critics.<br/>While President Trump may not like CNN coverage or Google search results of his name, granting the government the power to control search results is asking for a whole host of unintended consequences...<br/>The freedom and choice the Internet provides have allowed for an explosion of different opinions and content available to people around the world. Empowering the government to provide \"balance\" is not only impractical, but a mistake that could massively backfire - likely against the very people pushing for it.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ICYMI: IFS Analyzes the Free Speech Record of Judge Kavanaugh</emphasis><br/>The Free Speech Record of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Part I<br/>By IFS Staff<br/>Judge Kavanaugh has seen his fair share of campaign finance and political speech cases. That's for good reason. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where he has served since 2006, has jurisdiction over most challenges to federal campaign finance laws and regulations. We analyze the following such cases in this post.<br/>- Emily's List v. Federal Election Comm'n, 581 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2009)<br/>- SpeechNow.org v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 599 F.3d 686 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (en banc)<br/>- Independence Institute v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 816 F.3d 113 (D.C. Cir. 2016)<br/>- Pursuing America's Greatness v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 831 F.3d 500 (D.C. Cir. 2016)<br/>-Wagner v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 793 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (en banc)<br/>Judge Kavanaugh ruled in favor of free speech in four of these cases. The exception was Wagner, where he joined an 11-0 opinion siding with the Federal Election Commission. His opinion in Emily's List is particularly impressive. Foreshadowing later rulings in Citizens United and SpeechNow, Judge Kavanaugh clearly articulated a First Amendment right for associations to spend money in support of candidates. The opinion demonstrates an ability to anticipate trends in First Amendment jurisprudence before they fully take hold.<br/>In the other three cases, Judge Kavanauagh applied careful scrutiny to government regulations that impeded free political speech. He authored the opinion in Independence Institute, which ordered that a special three-judge district court review the Institute's challenge to McCain-Feingold's donor disclosure requirements, and joined rulings striking down FEC regulations in SpeechNow and Pursuing America's Greatness.<br/>Part II: More on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Campaign Finance Opinions<br/>By IFS Staff<br/>This post explores three First Amendment opinions written or joined by Judge Kavanaugh. In these decisions, he sided with the government and declined to approve First Amendment challenges, although his opinions nevertheless showed some concern for the First Amendment rights raised, albeit in dicta. Whether he would translate those words into action on the Supreme Court is an open question.<br/>In the first of these cases, Holmes v. Federal Election Commission, Judge Kavanaugh joined a unanimous, en banc D.C. Circuit when it missed the opportunity to require that individual provisions of a law meet heightened scrutiny when they burden an individual's rights, even when the law as a whole has previously survived a facial challenge.<br/>In the second case, Republican National Committee v. Federal Election Commission, the plaintiffs presented a more straightforward challenge to prior precedent, McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, in light of recent limits the Supreme Court had placed on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Writing for a special three-judge district court, Judge Kavanaugh upheld BCRA's contribution limits, holding that it was up to the Supreme Court to clarify or refine the McConnell decision.<br/>Finally, in Bluman v. Federal Election Commission, again writing for a special three-judge district court, Judge Kavanaugh upheld BCRA's prohibition on political contributions by foreign nationals. The court held that foreign nationals do not have a constitutional right to spend any money advocating for or against candidates in American elections, and that the government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign influence over the political process. Treading in an area of fundamental liberties, however, Judge Kavanaugh warned the government that the court's analysis did not address the rights of lawful permanent residents or the ability of foreign nationals to speak about American politics. Importantly, he also interpreted the law narrowly so as to apply only to express advocacy and electioneering communications.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Part III: Judge Brett Kavanaugh Joins Pro-Speech Opinion Upholding Rights of Protesters<br/>By IFS Staff<br/>This post explores two opinions Judge Kavanaugh wrote or joined addressing the rights of protesters under the First Amendment. In these decisions, Judge Kavanaugh demonstrated a solicitude for First Amendment speech freedoms, but one limited to activities that are peaceful and non-destructive.<br/>Boardley v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior, 615 F.3d 508 (D.C. Cir. 2010)<br/>In Boardley, Judge Kavanaugh joined an opinion holding that National Park Service rules requiring permits, in addition to existing restrictions limiting speech to free speech areas, were overbroad and unconstitutional...<br/>Mahoney v. Doe, 642 F.3d 1112 (D.C. Cir. 2011)<br/>Here, the D.C. Circuit held that a law against the defacement of public property did not violate the First Amendment rights of anti-abortion protestors who wished to chalk the street in front of the White House.<br/>Judge Kavanaugh wrote a short concurring opinion to emphasize that \"[n]o one has a First Amendment right to deface government property.\" Id. at 1122. The law here, according to Judge Kavanaugh, was \"a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction for purposes of First Amendment doctrine\" because it was content and viewpoint neutral. Id.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Part IV: Judge Brett Kavanaugh Authors Pro-Speech Dissents in Two Communications Act Cases<br/>By IFS Staff<br/>Previous posts have focused on cases squarely raising claims related to political free speech and press rights. But Judge Kavanaugh has shown a willingness to protect speech rights in other contexts, including while interpreting the expansive Communications Act of 1934.<br/>In contrast to campaign finance law, which sharply limits the Federal Election Commission's discretion, the Communications Act and its amendments give the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") wide power to regulate wire and radio systems to promote equality and efficiency in communications. One hotly contested issue is whether the FCC may regulate Internet companies as \"common carrier\" utilities (like landline telephones) under the Communications Act-a debate commonly referred to as \"Net Neutrality.\"<br/>In a pair of dissents, Judge Kavanaugh staked out the importance of protecting the freedom of speech, even for corporations...<br/>The Institute agrees that the First Amendment is designed to keep the hands of the government out of the editorial decisions of speakers. That includes those who speak on the Internet. Though he wrote in dissent, Judge Kavanaugh's view of the First Amendment as a shield from bureaucratic meddling is important to consider. The Internet's success comes from the freedom it enjoyed in allowing those with modest means a voice to reach many.<br/>Judge Kavanaugh appears to see the importance of the freedom of speech both in what one says and what one chooses not to say. Likewise for freedom of association. Both views-the right to speak and the right to not be compelled to speak-are at the heart of the First Amendment.\u00a0<br/>Setting the Record Straight: A Response to CLC's Attacks on Judge Kavanaugh<br/>By Bradley A. Smith<br/>[T]he Institute for Free Speech conducted a thorough review of the First Amendment records of each of the potential nominees...<br/>We noted a number of decisions in which we disagree with Judge Kavanaugh. These included Holmes v. Federal Election Commission, a case in which we represented the plaintiffs, but Judge Kavanaugh joined an opinion by Obama appointee Sri Srinivasan upholding an FEC regulation that had the practical effect of giving many incumbents higher contribution limits than their challengers; and Wagner v. Federal Election Commission, in which Judge Kavanaugh joined a majority in voting to uphold a ban on political contributions by individuals who held government contracts, and where we filed an amicus brief on the losing side.<br/>Nevertheless, we concluded - as did most others specifically looking at Judge Kavanaugh's record in First Amendment cases, that he generally gave the First Amendment a robust interpretation protective of individual rights, and we offered praise for his nomination...<br/>[I]t is not surprising that if the Institute for Free Speech and other First Amendment advocates like the Kavanaugh nomination, CLC does not.<br/>What is unfortunate is that CLC has chosen to make the case for its opposition to Kavanaugh through a report that alternately misleads, misrepresents, cherry-picks data, and resorts to alarmism in place of serious analysis. Titled \"Kavanaugh Has an Unsettling Record on Democracy,\" and released as a joint effort with the left-wing group Demos, the report does no credit to CLC, and perhaps indicates the general lack of any serious basis for attacking the Kavanaugh nomination. In this review, I will go through the CLC charges as they are presented in the report.<br/>Kavanaugh Joins Opinion that Helps Ensure FEC Enforcement Actions Remain Free of Bias<br/>By IFS Staff<br/>Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Federal Election Comm'n, Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit, 2018 ...<br/>The FEC regulates in a very sensitive area - speech about government and election campaigns. Its jurisdiction is wrought with thorny First Amendment issues and is vulnerable to partisan complaints lacking merit or where investigations would not represent an efficient use of agency resources. Congress designed the enforcement process to prevent partisans from weaponizing the agency's enforcement powers and avoid imposing undue burdens on protected speech. In bringing this case, CREW sought to privatize one aspect of the FEC's enforcement function-dismissed complaints based on prosecutorial discretion in 3-3 ties.<br/>The importance of this case lies with the finality of commission decisions. It helps constrain private enforcement, which is likely to have ideological or partisan motivations. This case and the resulting precedent shuts down that possibility in this context. Judges Randolph and Kavanaugh correctly ruled courts must leave enforcement decisions to the Commission where expertise and statutory balance can prioritize resources and help ensure that enforcement is viewpoint neutral.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Disclosure Laws Will Hurt Minority Views<br/>By Scott Blackburn<br/>California Democratic Party Chairman Eric Bauman is calling for a boycott of In-N-Out burger because, horror of horrors, the company donates to Republicans...<br/>We regularly talk about how disclosure laws harm First Amendment activity by subjecting individuals, companies, and advocacy groups to political attacks, often unwarranted as is the case here.<br/>But what this example brings into stark contrast is that these kinds of harms aren't random. They're instigated by people in power that find easy scapegoats in those who have minority opinions...<br/>Of course, it should go without saying that just as the First Amendment protects In-N-Out's right to associate with one (or both) political parties, it is California Democrats' right to call for a boycott of the company for its associations. And any laws that attempt to hamper the right to boycott would draw equal (if not greater) ire from organizations like ours who fight to defend the First Amendment.<br/>But these 'safe' attacks on minority opinions or associations do tremendous harm to the fabric of free speech across the country. Using disclosure data to economically harm businesses in California is no different than using anti-protest bills to silence environmental activists in Oklahoma. Democratic leaders calling for boycotts of businesses that support Republicans with their political donations is no different than Republican leaders calling for progressive college professors to be fired for their anti-Trump rhetoric.<br/>People in power find an easy target and bully them into silence. Why? Not so much because they are afraid of their message, but because the target's opinion is so unpopular, they'll score some cheap political points with their team just for acting like a self-righteous bully.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supreme Court</emphasis><br/>CNN:\u00a0Documents: Kavanaugh saw 'some constitutional problems' in campaign contribution limits<br/>By\u00a0Ariane de Vogue<br/>Newly released documents reveal that when he was serving in the White House under President George W. Bush, Brett Kavanaugh suggested that he thought candidate contribution limits have \"some constitutional problems.\" ...<br/>Kavanaugh's comments will raise questions during his confirmation hearings from Democrats who support campaign finance regulation...<br/>\"Judge Kavanaugh's views on campaign finance are already pretty well-known,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"But these emails suggest that he'd go farther in striking down these regulations than the court has to date. It's hard to imagine this not becoming a point of some contention at next week's confirmation hearing.\"<br/>The documents, released Friday night before a three-day weekend, depict an email exchange between Kavanaugh and Helgard Walker, who also worked in the Bush White House.<br/>\"I have heard very few people say that the limits on contributions to candidates are unconstitutional, although I for one tend to think those limits have some constitutional problems,\" Kavanaugh wrote in a March 6, 2002, email...<br/>The documents had already been released to the Senate Judiciary Committee on a \"Committee Confidential\" basis. But committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, sent a letter to his colleagues last week telling them he would consider requests from members identifying confidential documents they wish to use during the hearings as long as the requests were \"reasonable.\"<br/>The documents in question were requested by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, according to a release from the Judiciary Committee. <br/>Slate:\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh May Soon Unshackle All Rich Political Donors<br/>By Richard L. Hasen<br/>Recently released documents from the time that Kavanaugh was advising Bush on McCain-Feingold show a person seriously skeptical of campaign finance laws' constitutionality. Kavanaugh expressed deep misgivings about laws that let outside groups spend unlimited sums in elections while limiting how much candidates and parties can raise to respond to such ads. He told another adviser that he saw \"serious\" First Amendment problems with capping what people can contribute to candidates, adding that \"it is possible my 1A views are even purer than yours.\" He also noted that while \"very few people\" thought contribution limits to candidates are unconstitutional, \"I for one tend to think those limits have constitutional problems.\" ...<br/>Right now pending before the court is a cert petition asking the Supreme Court to review Montana's campaign contribution limits. The issue in the 9th Circuit case of Lair v. Motl may seem a bit esoteric; it concerns how much evidence of corruption a state must produce to support a campaign contribution limit. But make no mistake: The Lair case, brought by Citizens United brainchild Jim Bopp, builds upon Chief Justice Roberts' McCutcheon decision to argue for a standard that would lead courts to strike down virtually all contribution limits.<br/>The court is also considering petition from opponents of city-level campaign contribution limits in Austin, Texas. Although a 5th Circuit panel upheld Austin's limits in Zimmerman v. City of Austin, newly confirmed Judge Jim Ho wrote a strong dissent from the entire 5th Circuit's decision not to rehear the case...<br/>Neither Lair nor Zimmerman directly call the federal $2,700 campaign finance limit into question, but either or both cases could be the vehicle to create a precedent that would compel federal courts to strike down the $2,700 limit.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>NBC News:\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden: If Facebook, Google and Twitter want to avoid new regulation, they need to police their users better<br/>By\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden<br/>For the purposes of the current debate, I propose two basic principles: First, that the government has no business regulating content online and, second, that the big tech companies should get serious about cleaning up the slime that is still too common on their platforms - not out of fear of government regulation, but because it's both the right and the decent thing to do, morally and for their bottom line...<br/>Anyone is free to run 4chan or unmoderated message boards or start their own \"conservative Facebook\" - and they already have; the law protects the right of those sites to exist. But it's ridiculous to say that the government should force Facebook and Twitter to host neo-Nazi leaders or people who harass the parents of dead children.<br/>When I made this argument last week, it prompted accusations from the far-right that I was threatening to censor Twitter, or repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which is the law that provides the legal foundations for social media. (From Wikipedia to Youtube to Instagram, these sites cannot exist without 230 protection.)<br/>But in fact, I co-wrote Section 230 and have defended it for years...<br/>So that is why I'm sounding an alarm for those tech CEOs who have been asleep at the wheel: They risk even more attacks, the loss of goodwill upon which they've relied and calls for regulation, if they don't get serious about decency...<br/>An alternative idea to gutting Section 230, floated by the Trump administration, would be to somehow force platforms to host or promote conservative content to correct alleged liberal bias...<br/>And, more to the point, it's plainly unconstitutional for government to regulate speech and content to that extent outside the very narrow world of publicly-owned broadcast airwaves.<br/>Bloomberg BNA:\u00a0Insight: The Communications Decency Act Safe Harbor: Pendulum Swings In 2018<br/>By\u00a0Christopher A. Cole and Gabriel M. Ramsey<br/>The Communication Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), 47 USC Section 230, provides a safe harbor to internet service providers and platforms, exempting them from liability based on the speech and content of their users. The intent of the safe harbor was to protect service providers who assumed an editorial role with regard to customer speech or content, and who would have otherwise become publishers, and legally responsible for libel and other torts committed by customers. Under Section 230, courts are precluded from \"entertaining claims that would place a computer service provider in a publisher's role.\" Zeran v. America Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir. 1997) ...<br/>One view of Section 230 is that it promotes an open internet, and protects the rights of internet service providers from the likely immense and subjective task of responding to demands to alter display of users' unfettered ideas and opinions. The safe harbor has always been a double-edged sword. For platforms, the task of monitoring user content and responding to demands to remove defamatory or otherwise unlawful third-party content could easily become so onerous as to be infeasible. On the other hand, for parties aggrieved by unlawful postings, it can be immensely difficult to cause an unresponsive platform to remove even obviously wrongful-even demonstrably illegal-content or speech.<br/>Over the course of 20 years, the law regarding CDA immunity became relatively settled. However, 2018 has brought some of the most notable developments in decades. A number of controversial rulings and developments, cutting several ways, have disrupted the legal landscape and three key examples are discussed below. Internet platforms claiming immunity and aggrieved parties asserting platform liability will have to consider this recent evolution.<br/>Fox News:\u00a0Hey, Google, Facebook, Twitter - Trump's got a point. You need to do a better job of self-regulating<br/>By Jim Hanson<br/>Hopefully, the social media companies will heed the president's warning, but if not, what can he do?<br/>In this election season, the president could direct the Federal Election Commission to investigate the practices of the social media companies. The commission could examine whether suppressing conservative ideas - including in some cases the accounts of Republican candidates - constitutes an in-kind contribution to the Democratic Party and its candidates.<br/>Security Studies Group submitted a complaint to the Federal Election Commission asking for this type of investigation into Twitter with a reference to the Fact Sheet on Viewpoint Discrimination we compiled.<br/>Another avenue is to have the Federal Communications Commission look at the immunity granted to the social media companies as Internet service providers under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act...<br/>Google, Facebook and Twitter are private companies. They have the right to have policies to promote liberal ideas and ban conservative ones from their platforms. But as publicly traded companies, they have a responsibility to speak honestly about their business practices. They can't have their CEOs saying they do not discriminate if it can be shown they do.<br/>President Trump could ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to examine whether the three companies are misleading their shareholders and the public.<br/>There is also a question of whether the success of the social media companies has made them indispensable for businesses, organizations and many individuals. If so, there is the possibility that they could be declared to be public utilities and regulated that way to prevent discrimination.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Washington Examiner:\u00a0Report: Top FEC Dem, staff behind anti-Trump jihad, fairness questioned<br/>By\u00a0Paul Bedard<br/>The longest-serving Democratic member of the Federal Election Commission, expected to take over as chair in four months, and her top staffer are behind an anti-Trump and anti-GOP crusade, according to a new report from a critic.<br/>In a series of blog posts, the Republican National Lawyers Association questioned the fairness of Commissioner Ellen Weintraub and her counsel, Tom Moore...<br/>\"All this political jousting indicates one thing: that Commissioner Weintraub started off with a clear bias against Donald Trump, his lawyer, and his administration,\" said one of the postings from RNLA Executive Director Michael Thielen.<br/>Weintraub, he noted, has been harshly critical of Trump and his staff, including outgoing Chief Counsel Don McGahn, a former FEC commissioner...<br/>In his first post, Thielen said that Weintraub's anti-Trump bias is \"pale by comparison\" to the criticism leveled by former FBI official Peter Strozk. He cited her writings and tweets as evidence.<br/>In a second, the Republican Lawyer blog turned to her counsel, Moore, giving him credit for the Twitter account \"alt_FEC,\" one of several \"alt\" sites that were created inside federal agencies to challenge the Republican administration after Trump's election. Alt_FEC describes itself as \"The unofficial #Resistance team of the U.S. Federal Election Commission.\"<br/>Hill reporter Rudy Takala identified Moore as one behind the alt_FEC account, said the blog.<br/>That account has ripped Fox News, even suggesting that cable companies cancel carrying the channel...<br/>Thielen asked in his second post, \"How can Commissioner Weintraub's office be viewed as fair, neutral, impartial when such nasty ad hominem attacks at President Trump are being published by her personal staff? It simply cannot.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump Administration</emphasis><br/>Quartz:\u00a0How White House lawyer Don McGahn helped break the US election system<br/>By Heather Timmons<br/>Before McGahn joined the Trump White House in January 2017-after serving as Trump's campaign lawyer-he was appointed by George W. Bush to the Federal Election Commission from 2008 to 2013. While there, critics say McGahn single-handedly presided over the destruction of one of the two US agencies responsible for insuring that the US's elections remain truly democratic...<br/>In his 21 months with the Trump White House, McGahn has had a different kind of impact, spearheading an unprecedented push-again with McConnell's blessing-to fast-track conservative judges on to the bench...<br/>\"The dozens of federal judges he selected will help corporations and rich people continue to buy elected officials for many years to come,\" [Adav] Noti predicts.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Harsh new anti-protest laws restrict freedom of speech, advocates say<br/>By\u00a0Nicholas Kusnetz<br/>Only days after McCray and the coalition announced their plans to resist the Diamond Pipeline construction, an Oklahoma state lawmaker introduced a bill to stiffen penalties for interfering with pipeline projects and other \"critical infrastructure.\" The law, which the governor signed, imposed punishments of up to 10 years in prison and $100,000 in fines - and up to $1 million for any organization \"found to be a conspirator.\" ...<br/>Dozens of bills and executive orders that aim to restrict high-profile protests have been introduced in at least 31 states and the federal government since November 2016. Fifteen have been enacted, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, including the critical-infrastructure pipeline bill signed in Oklahoma and similar bills in Louisiana and Iowa...<br/>The pipeline bills may get their first test soon in Louisiana, where three activists were arrested this month on felony charges stemming from one of the new laws...<br/>If the district attorney brings charges, the activists will challenge the law itself, said William Quigley, a professor at Loyola University College of Law in New Orleans who is representing the three people pro bono...<br/>Advocacy groups fear the legislation uses a handful of dangerous incidents as a pretext to intimidate mainstream advocates. The American Civil Liberties Union in Oklahoma is considering legal challenges, but said it may have to wait until a district attorney tries to use the new law.<br/>\"By equating those kinds of things together, essentially political speech on one end and on the other end outright terrorism,\" said Brady Henderson, legal director for the Oklahoma chapter of the ACLU, \"the [Oklahoma] bill is a pretty gross instrument.\"\u00a0<br/>Associated Press:\u00a0Group fights 'dark money' influence in Georgia politics<br/>By Ben Nadler<br/>The new group aims to monitor spending by outside groups in November's general election and draft proposed legislation for next year's state legislative session to strengthen Georgia's campaign finance laws.<br/>The coalition links several well-known conservative groups with some liberal-leaning and nonpartisan watchdog groups.<br/>Leaders include Debbie Dooley of the Atlanta Tea Party; Republican state Sen. Josh McKoon; Kay Godwin of Georgia Conservatives in Action; Sara Henderson of Common Cause Georgia; and William Perry of Georgia Ethics Watchdogs.<br/>The group calls itself the Georgia Coalition for Transparency and Ethics, Perry said in a statement.<br/>Critics use the term \"dark money\" to describe funds spent to influence elections by groups including nonprofit organizations that are not required by federal law to disclose their donors...<br/>The group wants to hear from voters who receive \"questionable mail pieces or who hear or see commercials or other advertisements by non-candidate committees or other organizations.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-34739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1SM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 4, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Mangan (U.S. Supreme Court)<br/>In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), this Court explained the standard for reviewing restrictions on contributions to candidates and political parties. Such limits could only \"be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.\" 424 U.S. at 25. The Court applied this \"exacting\" review, 454 U.S. at 294, over the ensuing decades, in cases such as Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. City of Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 294 (1981).</p><p><br/>In 2006, however, the Court imposed a new gloss on Buckley, creating a two-step, multi-factor test for determining whether a given contribution limit was too low. Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230 (2006). Three justices approved this test, which was contained in the narrowest-and thus controlling-opinion. Unfortunately, despite professing a certain technocratic exactitude, the Randall plurality's test cannot \"be reduced to a workable inquiry,\" Randall, 548 U.S. at 268 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment), and provides little useful guidance to the lower courts that are obliged to apply it.<br/>Accordingly, this Court ought to grant the writ and formally supersede the Randall plurality's opinion. See Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 558 U.S. 310, 372-393 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring). Furthermore, the Court should take the opportunity to clarify that Buckley mandates the application of \"exacting scrutiny\" to contribution limits. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366-367.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supreme Court</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court Hearing Has Testy Start<br/>By\u00a0Jess Bravin and Byron Tau<br/>Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's weeklong confirmation hearings began raucously Tuesday, as Democrats sought to bring the proceedings to a halt and protesters shouting from the rear were removed by police, leading to 70 arrests.<br/>Republicans, holding a one-vote majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, brushed aside complaints about access to Judge Kavanaugh's records as an aide to former President George W. Bush and insinuations that his appointment could abet President Trump's grip on power.<br/>Judge Kavanaugh, who spoke at day's end, made no reference to the seven hours of partisan debate. He touted his judicial impartiality at a session in which Democrats painted him as a servant of social conservatives and business interests...<br/>Supreme Court confirmation battles have become hard-hitting affairs, but even in that context Tuesday's session was unusual. \"This is something I've never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations,\" Mr. Grassley said as he struggled to maintain order.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>ACLU:\u00a0Is the Government Planning to Surveil Keystone XL Protesters?<br/>By\u00a0Jacob J. Hutt<br/>On Tuesday, we sued the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and several other federal agencies to find out the government's plans for cooperating with state law enforcement actors and private security contractors around anticipated Keystone XL protests. From these records, we hope to determine what plans the government has for thwarting, surveilling, and otherwise engaging with indigenous and environmental activists who oppose the construction of another oil pipeline. We also hope to determine whether and how the federal government is targeting indigenous communities to preempt political protest...<br/>Evidence that the federal government plans to address Keystone XL protests with counterterrorism tactics, coupled with the recent memory of excessive uses of force and surveillance at the Standing Rock protests, raise immense concerns about the safety of indigenous and environmental protesters who seek to exercise their First Amendment rights. Indigenous communities, in particular, have been historically over-policed and subject to unwanted governmental surveillance, with the surveillance of the Dakota Access Pipeline Spirit Camp one of many examples.<br/>The First Amendment protects political speech from the threat of undue government scrutiny, and the extent of that scrutiny, in this case, is unknown. If the government is planning to prevent or monitor indigenous and environmental protests, the activists involved have a right to know about it.<br/>MapLight:\u00a0Why Michael Cohen's Campaign Law Violations Are Crimes<br/>By Ann M. Ravel<br/>The contribution made by Cohen to one of the women is a violation of the law since it is in excess of the total limitation of $5,400 for both the primary and general election, and was purposely unreported. This payment to Stormy Daniels is considered to be an unreported \"in kind\" excess campaign contribution. Cohen also admitted that he caused American Media Inc. to make a $150,000 payment to another woman to silence her from speaking out about her alleged affair with Donald Trump. These contributions are prohibited by law as they are unlawful corporate contributions. According to the Cohen plea, both these acts were done knowingly and willfully. Consequently, they are charged as felonies.<br/>Cohen also said in open court that he committed these crimes \"at the direction\" of Donald Trump. Trump's reimbursement of Cohen for these contributions may potentially also be a crime, as it is illegal to contribute \"in the name of another,\" which is sometimes referred to as money laundering.<br/>It is legally significant that Cohen stated that these arrangements were done for the purpose of influencing the election. It is not illegal to make payments to keep someone quiet. But if those payments are for the purpose of influencing an election, then they become a campaign contribution...\u00a0<br/>There are still many facts that are unknown - for example, the true source of the money that was given to Stormy Daniels. Was it in fact paid through the Trump Organization, or did other sources anonymously provide that money to the organization or to Trump to provide to Cohen? Will there be more evidence that indicates that the president was aware of the intent to utilize the money provided to the women for the purpose of influencing the election?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Facebook's Sandberg and Twitter's Dorsey to Face Questions on Capitol Hill About Russian Meddling, Bias<br/>By\u00a0Deepa Seetharaman, Dustin Volz and John D. McKinnon<br/>On Wednesday morning, Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey will appear in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee to defend their platforms' handling of manipulation by foreign actors. Later in the day, the House Commerce Committee will question Mr. Dorsey, whose platform has been a focus of many Republicans' ire, about alleged anticonservative bias.<br/>\"We were too slow to spot this and too slow to act,\" Ms. Sandberg said in prepared testimony reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \"We're getting better at finding and combating our adversaries from financially motivated troll farms to sophisticated military intelligence operations.\"<br/>\"We now possess a deeper understanding of both the scope and tactics used by malicious actors to manipulate our platform and sow division across Twitter more broadly,\" Mr. Dorsey said in separate prepared testimony.<br/>Kent Walker, senior vice president for global affairs at Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit, planned to join the Senate hearing as well. But last month, Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), who heads the Senate Intel Committee, said he rejected the offer, insisting that Alphabet's CEO, Larry Page, appear. Mr. Page isn't expected to attend the hearing and Mr. Walker has been briefing lawmakers in Washington this week instead...<br/>On Wednesday, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the panel, plans to solicit feedback on a policy white paper he released earlier this summer articulating several possible routes Congress could take to regulate large internet companies, an aide to the lawmaker said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg: Protecting democracy is an arms race. Here's how Facebook can help.<br/>By\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg<br/>[W]ith advances in artificial intelligence, we now block millions of fake accounts every day as they are being created so they can't be used to spread spam, false news or inauthentic ads.<br/>Increased transparency in our advertising systems is another area where we have also made progress. You can now see all the ads an advertiser is running - even if they aren't targeted to you. Anyone who wants to run political or issue ads in the United States on Facebook must verify their identity. All political and issue ads must also make clear who paid for them, in the same way as TV or newspaper advertisements. But we've gone even further by putting all these ads in a public archive, which anyone can search to see how much was spent on each individual ad and the audience it reached. This greater transparency will increase responsibility and accountability for advertisers.<br/>As we've seen from previous elections, misinformation is a real challenge. A big part of the solution is getting rid of fake accounts. But it's also about attacking the spammers' economic incentives to create false news in the first place. And where posts are flagged as potentially false, we pass them to independent fact-checkers - such as the Associated Press and the Weekly Standard - to review, and we demote posts rated as false, which means they lose 80 percent of future traffic...<br/>For the U.S. midterm elections we're also using a new tool we tested in the Alabama Senate special election last year to identify political interference more quickly. This enabled us to find and remove foreign political spammers who'd previously flown under the radar. And last month, we took down hundreds of pages, groups and accounts for creating networks that were deliberately misleading people about their identities and intentions...<br/>It's an arms race, and it will take the combined forces of the U.S. private and public sectors to protect America's democracy from outside interference.<br/>Politico:\u00a0An Avalanche of Speech Can Bury Democracy<br/>By\u00a0Zeynep Tufekci<br/>Go back a decade and imagine your response to the question: \"What would a threat to truth look like?\" You might have thought of censorship-perhaps the Fahrenheit 451 version, in which books are piled up and burned, or the 1984 nightmare of a regime with total information control. Or perhaps you would have worried about the limits and biases of the mainstream media.<br/>But in the digital age, when speech can exist mostly unfettered, the big threat to truth looks very different. It's not just censorship, but an avalanche of undistinguished speech-some true, some false, some fake, some important, some trivial, much of it out-of-context, all burying us.<br/>For the longest time, we thought that as speech became more democratized, democracy itself would flourish. As more and more people could broadcast their words and opinions, there would be an ever-fiercer battle of ideas-with truth emerging as the winner, stronger from the fight. But in 2018, it is increasingly clear that more speech can in fact threaten democracy. The glut of information we now face, made possible by digital tools and social media platforms, can bury what is true, greatly elevate and amplify misinformation and distract from what is important...<br/>It's not speech per se that allows democracies to function, but the ability to agree-eventually, at least some of the time-on what is true, what is important and what serves the public good. This doesn't mean everyone must agree on every fact, or that our priorities are necessarily uniform. But democracy can't operate completely unmoored from a common ground, and certainly not in a sea of distractions.<br/>How can we get back to that common ground? We need new mechanisms-suited to the digital age-that allow for a shared understanding of facts and that focus our collective attention on the most important problems.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>Forbes:\u00a0Why The First Amendment Won't Save Google From Trump<br/>By Fred Campbell<br/>The First Amendment prohibits the government from passing a law that requires Google to censor content, but the government can still attempt to make an end-run around the First Amendment by convincing (or coercing) Google to censor content (\"voluntarily\") on the government's behalf, a practice known as de facto censorship.<br/>There is ample evidence that federal officials have engaged in the practice of de facto censorship with Google and other big tech companies. The ACLU raised the alarm in 2016, after top national security officials in former President Obama's administration held closed-door meetings with social media executives to \"learn how\" their platforms could counter \"radicalization.\" The ACLU was justifiably concerned that the Obama administration was pressuring social media executives to limit content on their platforms in a manner that could amount to de facto censorship...<br/>If Google were to push back against government demands, the company would increase the risk of government oversight of its business activities. Senator Chuck Schumer (D.-NY) said as much in this interview with Kara Swisher, executive editor of Recode, and Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen. Mr. Schumer told the interviewers that the \"antidote\" to government regulation of big tech was for big tech to \"do more on their own\" to curate content. \"I've told them, make efforts to figure out how to deal with this issue without doing too much impinging on free speech or the government's going to come in and change you, and that will not be good,\" he said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump Administration</emphasis><br/>Axios:\u00a0Trump asks for change in libel laws after Woodward book<br/>President Trump continued to tweet about his frustrations with Bob Woodward's forthcoming book, \"Fear,\" on Wednesday morning, questioning the country's libel laws after claiming last night that the book is \"a con on the public.\"<br/>\"Isn't it a shame that someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost. Don't know why Washington politicians don't change libel laws?\"<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Trump suggests protesting should be illegal<br/>By\u00a0Felicia Sonmez<br/>President Trump has long derided the mainstream media as the \"enemy of the people\" and lashed out at NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem. On Tuesday, he took his attacks on free speech one step further, suggesting in an interview with a conservative news site that the act of protesting should be illegal.<br/>Trump made the remarks in an Oval Office interview with the Daily Caller hours after his Supreme Court nominee, Brett M. Kavanaugh, was greeted by protests on the first day of his confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill.<br/>\"I don't know why they don't take care of a situation like that,\" Trump said. \"I think it's embarrassing for the country to allow protesters. You don't even know what side the protesters are on.\"<br/>He added: \"In the old days, we used to throw them out. Today, I guess they just keep screaming.\"<br/>More than 70 people were arrested after they repeatedly heckled Kavanaugh and senators at Tuesday's hearing.<br/>Trump has bristled at dissent in the past, including several instances in which he has suggested demonstrators should lose their jobs or be met with violence for speaking out.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corporate Speech</emphasis><br/>Forbes:\u00a0Big Brands And Political Activism: What Do Marketers Think?<br/>By\u00a0Christine Moorman<br/>Companies that decades ago would have maintained a studied silence are now weighing in hard on issues ranging from gun violence to immigration and free speech, and they're changing their strategy (marketing, sales, and lobbying) to match. Think of Dick's Sporting Goods' move to ban assault weapons after Nikolas Cruz (a customer) shot and killed his classmates in Parkland, Florida. Similarly, tech leaders Apple, Google, and Facebook came out swinging against Trump's immigration ban, which targeted seven countries with Muslim-majority populations.<br/>Now Nike, no stranger to political activism, joins the fray. The company just named Colin Kaepernick, the controversial former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, as the face of the 30th-anniversary \"Just Do It\" advertising campaign. Kaepernick, as most of the planet knows, is the football player who in 2016 \"took a knee\" to protest racial injustice when the U.S. national anthem played before the start of the team's football games. Kaepernick not only faced public invective for his choice, but also ultimately lost his career when he wasn't re-signed to an NFL team as a free agent...<br/>All of these decisions - by Dick's, the tech giants, Kaepernick, and Nike - were made by brands, corporate and personal, that counted the cost of political activism and decided to stand for an important cause. These leaders hope that their political activism will help shape public opinion and potentially lead to lasting change, while simultaneously cementing their reputations as moral leaders and change agents. In addition, the companies hope to develop stronger ties with employees and customers, who are increasingly politically active themselves and expect the same of the brands they buy.<br/>But what do marketers think?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Progressive Ousts Massachusetts Congressman, Joining Ranks of Democratic Stars<br/>By\u00a0Reid J. Epstein<br/>In the latest upset among Democrats, Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city councilor who ran as a progressive activist, beat 10-term Democratic Rep. Michael Capuano on Tuesday in a Massachusetts House primary.<br/>Ms. Pressley becomes the second Democrat to defeat an incumbent House member in a 2018 primary. She rode energy from the party's resistance to President Trump to topple Mr. Capuano, who Federal Election Commission records show raised about twice as much money as she did.<br/>Ms. Pressley's victory instantly thrusts her into the ranks of the new Democratic stars of 2018, alongside New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the only other Democrat to oust an incumbent member of Congress this year, and Andrew Gillum, who last week won an upset victory to become the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida.<br/>Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Gillum, Ms. Pressley is a minority candidate who was lifted by the progressive energy powering the Democratic Party in the era of Trump...<br/>Progressive groups that backed Ms. Pressley celebrated her victory. Jim Dean, the chairman of Democracy for America, called her \"an important reflection of the generational, multiracial, inclusive, populist transformation that's happening in the Democratic Party right now all across the country.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-34882</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3124\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 5, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002FSY</classCode><className>VALEO SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The court agreed with an Institute for Free Speech amicus brief in the case that argued the violation was not intentional as a matter of law and the fine should not have been tripled.</p><p><br/>The case, State of Washington v. Grocery Manufacturers Association, started in 2013 when the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), a national trade group, opposed a ballot measure that would have mandated GMO labeling.<br/>After a complaint filed by supporters of the ballot measure, the state sued GMA for failing to register as a political committee and failing to disclose the sources of its contributions. The state trial court not only found GMA violated those laws, but that it did so intentionally, tripling the associated fine. The court fined GMA an unprecedented $18 million.<br/>The appeals court rejected the triple fine: \"[A] party must have knowledge that it was violating the law to be subject to treble damages. The fact that GMA deliberately engaged in conduct that the trial court later determined was a violation of the [law] does not mean that GMA intended to violate the [law].\"<br/>This ruling echoes the Institute for Free Speech's amicus brief in the case: \"The standard for treble damages used by the Superior Court fails [the] requirement that fines be tailored to the government's purpose for imposing punitive damages. A court may only impose punitive damages-such as the treble damages here-to express 'moral condemnation' and 'to punish reprehensible conduct.'\"<br/>\"We're glad the court recognized that excessive fines should not be a tool regulators use to police good-faith legal errors,\" said Institute For Free Speech Legal Director Allen Dickerson. \"Fines this large inevitably chill campaign activity, since a tripled fine will cripple most organizations discussing ballot measures. Groups concerned they may flub a technical reporting requirement will often choose not to take the risk of speaking.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In the News</emphasis><br/>Vermont Public Radio:\u00a0Super PACs Are Back: Outside Groups Look To Influence Vermont Elections In 2018<br/>By\u00a0Peter Hirschfeld<br/>\"Super PACs are really just organizations of people banding together to speak jointly,\" [Institute for Free Speech President David]\u00a0Keating said. \"Last time I checked we still had a First Amendment which says we have the right to free speech and we have the right to a free press.\"<br/>Keating actually started the first super PAC in the country, called SpeechNow. It was the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court test case that broke the dam on elections spending. And Keating said that was a good thing.<br/>\"Far from being a perversion of the process, this is exactly what the First Amendment was written for - to protect our right to speak out about candidates and government,\" Keating said.<br/>And all those political ads super PACs are paying for? Keating said it means more voters are paying more attention to electoral contests.<br/>\"What political science research has found is ... when more information is provided to voters on any candidate, on any issue, it tends to drive turnout up,\" Keating said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Concurring Opinions:\u00a0FAN 199.8 (First Amendment News) Now Out - \"The Coddling of the American Mind\" by Greg Lukianoff &amp; Jonathan Haidt<br/>By\u00a0Ronald K.L.

Whitehouse Condemns Federalist Society...There Are Just a Few Problems<br/>By\u00a0Cortney O'Brien<br/>During the second day of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (RI) shamed the Federalist Society. The group, Whitehouse explained, is \"a significant group of people who tend to share very conservative and pro-corporate point of view.\" He then had an aide provide a poster showing a large list of the group's \"right-wing funders.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>CNBC:\u00a0GOP Sen. Richard Burr on social media hearings: It's hard to 'legislate around' the First Amendment <br/>By\u00a0Matthew J. Belvedere<br/>Sen. Richard Burr told CNBC on Wednesday the federal government and Big Tech need come together to thwart the kind of election meddling that plagued social media platforms during the 2016 presidential campaign.<br/>Yet he also noted the need to protect people's First Amendment rights.<br/>\"We've had a partnership over the last few months that's shown great progress. And today is a continuation,\" said Burr, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence...<br/>On the issue of regulation, Burr acknowledged in a CNBC interview that \"the First Amendment is a tough thing to legislate round.\"<br/>\"We want platforms where people can voice their opinions without any kind of influence in it,\" the North Carolina Republican said. \"But we want to make sure we keep the national security of the country.\"<br/>Warner told reporters: \"There are no existing rules or regulations at this point. That's why we need to put an end to the wild Wild West.\"<br/>\"The companies have gotten better. The government's gotten better. But frankly the Russians are getting better as well,\" the Virginia Democrat added.<br/>The hearing and one Wednesday afternoon on Twitter transparency in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce come just about two months before the midterm elections.<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Facebook, Twitter pledge to defend against foreign intrusion<br/>By\u00a0Mary Clare Jalonick and Barbara Ortutay, AP<br/>Facebook and Twitter executives pledged on Wednesday to better protect their social media platforms in the 2018 elections and beyond, and told Congress of aggressive efforts to root out foreign intrusions aimed at sowing divisions in American democracy.<br/>Facebook's No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, and Twitter's CEO, Jack Dorsey, testified before the Senate intelligence committee, but there was an empty chair for Google's parent Alphabet, which refused to send its top executive.<br/>Senators had sharp words for Alphabet CEO Larry Page, who oversees Google...<br/>Sandberg detailed the company's efforts to fight the problem with new technologies and manpower.<br/>\"We are even more determined than our adversaries, and we will continue to fight back,\" Sandberg said...<br/>Holding his phone at the witness table, [Dorsey] tweeted some of his opening statement: \"We aren't proud of how that free and open exchange has been weaponized and used to distract and divide people, and our nation. We found ourselves unprepared and ill-equipped for the immensity of the problems we've acknowledged,\" Dorsey wrote.<br/>He added: \"Abuse, harassment, troll armies, propaganda through bots and human coordination, misinformation campaigns, and divisive filter bubbles - that's not a healthy public square. Worse, a relatively small number of bad-faith actors were able to game Twitter to have an outsized impact.\"<br/>Dorsey was headed later Wednesday to a House committee focused on GOP complaints that social media companies have shown evidence of bias against conservatives. In testimony released before that hearing, Dorsey denied that Twitter uses political ideology to make decisions.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Big Tech in the Dock<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>[F]ury on the political left and right is converging and amplifying demands for government action. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley last year launched an investigation into Google's business practices, and other states may follow. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia has proposed stripping platforms of some of their legal protection for user-generated content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Senator Ted Cruz has said the predicate for Section 230 immunity is \"you're a neutral public forum.\"<br/>The Trump FTC has said it will reopen the agency's probe of Big Tech. The commission could hamstring the monopolists with regulation-perhaps appointing government monitors to oversee content reviews-and watch out if Elizabeth Warren is elected President.<br/>Then there's the private litigation threat. PragerU's charge that Google violated its free-speech rights is unlikely to prevail in court because Google isn't the government and can choose to exclude certain content under the law. But claims that Google engaged in unfair business practices by violating its own terms and conditions are stronger.<br/>Count us among the skeptics that government has an answer to this, and we don't need an Internet version of the Fairness Doctrine (1949-1987). But history shows that Americans will eventually ask politicians to rein in businesses that appear to be unaccountable. The lords of Big Tech will pay a price if they create the perception that they are the censorship arm of the political left.<br/>Columbia Journalism Review:\u00a0Press protections might safeguard Google's algorithms, even from Trump<br/>By\u00a0Jared Schroeder<br/>Regulating algorithms might seem like entirely new legal territory, since Google and its cousins are only two decades old. But a newspaper case from 1974 has quite a bit to say about whether the government can control, under the First Amendment, companies' algorithms and how they produce and organize information.<br/>In Miami Herald v. Tornillo, the Supreme Court struck down a Florida law that gave political candidates the \"right of reply\" to criticisms they faced in newspapers. The law required the newspaper to publish a response from the candidate, and to place it, free of charge, in a conspicuous place. The candidate's lawyers contended that newspapers held near monopolistic roles when it came to reaching audiences and that compelling them to publish responses was the only way to ensure that candidates could have a comparable voice.<br/>Nearly 45 years later, we are hearing a similar argument. Google and Facebook do not face any significant competition. If they manipulate their algorithms to privilege certain information, those who are harmed have comparatively limited tools through which to be heard.<br/>In the Herald case, the paper refused to comply with the law. Its editors argued the law violated the First Amendment because it allowed the government to compel a newspaper to publish certain information. The Supreme Court resoundingly agreed with the Herald. Justices explained that the government cannot force newspaper editors \"to publish that which reason tells them should not be published.\"<br/>What's important in 2018, however, isn't simply that the law was unconstitutional. Justices used the decision to highlight that the government cannot compel expression.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump Administration</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Justice Department to consider allegations of censorship on Facebook, Twitter<br/>By\u00a0Brian Fung, Tony Romm, Craig Timberg and Devlin Barrett<br/>Attorney General Jeff Sessions plans to meet with state attorneys general later this month to discuss whether tech companies may be \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas,\" the Justice Department said Wednesday in a statement...<br/>Agency spokesman Devin O'Malley said the meeting also will consider whether tech platforms \"may have harmed competition\" with their actions, a hint that the Justice Department may be weighing antitrust action against the firms.<br/>The meeting, which had been in the works since before Wednesday's hearing, is expected to take place in Washington on Sept. 25 - and at least three state attorneys general have agreed to participate...<br/>But antitrust experts say it would be difficult to turn generalized allegations of political bias into a compelling case. When it comes to Google, court rulings have held that search engine algorithms are constitutionally protected under the First Amendment...<br/>\"The irony here is that conservative media has long opposed governmental measures to enforce equal treatment of content by distribution platforms,\" said Marc Martin, a technology lawyer at the firm Perkins Coie. One prominent example, said Martin, may be found in the Fairness Doctrine...<br/>Others called the Justice Department's move unusual and a potential threat to the First Amendment rights of social media platforms, who may alter their behavior because of the implicit threat of action by federal and state investigators.<br/>\"It's not clear what they're investigating. If they're investigating companies without a clear reason, it's possible that the investigations themselves will stifle free speech,\" said Alex Abdo, a senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. \"DOJ without some clear implication of wrongdoing, should not be meddling.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corporate Speech</emphasis><br/>Fortune:\u00a0Levi Strauss CEO: Why Business Leaders Need to Take a Stand on Gun Violence<br/>By\u00a0Chip Bergh<br/>As president and CEO of a values-driven company that's known the world over as a pioneer of the American West and one of the great symbols of American freedom, I take the responsibility of speaking up on the important issues of our day very seriously. We can't take on every issue. But as business leaders with power in the public and political arenas, we simply cannot stand by silently when it comes to the issues that threaten the very fabric of the communities where we live and work. While taking a stand can be unpopular with some, doing nothing is no longer an option.<br/>That's why Levi Strauss &amp; Co. is stepping up our support for gun violence prevention...<br/>First, we have established the Safer Tomorrow Fund, which will direct more than $1 million in philanthropic grants from Levi Strauss &amp; Co. over the next four years to fuel the work of nonprofits and youth activists who are working to end gun violence in America.<br/>Second, I'm proud to announce that Levi Strauss &amp; Co. is partnering with Everytown for Gun Safety and executives including Michael Bloomberg to form Everytown Business Leaders for Gun Safety, a coalition of business leaders who believe, as we do, that business has a critical role to play in and a moral obligation to do something about the gun violence epidemic in this country...<br/>Third, we know that some of our employees have been personally affected by this issue and want to see change. Therefore, we are doubling our usual employee donation match to organizations aligned with our Safer Tomorrow Fund. In addition, we're encouraging employees who are concerned about gun violence to get involved. Levi Strauss &amp; Co. provides employees five hours a month (60 hours a year) in paid volunteer time and we recently expanded this to include political activism. We're encouraging our employees to use their time to make an impact.<br/>Vox:\u00a0Watch: Nike's powerful Colin Kaepernick commercial<br/>By\u00a0Alex Abad-Santos<br/>During the NFL season opener between the Philadelphia Eagles and Atlanta Falcons, Nike will air a powerful commercial (as seen above) that celebrates Kaepernick and other athletes while also commemorating the 30th anniversary of its \"Just Do It\" ad campaign...<br/>Kaepernick's call for people to \"believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything\" is a reference to Kaepernick's battle against the NFL for allegedly colluding to keep the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback out of the league over his protests against racial injustice and the police killings of unarmed black men and women. Kaepernick began kneeling during the playing of the national anthem before NFL games in 2016, and went unemployed by the league the following two years.<br/>Though Kaepernick and other NFL players who have kneeled during the national anthem maintain that their protest is about police brutality resulting in the deaths of unarmed black Americans, that hasn't stopped their critics, including President Donald Trump, from claiming that Kaepernick is disrespecting his flag and country.<br/>And in the wake of Nike's ad campaign, which was announced on Monday, Kaepernick's critics began calling for a Nike boycott, with some people destroying their already purchased Nike apparel. This ad won't make those people very happy.<br/>By kicking off its campaign with Kaepernick and including James and Williams, two transcendent athletes who have endured irrational and political criticism, Nike appears to be reemphasizing its support of Kaepernick and his message - even in the face of NFL owners and Kaepernick's critics, one of whom is the president of the United States.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>KALW San Francisco Public Radio:\u00a0Former FEC Chair Ann Ravel discusses her resignation and money in politics<br/>By\u00a0Rose Aguilar &amp; Laura Flynn<br/>In 2017, Federal Elections Committee chair Ann Ravel resigned saying: \"The mission of the FEC is essential to ensuring a fair electoral process. Yet, since the Supreme Court's\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0decision, our political campaigns have been awash in unlimited, often dark, money.\"<br/>Ann Ravel is now a lecturer at Berkeley Law.

Hirsch ruled that it didn't matter whether the association knew beforehand it was breaking the law.<br/>The appeals court rejected that position and sent the case back to Hirsch for further deliberations on whether the penalty should be tripled.<br/>The fine imposed by Hirsch was the largest ever in the U.S. for a campaign-related violation.<br/>Initiative 522 would have required labels on most food and drinks with genetically modified ingredients.

The proposed limits for those who choose not to opt in to the program are $3,500, $2,500 and $1,500 respectively.<br/>The proposal also increases the matching ratio to 8-to-1 for the first $250 raised by a citywide candidate and for the first $175 raised for all other seats. It would increase the cap on public funds disbursements from 55 percent to 75 percent of the spending limit for a seat, while also doling out the funds earlier in the election cycle.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-35142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3420\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 6, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

FEC\u2019s Impact on Independent Expenditures and Donor Privacy, Explained<br/>By Bradley A. Smith<br/>Over the past few years, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (\u201cCREW\u201d) has been on a targeted lawfare campaign against the Federal Election Commission\u2026<br/>One of CREW\u2019s longstanding white whales has been Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, the money pit run by Karl Rove that managed to light millions of dollars of donor cash on fire in fruitless efforts to elect people like former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel to the U.S. Senate in 2012.</p><p><br/>Crossroads GPS, whatever its flaws, conducted much of its business back in the early 2010s. In particular, it sought to protect the privacy of its donors by relying on a longstanding FEC regulation that said only donors giving for the purpose of a\u00a0particular\u00a0independent expenditure needed to be disclosed in connection with that expenditure. This wasn\u2019t a controversial interpretation of the regulation. The language is quite clear, and the FEC\u2019s Office of General Counsel agreed that Crossroads was protected by its terms.<br/>CREW disagrees with this regulation and seeks greater disclosure from nonprofit groups (and less privacy for donors to nonprofits generally). But, as the court noted on page 15 of its opinion, rather than seek to open a rulemaking before the Commission, it went after Crossroads itself. This end-run around the Commission\u2019s regulatory apparatus found success in late August, in a 2-0\u00a0opinion\u00a0written by Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan of the D.C. Circuit\u2026<br/>That decision found that the FEC\u2019s regulation was invalid because it conflicts with Congressional guidance. And with that regulation gone, an important question arises: precisely which donors to an organization making independent expenditures must now be reported?<br/>Has Citizens United Increased Corruption? An Examination of Public Corruption Prosecutions<br/>By Alec Greven<br/>The Citizens United decision is not correlated to an increase in corruption. As independent expenditures rapidly rose on the national level, public corruption prosecutions declined. A similar trend is observed in the states. If you isolate states that were most affected by Citizens United, the data show that those states experienced a steeper decline in corruption.\u00a0<br/>These findings are in line with similar academic research\u2026<br/>Most importantly, however, there is simply no evidence of a causal relationship between Citizens United and increases in public corruption. Corruption levels are generally unaffected by independent political expenditures. Campaign finance laws, by their very nature, limit the freedom of individuals to engage in political activities. This limitation, otherwise disallowed by the First Amendment, rests on the necessity of preventing corruption. Government officials should be careful to only implement coercive laws when those laws actually target corrupt behavior. The absence of any link between independent expenditures and corruption indicates either no relationship or one where increased speech through independent expenditures actually benefits society. In light of these findings, we should be very cautious before we take any action to overturn or undermine Citizens United. Additionally, critics of Citizens United should re-evaluate their beliefs about the relationship between independent expenditures and corruption until further evidence is found.<br/>PDF<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal: Land of Free (and Fettered) Speech<br/>By Adam Kirsch<br/>Today, Americans are less worried about government censorship than about navigating the unwritten rules of socially acceptable speech. Violating those rules doesn\u2019t bring jail time, but the prospect of losing your reputation or your job has a chilling effect all on its own\u2026<br/>The challenge facing Americans today is primarily cultural: We have to relearn the role that free speech plays in a pluralistic society. Declaring speech out of bounds in certain contexts, especially when it expresses views that are actually widely held, glosses over conflict without resolving it.<br/>On the contrary, when people are told that they can\u2019t say what they think, rather than being presented with an argument for why it\u2019s wrong, they may comply, but they won\u2019t change their minds. As the philosopher Benedict Spinoza wrote in the 17th century, when religious opinions were the ones being censored, people \u201care most prone to resent the branding as criminal of opinions which they believe to be true\u2026In a democracy, everyone submits to the control of authority over his actions, but not over his judgment and reason.\u201d<br/>To overcome our current divisions, Americans need to be confident enough to hear and express differences without giving in to fear or rage, which are mute emotions, capable of expressing themselves only in violence. Free speech represents the possibility that society can change peacefully, that today\u2019s unpopular cause can become tomorrow\u2019s consensus. The more urgently change is needed, the more that freedom is worth defending.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Reason (Volokh Conspiracy): Facebook Need Not Remove \u201cRussia State-Controlled Media\u201d Label from Maffick\u2019s \u201cIn the Now,\u201d \u201cWaste-Ed,\u201d and \u201cSoapbox\u201d Pages<br/>By Eugene Volokh<br/>From\u00a0Maffick LLC v. Facebook, Inc., decided yesterday by Judge James Donato (N.D. Cal.):<br/>Plaintiff Maffick LLC seeks a temporary restraining order directing defendant Facebook, Inc., to take down a \u201cRussia state-controlled media\u201d label that Facebook posted on Maffick\u2019s \u201cIn the Now,\u201d \u201cWaste-Ed\u201d and \u201cSoapbox\u201d pages\u2026.<br/>Maffick\u2019s TRO application also raises a concern about prior restraint. A court order that forbids speech activities, which is what Maffick seeks, is a \u201cclassic prior restraint of speech.\u201d \u201cPrior restraints pose the \u2018most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights,'\u201d and there is a \u201chistorical and heavy presumption against such restraints.\u201d \u2026<br/>Although Maffick asserted six causes of action against Facebook in its complaint, Dkt. No. 1, it seeks a TRO on just four of those claims: (1) libel under California Civil Code Section 45; (2) Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(A)); (3) the California Unfair Competition Law (Cal. Bus. &amp;Prof;. Code \u00a7 17200); and (4) interference with prospective economic advantage claim under California state law.<br/>The merits inquiry is considerably streamlined by the fact that all four claims hinge on the proposition that the Russian media label is false. Consequently, to win a TRO, Maffick must demonstrate that it is likely to succeed in showing that the \u201cRussia state-controlled media\u201d label is false. It has not crossed that threshold.<br/>New York Times: Julian Assange Appears in London Court for U.S. Extradition Hearing<br/>By Megan Specia<br/>Julian Assange, the embattled founder of WikiLeaks, made his first appearance in a London court in months on Monday, as an evidentiary hearing began in his U.S. extradition case\u2026<br/>In the hearings, Mr. Assange and his lawyers will argue against his extradition on the American charges, which accuse Mr. Assange of violating the Espionage Act. The charges stem from the publishing of secret military and diplomatic documents by WikiLeaks in 2010\u2026<br/>From the start, the charges against Mr. Assange have raised\u00a0profound First Amendment issues\u00a0because his actions are difficult to distinguish in a legally meaningful way from those of traditional news organizations. It would be\u00a0unprecedented in American law\u00a0for such activity to result in criminal convictions, so press freedom advocates have denounced the charges against him and have been watching the case closely\u2026<br/>On Monday, the defense called its first witness, Mark Feldstein, a professor at the University of Maryland and a former investigative reporter, who appeared by video link.<br/>He testified that the passing of leaked, classified information to news organizations in the United States was common\u2026<br/>\u201cIts routine, every government study in the last 60 years has said that it is widespread, and these leaks, they shed light on decision making by the government,\u201d Mr. Feldstein said, noting that they have also \u201cexposed government deceit\u201d and \u201cgo back to George Washington\u2019s presidency.\u201d<br/>Mr. Feldstein also said that U.S. authorities had not pursued charges against publishers of leaked information \u201cbecause of fear of running afoul of the free press clause in the Constitution.\u201d<br/>Reason (Volokh Conspiracy): Short Circuit: A Roundup of Recent Federal Court Decisions<br/>By John Ross<br/>Please enjoy the latest edition of\u00a0Short Circuit, a weekly feature from the Institute for Justice\u2026<br/>The City of Austin allows digitized billboards for \u201con-premises signs,\u201d i.e., signs that advertise stuff at the locale of the sign, but prohibits digitization of \u201coff-premises signs.\u201d Is this a content-based distinction that violates the First Amendment?\u00a0Fifth Circuit: It is, notwithstanding Justice Alito\u2019s suggestion in\u00a0Reed v. Town of Gilbert\u00a0that such distinctions are content neutral.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>Fox News: Ex-Acting AGWhitaker calls on DOJ to probe \u2018insidious\u2019 influence of Big Tech on democracy<br/>By Charles Creitz<br/>Former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker told \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d Friday that he believes the\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0is \u201cgoing to get to the\u00a0bottom of this insidious, really, censorship of mostly\u00a0conservative voices on social\u00a0media.\u201d<br/>\u201cI think the Department of Justice has been looking at this\u00a0issue, and\u00a0I also believe that because of the way the\u00a0algorithms that Facebook and\u00a0Twitter and the like [are used] to\u00a0provide your news feed, I think\u00a0that could be viewed, and maybe viewed by this Department of Justice,\u00a0as a campaign contribution \u2014 an illegal campaign contribution \u2014 that ultimately, I think, they\u00a0will step in and take action.\u201d \u2026<br/>\u201cAnd I think what is also happening among these companies, Facebook in particular, [is] they have so much data on their individual users that they can essentially manipulate what you see, how you see it, and therefore, based on the feedback loop that is provided, they can then try to influence you to \u2026 use a product [or] vote for a candidate,\u201d Whitaker said.\u00a0<br/>Wall Street Journal: Facebook\u2019s Rittenhouse Mistake<br/>By The Editorial Board<br/>Will\u00a0Facebook\u00a0let users share this editorial? We\u2019ll see. The social-media giant seems to have declared Kyle Rittenhouse\u2019s fatal shooting of two people amid riots in Kenosha, Wis., a mass murder. Mr. Rittenhouse\u2019s lawyer says his client was attacked and acted in self-defense, but Facebook has banned any \u201cpraise and support\u201d for him on the site, including links to contribute to his legal representation. Searches for his name on the platform also come up empty.<br/>This is an alarming resort to censorship on an issue of public concern by a company that has advertised its support for First Amendment values. Even more than most political controls on content, this blackout is troubling because it seems targeted at users\u2019 expectation of freedom of speech and Mr. Rittenhouse\u2019s right to due process\u2026<br/>Facebook\u2019s heavy-handed blackout flies in the face of CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s commitments last year-which we have defended-that the company would protect free expression and not yield to political demands to suppress speech.<br/>Facebook naturally wants to dissociate itself from street violence, but in this case it has made a mistake. It can continue to block incitements to violence, and shut down groups plotting violence, without throwing itself into a murky and politicized criminal case. Prejudging guilt and moving against a person\u2019s legal defense is a bad look for a company that claims to be committed to civil liberties. Voters, and their representatives, will notice.<br/>ProPublica: Facebook\u2019s Political Ad Ban Also Threatens Ability to Spread Accurate Information on How to Vote<br/>By Jeremy B. Merrill<br/>Facebook this week said it would bar political ads in the seven days before the presidential election. That could prevent dirty tricks or an \u201cOctober surprise\u201d and give watchdogs time to fact-check statements. But rather than responding with glee, election officials say the move leaves them worried.<br/>Included in the ban are ads purchased by election officials \u2013 secretaries of state and boards of elections \u2013 who use Facebook to inform voters about how voting will work. The move effectively removes a key communication channel just as millions of Americans will begin to navigate a voting process different from any they\u2019ve experienced before.<br/>New York Times: Why Facebook\u2019s Blocking of New Political Ads May Fall Short<br/>By Davey Alba and Sheera Frenkel<br/>To limit voter misinformation ahead of November\u2019s election, Facebook said this week that it would\u00a0block new political ads from appearing on its site\u00a0in the week before Election Day\u2026<br/>But just how effective could such a move be in minimizing confusion?<br/>The answer: likely not very effective.<br/>That\u2019s because political ads on Facebook are just one piece of content on the social network; political misinformation also flourishes in messages that people post and in discussions in private Facebook Groups. Facebook is not tackling those areas as part of the changes it announced this week.<br/>Political ads have also been on the rise on Facebook already. Many of those ads are likely to remain online before Election Day because the company is not removing existing promotions.<br/>At the same time, some new political ads may slip onto the site because the social network has sometimes had difficulty identifying which ads should be categorized as political, researchers said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Bloomberg: Trump Weighs Putting Up to $100 Million of His Cash Into Race<br/>By Jennifer Jacobs, Mario Parker, and Bill Allison<br/>President Donald Trump has discussed spending as much as $100 million of his own money on his re-election campaign, if necessary, to beat Democratic nominee Joe Biden, according to people familiar with the matter.<br/>The billionaire president has talked about the idea with multiple people, though he hasn\u2019t yet committed to any self-funding, according to people briefed on internal deliberations. Though Trump personally contributed $66 million to his 2016 campaign, it would be unprecedented for an incumbent president to put his own money toward winning a second term\u2026<br/>Trump said Tuesday that his campaign had to spend \u201ca lot of money\u201d to combat what he called \u201cfalse reporting\u201d on his handling of the coronavirus outbreak.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fundraising</emphasis><br/>Washington Post: Louis DeJoy\u2019s rise as GOP fundraiser was powered by contributions from company workers who were later reimbursed, former employees say<br/>By Aaron C. Davis, Amy Gardner, and Jon Swaine<br/>Louis DeJoy\u2019s prolific campaign fundraising, which helped position him as a top Republican power broker in North Carolina and ultimately as head of the U.S. Postal Service, was bolstered for more than a decade by a practice that left many employees feeling pressured to make political contributions to GOP candidates \u2013 money DeJoy later reimbursed through bonuses, former employees say.<br/>Five people who worked for DeJoy\u2019s former business, New Breed Logistics, say they were urged by DeJoy\u2019s aides or by the chief executive himself to write checks and attend fundraisers at his 15,000-square-foot gated mansion beside a Greensboro, N.C., country club. There, events for Republicans running for the White House and Congress routinely fetched $100,000 or more apiece.<br/>Two other employees familiar with New Breed\u2019s financial and payroll systems said DeJoy would instruct that bonus payments to staffers be boosted to help defray the cost of their contributions, an arrangement that would be unlawful\u2026<br/>Although it can be permissible to encourage employees to make donations, reimbursing them for those contributions is a violation of North Carolina and\u00a0federal election laws. Known as a straw-donor scheme, the practice allows donors to evade individual contribution limits and obscures the true source of money used to influence elections.<br/>Such federal violations carry a five-year statute of limitations. There is no statute of limitations in North Carolina for felonies, including campaign finance violations.<br/>Politico: Trump says he\u2019s open to investigating Louis DeJoy over GOP contributions<br/>By Matthew Choi<br/>President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would be open to investigating and potentially removing the head of the U.S. Postal Service over allegations of campaign finance violations.<br/>Speaking at a White House news conference, Trump made the remarks in response to a Washington Post\u00a0investigation\u00a0that reported Postmaster General Louis DeJoy had pushed employees at his former North Carolina-based company to donate to Republican campaigns and reimbursed them using bonuses. If true, the acts would be a violation of campaign finance law.<br/>When asked about the report, Trump said he would be open to an investigation, but stressed that he wasn\u2019t familiar with the details. When asked whether he would be OK with DeJoy\u2019s being dismissed if he were found to have violated campaign finance law, Trump said yes\u2026<br/>The campaign finance allegations were already enough to raise the eyebrows of North Carolina\u2019s attorney general, Josh Stein, who said on Sunday that they were worthy of an investigation.<br/>\u201cIt is against the law to directly or indirectly reimburse someone for a political contribution,\u201d Stein said in a pair of tweets. \u201cAny credible allegations of such actions merit investigation by the appropriate state and federal authorities. Beyond this, it would be inappropriate for me as Attorney General to comment on any specific matter at this time.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Springfield News-Leader: Ballot language set for Clean Missouri do-over. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll see Nov. 3<br/>By Austin Huguelet<br/>A state appeals court finalized language for one of the most controversial items on the ballot this fall after a months-long legal fight.<br/>At issue was a Republican-sponsored proposal that asks voters to reverse key parts of a redistricting overhaul voters themselves approved in 2018.<br/>Republicans\u00a0described their proposal with no mention of repeal, prompting supporters of the 2018 proposal, known as Clean Missouri, to cry foul.<br/>Two courts ultimately agreed the legislature erred, and on Monday, a Western District Court of Appeals panel wrote that the original language failed to acknowledge lawmakers\u2019 full intentions. They then rewrote the question as follows:<br/>\u201cShall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:<br/>Ban gifts from paid lobbyists to legislators and their employees;<br/>Reduce legislative campaign contribution limits;<br/>Change the redistricting process voters approved in 2018 by: (i) transferring responsibility for drawing state legislative districts from the Nonpartisan State Demographer to Governor-appointed bipartisan commissions; (ii) modifying and reordering the redistricting criteria.\u201d<br/>That language became final Wednesday after lawmakers declined to appeal and the court rejected a request from Clean Missouri supporters to modify the language further.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 9/8 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-112836</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T1-N7T1-DY1R-B4P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

McCutcheon\u00a0filed an advisory opinion request\u00a0with the FEC in June asking the agency if he can bypass individual contribution limits by transferring $50,000 that he contributed to his campaign committee directly to the Libertarian Party.\u00a0<br/>\u201cFederal election law allows an individual to only contribute up to $35,500 per year to a political party \u2013 and that same limit applies to Mike Bloomberg\u2019s transferred money- unless and until the FEC or courts approve Shaun McCutcheon\u2019s request to do the same,\u201d Dan Backer, attorney for McCutcheon, said in a press statement announcing the lawsuit\u2026<br/>Bloomberg could set a precedent, according to former FEC Commissioner Brad Smith. \u201cThe statute is pretty clear that such transfers are allowed,\u201d Smith told the DCNF in June. \u201cNote that it\u2019s right in the statute \u2013 this is not a creation of FEC regulation, but of Congress.\u201d \u2026<br/>\u201cWe may see more of it \u2013 now that the tactic has been demonstrated, we should expect that others will probably use it,\u201d Smith said, explaining what he believes will happen if FEC does acknowledge the legality of such transfers.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Presidential Nominating Convention Accounts\u2019 Expenditure Limit: A Cap on Political Expression<br/>By Heather McGuire<br/>While individuals may only contribute $35,500 per year to a national party committee, individuals may contribute $106,500 per year to a convention committee. Despite being able to receive larger contributions, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30116(a)(9)(A) places a $20,000,000 aggregate\u00a0expenditure limit\u00a0on convention committees with respect to any single convention.<br/>In 2016, the DNC spent $16.6 million and the RNC spent $10.6 million on their respective presidential nominating conventions.\u00a0This year, the DNC and RNC accounted for the usual convention costs that tend to rise slightly each cycle with inflation. Then, a pandemic arrived, and the parties were forced to bear the added cost of executing a first-of-its-kind, COVID-19-safe, digital operation from multiple venues. Those added costs will likely be tacked onto the price tag of a traditional convention format that was scrapped just months prior as a result of the pandemic. It is very much within the realm of possibility that each national party hits the $20,000,000 expenditure limit at some point in the next several election cycles.<br/>The Supreme Court has decided that limits on political expenditures deserve closer scrutiny than restrictions on political contributions, as the former tend to curb expressive and associational activity more than the latter.Moreover, the Court has found that expenditure limits are rarely justified, as they have a less direct link to political corruption.<br/>Section 30116(a)(9)(A)\u2019s $20,000,000 cap unconstitutionally limits national parties\u2019 ability to engage in political expression. Further, it disincentivizes convention committees from raising as much as they can; why raise more money than you are allowed to spend?<br/>PDF<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Washington Post: The Trailer: It\u2019s not 2016 for third-party candidates<br/>By David Weigel<br/>And in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Republican donor Shaun McCutcheon\u00a0sued the FEC\u00a0with an argument that, if successful, would allow self-funding candidates to donate more to their parties; if not successful, it would stop Mike Bloomberg from donating leftover money from his presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee. (The FEC lacks a quorum and can\u2019t adjudicate such things on its own right now.)<br/>Ironically, it was McCutcheon whose successful lawsuit against candidate contribution limits to political parties led to a 2014 decision lifting the ceiling on individual donations to candidates, parties and PACs, allowing donors who might have given a combined $117,000 to all three to give, in that cycle, $3.5 million. The rules have been different for candidates themselves. Bloomberg donated $18 million to the DNC, proportionately less than the $4.5 million Beto O\u2019Rourke donated to Texas\u2019s Democratic Party after the failure of his 2018 Senate bid.\u00a0<br/>McCutcheon\u2019s lawsuit asks whether self-funding candidates, like Bloomberg, get to take advantage of a loophole, giving more than an ordinary donor can to a party. His argument began with a blink-and-you-missed it, 18-day run for the Libertarian Party\u2019s nomination. McCutcheon, a Trump donor, filed to run 14 days before the Libertarian convention, invested $65,000 in his campaign, spent $15,000 and wanted to give the rest to the LP.<br/>Law360: How Ohio Case May Alter Corruption Law Landscape<br/>By Peter Koski and Randall Friedland<br/>When federal agents arrested former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder on corruption charges, the headlines were jaw-dropping: $60 million in bribes in exchange for a controversial $1.3 billion legislative bailout for two aging nuclear power plants. The fallout was predictable and swift\u2026<br/>But despite the sensational headlines, the 82-page criminal complaint contains none of the salacious details commonly associated with such bribery schemes. There are no allegations of cash-filled suitcases, private jets or exotic vacations.<br/>Instead, the complaint alleges that the company that wanted the legislative bailout spent $60 million on far more prosaic fare: media ads, lobbying activity and campaign literature, including $3.5 million for postage.<br/>The complaint alleges that\u00a0FirstEnergy Corp., identified in the complaint as \u201cCompany A,\u201d contributed $60 million to Generation Now Inc., an IRS 501(c)(4) entity, created to fund a lobbying campaign to enact the legislative bailout and defeat Ballot Campaign, a referendum seeking its repeal.<br/>The complaint alleges that Generation Now spent the money on polls, media buys, and mailers; two media services firms;a political strategy group; Ballot Campaign Organizers to collect the signatures of registered voters; and \u201ca media blitz \u2013 television ads, radio ads, mailers, and digital media,\u201d among other First Amendment protected activity\u2026<br/>This case raises several consequential issues at the core of the federal corruption statutes, and it creates significant legal risks for companies engaging in political speech.<br/>Above the Law: The Constitution Was Not Made Only For A Religious People<br/>By Tyler Broker<br/>Last week, a ruling out of the\u00a0Seventh Circuit\u00a0presented the latest example that this country is facing an increasingly theocratic judiciary seeking to expressly favor religion and religious citizens at the great expense of nonbelievers. To be clear, the case is only at the preliminary injunction stage, so the Seventh Circuit panel was not making a decision on the merits. However, where the panel did make legal conclusions, they were downright alarming. For example, Judge Diane Wood declared that the court is convinced \u201cthat the speech that accompanies religious exercise has a privileged position under the First Amendment.\u201d If your alarm bells went off at the mention of a \u201cprivileged position\u201d within the First Amendment just wait, because somehow this opinion gets even worse:<br/>We conclude by explaining that a comparison between ordinary speech (including political speech, which all agree lies at the core of the First Amendment) and the speech aspect of religious activity reveals something more than an \u201capples to apples\u201d matching. What we see instead is \u201cspeech\u201d being compared to \u201cspeech plus,\u201d where the \u201cplus\u201d is the protection that the First Amendment guarantees to religious exercise.<br/>Declaring that religious expression is entitled to some special, privileged status within the First Amendment that is\u00a0superior\u00a0to political speech is incredibly difficult to justify. For one thing, the free speech law that I thought we were\u00a0all operating under, seems pretty clear that unless it is determining whether certain speech falls into a narrowly defined list of historical exceptions, government is not supposed to be in the business of making\u00a0viewpoint or content-based restrictions. Yet, if courts are granting better treatment to expressive gatherings simply because they contain religious speech than other expressive gatherings such as political ones, this would seem to be a pretty clear-cut case of content-based restriction.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>The Verge: Republicans pressure platforms with new 230 bill<br/>By Makena Kelly<br/>A group of Senate Republicans introduced a new bill Tuesday aimed at chipping away some of the protections provided to social media companies through Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.<br/>The\u00a0Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act, introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), would strip away the liability protection provided by Section 230 if a platform restricted access to content without providing specific rules that it violated. The bill would require platforms to have an \u201cobjectively reasonable belief\u201d that content violated a specific policy in order for it to be removed, or they could be held liable for their moderation actions.<br/>The bill would also amend language in the original law, changing vague terms like \u201cobjectionable\u201d with \u201cpromoting terrorism\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d as guidance for moderating content.<br/>\u201cSocial media companies are routinely censoring content that to many, should be considered valid political speech,\u201d Graham said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThis reform proposal addresses the concerns of those who feel like their political views are being unfairly suppressed.\u201d\u00a0<br/>NPR: House Democrats Investigating Postmaster General Over Campaign Finance Allegations<br/>By Merrit Kennedy<br/>House Democrats say they are investigating Postmaster General Louis DeJoy over\u00a0allegations reported\u00a0by\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0that he asked employees to donate to certain political candidates and then reimbursed them through bonuses.<br/>\u201cIf these allegations are true, Mr. DeJoy could face criminal exposure \u2013 not only for his actions in North Carolina, but also for lying to our committee under oath,\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said in a written statement.<br/>\u201cWe will be investigating this issue, but I believe the Board of Governors must take emergency action to immediately suspend Mr. DeJoy, who they never should have selected in the first place,\u201d Maloney added.<br/>Wall Street Journal: Make the Senate Great Again<br/>By Ben Sasse<br/>One of the biggest reasons Congress gives away its power to the executive branch is that it\u2019s politically expedient for both parties to avoid the decisions that come from the work of legislating. Lawmakers are obsessed with staying in office, and one of the easiest ways to keep getting re-elected is by avoiding hard decisions. We ought to propose a constitutional amendment to limit every senator to one term, but we should double it from six years to 12\u2026<br/>If that\u2019s a bridge too far, at least ban fundraising while the Senate is in session in Washington. It\u2019s an everyday experience to sit down at a $2,000-a-plate lunch fundraiser and then run over to make committee votes. Lobbying is protected by the First Amendment, but it shouldn\u2019t be the primary focus of senators when we\u2019ve got work to do.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IRS</emphasis><br/>Wisconsin Examiner: Watchdog: Outside group omitted campaign spending on GOP from tax return<br/>By Erik Gunn<br/>A tax-exempt lobbying group with close ties to the Republican Party spent nearly $1 million to help elect 13 GOP lawmakers in the 2016 and 2018 election cycles \u2013 without filing required reports, according to a complaint filed Tuesday with the federal Internal Revenue Service.<br/>The Jobs First Coalition (JFC), founded in August 2009 and exempt from taxes under Section 501(c)(4) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, transferred $920,000 in the tax years of 2016 through 2018 to a separate political fund it operates,\u00a0states the complaint, filed by the Campaign for Accountability in Washington, D.C.<br/>Contrary to IRS requirements, the complaint states, \u201cJFC failed to report any of this political campaign activity to the IRS.\u201d<br/>Instead, the Campaign for Accountability complaint states, \u201cJFC reported to the IRS \u2013 under penalty of perjury \u2013 that it spent nothing on political campaign activities between 2016 and 2018.\u201d<br/>The money was transferred to the Jobs First Coalition Political Fund, which was established in 2013 and made independent expenditures on behalf of Republican legislative candidates and against their Democratic challengers in the 2016 and 2018 elections.<br/>Under Wisconsin campaign finance law, organizations that make independent expenditures in political campaigns must file an itemized report of the contributions they receive, identifying each donor and the amount it has contributed, with the Wisconsin Ethics Commission.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>The Verge: Trump\u2019s latest attack on Section 230 is really about censoring speech<br/>By Casey Newton<br/>Trump brought [Section 230] up today when a Twitter account with fewer than 200 followers posted an obviously doctored image of Senate Majority Mitch McConnell dressed up in Soviet military garb, with the caption reading \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d<br/>\u201cWhy does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up, but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true?\u201d\u00a0the president wanted to know. \u201cMitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you!\u201d \u2026<br/>The reason Twitter (usually) leaves phony pictures like that up is that the United States permits its citizens to speak freely about politicians \u2013 even to say mean things about them. Repealing Section 230 would likely have no impact on the tweet in question, because the Twitter user\u2019s speech is protected under the First Amendment.<br/>It might, however, make Twitter legally liable for what its users post \u2013 which would lead the company to remove more speech, not less\u2026<br/>As it so happens, there\u2019s\u00a0a sharp new report\u00a0today out on the subject. Paul Barrett at the\u00a0NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights\u00a0looks at the origins and evolution of Section 230, evaluates both partisan and nonpartisan critiques, and offers a handful of solutions.<br/>To me there are two key takeaways from the report. One is that there are genuine, good-faith reasons to call for Section 230 reform, even though they\u2019re often drowned out by bad tweets that misunderstand the law.\u00a0<br/>New York Post: Facebook will pay users to log off before 2020 election<br/>By Selim Algar<br/>Facebook is offering users money to refrain from using the site and Instagram in the weeks leading up to the bitterly contested November elections.<br/>To assess the impact of social media on voting, the company will pay selected members up to $120 to deactivate their accounts beginning at the end of September\u2026<br/>The\u00a0Silicon Valley giant\u00a0said it expects 200,000 to 400,000 people to take part.<br/>\u201cRepresentative, scientific samples of people in the US will be selected and invited to participate in the study.

The campaign and its joint fund with the Republican National Committee have spent over $65 million on YouTube and Google \u2013 about $30 million of it since July. Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee joint committee, by comparison, have spent about $33 million on YouTube and Google during the entire campaign. (Google doesn\u2019t provide an exact breakdown of the spending, but the Trump campaign said most of the money was for YouTube as opposed to search ads.) \u2026<br/>Trump\u2019s campaign has also devoted significant resources to generating organic content on YouTube \u2013 regular videos uploaded by supporters as opposed to ones it pays to promote. In August, the campaign posted nearly 900 videos, while the Biden campaign posted just over 100.<br/>Many digital strategists say YouTube\u2019s algorithm is more likely to recommend to viewers channels that are updated regularly with new content. \u201cThe name of the game with algorithms is to flood the zones,\u201d said Eric Wilson, a veteran Republican digital operative. \u201cThe Trump campaign is putting on a master class in advertising according to algorithms \u2013 it just rewards the side that will produce more content.\u201d<br/>Politico: GOP congressman spent $70K in campaign cash on meals<br/>By Ally Mutnick<br/>Dinners at international sushi bars, steakhouses and a wine boutique.

The individual receipts are fairly modest in most cases \u2013 typically ranging from $12 to a few hundred dollars.But together, ethics watchdogs say, they suggest a consistent pattern: Turner uses

Greenlee said Tuesday an order signed last month that banned all expressive conduct within 300 feet of the Gaston County Courthouse and Magistrate\u2019s Office has been lifted.<br/>Greenlee said the

The First and Eighth Amendments do not allow such massive penalties for speakers whose only errors involve registration and reporting of perfectly legal expenditures, the brief says.</p><p><br/>\u201cThe threat of multi-million dollar fines for technical violations will cause many groups to avoid speaking on public issues. The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive fines, and that protection is especially important where those fines are directed at political speech,\u201d\u00a0said Institute for Free Speech Legal Director Allen Dickerson.<br/>The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), a national trade group, was fined in 2016 for reporting errors in its ballot measure advocacy. The group reported all of its contributions, and voters knew of GMA\u2019s economic interests in opposing a ballot measure. Nevertheless, the state imposed a massive $6 million fine on GMA for failing to register and report as a political committee. The fine was later trebled to $18 million, which the state\u2019s Attorney General hailed as \u201chistoric.\u201d<br/>A state court of appeals reduced the fine to the original $6 million, but did not subject this base fine to constitutional scrutiny. The Institute for Free Speech\u2019s brief explains that this huge fine is excessive and will chill protected speech\u2026<br/>The Institute asks the Washington Supreme Court to remand the case for consideration of First and Eighth Amendment concerns. The case is\u00a0State of Washington v. Grocery Manufacturers Association.<br/>Institute for Free Speech Amicus Brief in State of Washington v. Grocery Manufacturers Association, Washington Supreme Court (September 6, 2019)<br/>Washington\u2019s Attorney General hailed as \u201chistoric\u201d the Superior Court\u2019s imposition of an $18 million fine for reporting errors related to ballot-issue advocacy. Those reporting errors did not involve bribery or anything related to quid pro quo corruption: There were no candidates or office holders to be corrupted. The Grocery Manufacturers Association\u2019s (\u201cGMA\u201d) error did not conceal the interests of those funding the opposition to the ballot measure: The full amounts contributed were reported, voters knew GMA\u2019s and its members\u2019 interests, and the contributions were themselves legal.<br/>The Court of Appeals reduced the fine to $6 million to cure the Superior Court\u2019s errors in statutory interpretation, but the Court of Appeals erred in not subjecting the base and punitive fines to constitutional scrutiny. Whether $6 million or $18 million, the fines here are massive-a death sentence for most groups. And groups will silence themselves, knowing that complaints by ideological opponents may result in terminal penalties. Such fines therefore suppress \u201cspeech about public issues,\u201d which \u201ccommands the highest level of First Amendment protection.\u201d<br/>Neither the trebled fine nor the base fine pass such constitutional scrutiny. Because the fines target protected political speech, they must meet the scrutiny required under both the First and Eighth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Eighth Amendment\u2019s gross disproportionality analysis, properly accounting for the First Amendment burdens at issue here, requires that the actual burdens imposed for noncompliance with a disclosure law be substantially related to the government\u2019s informational interest. The trebled fine is not substantially related to the State\u2019s interest in punishing reprehensible conduct. And given the tenuous relationship between the additional disclosure demanded by the State and the informational interest, the burdensome base fine also cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. Accordingly, while the decision by the Court of Appeals to reverse the trebled fine should be affirmed-on both statutory and constitutional grounds-the First and Eighth Amendments require that the base fine be reversed as well.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Amendment\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Liberal City Tags Speech as Terrorism<br/>By\u00a0Walter Olson<br/>Only Congress can declare war, but the San Francisco Board of Supervisors is trying. Last week it voted unanimously to brand the National Rifle Association, an association with millions of American members, a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization.\u201d\u2026<br/>An even greater problem for the supervisors is that the NRA and its members are generally law-abiding. The resolution therefore claims that even otherwise lawful acts-such as training or providing funds-that assists or enables someone you should have known might misuse weapons constitutes \u201cmaterial support.\u201d That includes the NRA\u2019s \u201cadvocacy,\u201d \u201cpropaganda\u201d and \u201cpromotion\u201d both of gun ownership and of \u201cextremist positions.\u201d In a word, speech. Thus the supervisors purport to classify as terrorism the expression of opinions with which they disagree.<br/>The resolution is mostly symbolic, but it does order city officials to \u201ctake every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County of San Francisco from doing business with\u201d the NRA. That\u2019s almost certainly unconstitutional. In Board of County Commissioners v. Umbehr (1996), the Supreme Court held that terminating a contract in response to the contractor\u2019s protected speech violates the First Amendment. The vote was 7-2, with only Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissenting.<br/>The general issue has been in the news in recent years because of cities\u2019 moves to keep conservative-owned businesses like Chick-fil-A from getting concessions in airports and similar facilities, or even in one case from obtaining routine permits. Last month a federal judge allowed the NRA to proceed with a lawsuit challenging a less extreme Los Angeles ordinance that requires city contractors to disclose (but not discontinue) their associations with the gun group. The judge ruled that in the context of the NRA\u2019s First Amendment claims, even commercial ties such as discount partnerships could be construed as \u201cexpression.\u201d<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0No, San Francisco. The NRA is not a \u2018domestic terrorist organization.\u2019<br/>By\u00a0Henry Olsen<br/>[The resolution] states that \u201cthe National Rifle Association through its advocacy has armed those individuals who would and have committed acts of terrorism.\u201d You can\u2019t get clearer than that: Constitutionally protected speech supporting the private ownership of guns is an act of terror\u2026<br/>Congratulations, average NRA member: Your $30 one-year membership makes you a terrorist.<br/>This is McCarthyism, pure and simple. Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy was rightly condemned for trying to stigmatize the American left in the 1950s by labeling it Communist and \u201cun-American.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s witch hunts destroyed the careers of many people whose only \u201ccrime\u201d was supporting a larger federal government and supporting a different foreign policy toward the Soviet Union. San Francisco\u2019s policy toward the NRA commits the same sin.<br/>This can only make our already toxic political atmosphere worse. Liberal democracy rests on the idea of the \u201cloyal opposition.\u201d In modern democracies, simply advocating a political position or a change in government is not, as so often was the case in the past, an act of treason. The First Amendment exists to provide citizens with a protected zone in which they can engage in heated political disagreement without fear of government suppression.<br/>The San Francisco resolution essentially declares that people who back the NRA cannot be a loyal opposition. It then seeks to reduce NRA support by saying that the city should try to \u201climit those entities who do business\u201d with the city \u201cfrom doing business with this domestic terrorist organization.\u201d That arguably sets the power of a government against a set of citizens solely on the basis of their politics. This is called \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d in First Amendment law and is unconstitutional.<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Justice for Scabby the Rat<br/>By\u00a0Mark Lasswell<br/>Peter B. Robb, who was appointed general counsel by President Trump in 2017 after a long career advocating for management in labor disputes, began issuing balloon-related memorandums and court filings with one thing in mind: rodenticide. He seemed intent on upending an Obama-era NLRB policy that treated Scabby\u2019s personal appearances as a protected form of speech \u2013 a view reflected in rulings by courts and previous NLRB boards since the balloon\u2019s debut three decades ago.<br/>In recent months, Robb\u2019s office has objected to inflatable rats outside supermarkets in Staten Island, N.Y., whose owner stoked the ire of a construction local that accused him of planning a new store in a shopping center built with non-union labor. Robb has also targeted the balloons near the entrance of a Philadelphia hotel that union electricians resented for using an electrical contractor that employed non-union workers.<br/>Scabby the Rat\u2019s inflatable pal, Fat Cat (which smokes a cigar and clutches a worker in its pillowy paw), prompted a memorandum from Robb\u2019s office in December. The balloon had been deployed near a Chicago construction site to decry a contractor\u2019s use of a non-union subcontractor at a different site.<br/>Robb\u2019s anti-rat-and-cat campaign is focused on that kind of \u201csecondary\u201d protest, when unions pursue a beef against a specific contractor by targeting neutral businesses that happen to employ the offending contractor. The magic word in the NLRB general counsel\u2019s paperwork is \u201ccoercive\u201d \u2013 the National Labor Relations Act blesses secondary protests as long as they don\u2019t force customers or businesses to behave in a way that the union would find more appealing\u2026<br/>Robb\u2019s efforts so far have been conducted in the realm of memos and lower-court skirmishes, but they could be a prelude to a formal NLRB ruling against Scabby, which would prompt a serious court fight over the First Amendment and labor rights.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supreme Court</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0The Supreme Court has become just another arm of the GOP<br/>By U.S. Senator\u00a0Sheldon Whitehouse<br/>From 2005 through the fall term of 2018, the Roberts court issued 73 5-to-4 partisan decisions benefiting big Republican donor interests\u2026<br/>The big-donor takeover of the federal courts begins, as reported by The Post, with a sprawling network of organizations funded by at least a quarter-billion dollars of largely anonymous money\u2026<br/>With its judges in place, the network lobbies the court with anonymously funded amicus briefs, signaling how the judges should vote\u2026<br/>My own calls for judicial reform have been for transparency around the dark money behind judicial nominations and amicus briefs; for improved ethics reporting and a court code of ethics; and for justices to follow principles they espouse at confirmation hearings such as respect for precedent, judicial modesty, deference to duly passed laws of Congress, letting fact-finders find the facts, and calling balls and strikes apolitically. None of that seems unreasonable.<br/>The right-wing eruption offered no defense of why a multimillion-dollar secret influence apparatus should be involved in selecting justices and campaigning for their confirmation and filing anonymous amicus briefs\u2026<br/>Instead, we saw precisely the howl of coordinated, multiple-mouthpiece misdirection you would expect to hear from big donors whose scheme to capture the Supreme Court for one team was suddenly exposed and is now at risk.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0We need our elections protected. A weakened FEC only invites attack.<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>[T]his is a precarious time for the commissioners to lack a quorum. The 2016 presidential election was undermined by interference from Russia, and the upcoming campaign seems equally vulnerable to mischief and meddling. Moreover, the need is greater than ever to police the torrents of cash flowing into campaign coffers, much of it in dark money from shady interest groups. The lack of a quorum at the FEC is an open invitation to those who want to skirt the law to gamble that they won\u2019t be caught until later, if at all.<br/>President Trump has repeatedly leveled the charge, of which there is no evidence, that there was massive voter fraud in 2016. If he were really interested in keeping U.S. elections clean and transparent, he would make a special effort to bring the FEC back up to speed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has long wanted to neuter the FEC. Both he and Mr. Trump have the power to fix it \u2013 and have not\u2026<br/>Meanwhile, all three current serving commissioners are holdovers first appointed in the presidency of George W. Bush. It looks as though politicians have done their best to weaken the FEC just as the nation heads into an election cycle. Whose interest does that serve?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>The Hill:\u00a0Nadler schedules vote on procedures for impeachment probe<br/>By\u00a0Olivia Beavers<br/>The head of the House Judiciary Committee announced Monday that the panel will vote this week to adopt procedures for hearings as it seeks to determine whether to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump.<br/>Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said the committee will vote Thursday on a resolution that would solidify several key policies\u2026<br/>The announcement comes as Nadler and his committee are quickly expanding their probe beyond former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report to include a series of new areas, including reports Trump dangled pardons to border and law enforcement officials, hush money payments made to women alleging affairs with the president and whether Trump profited from government spending as administration officials stayed at his family-owned properties during work trips.<br/>\u201cTrump\u2019s crimes and corruption extend beyond what is detailed in the Mueller report,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cThe President is in violation of the emoluments clauses of the Constitution as he works to enrich himself, putting the safety and security of our Nation at risk. He has dangled pardons, been involved in campaign finance violations and stonewalled Congress across the board, noting that he will defy all subpoenas.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Independent Groups</emphasis><br/>OZY:\u00a0Meet the Democrats\u2019 Most Dangerous Digital Strategist<br/>By\u00a0Nick Fouriezos<br/>Indeed, Acronym has taken hardly any time in breaking the strategy-firm ecosystem in the nation\u2019s capital. By the end of 2018, it had raised and managed more than $18 million, registered 60,000 voters, run 105 targeted ad campaigns in 15 states, helped elect 63 progressive candidates and won 61 percent of the races it invested in. Its staff has grown from five to 38 and it has quickly become one of the go-to digital organizing forces for everyone from Planned Parenthood and Emily\u2019s List to Everytown for Gun Safety and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2026<br/>While the numbers are impressive, what could upend Washington politics entirely is the structure of her organization. Unlike most digital strategists, her operation is what the IRS classifies as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit \u2013 meaning a majority of its funds must be used to promote \u201csocial welfare.\u201d And yet, Acronym has a web of for-profit companies beneath it: a campaign consulting firm (Lockwood Strategy), a political tech company with a peer-to-peer texting product (Shadow) and a media company investing in local left-leaning outlets (FWIW Media). In the works is an apparel arm (Rogue Swag) that would be the first major liberal answer to conservative companies that skirt campaign finance laws by selling politically branded clothing over Facebook and elsewhere \u2013 spreading political messaging without having to report the spending.<br/>It means the nonprofit Acronym is able to raise money, invest in for-profit companies to advance progressive aims and then return any profits back into its mission. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand why I am creating a model that I can\u2019t get very rich off of. Because I don\u2019t own the companies; the (c)(4) does,\u201d [Tara McGowan] says.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fundraising\u00a0</emphasis><br/>New York Times:\u00a0How Elizabeth Warren Raised Big Money Before She Denounced Big Money<br/>By\u00a0Shane Goldmacher<br/>[E]arly this year, Ms. Warren made a bold bet that would delight the left: She announced she was quitting this big-money circuit in the 2020 presidential primary, vowing not to attend private fund-raisers or dial up rich donors anymore. Admirers and activists praised her stand \u2013 but few noted the fact that she had built a financial cushion by pocketing big checks the years before.<br/>The open secret of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency. Last winter and spring, she transferred $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to underwrite her 2020 run, a portion of which was raised from the same donor class she is now running against.<br/>As Ms. Warren has risen in the polls on her populist and anti-corruption message, some donors and, privately, opponents are chafing at her campaign\u2019s purity claims of being \u201c100 percent grass-roots funded.\u201d Several donors now hosting events for her rivals organized fund-raisers for her last year.<br/>\u201cCan you spell hypocrite?\u201d said former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, who contributed $4,000 to Ms. Warren in 2018 and is now supporting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.<br/>Mr. Rendell said he had recruited donors to attend an intimate fund-raising dinner for Ms. Warren last year\u2026 He said he received a \u201cglowing thank-you letter\u201d from Ms. Warren afterward.<br/>But when Mr. Rendell co-hosted Mr. Biden\u2019s first fund-raiser this spring, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign sent brickbats, deriding the affair as \u201ca swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors,\u201d the likes of which she now shuns.<br/>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have any trouble taking our money the year before,\u201d Mr. Rendell said. \u201cAll of a sudden, we were bad guys and power brokers and influence-peddlers. In 2018, we were wonderful.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Forbes:\u00a0Russia Accuses Facebook And Google Of Illegal Election Interference<br/>By\u00a0Zak Doffman<br/>The \u201cfacts,\u201d the country\u2019s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says in its statement, point to \u201cthe distribution of political advertising on Google and Facebook at a time prohibited by Russian election law.\u201d\u2026<br/>These new allegations relate to the running of political ads on voting day-September 8, despite, the regulator says, warnings that such action would break the country\u2019s election laws. \u201cDuring the monitoring of mass media on voting day, on Google\u2019s search engine, on Facebook and on YouTube, political advertising was established.\u201d<br/>Roskomnadzor claims the actions of the U.S. giants \u201ccan be considered as interference in the sovereign affairs of Russia and obstructing the holding of democratic elections in the Russian Federation.\u201d\u2026<br/>According to Russian media, a member of Russia\u2019s Civic Chamber, Aleksandr Malkevich, claimed that Google \u201cdisplayed ads for the so-called \u2018Smart Voting\u2019 system promoted by opposition figure and video blogger Aleksey Navalny-these ads are said to have been shown to users searching for data on the local elections in Moscow.\u201d<br/>Meanwhile, Facebook allegedly \u201cblocked two posts that Moscow\u2019s Election Commission had tried putting up on its account-detailing how violations during the ongoing vote are being verified.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>New York Times:\u00a0Better Government for New York<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>New York this fall has the best chance in years to adopt a strong system of public financing. Done right, this new policy could increase competition and amplify the voices of small donors in elections. That is, if career politicians don\u2019t kill it first.<br/>Candidates who choose to participate in public financing programs receive a match in taxpayer dollars for donations they raise privately. New York City\u2019s public financing system, in place since 1988, has helped make elections far more competitive, by helping newcomers with fresh ideas run for office.<br/>In Albany, securing a public financing system for state elections has been harder, and proposals have languished. Advocates for public financing were hopeful when Democrats took control of the State Senate this year. But lawmakers demurred, largely over opposition in the Assembly. The state budget called for the establishment of a public financing system, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature left its details and fulfillment up to a nine-member commission.<br/>On Tuesday at 4 p.m., that commission is scheduled to hold the first of four public hearings at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in Lower Manhattan. Its final plan is due Dec. 1, and that plan will automatically become law unless the Legislature moves to block it within 20 days.<br/>USA Today:\u00a0Google targeted in antitrust inquiry by attorneys general in 48 states, DC and Puerto Rico<br/>By\u00a0Rachel Lerman, Associated Press<br/>A group of states led by Texas launched an investigation into Google to examine whether the Silicon Valley tech giant has gotten too big and effective at stomping or acquiring rivals.<br/>The inquiry is the latest blow against big tech companies as antitrust investigations ramp up in the USA and around the world. A separate group of states announced an investigation into Facebook\u2019s dominance Friday. The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress are also conducting inquiries\u2026<br/>The investigation, which is joined by 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, \u201cwill focus on Google\u2019s dominance in the telecommunications and search engine industries, as well as the potential harm caused to consumers and the economy from any anti-competitive conduct,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. James leads the states\u2019 investigation into Facebook.<br/>Colorado Springs Gazette:\u00a0Colorado Supreme Court rules in favor of Colorado Springs political committee\u2019s campaign finance action<br/>By\u00a0Marianne Goodland<br/>The Colorado Supreme Court on Monday overturned an appeals court decision on a campaign finance complaint filed against the Alliance for a Safe and Independent Woodmen Hills.<br/>The 2014 complaint was filed by Campaign Integrity Watchdog (CIW) and its director, Matt Arnold, the state\u2019s most prolific filer of campaign finance complaints\u2026<br/>The state Supreme Court\u2019s ruling Monday looked at the plain language of Amendment 27, the voter-approved campaign finance law passed in 2002. The high court ruled that since CIW had filed its motion in El Paso County more than a year after the administrative law judge\u2019s decision, the motion was outside the statute of limitations. The justices reinstated the requirement that CIW pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u2026<br/>\u201cThis particular horse was dead a very long time ago, but Mr. Arnold continues to beat it,\u201d said Ryan Call, former head of the Colorado GOP and the registered agent for the Alliance. \u201cIf chilling political speech and discouraging activity in connection with a small local district election was his goal, he certainly accomplished that. I stopped trying to figure out what motivates him, but I expect it\u2019s akin to why an arsonist sets fire to abandoned buildings.\u201d<br/>New York Law Journal:\u00a0Group Sues NY Campaign Finance Commission Over Freedom of Information Law Compliance<br/>By\u00a0Dan M. Clark<br/>A lawsuit filed Monday against a special commission created by the state Legislature in New York to develop a comprehensive public campaign finance system claimed the panel has not complied with the state\u2019s Freedom of Information Law since it was formed in July.<br/>The Government Justice Center was seeking, through the request, documents distributed at a recent meeting, and communications related to them.<br/>The group, which bills itself as a nonprofit organization that sponsors litigation against the state, claimed in the lawsuit that its FOIL requests sent to Jay Jacobs, a member of the panel and chair of the State Democratic Party, have not been fulfilled.<br/>In a seven-page petition filed Monday in Albany County Supreme Court, the Government Justice Center wrote that it had made the inquiry to Jacobs because the commission had yet to appoint someone to handle FOIL requests, as is required under law. Jacobs, according to the suit, responded that they were short-staffed but said the request would be fulfilled at some point.<br/>Part of the reason the Government Justice Center made the request, according to the complaint, was because it appeared that some members of the commission hadn\u2019t seen the documents, including an agenda, until the day of the meeting.<br/>Cameron Macdonald, the group\u2019s general counsel and executive director, said the lawsuit was filed to shine light on how the commission is operating.<br/>\u201cThe public has a right to know what the Commission is up to, especially since the members are not accountable to voters like our elected officials are,\u201d Macdonald said.<br/>Macdonald also criticized the commission\u2019s other open records practices, including that its initial meeting was livestreamed with poor quality on a mobile device.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 9/9 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-74641</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1C-TDK1-DY1R-B23D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4161\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>WASHINGTON SUPREME COURT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Smith<br/>The president's anger at a disloyal staffer who is vowing to frustrate his policies is understandable, and if his identity is learned, firing is an appropriate response. But the New York Times piece is not \"treason,\" it is not a national security issue to find this person, and the president should not be haranguing the New York Times about disclosing this author or others. It's that pesky First Amendment thing...</p><p><br/>No one thinks for a moment that the New York Times is going to \"turn over\" its anonymous diarist \"to government.\" But the Times is protecting its author because his or her \"job would be jeopardized by its disclosure.\" And the Times thought it important to publish these anonymous thoughts because it \"believe[s] publishing this essay anonymously is the only way to deliver an important perspective to our readers.\"<br/>Yet the New York Times has been a big supporter of ever more disclosure of the identities of persons who finance public debate. It has supported the so-closed \"DISCLOSE Act\" and regularly rails against \"dark money.\"<br/>Does it not occur to the Times that perhaps its anonymous writer ought also be able to contribute to candidates or organizations critical of President Trump without \"jeopardizing\" the anonymous writer's job? How about other people in similar situations? What about a Trump critic who happens to work for the Trump Organization? What about a corporate officer of a company with long-standing government contracts, or one that hopes to bid fairly in the future?<br/>Many people who will never be granted a platform as large as a New York Times op-ed face possible retaliation for their views, whether from government officials, employers, or the online mob. Yet the Times supports a crackdown on the decidedly less influential means of speaking that are available to them - contributions to like-minded candidates and causes.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Institute for Free Speech Welcomes Senior Attorney Parker Douglas to Legal Team<br/>The Institute for Free Speech (IFS) is pleased to welcome Parker Douglas to its legal team as a Senior Attorney. Parker's addition to the staff will enable IFS to expand its litigation efforts to protect the political rights to free speech, press, assembly, and petition guaranteed by the First Amendment.<br/>\"We are excited to add an attorney of Parker's stature and experience to our team. His background as a senior state official, federal public defender, and Supreme Court Fellow will add immeasurably to our capabilities,\" said Institute for Free Speech Legal Director Allen Dickerson.<br/>Prior to joining IFS, Parker was the 2017-2018 Supreme Court Fellow assigned to the Supreme Court of the United States, where he served in the Office of the Counselor to the Chief Justice. Previously, he served as Utah Federal Solicitor and Chief of Staff to Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes. Parker has also been an Assistant Federal Defender, practiced in the Supreme Court and Appellate section of Latham &amp; Watkins's Washington, D.C. office, and taught law at the University of Utah, S.J. Quinney School of Law.<br/>\"I'm very pleased to join the Institute for Free Speech as a Senior Attorney. I've admired the Institute's work for a long time, as they have become our nation's bellwether for political speech protection and advocacy. I am excited about the work we will do together and look forward to assisting them in their endeavors to protect our precious first freedom,\" said Parker.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Event</emphasis><br/>Cato:\u00a0Can Free Speech Be Progressive?<br/>Featuring\u00a0Louis Michael Seidman, Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Constitutional Law, Georgetown University Law Center;\u00a0Robert F. Bauer, Professor of Practice and Distinguished Scholar in Residence, New York University School of Law; and\u00a0Ronald K. L. Collins, Harold S. Shefelman Scholar, University of Washington School of Law; moderated by\u00a0John Samples, Vice President, Cato Institute. <br/>For much of the 21st century, those who identified themselves as left of center were the strongest proponents of freedom of speech. They believed in the principle, and they thought that free speech benefited civil rights and labor activists-not to mention radicals seeking fundamental change. Conservatives, they thought, would always oppose free speech because of its threat to the status quo. Beginning in the late 1960s, some spoke of free speech as \"repressive tolerance\" that precluded radical changes. Later, as courts connected free speech to campaign finance, some on the left argued that the First Amendment served corporate interests, not emancipation of the oppressed. Professor Michael Seidman has renewed this debate with a provocative paper denying that free speech in the American context can be progressive. Please join us for an intriguing debate about the future of free speech, a debate that matters for everyone at all points on the political spectrum.<br/>Date:\u00a0September 11, 2018<br/>Time:\u00a012:00PM\u00a0to\u00a01:30PM\u00a0EDT<br/>Location: Cato Institute<br/>Register here<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anonymous Speech</emphasis><br/>USA Today:\u00a0The New York Times op-ed writer wants us to put our trust in a 'shadow presidency'<br/>By\u00a0Karen Hobert Flynn<br/>Americans have a right to know what is happening within our government. When a senior White House official sounds an alarm, we should listen, even if The New York Times author believes anonymity is the only option.<br/>It highlights the importance of the First Amendment protection of the free press and shield laws that protect anonymous sources as essential tools for news outlets to pursue investigative reporting the public relies on. Until the Trump campaign began its frequent attacks on journalists, corporate consolidation was the biggest threat to the free and independent news media.<br/>The anonymous op-ed reportedly infuriated the president, whose Cabinet and staff are now consumed by proving loyalty, denying authorship, and finding the true identity of \"anonymous.\" The president has even asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Justice Department to uncover the author's identity.<br/>Those protections for anonymous sources and laws protecting whistleblowers are often the only reason the public learns about fraud or abuse, because the people with the evidence feel safe coming forward so we can all know the truth.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Bloomberg:\u00a0Trump Executives Face U.S. Campaign-Finance Probe, Source Says<br/>By\u00a0Greg Farrell and Christian Berthelsen<br/>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether anyone in the Trump Organization violated campaign-finance laws, in a follow-up to their conviction last month of Michael Cohen, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br/>The inquiry, not previously reported, shows that the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office doesn't intend to stand down following the guilty plea from Trump's longtime personal lawyer...<br/>Central to the inquiry will be longtime Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, who has already provided narrow cooperation with authorities over Cohen's activities and hush agreements, according to the person...<br/>Last month, prosecutors said in indicting Cohen that two Trump company executives - one of whom is believed to be Weisselberg - approved the improper payments to Cohen in violation of campaign-finance laws. Investigators are looking at those people and others who may have been aware of the activities, according to the person...<br/>In January 2017, Cohen sought reimbursement for $130,000 that he had paid Clifford. He submitted an invoice from his consulting firm to Trump's company for that amount and $50,000 for \"tech services\" related to the campaign.<br/>The $50,000 payment for campaign-related services appears to violate campaign finance rules, though Cohen's guilty plea was limited to the two women's payments. Prosecutors and FBI agents need to determine if the Trump real estate companies or his trust made campaign-related payments without disclosing them properly to election officials.<br/>In announcing Cohen's guilty plea last month outside of federal court in Manhattan, Deputy U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami said \"we will not fear prosecuting additional campaign finance cases.\"<br/>Los Angeles Times:\u00a0Trump waives millions in claims against Stormy Daniels in new fallout from illegal payoff<br/>By\u00a0Michael Finnegan<br/>President Trump has agreed to give up his right to pursue millions of dollars in damages against Stormy Daniels in a move to kill litigation over an illegal payoff to the adult-film star.<br/>The maneuver marks a sharp reversal for Trump. His legal team sought earlier to pull Daniels into an arbitration that could have forced her to pay the president more than $20 million for breaking a nondisclosure agreement over her claim of a sexual liaison with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the affair.<br/>The switch in tactics, disclosed late Saturday by a Trump attorney, highlights the legal trouble faced by the president and his private business, the Trump Organization, as federal prosecutors continue to investigate the $130,000 in hush money that Daniels received 12 days before the November 2016 election.<br/>Michael Cohen, who was executive vice president of the Trump Organization when he orchestrated the deal, told a federal judge last month that Trump directed him to make the payoff in an attempt to influence the election. Cohen also agreed Friday to give up any right to damages against Daniels under the nondisclosure agreement...<br/>Lawyers for Trump, Cohen and Daniels are set to gather Sept. 24 for a hearing on the case before District Judge S. James Otero in Los Angeles federal court.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Google Case Asks: Can Europe Export Privacy Rules World-Wide?<br/>By\u00a0Sam Schechner and Jacob Gershman<br/>Google on Tuesday will appeal an order to extend the European Union's \"right to be forgotten\" to its search engines across the globe, arguing before the EU's top court that the order encourages countries to assert sovereignty beyond their borders.<br/>National laws used to stop at the border. In cyberspace, they increasingly stretch around the world, as regulators in Europe, the U.S. and Canada have started asserting legal authority over the internet across country lines.<br/>That is thrusting global tech firms like Google, Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. into a potentially costly legal morass, and setting the stage for conflict over who will-or should-regulate everything from free speech and privacy to cybercrime and taxes.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Texas Tribune:\u00a0Ted Cruz campaign criticizes Beto O'Rourke for co-hosting fundraiser with PAC<br/>By\u00a0Abby Livingston and Patrick Svitek<br/>The campaign of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz tore into U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke on Friday afternoon, accusing his Democratic challenger of \"hypocrisy\" for \"accepting support from a political action committee at a Washington, D.C. fundraiser, even though he campaigns in Texas against taking any support from political action committees,\" per a Cruz news release.<br/>At issue is a fundraiser Thursday in Washington, D.C. that was co-hosted by both the O'Rourke campaign and a political action committee... The PAC in question is End Citizens United...<br/>O'Rourke spokesman Chris Evans defended the event as in keeping with the candidate's principles in a statement earlier this week to the Tribune.<br/>\"Thursday's grassroots event is entirely our event - we are hosting it just like we have done with Beers With Beto events across Texas,\" Evans wrote. \"We pay all the bills and each attendee has gotten a ticket through our campaign as an individual contribution.\" ...<br/>Over the summer, the Cruz campaign hammered O'Rourke for accepting bundled contributions from J-Street, a PAC that supports a two-state solution to the conflict in Israel. J-Street has also hosted O'Rourke at fundraising events...<br/>\"There's no legal standard for what constitutes accepting help from a PAC ... so we're automatically in the realm of opinion,\" said Paul S. Ryan, vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause. \"On the one hand, you have a guy who is holding up his promise [to not accept PAC money], but I certainly consider the receipt of contributions bundled by a PAC to be accepting help from a PAC. It's not the same thing as accepting PAC money, but yeah, it's accepting help from a PAC.\"<br/>\"Cruz's criticism is technically correct in that the PAC gave some help to O'Rourke, but all they did was pass along contributions,\" added Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at Akerman LLP. \"They didn't give PAC money.\"<br/>Washington Examiner:\u00a0When a foreign adversary meddled in a presidential election<br/>By Byron York<br/>In the 1990s, a hostile foreign power meddled in our presidential election. There were serious questions about whether one party's candidate - the beneficiary - was complicit in the meddling, or at least looked the other way while it was going on. The candidate fiercely resisted the appointment of a special prosecutor, then known as an independent counsel, to investigate. Finally, amid only moderate media interest and public concern, it all faded away.<br/>The country doing the meddling, of course, was China, and the presidential candidate was Bill Clinton, who was already in the White House and seeking re-election in 1996.<br/>Looking back on press accounts from the era, it's striking how brazen a number of the players were as they went about the task of funneling illegal foreign donations to the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee...<br/>The scandal was news at the time; indeed, some print outlets, like the Los Angeles Times, led the way in uncovering it. The story received far less coverage on television, where several news outlets appeared distinctly uninterested. Overall, it would probably be fair to call the coverage moderate-to-restrained.<br/>The rhetoric was restrained, too. To use one measure, it did not lead to widespread use of the word \"treason\" in the public discussion of President Clinton.<br/>There is simply no comparison between the political conversation about the Clinton foreign influence scandal in the 1990s and today's conversation about the Trump-Russia affair. Of course, the circumstances and facts are different, but it seems reasonable to say that for whatever reason, Washington is far more upset about Russia's attempt to influence the election in 2016 than it was about China's attempt to do the same 20 years earlier.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donors</emphasis><br/>New York Times:\u00a0Thoughts for Very Wealthy Political Donors<br/>By\u00a0Bret Stephens<br/>So why is party-line voting on the rise? One big reason is misguided campaign-finance \"reform\" that steers political money away from parties - whose aims are to find and finance candidates who can win office, irrespective of ideology - and toward issue-advocacy groups and Super PACs that demand ideological purity in exchange for support.<br/>But another big reason is, well, you. The interesting finding from the Sunlight Foundation analysis is that big-money donors are hyper-partisans in their giving, even if they are more moderate in their general political outlook. Only a small fraction of you ever split your money between the parties; mostly, your contributions are either all-red or all-blue...<br/>There's an alternative. Split more of your money between the parties. Fund candidates with proven or potential cross-party appeal. Help out politicians with scores below 100 percent from the N.R.A. or the Sierra Club. Set up a PAC - call it SanePAC or NotNutsPAC - to help candidates facing primary challenges from the further-right or further-left. Expand the reach of purple America at the expense of deep red or deep blue.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0States Loom as a Regulatory Threat to Tech Giants<br/>By\u00a0John D. McKinnon and Douglas MacMillan<br/>State officials are raising risks for companies such as Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google as the states begin piecing together a coordinated legal strategy for confronting the firms over alleged antitrust violations and data-privacy abuses, and over what some Republicans say is a suppression of conservative speech.<br/>Tensions have been simmering for months, but they surfaced publicly last week when the Justice Department said U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions would meet with several state attorneys general later this month to discuss a \"growing concern\" that the companies are hurting competition and \"stifling the free exchange of ideas\" on their platforms...<br/>The tech companies adamantly deny they have sought to suppress conservative content on the internet. And even some big tech critics say they hope the legal concerns about the social-media platforms aren't being weaponized for political gain.<br/>\"We obviously think there are competition problems,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a think tank that has criticized the internet platforms. But the current focus on the treatment of conservative viewpoints could suggest \"an attempt to use legitimate concerns to organize legal power for one party and point of view, and that's dangerous,\" he added.<br/>Experts have raised a range of doubts over whether an antitrust probe into the platforms could fly. Those include the federal immunity law that has frustrated many state investigations into the internet platforms' practices. Some believe, however, the allegations of free-speech suppression could help undermine the platforms' immunity claims.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-35525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NEW YORK GIANTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODdEMDhDREQzOEQ2NDE2RkE2Njk3RTNEMUM0NTE3MEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkU5NzdDMzI5QTcxNDQ5QTg3NDAwNjNGM0MwMTgxNEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Scope</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFFNzEwMUYzNEU3NDdGRTg4RUM2OUM0ODI1ODg2QjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Knight First Amendment Institute<br/>20-197<br/>Issue: Whether the First Amendment deprives a government official of his right to control his personal Twitter account by blocking third-party accounts if he uses that personal account in part to announce official actions and policies.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC</emphasis><br/>The Verge: Trump eyes social media bias hawk as next FCC commissioner<br/>By Makena Kelly<br/>The Trump administration is considering an unconventional pick for the next FCC commissioner, a senior adviser at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) who has played a significant role in the agency\u2019s social media regulation agenda\u2026<br/>Three sources close to the matter say Nathan Simington, a senior advisor at the NTIA within the commerce department, has emerged as a leading candidate to take over Republican Commissioner Mike O\u2019Rielly\u2019s seat at the FCC.<br/>Simington is said to have helped draft the administration\u2019s social media executive order, and his nomination would be a victory for Republicans who want to see the FCC take a larger role in regulating social networks.<br/>Simington would be a significant break from O\u2019Rielly, who had expressed concerns that Trump\u2019s anti-bias efforts could violate constitutional law. \u201cAs a conservative, I\u2019m troubled voices are stifled by liberal tech leaders,\u201d he\u00a0wrote on Twitter\u00a0in May, in response to news of Trump\u2019s looming executive order. \u201cAt same time, I\u2019m extremely dedicated to First Amendment which governs much here.\u201d<br/>In August, Trump abruptly withdrew O\u2019Rielly\u2019s nomination after the commissioner gave a speech opposing making changes to Section 230.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal: Google and Twitter Sharpen Tools to Stop False Claims About Election<br/>By Emily Glazer and Kirsten Grind<br/>Google and\u00a0Twitter\u00a0Inc. said they are taking additional steps to tamp down misinformation about the U.S. election, as tech platforms scramble to address an expected flood of false claims and misleading posts ahead of the November vote.<br/>In separate announcements on Thursday, Twitter said it plans to more aggressively label or remove election-related tweets that include disputed or misleading information, while Google said\u00a0it would screen more auto-complete suggestions to avoid voters being misled\u2026<br/>The changes could affect tweets claiming victory before election results have been certified; posting unverified information about ballot tampering or other matters that could undermine confidence; or including false or misleading information that causes confusion about laws, regulations, officials or institutions related to elections\u2026<br/>In its changes to auto-complete results, which predict what users are searching for, Google will remove predictions \u201cthat could be interpreted as claims for or against any candidate or political party,\u201d the company said in a blog post. It also said it would screen out statements about voting methods and requirements, so predictions such as \u201cyou can vote by phone\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t vote by phone\u201d won\u2019t be produced in auto-complete. Users will still be able to search for those topics on their own.<br/>Washington Times: Liberals organize new push for social media crackdown before Election Day<br/>By Ryan Lovelace<br/>A former campaign staffer for Hillary Clinton blaming Big Tech for President Trump\u2019s rise to power has formed a new group pressuring Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies to help dethrone him online in the run-up to the November elections.<br/>The group, Accountable Tech, has demanded sweeping changes at Big Tech companies for the final weeks of the presidential campaign. It wants social media companies to certify \u201cPlatform Poll Watchers\u201d to police content and is urging Twitter and Facebook to shut off algorithms that show trending topics and other information currently viewed by users.<br/>Former Clinton campaign foreign affairs spokesperson Jesse Lehrich, who garnered attention during the 2016 campaign for telling Mr. Trump to \u201cgo f- yourself,\u201d has enlisted former Facebook engineer Sahar Massachi, former Democratic Federal Election Commission chairwoman Ann Ravel, and a Mozilla vice president, Ashley Boyd, to push for a Big Tech overhaul.<br/>\u201cUltimately, we need Congress to set clear laws to promote a healthier environment for online political information \u2013 but that is not going to happen in the next two months,\u201d Ms. Ravel said in a statement. \u201cIn the meantime, social media companies themselves must act responsibly and forcefully to ensure the outcome of the election is not determined by the spread of misinformation.\u201d<br/>Accountable Tech\u2019s \u201c\u201cElection Integrity Roadmap for Social Media Platforms\u201d,\u201d released Thursday, includes specific objectives the liberals want followed before the election.<br/>Bloomberg: Facebook Has a New Plan to Fight Climate Misinformation<br/>By Sarah Frier<br/>Facebook has recently re-evaluated its approach to climate misinformation, according to spokesman Andy Stone. The company is working on a climate information center, which will display information from scientific sources. Stone said Facebook isn\u2019t ready to officially announce anything, but it\u2019s easy to imagine what this might look like. Facebook has already devised centers for factual information about Covid-19, and about voting and the upcoming election, both of which it has promoted heavily on its site.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Washington Examiner: Outraged Trump demands Biden, Twitter, Facebook pull down troop ad<br/>By Paul Bedard<br/>President Trump, still fuming over much-disputed allegations in an Atlantic article that he disparaged military troops, is demanding that a Biden campaign ad promoting the story be banned on Twitter and Facebook\u2026<br/>Citing a double standard by Twitter and Facebook, the legal counsel for the Trump-Pence campaign called for a \u201ccease and desist\u201d on the digital ad.<br/>Directed to the Biden campaign, but also Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Jenna Ellis wrote, \u201cOn behalf of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., President Trump\u2019s principal campaign committee, this letter notifies you that Biden for President (the \u201cBiden Campaign\u201d) produced and caused to be posted on Joe Biden\u2019s Twitter feed a digital ad that contains intentionally false and misleading statements that cannot be verified when it alleges that President Trump made derogatory comments towards fallen American military heroes.\u201d \u2026<br/>\u201cBoth Twitter and Facebook have used their policies to remove or flag tweets and postings by President Trump. Now, Twitter and Facebook \u2014 if they are truly trying to be fair arbiters of factually accurate statements \u2014 will be obligated to remove your False and Misleading Ad, which is based solely on cites to anonymous sources,\u201d said Ellis.<br/>Politico: \u2018So much noise\u2019: Brawl over 2020 intel leaves voters in the dark<br/>By Kyle Cheney, Natasha Bertrand, and Andrew Desiderio<br/>For months, Americans have been served conflicting pronouncements from the Trump administration and lawmakers about foreign efforts to interfere in the 2020 presidential election \u2013 complicating matters for voters seeking a reliable understanding of which countries are actively meddling, and on whose behalf\u2026<br/>On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) released a\u00a0whistleblower complaint\u00a0from a top Homeland Security official that bolstered Democrats\u2019 case that the administration is downplaying Russia\u2019s 2020 activity: Senior Trump appointees had for years sought to censor and suppress evidence of the Kremlin\u2019s malign activities in the United States, said the official, Brian Murphy\u2026<br/>On Thursday, Microsoft announced that Russian government hackers had targeted at least 200 organizations tied to the 2020 presidential election in recent weeks, including SKDKnickerbocker, one of Biden\u2019s chief communications and strategy firms. The target of that attack appeared to be Anita Dunn, the firm\u2019s managing director and a senior Biden campaign adviser, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br/>Russia-linked actors have also pushed narratives about Biden being in cognitive decline and abusing his prior position to advance personal interests.<br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Russian Hackers Have Targeted 200 Groups Tied to U.S. Election, Microsoft Says<br/>By Dustin Volz<br/>Russian government hackers have targeted at least 200 organizations tied to the 2020 U.S. election in recent weeks, including national and state political parties and political consultants working for both Republicans and Democrats, according to\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0Corp.<br/>China has also engaged in cyberattacks against \u201chigh-profile individuals\u201d linked to Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, while Iranian actors have continued targeting personal accounts of people associated with President Trump\u2019s campaign,\u00a0Microsoft said in a blog post published Thursday\u2026<br/>Most of the attempted intrusions haven\u2019t been successful, and those who were targeted or compromised have been directly notified of the malicious activity\u2026<br/>The Russian actor tracked by Microsoft is affiliated with a military intelligence unit and is the same group that hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential contest. In addition to political consultants and state and national parties, its recent targets have included advocacy organizations and think tanks, such as the German Marshall Fund, as well as political parties in the U.K., Microsoft said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>MIT Technology Review: Brazil\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d bill won\u2019t solve its misinformation problem<br/>By Raphael Tsavkko Garcia<br/>Brazil is grappling with a crisis of misinformation\u2026<br/>But the \u201cfake news\u201d bill (officially the Brazilian Law on Freedom, Responsibility and Transparency on the Internet) is, in my view, the worst possible way to combat the problem. It could be one of the most restrictive internet laws in the world\u2026<br/>Why wouldn\u2019t the bill achieve its intended aim? To start, it is vague on the matter of what\u2019s considered fake news, which it describes as false or deceptive content shared with the potential to cause individual or collective harm. This ambiguity leaves it to the state to decide what kind of content is considered false or potentially harmful, and could allow those in power to manipulate the definition for political gain\u2026<br/>Perhaps the worst thing about the bill, though, is that it reverses one of the greatest advances brought about by the\u00a0Marco Civil. According to that law, platforms are not responsible for content posted by users and must remove such content only if a court order specifies what crime or illegal act was committed. In contrast, the new bill makes social platforms responsible for everything published on them. This will lead them to aggressively remove content that might displease the government, and they will police users for improper posts.<br/>Real Clear Foundation: An Open Letter to Our Fellow American Citizens<br/>We stand at the crossroads.<br/>Over the next several years, the noble sentiments and ideas that gave birth to the United States will either be repudiated or reaffirmed. The fateful choice before us will result either in the death of a grand hope or a recommitment to an extraordinary political experiment whose full flowering we have yet to realize\u2026<br/>In the name of justice and equality, those animated by contempt and despair seek to destroy longstanding but fragile American institutions through which justice and equality can be secured\u2026<br/>In the face of this threat, the American institutions we must now reaffirm are these:<br/>-Free speech.\u00a0Too many of our media outlets have become shameful caricatures intent on purveying one-sided narratives rather than on wrestling with difficult issues about which reasonable citizens will disagree. They inflame rather than inform. They contort public debate rather than contribute to it. Rather than defend freedom of speech and association, they have become instruments of a despicable \u201ccancel culture,\u201d bereft of forgiveness and intolerant of opposing views\u2026<br/>-Federalism.\u00a0Our country is diverse. We cannot produce a unity amidst diversity by forcing all citizens to fit the singular mold that politically correct speech imposes. A diverse polity can exist only within the framework of federalism, which allows true pluralism to thrive.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Courthouse News: Texas State Bar Defies Attorney General on Anti-Bias Rule<br/>By David Lee<br/>The State Bar of Texas refused Thursday to kill consideration of an anti-bias rule by the American Bar Association, ignoring repeated warnings by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton that the rule is vague and infringes attorneys\u2019 free speech and religious rights.<br/>The State Bar\u2019s board of directors approved referring the\u00a0Model Rule 8.4(g)\u00a0to an internal committee for further review after seven hours of public debate and closed session discussions during a virtual meeting on Zoom\u2026<br/>The rule deems it professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is harassment or discrimination on the basis of \u2026 sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, or socioeconomic status in conduct\u201d relating to practicing law\u2026<br/>Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, also urged the board to not adopt the model rule and \u201crubber stamp\u201d an ABA proposal that he says burdens free speech.<br/>\u201cI appreciate the bar\u2019s desire to promote racial and other types of equality, but moving forward with 8.4(g) would fail to achieve those goals,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cIt would be challenged immediately in court. I suspect the same plaintiffs who challenged the integrated bar will line up for an encore suit. And the Texas attorney general, who ruled the proposal unconstitutional, has hinted he will file suit as well.\u201d\u00a0<br/>Common Dreams: \u2018What a Healthy Democracy Should Look Like\u2019: Connecticut Small-Dollar Campaign Program a Model for Restoring Power to the People<br/>By Lisa Newcomb<br/>Connecticut\u2019s statewide small-dollar donor program has resulted in more competitive races, allowed new voices to get elected, and led to better government policies, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0released Thursday by advocacy group Common Cause.<br/>\u201cThe small-dollar donor experiment in Connecticut is working and the state has become a national model,\u201d Beth Rotman, national director of money in politics and ethics for Common Cause and author of the report,\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement\u2026<br/>The Citizens\u2019 Election Program (CEP), enacted in 2008, is a voluntary program in which candidates for statewide and state legislative offices must agree to fundraising and spending restrictions and demonstrate public support by raising between $5,000 and $250,000-depending on the office sought-from small-dollar donors. Those contributions can be between $5 and $100 each. Once those conditions are met, candidates receive grant money from the program, which is funded primarily from the sale of abandoned property in the state\u2019s custody.<br/>Register-Herald: W.Va. expected to see nation\u2019s strongest campaign finance reform bill in January<br/>By Jessica Farrish<br/>The bill, which a group of West Virginia legislators are expected to introduce in Charleston in January, aims to break the \u201ccycle of legalized corruption\u201d in U.S. government that was identified in a 2014 study by researchers from Princeton University and Northwestern University, which found that from 2009 to 2014,\u00a0the 200 most politically active companies in the U.S. spent $5.8 billion influencing the government with lobbying and campaign contributions.<br/>Those same companies got $4.4 trillion in taxpayer support \u2013 earning a return of 750 times their investment, the study found\u2026<br/>Under\u00a0the \u201cWest Virginia Can\u2019t Wait to End the Buying of Elections\u201d plan, lobbyists would be charged a fee. The fee would fund public elections in all state races, and out-of-state lobbyists would pay the \u201clion\u2019s share.\u201d<br/>The plan caps self-funding by all candidates at $1,000 and requires all candidates and lawmakers to submit income tax filings and to post their donor lists publicly in\u00a0their offices and on legislature websites\u2026<br/>The plan also calls for a lifetime ban on lobbyists becoming legislators. And it would make it illegal for a legislator to serve as a lobbyist.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 9/11 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-113241</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TN-4031-DY1R-B3H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2702\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS &amp;

Among the most troubling is a law regulating online speech passed by the Maryland General Assembly last year. Rather than targeting foreign meddlers, the law makes it harder for Americans to use the Internet to speak about government, call out corruption, and organize with their fellow citizens.</p><p><br/>The law is currently being challenged by a coalition of press organizations, including The Washington Post, The Baltimore Sun, and other local Maryland newspapers. They argue that it violates their First Amendment rights by forcing them to collect and publish information about their advertisers. Now before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the case, The Washington Post v. McManus, could be a crucial landmark for the First Amendment\u2019s protections of a free press and free speech online.<br/>The Institute for Free Speech (IFS) filed an amicus brief urging the Fourth Circuit to declare the law unconstitutional. The brief states that, despite the veneer of an election security measure, Maryland\u2019s \u201claw will do little to advance that cause while chilling political speech and association at the core of the First Amendment\u2019s protections.\u201d<br/>\u201cIndeed, Maryland\u2019s law requires press entities and Internet advertisers to amass vast amounts of information \u2013 every buyer of advertisements and their underlying donors \u2013 in order to possibly find a Russian spy posing as an American,\u201d the brief notes.<br/>IFS asked the Fourth Circuit to affirm a lower court\u2019s injunction barring Maryland from enforcing the law against online publishers.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy</emphasis><br/>Wiley Rein\u00a0Election\u00a0Law\u00a0News:\u00a0The First Amendment Right to Political Privacy, Chapter 6 \u2013 Campaign Finance and Other Very Public Exceptions to Privacy<br/>By\u00a0Lee E. Goodman<br/>Previous chapters have traced the origin and development since the 1940s of the First Amendment right to privacy in the political sphere. That right manifested as the right to associate, speak, and access information for political purposes free from government compelled exposure.<br/>Over the same period of time, the U.S. Supreme Court was grappling with discrete realms of government-compelled exposure and carving exceptions to the constitutional protection. The exceptions were drawn narrowly upon the Court\u2019s findings that \u201csubstantial\u201d government objectives outweighed the constitutional right under one form or another of constitutional scrutiny. The most prominent exceptions were compelled disclosure of financial contributions to direct lobbying of members of Congress and contributions to candidates\u2019 campaigns. This chapter summarizes the jurisprudence of exceptions to the right of political privacy.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Gizmodo:\u00a0With Senate Inquiry Looming, Facebook Scrambles to Look Busy<br/>By\u00a0Bryan Menegus<br/>\u201cThere\u2019s been a general feeling from the platform companies of kind of playing rope-a-dope with the Congress,\u201d Senator Ed Markey\u00a0told\u00a0a small audience gathered in the Federal Election Commission\u2019s headquarters around 9am [yestereday] morning. Four hours later, Markey\u2019s well-informed inference was proven true yet again when Facebook trotted out a new blog post titled \u201cCombating Hate and Extremism,\u201d<br/>It\u2019s surely no coincidence the image-troubled social giant is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0on Wednesday morning-along with representatives from Twitter and Google-to testify at the grimly titled hearing \u201cMass Violence, Extremism, and Digital Responsibility\u201d before the Senate\u2019s Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee (of which Markey is a member.)\u2026<br/>In an apparent attempt to further rebut likely questions over the platform\u2019s lack of action tomorrow, Facebook also updated its \u201cDangerous Individuals and Organizations\u201d policy, specifically its definition of terrorists\u2026<br/>Markey\u2026concluded his remarks by telling platform companies that \u201cat the end of the day frankly I think that\u2019s going to be a huge business mistake-because we\u2019re not going away.\u201d He added, \u201cwe are, candidly, one significant event away [\u2026] from potentially Congress overreacting, because the next event could really be extraordinarily dramatic.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0The Technology 202: Snap launches political ads library<br/>By\u00a0Cat Zakrzewski<br/>Snap told me it has launched a political ad library in recent days that will list all political and advocacy ads on its platform; so far, the library includes more than 1,000 ads purchased in 2019 promoting President Trump, and 2020 rivals former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) The database also includes third-party ads touching on hot-button issues, including ads from Planned Parenthood and even ads about criminal justice restructuring from the ice cream company Ben and Jerry\u2019s\u2026<br/>Snap said it didn\u2019t find evidence that Russian actors bought ads on its platform after an internal audit following the 2016 election so it hasn\u2019t confronted the same political blowback in Washington as larger platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google, which have previously rolled out similar databases.<br/>But it highlights a growing awareness that smaller social media companies are targets of malign influence operations, and need to be regulated like everyone else when it comes to political activity, according to lawmakers\u2026<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s commendable that more companies are increasing transparency when it comes to political advertising; however, a patchwork of voluntary measures from tech companies isn\u2019t sufficient \u2013 we need to pass the Honest Ads Act,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told me.<br/>\u201cThe goal of my legislation is to ensure that all major platforms that sell political advertisements are held to the same rules of the road, something that is already required for television, radio and print political advertising. Americans have a right to know who is paying to influence them regardless of where ads are sold.\u201d\u2026<br/>\u201cUnder the Honest Ads Act, the threshold is a site having at least 50 million monthly active users and, to the extent Reddit sells political ads, it should follow the lead of other large platforms and establish a political ad library,\u201d [Sen. Mark]\u00a0Warner told me.\u00a0<br/>Cato:\u00a0A First Look at Facebook\u2019s Oversight Board<br/>By\u00a0John Samples<br/>Today Facebook released a Charter for its Oversight Board. This institution may well face insuperable difficulties and come to nothing. But it is possible, perhaps likely, that the Facebook board will significantly influence the future of speech on the internet. The charter announced today offers a kind of constitution for the Oversight Board. What does the Charter mean for free expression?<br/>First, some context. Facebook maintains Community Standards that users agree to abide by when joining the platform. Facebook censures or removes users who violate those standards. Such \u201ccontent moderation\u201d goes back almost to the founding of Facebook. Facebook may suppress speech in this way because the First Amendment does not apply to privately-owned forums like social media.<br/>Facebook officials often say content moderation involves a tradeoff or as the Charter notes, \u201cFree expression is paramount, but there are times when speech can be at odds with authenticity, safety, privacy, and dignity.\u201d This statement is both ominous and reassuring. It suggests ominously that free expression will frequently give way to other values. It is reassuring because free expression is \u201cparamount\u201d which means \u201cmore important than anything else.\u201d\u2026<br/>The Facebook Board\u2019s impact on free speech will be determined over time, decision by concrete decision. Free expression could have been treated as just another competing value in this Charter and related documents. It is more than that. Free expression is paramount. Now will the Facebook Board live up to its Charter?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Political Parties</emphasis><br/>New York Times:\u00a0The Changing Shape of the Parties Is Changing Where They Get Their Money<br/>By\u00a0Thomas B. Edsall<br/>A pair of major developments give us a hint about how future trends will develop on the partisan battleground.<br/>First: Heading into the 2020 election, President Trump is on track to far surpass President Barack Obama\u2019s record in collecting small donor contributions \u2013 those under $200 \u2013 lending weight to his claim of populist legitimacy.<br/>Second: Democratic candidates and their party committees are making inroads in gathering contributions from the wealthiest of the wealthy, the Forbes 400, a once solid Republican constituency. Democrats are also pulling ahead in contributions from highly educated professionals \u2013 doctors, lawyers, tech executives, software engineers, architects, scientists, teachers and so on\u2026<br/>In their paper, \u201cIncreasing Inequality in Wealth and the Political Expenditures of Billionaires,\u201d Adam Bonica and Howard Rosenthal, political scientists at Stanford and N.Y.U., track the partisan contribution patterns of the Forbes 400 from the 1981-82 election cycle through the 2011-12 cycle.<br/>For that three-decade period, the level of giving to Republicans and Republican Party committees by members of the Forbes 400 followed a steady downward trajectory\u2026<br/>\u201cThe 400 have trended steadily to the left,\u201d conclude Bonica and Rosenthal\u2026<br/>Raymond J. La Raja, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, also emailed me:<br/>It is not too surprising that Trump has outpaced others, even Obama, in raising money from small donors. Individual donors \u2013 big and small \u2013 tend to be much more polarized compared to the rest of the electorate. They give because of strong ideological preferences and passions. People like Trump ignite those passions.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Bloomberg Government:\u00a0Social Media Giants Warned \u2018Wild West\u2019 Era on Rules Is Over<br/>By\u00a0Kenneth P. Doyle<br/>Major internet platforms are overdue for regulation, including possible removal of liability protections Congress put in place in the 1990s, warned a lawmaker crafting legislation to rein in social media giants.<br/>\u201cThe Wild West is over,\u201d Mark Warner (D-Va.) said in a keynote address at a conference at the Federal Election Commission on how to fight digital disinformation.<br/>Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Twitter Inc. and Microsoft Corp. sent representatives to the forum organized by FEC Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub\u2026<br/>On the liability issue, Warner was referring to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104) which protects online platforms from being sued for content issues.<br/>The senator, who\u2019s the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has called for legislation (S. 1356) to disclose funding of online political ads and another proposal to require campaigns to report any offers of foreign help\u2026<br/>Weintraub (D) has been using her position as a bully pulpit to press the need for cybersecurity safeguards, particularly now that the panel lacks a quorum needed to write regulations or take enforcement action\u2026<br/>Russia violated campaign finance laws by secretly spending millions of dollars to influence the 2016 election, but the nation\u2019s campaign finance agency can\u2019t counter such efforts alone, Weintraub said in introductory comments.<br/>Weintraub said she was hosting the event as an individual commissioner and that it wasn\u2019t an official hearing.<br/>Commissioner Caroline Hunter (R) attended the event but didn\u2019t speak. She said in an email that she was \u201cheartened that several participants cautioned against trampling on First Amendment rights and warned of government overreach \u2013 an approach I have taken at the FEC.\u201d<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0The Technology 202: Senators grill agency officials over infighting in push to regulate big tech<br/>By\u00a0Cat Zakrzewski<br/>The United States was not adequately prepared for foreign disinformation threats during the 2016 elections and isn\u2019t equipped for election integrity challenges in the 2020 campaign, experts and policymakers warned during a symposium Tuesday on information and election security, my colleague Michelle Yee Hee Lee reports for the Technology 202.<br/>There has not been enough meaningful progress in the United States on protecting from foreign disinformation threats, and it remains difficult for policymakers and private companies to create systemic changes that do not impinge on freedom of expression, the speakers said.<br/>The event, co-organized by PEN America, the Global Digital Policy Incubator at Stanford University\u2019s Cyber Policy Center and Ellen Weintraub, chairwoman of the FEC, emphasized the need for lawmakers, public policy organizations, technology companies and the media to fulfill their responsibilities in ensuring election integrity and fight the spread of disinformation online, including new regulations, transparency on user data, increased fact-checking in news coverage, and more, Michelle writes\u2026<br/>U.S. institutions were \u201ccaught flat-footed\u201d in 2016 by Russian efforts, which used routine online fraud activities such as audience-building and exploiting algorithms and recommendations on social media, said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.<br/>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how the misuse of technology threatens our democratic systems, our economy, and increasingly, our national security,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThe truth is, the United States was caught flat-footed in 2016, and our social media companies failed to anticipate how their platforms could be manipulated and misused by Russian operatives. Frankly, we should\u2019ve seen it coming.\u201d<br/>Meanwhile, one of those regulatory bodies remains defanged. The FEC, which enforces federal election regulations and laws, has been unable to conduct official business since it lost its voting quorum late last month.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>CNBC:\u00a0Elizabeth Warren took lobbyists\u2019 money for Senate runs \u2013 now, running for president, she opposes the practice<br/>By\u00a0Brian Schwartz<br/>Before Sen. Elizabeth Warren took the stage in front of a raucous crowd in New York on Monday, she unveiled a plan that called on lobbyists to be banned from contributing and fundraising to their preferred campaigns.<br/>\u201cMy plan not only bans lobbyists from making political contributions, it also bans them from bundling donations or hosting fundraisers for political candidates,\u201d Warren said in her Medium post.<br/>This plan represents the latest phase of an apparent shift from Warren, who accepted at least $95,000 from federally registered lobbyists during her campaigns for the U.S. Senate, according to records reviewed by CNBC\u2026<br/>A $10.4 million transfer from her Senate political committee helped fund the early stages of Warren\u2019s presidential campaign\u2026<br/>\u201cFor nearly two years, Elizabeth\u2019s campaign operation has screened and rejected federal lobbyist donations. For over a year, she has rallied candidates and Members of Congress to support her legislation to ban federal lobbyist donations,\u201d Warren\u2019s deputy press secretary, Saloni Sharma, told CNBC. \u201cInstead of cynically attacking a handful of old donations dwarfed by millions of grassroots contributions in order to deflect from their own practices, every candidate for President should step up, reject federal lobbyist contributions, and support Elizabeth\u2019s comprehensive anti-corruption platform, which would end it permanently.\u201d<br/>Still, Warren\u2019s policy has triggered criticism from lobbyists who supported her in the past.<br/>\u201cI\u2019m not happy with the overall plan. I think the whole thing is silly,\u201d Warren donor Robert Crowe, of lobbying firm Nelson Mullins, said Tuesday.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Independent Groups</emphasis><br/>Daily Caller:\u00a0Survey: 32 Percent Of Democrats Want NRA Labeled A Terrorist Organization<br/>By\u00a0Peter Hasson<br/>A Rasmussen survey released Monday found that 32 percent of likely Democratic voters want their local communities to follow the example of San Francisco and designate the NRA as a terrorist group\u2026<br/>The Rasmussen survey also found that 28 percent of Democrats think it should be illegal to join gun rights groups like the NRA, despite the First Amendment\u2019s freedom of association protections.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>St. Louis Post-Dispatch:\u00a0In post-Greitens Missouri, new campaign fundraising rules going into effect<br/>By\u00a0Kurt Erickson<br/>Out-of-state groups seeking to influence Missouri politics will have to register with the state under a new rule designed to address a controversial practice highlighted during former Gov. Eric Greitens\u2019 2016 run for office.<br/>The change, which is in effect for a series of special elections in November, was spurred by the secretive, big money contributions received by the disgraced former chief executive that included millions of dollars from so-called \u201cdark money\u201d nonprofits with connections to Nick Ayers, the former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence.<br/>The new rule is one provision of the \u201cClean Missouri\u201d ballot initiative approved by voters last year as a way to bring more transparency to election-time spending\u2026<br/>Other changes to the constitution that were part of the ballot question included capping contributions to individual candidates at $2,500 to curtail a practice in which candidates like Greitens were receiving seven figure contributions from groups that were not required to disclose their donors.<br/>The change affects candidates running for seats in the Missouri House and Senate, but does not cover statewide candidates.<br/>Courthouse News Service:\u00a0California Senate Approves Anti-Deepfake Bill Despite Free Speech Concerns<br/>By\u00a0Nick Cahill<br/>Shunning free speech concerns brought by civil liberties groups, the California Senate on Friday approved a bill meant to protect political candidates from deceptive social media videos known as deepfakes\u2026<br/>Assembly Bill 730 would give candidates the ability to sue people or organizations that share deepfakes without warning labels near Election Day\u2026<br/>The bill specifically bars individuals and entities from sharing deepfakes of candidates within 60 days of an election.

The case involved a complaint filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) against Crossroads GPS regarding the group's \"independent expenditures\" - ads that urge the support or defeat of a candidate.</p><p><br/>CREW now misrepresents the ruling, saying that it requires such groups to \"disclose the identities of all contributors who gave more than $200 in a year.\"<br/>CREW did ask for that ruling, but the court refused. While CREW won a significant victory in the case, Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote that CREW's view of the law's disclosure requirements was \"erroneous\", and explained that \"only those donors contributing over [$200] for political purposes to influence any federal election are covered.\"<br/>She added that \"the identities of contributors to [nonprofits] for 'those organizations' general programs' need not be identified; only those non-trivial donors contributing to fund those organization's political efforts in federal campaign and independent expenditure activities are required to be disclosed.\"<br/>The case is CREW v. FEC. More information is available here. The Institute's full analysis of the district court's ruling is available here.<br/>CREW Misleads Public, Media on Judge Howell's Ruling in CREW v. FEC<br/>What Judge Howell called CREW's \"erroneous view,\" is that \"identification of all contributors over $200\" is required under the law. In reality, Judge Howell explained, \"only those donors contributing over that threshold amount for political purposes to influence any federal election are covered.\"<br/>The ruling was nonetheless a significant partial victory for CREW. (Our analysis of the decision is available\u00a0here.)\u00a0The court agreed that the law requires more disclosure than FEC regulations had required. Previously, non-PACs had reported only donors who give to fund a specific independent expenditure (IE) communication. Under Judge Howell's ruling, any donor who gives funds to support any independent expenditure for one or more clearly identified candidates must be disclosed.<br/>Figuring out what all this means in practice will be complicated, but the one thing that is absolutely clear is that nonprofit groups making IEs do not need to report all donors above $200 to the FEC.<br/>Yet CREW has been wrongly asserting that its \"erroneous\" argument prevailed. Describing the effect of the ruling, CREW writes, \"effective immediately, anyone making more than $250 in express advocacy ads - ads that tell viewers who to vote for or against - must now disclose the identities of all contributors who gave more than $200 in a year.\" ...<br/>Another passage in Judge Howell's ruling similarly rejects CREW's argument that all donors above $200 must be disclosed. On page 96, the judge wrote, \"the identities of contributors to both the NRA and the Sierra Club for 'those organizations' general programs' need not be identified; only those non-trivial donors contributing to fund those organization's political efforts in federal campaign and independent expenditure activities are required to be disclosed.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In the News</emphasis><br/>Palisades Hudson Financial Group:\u00a0Politics At the Water's Edge<br/>By Larry M. Elkin<br/>[T]he goal of \"one administration at a time\" was also easier to achieve in the era when we had political campaigns that ended on election night, followed by a period in which the winner of the election performed the job, eventually followed by another campaign. Now the campaigning never ends.\u00a0A 2015 report\u00a0from the Center for Competitive Politics (since renamed the Institute for Free Speech) found that the average presidential campaign from the 1970s onward lasted 484 days, compared to 286 days in the 1950s and '60s. Congressional campaigns are as bad, if not worse. Literally the morning the election results are announced, jockeying for position begins for the next cycle.<br/>With many members of Congress and nearly every first-term president in constant campaign mode, we should be unsurprised at the results. This is the practice of modern political science in the real world, where in order to have an \"us,\" it is necessary to have a \"them\" made up of your electoral opponents. It is how you enlarge and fire up the base: Draw the sharpest possible contrast between your side and the opposition. Your opponents can't just be misguided or wrong. They have to be witless, evil or some combination of the two. You cannot expect, let alone urge, foreign leaders to respect them when you refuse to respect them yourself. In fact, you have every incentive to undermine foreign respect for the opposing party, even if doing so injures your own.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>The Hill:\u00a0Dems offer resolution to force vote to overturn IRS guidance limiting donor disclosure<br/>By Naomi Jagoda<br/>Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) on Monday announced an effort to force a Senate vote on IRS guidance that reduces donor disclosure requirements for certain tax-exempt groups.<br/>The senators introduced a resolution to overturn the guidance under the Congressional Review Act. They argued that undoing the guidance is necessary to prevent the erosion of transparency in politics.<br/>\"We must crack down on the dark money flooding our political system, that's why we are taking an aggressive approach and introducing this legislation to protect our democracy and hold special interests accountable with transparency,\" Tester, who is up for reelection this year in a state Trump won, said in a statement...<br/>Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, cited the guidance earlier this month when voting against President Trump's nominee to lead the IRS, Charles Rettig. Many other Democrats, including Tester, also voted against Rettig's nomination, though he was ultimately confirmed by a vote of 64-33.<br/>\"Over the next few weeks political ads will be flooding the airwaves. Because of the Trump administration's new dark money rule, tax authorities won't know whether those ads are being paid for by foreign governments or individuals,\" Wyden said. \"Opposition against my resolution with Senator Tester is an endorsement of the Trump administration's plan to further cripple campaign finance transparency.\" ...<br/>The resolution from Wyden and Tester is unlikely to be enacted, even if it passes the Senate, because Republicans have a bigger majority in the House and Trump could veto the measure.<br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Google CEO Sundar Pichai to Meet With Top GOP Lawmakers<br/>By John D. McKinnon and Douglas MacMillan<br/>Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai plans to appear at a private meeting of top GOP lawmakers on Friday and again at a public hearing this year, responding to new scrutiny of the company's work with China, its market power and alleged bias against conservatives in its search results...<br/>\"Google has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior and business dealings with repressive regimes like China,\" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), who is organizing Friday's meeting. He added that Mr. Pichai has \"kindly\" agreed to field Congress's questions with Republican members on Friday. Mr. Pichai also is expected to appear at a House Judiciary Committee hearing after the November election...<br/>The tech industry began facing serious political challenges last year, amid revelations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but Google initially escaped some of the intense scrutiny that Facebook and Twitter have endured. Since then, however, the company has drawn fire over privacy on its Gmail service and allegations by conservatives that its search results stifle their viewpoints...<br/>\u00a0Mr. McCarthy, who is aiming to help preserve the GOP's House majority and improve his chances of becoming speaker, has emerged as a vocal critic of the tech companies in recent months, as conservative voters appear to be focusing more on the issue of alleged political bias. He has been joined by President Trump, who recently accused Google of manipulating search results to highlight negative news reports about him.<br/>Tech firms deny that they skew their news feeds, search or other functions to boost liberals or hurt conservatives.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donor Privacy\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Center for Individual Freedom:\u00a0The Case for Protecting Donor Privacy (Audio)<br/>Leah Byers, Policy Analyst with the Civitas Institute, discusses a recent study titled, \"State Charitable Solicitations Licensing Programs: A Threat to Donor Privacy, an Unnecessary Burden on Lawful Non-Profits, and an Ineffectual Deterrent to Fraud.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump Administration</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0State Officials Weigh Joint Probes of Big Tech Companies<br/>By\u00a0John D. McKinnon and\u00a0Cameron McWhirter<br/>State officials expressed concerns about technology giants' market dominance and user-privacy practices at a meeting Tuesday hosted by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions...<br/>In the meeting, much of the focus from officials was on the massive amounts of personal data tech companies collect from their users, and the adequacy and transparency of their terms of use. Some officials also wanted to take a closer look at the market power of firms such as Facebook and Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. A third issue, potential political bias by major platforms, got relatively little attention in the meeting, participants said...<br/>The Justice Department said it would review the information shared by the state attorneys general and \"expects this dialogue will continue in the near future,\"...\u00a0<br/>State participants stopped short of saying a joint federal-state investigation would commence, but several state attorneys general said the issues deserve more attention...<br/>Tuesday's meeting of attorneys general had been expected to also focus on the political-bias allegations, which have been a concern among some Republican officials, including state attorneys general as well as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.). President Trump also has recently accused Google of skewing online search results to highlight negative news stories about him.<br/>The tech platforms deny allowing any political bias to affect their news, search or other functions.<br/>Attendees said the bias issue got less attention than expected, however.<br/>Mr. Sessions \"was really the only one who was talking about political speech,\" said Brian Frosh, the Democratic attorney general of Maryland.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Yahoo Sports:\u00a0Nike has donated three times as much money to Republicans as Democrats this year<br/>By Blake Schuster<br/>Nike is rejecting the inclusion of co-founder Phil Knight's political contributions in a report from the Center for Responsive Politics.<br/>\"Nike's Political Action Committee helps\u00a0employees\u00a0support candidates who understand our business and whose values and goals align with our mission of serving athletes,\" a Nike spokesperson said in a statement to Yahoo Sports. \"Contributions from the Nike PAC are entirely separate from personal contributions made by individuals, including Mr. Knight who retired as an employee of Nike in 2006.<br/>\"Using the data posted by Open Secrets, the Nike PAC has contributed $88,700 during the 2018 political cycle to Democrats and $79,400 to Republicans.

The CRP report also includes personal contributions from Nike employees, which the company does not track in accordance with election laws.\u00a0<br/>New Yorker:\u00a0How Russia Helped Swing the Election for Trump<br/>By Jane Mayer<br/>Few people, including Trump's opponents, have publicly challenged the widespread belief that no obtainable evidence can prove that Russian interference changed any votes. Democrats, for the most part, have avoided attributing Hillary Clinton's defeat directly to Russian machinations...<br/>The U.S. intelligence community, for its part, is prohibited from investigating domestic political affairs. James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, told me, \"We try not to spy on Americans. It's not in our charter.\" He emphasized that, although he and other intelligence officials produced-and shared with Trump-a postelection report confirming an extensive cyberattack by Russia, the assessment did not attempt to gauge how this foreign meddling had affected American voters. Speaking for himself, however, he told me that \"it stretches credulity to think the Russians didn't turn the election.\" ...<br/>Although the Senate hearings are still under way, the Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, a Republican, has already declared, \"What we cannot do, however, is calculate the impact that foreign meddling and social media had on this election.\"<br/>Even the Clinton campaign has stopped short of attributing its loss to the Russians...<br/>Politicians may be too timid to explore the subject, but a new book from, of all places, Oxford University Press promises to be incendiary. \"Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President-What We Don't, Can't, and Do Know,\" by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, dares to ask-and even attempts to answer-whether Russian meddling had a decisive impact in 2016. Jamieson offers a forensic analysis of the available evidence and concludes that Russia very likely delivered Trump's victory.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Kansas City Star:\u00a0Clean Missouri will be on November ballot after high court refuses to hear challenge<br/>By Allison Kite<br/>Missouri voters will get to choose whether the state adopts a slate of ethics and redistricting reforms in November after an effort to toss the initiative petition from the ballot hit a dead end Monday.<br/>Opponents of the initiative, called Clean Missouri, or Amendment 1, sued to have the issue removed from Missouri's November ballot. They were successful at the trial court level, but an appellate court in Kansas City upheld Clean Missouri last week.<br/>On Monday, the Missouri Supreme Court declined to take on the case, meaning the appellate court's decision will be final and cement Clean Missouri's place on the November ballot.<br/>\"We have no further avenues to block this poorly drafted amendment before it appears on the November 6 ballot,\" Daniel Mehan, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in a statement.<br/>Mehan was among the plaintiffs who sued to remove the initiative from the ballot.<br/>Clean Missouri proposes to lower campaign contribution limits, eliminate nearly all lobbyist gifts, require a cooling period before legislators and their staffers can become lobbyists and open legislative records...\u00a0<br/>Opponents of Clean Missouri had argued it violated a provision of the Missouri Constitution that limits the scope of initiative petitions and sought to mislead voters. Supporters said the sweeping changes all fall under the subject of reforming the legislature...<br/>\"When we talk about making changes to our state's constitution, we need to make sure any new amendments pass a high bar,\" Mehan said. \"The judiciary's decision in this case is especially troubling because it establishes a new, low precedent allowing constitutional amendments to go before voters regardless of drafting errors and deceptive intent.\"<br/>Columbia Daily Tribune:\u00a0Clean Missouri campaign benefits from dark money donations<br/>By Rudi Keller<br/>Clean Missouri, the campaign backing an initiative that seeks to make it harder to hide the source of campaign contributions as it also redefines how legislative districts are drawn, has accepted $618,000 since July 1 from a Texas organization that does not disclose its donors...<br/>Clean Missouri has raised more than $3.7 million to pay for the petition drive and fall campaign, according to reports filed with the Missouri Ethics Commission. It has a lengthy list of supporters including former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth, a Republican, and the League of Women Voters.<br/>The campaign's large donors include well-known groups with a long involvement in Missouri politics - the National Education Association, which from national and state organizations has given $1 million; other labor unions, which have contributed more than $400,000; and Planned Parenthood-affiliated Political Action Committees, which have given $205,000...<br/>More than half the money raised since July 1, however, has come from Texas. The Action Now Initiative, which gave $618,000, is a Houston not-for-profit affiliated with John and Laura Arnold, billionaire natural gas hedge fund investors. Django Bonderman of Fort Worth gave $250,000.<br/>Action Now Initiative does not disclose its donors. It reports its finances to the IRS, not a state or federal election agency. Sean Nicholson, campaign director for Clean Missouri, defended taking donations from the group.<br/>John Arnold \"supports government reform around the country and we are honored to have that support,\" Nicholson said...<br/>For opponents, however, Clean Missouri's effort to limit campaign donations from obscure sources doesn't match accepting large donations from a group that doesn't disclose its donors.<br/>Albany Times-Union:\u00a0Cuomo campaign admits outreach by Crystal Run<br/>By Chris Bragg<br/>In a meeting with the Times Union editorial board three weeks ago, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo emphatically and repeatedly stated that Crystal Run Healthcare, a growing Hudson Valley company, had never warned his campaign of potential problems with its $400,000 in donations.<br/>Moreover, the governor said that if the company had done so, Crystal Run would have effectively \"admitted to a crime.\"<br/>But on Tuesday, in response to the Times Union's questions about Cuomo's statement, his campaign acknowledged that what the governor said that day was not true: Crystal Run had indeed approached the campaign with concerns about its donations.<br/>\"Since the editorial board meeting, the governor has been informed that Crystal Run's counsel had been in contact with the campaign's outside counsel,\" campaign spokeswoman Abbey Collins said in an emailed statement.<br/>The FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan have been investigating whether a two-day flurry of 10 separate $25,000 checks from Crystal Run officials to Cuomo in October 2013 were actually reimbursed by the company through bonuses.<br/>If that occurred, it could violate state election law, which bars the circumvention of donation limits through the use of so-called \"straw donors.\"<br/>Collins said Crystal Run's counsel - whom she did not name - asked the campaign to reallocate individual contributions given in 2013 and 2015 \"to a broad array of partners to 'reflect the partnership's intent,'\" Collin said, quoting from the counsel's letter. Presumably, such a reallocation would source the donations to the company and not the individuals.<br/>\"As there was no basis for such a change in the campaign filing and - given the publicly reported investigation - no such reallocation was made,\" Collins said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-37550</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3183\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 26, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Initiative &amp;

That moment is now and their voice should be heard. The Senate should not act on this vacancy until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.\u201d<br/>Wall Street Journal: The Importance of Amy Coney Barrett<br/>By The Editorial Board<br/>President Trump\u2019s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court is a highlight of his Presidency and perhaps a hinge moment for the judiciary. Judge Barrett\u2019s record and intellect suggest she can join Mr. Trump\u2019s other appointees in reviving core constitutional principles in American law and life.<br/>If this sounds like a tall order for one Justice, we do not mean to suggest this is her job alone. She is the latest example of a new generation of originalist judges whom Mr. Trump and the GOP Senate have elevated to the federal bench. The numbers-three Justices and 53 appellate-court judges-are crucial, but more important is how they approach the law. With rare exceptions, they think of themselves as protectors of the proper constitutional order, not as a third policy-making alternative to the political branches.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Washington Post: Judge blocks TikTok ban in second ruling against Trump\u2019s efforts to curb popular Chinese services<br/>By Rachel Lerman<br/>TikTok received a reprieve of its\u00a0ban\u00a0from U.S. app stores on Sunday after a federal judge in Washington granted a preliminary injunction blocking an order from President Trump.<br/>It was the second setback for the Trump administration in its effort to curb U.S. residents\u2019 access to popular Chinese mobile apps. Last weekend, a federal magistrate in San Francisco\u00a0cited First Amendment issues\u00a0in blocking a proposed ban of the WeChat app.<br/>U.S. District Judge Carl J.

Who receives that vote is determined by an internal tally of each lawmaker in the delegation. This means the presidency may not be decided by the party that controls the House itself but by the one that controls more state delegations in the chamber.

Lindsey] Graham pleaded with Fox viewers for campaign cash\u2026<br/>Fox \u201chad no knowledge that he would solicit donations on air,\u201d the network said in a statement.<br/>As a general matter, news organizations are broadly exempt from federal campaign finance regulations that prohibit candidates from soliciting funds during TV interviews without a series of disclosures and disclaimers, said Brett Kappel, a Washington lawyer who specializes in campaign-finance, lobbying and government-ethics laws.<br/>The Federal Election Commission has never sanctioned \u2013 or even warned \u2013 a major media outlet for not having the required disclaimers during a broadcast interview in which a candidate solicited funds, he said.<br/>But any complaint about the lack of disclaimers would implicate both the candidate and the station that broadcasts the solicitation, Kappel said: \u201cRunning solicitations without disclaimers would raise the issue of whether [Fox] crossed the line from a protected press entity and became a corporate contributor to Graham\u2019s campaign.\u201d While the likelihood of enforcement action is low, \u201cit would be an issue [Fox] wouldn\u2019t want to have to address.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>Axios: Google to block election ads after Election Day<br/>By Sara Fischer<br/>Google informed its advertisers Friday that it will broadly block election ads after polls close Nov. 3, according to an email obtained by Axios.<br/>Big Tech platforms have been under pressure to address how their ad policies will handle conflicts over the presidential election\u2019s outcome\u2026<br/>In the email, Google says that advertisers will not be able to run ads \u201creferencing candidates, the election, or its outcome, given that an\u00a0unprecedented amount of votes\u00a0will be counted after election day this year.\u201d \u2026<br/>The ban will target ads that are\u00a0explicitly election-related, as well as any other types of ads that reference federal or state elections within the ad, or ads that run based on targeting election-related search queries, including on candidates or officeholders\u2026<br/>A source familiar with the policy says that the company will consider a number of different factors before lifting the ban, like how long it takes for all the ballots to be counted and whether or not there are major protests in light of the outcome.<br/>Politico: Why the right wing has a massive advantage on Facebook<br/>By Alex Thompson<br/>Throughout 2020, Democrats have denounced Facebook with growing ferocity as a \u201cright wing echo chamber\u201d with a \u201cconservative bias\u201d that\u2019s giving an edge to Donald Trump in November.<br/>But Facebook says there\u2019s a reason why right-wing figures are driving more engagement. It\u2019s not that its algorithm favors conservatives \u2013 the company has long maintained that its platform is neutral. Instead, the right is better at connecting with people on a visceral level, the company says.<br/>\u201cRight-wing populism is always more engaging,\u201d a Facebook executive said in a recent interview with POLITICO reporters, when pressed why the pages of conservatives drive such high interactions. The person said the content speaks to \u201can incredibly strong, primitive emotion\u201d by touching on such topics as \u201cnation, protection, the other, anger, fear.\u201d<br/>\u201cThat was there in the [19]30\u2019s.

This is not a feature of our society that we must simply accept. It is a choice to create an algorithm that feeds the distrust and polarization that are tearing us apart.\u201d<br/>RealClearPolitics: How Social Media Platforms Are Narrowing the First Amendment<br/>By Kalev Leetaru<br/>The First Amendment forms the bedrock of American democracy. Its protections against government censorship make possible the shared societal debates that have ushered many once-heretical ideas into the mainstream. Yet, as our national debates increasingly occur within the private walls of social media platforms, those companies, exempt from First Amendment restraints, have embraced their newfound role of national censor. As part of this process, fact-checkers are expanding their reach to questions for which there are no clear answers, adding new categories of assessment such as \u201cmissing context\u201d to their rulings.<br/>These shifting dynamics prompt a fundamental question: What does it mean for democracy when the First Amendment is continually narrowed by private companies stepping in to act as the censors that the government can\u2019t be?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Wiley\u2019s Election Law News: Biden Platform Proposes Major Changes to Government Ethics and Lobbying Regulation<br/>By Robert L.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) said his vote was conditional on a one-week delay to allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into sexual-assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.<br/>It was unclear if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) would delay the vote.

Garcia ultimately won the primary and general elections in Florida's 26th congressional district, and the candidate who received the undisclosed money, Justin Lamar Sternad, later pleaded guilty to breaking election laws.<br/>A political operative and former girlfriend of Rivera's also pleaded guilty to her role in the scheme and said she acted as a go-between for Rivera and Sternad, who accepted tens of thousands of dollars in hush-hush advertising and political services that he listed on campaign finance forms as self-loans.<br/>But Rivera has always denied any wrongdoing, and was not charged by the U.S. Attorney's office. After the statute of limitations ran out, the FEC filed a civil action against Rivera, arguing that he'd broken campaign finance laws prohibiting secret donations. The elections watchdog was pursuing nearly $500,000 in fines, but Rivera argued that if anyone broke election law in the alleged scheme, it was Sternad.<br/>Cooke's decision to dismiss the case was not based on any arguments of whether Rivera engaged in the alleged scheme, but predicated on a recent court ruling in Utah that found that the law cited by the federal agency in bringing its case against Rivera was fatally flawed.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Tech Firms Face Bias Accusations at Congressional Hearing<br/>By John D. McKinnon<br/>A day before Google's chief was set to meet with high-ranking Republicans, critics in a congressional hearing accused the internet giant and other tech firms of being \"insular\" and dismissive of the free-speech rights of conservatives.<br/>The contentious hearing, the latest such congressional event in recent months, could drive calls for stricter regulation of Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc.,\u00a0and other big tech companies and stoke concerns of their political bias-including accusations that such bias influences content on their platforms-in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections...<br/>On Friday, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai is set to meet privately with top House Republican leaders, including Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), the majority leader. Mr. McCarthy has become a leading critic of the tech firms' filtering practices, accusing them frequently of bias. He said last week that \"Google has a lot of questions to answer.\"<br/>At Thursday's House subcommittee hearing, Rep. Steve King (R., Iowa) warned that tech companies' alleged bias is beginning to be noticed by the public. \"Americans are beginning to recognize this quiet trend in our society in which one group or another systemically silences another's beliefs with which they disagree,\" he said in his opening statement.<br/>Several witnesses representing conservative media at the hearing said some social media companies have hurt them by restricting their internet traffic...<br/>A Google spokeswoman, Riva Sciuto, said, \"Our products are not used to set a political agenda, and we don't bias our algorithms toward any political ideology. We continually work to improve our products, and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>Daily Beast:\u00a0Silicon Valley's Big-Name, Big-Money Political Ad Gambit<br/>By Lachlan Markay<br/>The firm, digital-media startup MotiveAI, has created a handful of limited liability companies in Colorado through which it's purchased ads on at least 44 different Facebook pages...<br/>But it is also testing the limits of federal campaign-finance laws that are still very much stuck in the 20th century. Facebook's recent decision to require additional information from its political advertisers revealed the names of four LLCs that MotiveAI has used to mount its advertising campaign. But the involvement of MotiveAI itself is not disclosed, on Facebook or anywhere else, in part because current election laws have weaker disclosure requirements for digital ads than those run on TV and radio, or through direct mail and phone-banking.<br/>\"This is a good example of the digital loopholes in our campaign-finance laws,\" said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal and Federal Election Commission reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, an ethics watchdog group. He pointed to MotiveAI ads attacking Republican Senate candidates in competitive states such as North Dakota and Tennessee.<br/>\"These ads could be subject to [Federal Election Commission] reporting as 'electioneering communications' if they were run on TV or radio, but not when run online,\" Fischer explained. \"An electioneering communication is defined only as a broadcast ad naming a candidate and run shortly before an election. This means that a political ad subject to legal transparency requirements when aired on TV can remain shrouded in secrecy when that same ad is run online.\"<br/>The definition of \"electioneering communication\" was codified by the McCain-Feingold law of 2002. That's 16 years of rapid innovation for which lawmakers have yet to account.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Media</emphasis><br/>Los Angeles Times:\u00a0L.A. judge orders media not to publish courtroom photos of man charged with killing homeless people<br/>By Jaclyn Cosgrove and\u00a0James Queally<br/>A Los Angeles County judge ordered journalists Wednesday not to publish courtroom photographs of a Houston man charged with killing multiple homeless people in the L.A. area, a move that The Times plans to challenge in court as an unconstitutional prior restraint against the media...<br/>The judge's order comes eight years after an appellate court overturned a similar order prohibiting The Times from publishing photographs of a defendant charged with several counts of murder.<br/>\"It is distressing that once again the Los Angeles Times needs to resort to litigation to preserve our rights under the 1st Amendment,\" Times Executive Editor Norman Pearlstine said.<br/>California state court judges have wide discretion to allow or bar photos and video in their courtrooms. Defense attorneys often object if there are concerns that publishing photographs of their clients could improperly influence witnesses in a case in which identification is crucial. However, judges generally cannot prevent images from being published once they're taken legally.<br/>Free-speech experts were quick to contend that the judge's actions would probably be considered an unconstitutional act of prior restraint.<br/>\"Once the photos have been taken, once the photographer has those images in his or her camera, the court's ability to prevent them from being published is very close to zero,\" said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, a free-speech nonprofit organization.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Want your campaign funding to be effective? Diversify.<br/>By Ethan Roeder<br/>Political investors, both individual and institutional, confuse the political value of a race with the electoral utility of additional dollars. Some races are, of course, very politically valuable - a competitive U.S.\u00a0Senate seat, for instance, in a year when the balance of power is in play. But there is a limit to how much money a campaign can spend in a useful way...<br/>The fact is once all the basics of campaign engagement are fully paid for, additional dollars have virtually no chance of influencing the result.<br/>Meanwhile, hundreds of exceptional but little-known candidates are attempting in vain to introduce themselves to voters. As a partisan, I believe investing in these undervalued races will yield better overall returns for the political party I support, and as a voter, I believe a more balanced political environment would be better for our democracy.<br/>What I propose is investing in campaigns following the same framework that guides financial investors toward diversification: I call it the Modern Portfolio Theory for Campaigns. Like its financial counterpart, it spreads out investments to limit risk, is optimized for long-term rather than short-term results and, perhaps most revolutionary for politics, is more concerned with the performance of the overall portfolio than with any one component (i.e., a candidate).<br/>Instead of placing a few extremely large bets, political investors using this theory would expand their portfolios to include undervalued races and only fund top-tier races to a reasonable level. While lesser-targeted races are riskier, your marginal investment goes much further in an undervalued race than an overvalued one...<br/>The time is right for a new approach to funding campaigns. By adopting a portfolio approach, political investors can both improve outcomes and improve our democracy.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>AP News:\u00a0ACLU: Good-government measure violates First Amendment<br/>By Associated Press<br/>The American Civil Liberties Union's North Dakota chapter says a measure aimed at ethics reform in the state violates the First Amendment.<br/>Measure 1 would amend the North Dakota constitution to ban foreign money from state elections, restrict lobbying and create an independent ethics commission, among other provisions.<br/>Backers call it an \"anti-corruption\" measure aimed at transparency.<br/>But the ACLU says the measure is \"poorly written\" and restricts \"political speech and advocacy.\"<br/>The state's largest business organization also announced this month that it will campaign to help defeat the measure.<br/>The Greater North Dakota Chamber says it would be difficult to comply with the measure because it is too broadly worded.<br/>Campaign filings show supporters of the initiative have attracted nearly $420,000, much of it from left-leaning out-of-state groups.<br/>Las Vegas Review-Journal:\u00a0Las Vegas judge will reconsider ruling to overturn election<br/>By Ramona Giwargis<br/>A Las Vegas judge on Thursday agreed to reconsider his decision to overturn a Nevada Assembly election because the winner was late in filing campaign finance reports.<br/>Clark County District Judge Jim Crockett\u00a0ruled on Sept. 13\u00a0to nullify the Assembly District 5 Republican primary election after the defeated candidate, Mack Miller, sued the winner, Jason Burke. Miller claimed Burke should be declared ineligible for office because he failed to file timely campaign finance reports.<br/>Although the Nevada Constitution does not recognize late reports as a candidate disqualifier, Crockett agreed and deemed Miller the rightful winner. Burke asked the judge to reconsider his ruling - which Crockett granted on Thursday - and the two sides will return to court on Oct. 9 to hash out the case over the GOP candidate for the Las Vegas district.<br/>WRAL Raleigh:\u00a0Judges come out against two proposed NC amendments<br/>By Laura Leslie<br/>Some local judges have joined the fight against two proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot in November.<br/>Lawmakers have put six amendments before voters this fall, but two have generated intense opposition. They would take the power to name members of the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement and to fill judicial vacancies from the governor and give those powers to the legislature.<br/>All five living former governors, both Republican and Democrat, and all six living former chief justices of the state Supreme Court have said those two proposals would undercut the judiciary and erode the separation of powers between the branches of government...<br/>Regarding the elections board amendment, [retired Superior Court Judge Donald] Stephens said lawmakers want political control over who is and is not investigated for campaign finance and ethics violations.<br/>\"That's like foxes appointing foxes to investigate who ate the chickens,\" he said...<br/>The State Board of Ethics and Elections is currently bipartisan, made up of four Republicans, four Democrats and one Independent. The amendment would take the power to appoint the board away from the governor and give it to state lawmakers, and it would cut the number of board members from nine to eight, removing the independent.<br/>[Retired Superior Court Judge Gregory] Weeks said an even-numbered board would lead to partisan deadlock, generating electoral litigation that could cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br/>Lawmakers had to rewrite both proposals recently after a state court ruled that earlier versions were misleading to voters.<br/>York Dispatch:\u00a0Politicos stumped by Wagner's investments of 'excess campaign funds'<br/>By Logan Hullinger<br/>Facing\u00a0a Democratic incumbent who is raising and spending more money in Pennsylvania's gubernatorial race, Republican Scott Wagner is making an unusual move with his campaign contributions...<br/>Wagner - a York County businessman, like Wolf - has been investing \"excess campaign funds\" in a brokerage account...<br/>The campaign itself also has been loaned nearly $1.4 million from the account since 2017.<br/>Wagner campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo clarified all of the money invested into the account was from Wagner's own donations...<br/>The state's campaign finance laws state that as long as interest and dividends are \"received in accordance with the applicable banking laws and in the ordinary course of business,\" investing funds is legal...<br/>However, some Pennsylvania political analysts have never heard of such a strategy and struggled to find a reasoning behind Wagner's investments.<br/>Micah Sims, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, a nonpartisan political watchdog organization, said in his more than 20 years in politics he's \"never seen anything like this.\"<br/>\"This is probably a practice that many people, including myself, would totally frown upon,\" he said. \"I don't understand why we're running political campaigns to make money. I thought that happened on Wall Street.\"<br/>Sims added that although the practice may be within the boundaries of the state's campaign finance laws, Wagner's report illustrates the need for campaign finance law reform.<br/>\"This is something that has raised a red flag,\" he said. \"We are going to push upon and address this to fix campaign finance laws in Pennsylvania.\"<br/>Bangor Daily News:\u00a0Money can't buy love or the Blaine House<br/>By Michael Cianchette<br/>Well, Janet Mills is winning.<br/>Not necessarily the Blaine House. The limited polling shows a neck-and-neck race, while the lawn sign battle points to a clear Shawn Moody victory. But she is winning the money race...<br/>Put it all together and Mills is flirting with $4 million. Moody is at half that. And you know what? It won't really matter.<br/>The Beatles sang \"money can't buy me love,\" and they were right. Money doesn't buy the Blaine House - or any political office for that matter - either...<br/>Spending is useful and necessary to get the name and perspective of a candidate out into the minds of the public. But at some point, all the electioneering in the world boils down to a simple question, asked of each voter individually: Which person should get the job?<br/>That is where claims about \"buying\" elections break down. No matter how much money gets spent, it is hard to see a scenario where a Republican wins a State House seat in the center of Portland. All the dollars or dinars in the world will not see a U.S. Senate seat from Utah go to a Democrat in the near future...<br/>Mills may be winning the money race, but remains far from measuring for new carpet in the Blaine House.<br/>So, as we go into Fryeburg Fair week, enjoy all the jockeying and spin the campaigns will offer about the underlying meaning contained within their financing reports. Tolerate the fact that tens upon tens of thousands of dollars are being spent to put signs alongside our roads as we move into foliage season.<br/>And buckle-up. Because the dash to the finish is just getting started, and we won't know a winner until Nov. 7.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-37832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 28, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

And he\u2019s fascinated.<br/>\u201cTo me, what\u2019s really interesting is that they\u2019re doing this all this just to keep the petition from even qualifying for the ballot and that\u2019s what I don\u2019t recall [seeing] before. Is somebody coming forward and trying to spending a large amount of money just to get the issue from even being placed on the ballot,\u201d Smith said\u2026<br/>Groups including the League of Women Voters and Common Cause Ohio have called for more financial disclosure of the groups involved in this referendum. Ohio State University Moritz College of Law professor Dan Tokaji said it\u2019s simple.</p><p><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally an issue of transparency. We should know we the people should know who\u2019s funding campaigns whether they\u2019re for ballot measures or for candidates,\u201d Tokaji said.<br/>Those who oppose that say corporate and high profile donors sometimes want to be shielded to avoid protests and boycotts, and that they support dark money groups for reasons beyond political activity. And former FEC chair Bradley Smith said there\u2019s often plenty of information about dark money groups anyway.<br/>\u201cI think anybody would be, would not be shocked to discover that there\u2019s a fair amount of energy company money behind this, the people who in fact would benefit from this directly. So I don\u2019t know how much voters would benefit,\u201d said Smith.<br/>Smith is the founder of the Institute for Free Speech, which opposes campaign finance reform.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Comments to FEC on REG 2019-01: Rulemaking Petition to Amend the Definition of Contribution to Include \u201cValuable Information\u201d<br/>By David Keating<br/>The Commission should tread lightly where the Petition asks it to go, because \u201c[u]nique among federal administrative agencies, the Federal Election Commission has as its sole purpose the regulation of core constitutionally protected activity.\u201d The Petition asks that this Commission consider the regulation of speech within new categories of \u201cinformation.\u201d All the related terms are vague and overbroad, but to the extent these terms have any real meaning, they are likely already covered by existing FEC regulations. Because the proposed rule is either unconstitutional or duplicative, it should not be adopted\u2026<br/>The Petition seeks to create a category of contribution called \u201cValuable Information,\u201d defined by a multifactor test that uses language like \u201cnon-trivial\u201d and \u201ctraditional[]\u201d in the place of actionable definitions. This alone is problematic, for the regulation does not give adequate notice on what will be trivial, traditional, or traditionally trivial\u2026<br/>To the extent \u201cValuable Information\u201d goes beyond 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.52(d)(1) and related provisions, the proposed regulation runs into trouble. Terms like a \u201cnon-trivial amount for the recipient to obtain\u201d is not a workable standard for the regulated community. What is trivial? How much effort is too much effort? The same questions apply to the term \u201cnot freely available to the public.\u201d If a committee could point to a small corner of the Internet with the information, is that enough to defeat the definition? The FEC will be inundated with advisory opinion requests trying to figure out what is and is not \u201ctrivial\u201d or \u201cnot freely available to the public.\u201d These ambiguities are especially troubling since, as already discussed, the Petition seeks to initiate investigations premised on these vague concepts while bypassing a vote of the Commission itself.<br/>PDF of comments available here<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Liberal Meltdown at the FEC<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>For an example of why so many Americans perceive administrative agencies as partisan and unaccountable, look at the antics of Federal Election Commission Chair Ellen Weintraub, who has inserted her agency into the Trump impeachment debate and distorted campaign-finance law.<br/>Last week Democrats started calling for President Trump\u2019s impeachment over his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ms. Weintraub, who has been publicly baiting Mr. Trump for months, posted to the FEC website a draft campaign-finance interpretation designed to suggest the President had committed a crime. Another FEC commissioner, Caroline Hunter, objected to the rule\u2019s inclusion in the FEC\u2019s email digest without further discussion. That could lend the agency\u2019s imprimatur to a partisan stunt.<br/>The digest was never sent out. Ms. Weintraub then reproduced the digest in a series of tweets Friday, which have been retweeted more than ten thousand times. She wrote, \u201cI always thought these anti-regulatory people\u201d-presumably referring to Ms. Hunter-\u201cliked the First Amendment well enough. I guess they think it\u2019s just for corporations.\u201d\u2026<br/>The rule Ms. Weintraub proposes would likely be unconstitutional. If any \u201cinformation\u201d offered \u201cin connection with an election\u201d is prohibited, then gossip between an American campaign staffer and a noncitizen Uber driver ahead of an election could be prosecuted. There\u2019s a reason the Mueller report said treating \u201copposition research or similar information as a thing of value\u201d could \u201craise First Amendment questions.\u201d Perhaps \u201canti-regulatory people\u201d simply want to follow the Constitution\u2026<br/>Regardless of whether Congress impeaches, Mr. Trump will one day leave office. But by casting aside constitutional considerations and shedding even the appearance of impartiality, bureaucrats like Ms. Weintraub are inflicting serious damage to public confidence in U.S. institutions that may last far longer.<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Election chief, GOP colleague at odds over who kept a foreign activity memo from wide release<br/>By Alex Horton<br/>[FEC Commissioner Caroline Hunter]\u00a0said she asked Weintraub for time to evaluate the document before it was included in the digest. \u201cUnfortunately, she refused to publish the digest without her document,\u201d Hunter told The Washington Post on Tuesday.<br/>\u201cI have requested it to be released today in the digest with her document,\u201d she said, including her own statement that says putting forth such documents was futile because they don\u2019t currently have enough commissioners to meet.<br/>\u201cUnder these circumstances, a discussion in an open meeting without a quorum would be a useless and misleading exercise. I cannot participate in my colleague\u2019s efforts to grandstand,\u201d she said in separate statement\u2026<br/>Hunter said she takes foreign interference in elections seriously, and pointed to her voting record in her statement. But, she added, nuances of foreign interference in everyday life \u2013 and in possibly innocuous situations \u2013 make the matter complicated when restrictions are broadened, necessitating a more careful look at such regulations.<br/>\u201cParticularly with an issue as sensitive and troubling as foreign interference in American elections, however, it is crucial that Commissioners act prudently and judiciously,\u201d she said.<br/>FEC:\u00a0Statement of Commissioner Caroline C. Hunter on Consideration of Matters Without a Quorum<br/>Late last week, my colleague, Ellen Weintraub, unilaterally and without advance notice, made public a draft interpretative rule regarding the Act\u2019s foreign national ban and placed it on the agenda for the open meeting of October 17, 2019. Approval of such a document, however, requires a quorum of four Commissioners, which we currently lack. Under these circumstances, a discussion in an open meeting without a quorum would be a useless and misleading exercise. I cannot participate in my colleague\u2019s efforts to grandstand.<br/>Despite erroneous press reports, we all agree that federal law clearly prohibits a foreign national from making a contribution, donation, expenditure, or disbursement in connection with a Federal, State, or local election, and no person may solicit such a contribution or donation from a foreign national. For decades, the Commission has enforced this ban, and I stand by my votes to do so. But the Commission currently lacks a quorum to take official action on most substantive matters, and I object to actions that create the misimpression that the Commission can do more than is permissible under the circumstances.<br/>My concerns about discussing in open meeting a proposal that cannot be adopted do not impair my colleague\u2019s ability to speak on issues within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction (subject to the Act\u2019s confidentiality requirement). Particularly with an issue as sensitive and troubling as foreign interference in American elections, however, it is crucial that Commissioners act prudently and judiciously.<br/>Fox News:\u00a0Pro-Trump super PAC files FEC complaint against DNC over Ukraine outreach<br/>By\u00a0Andrew Keiper<br/>The complaint, filed by the pro-Trump Committee to Defend the President, hinges on the work of Alexandra Chalupa, a contractor hired by the DNC during the 2016 election. The DNC, the complaint alleges, \u201ctasked Chalupa with obtaining incriminating or derogatory information about Donald Trump \u2026 [and] Paul Manfort.\u201d<br/>In May, Fox News reported that the UkrainianEembassy confirmed that Chalupa had pushed for Ukrainian officials to publicly mention Manafort\u2019s financial and political ties to the country\u2026<br/>Chalupa, according to the complaint, sought to have the Ukrainian government provide her information about Manafort\u2019s work in the country. She was encouraged by the DNC to meet with former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to gain insight that would theoretically boost Hillary Clinton\u2019s bid for president\u2026<br/>Ken Vogel, a New York Times reporter who wrote about the story for Politico in 2017, tweeted that Chalupa wasn\u2019t representing the DNC during her meetings with Ukrainian officials. That point is overlooked in the complaint, which alleges that acquiring something of value in a political campaign from a foreign government is a violation of campaign finance.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Austin American-Statesman:\u00a0Lawsuit: Texas limits on drone photos violate free speech<br/>By\u00a0Chuck Lindell<br/>A federal lawsuit filed Thursday in Austin seeks to strike down Texas laws that restrict what can legally be photographed by drones.<br/>Filed by two journalism organizations and a reporter, the lawsuit argues that a 2013 law places improper limits on news gathering, violating the First Amendment by making it a crime to capture images of private property, or a person on that property, no matter where the drone is flying.<br/>The law bans the use of drones with the \u201cintent to conduct surveillance,\u201d a phrase that is not defined and is vague enough to include most news-gathering activities, allowing for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, the lawsuit argued\u2026<br/>The lawsuit also challenged a provision added in 2015 that bans all drone use below 400 feet above sports venues, prisons and \u201ccritical infrastructure facilities,\u201d including oil fields, pipelines, refineries and animal feedlots.<br/>Because Federal Aviation Administration regulations ban drones from flying above 400 feet, \u201cthe no-fly provisions function as a near absolute ban on the use of (drones) in these locations,\u201d the lawsuit argued\u2026<br/>According to the lawsuit, the state\u2019s drone laws have hampered efforts to document conditions of a facility that houses immigrant children and prompted threats from San Marcos police after a San Antonio Express-News photographer tried to document the aftermath of the Iconic Village apartment fire that left five dead in 2018.<br/>\u201cThe threat of criminal sanction for engaging in this protected conduct effectively censors critical comment by the press,\u201d said the lawsuit, filed by the National Press Photographers Association, the Texas Press Association (of which the American-Statesman is a member) and freelance journalist Joseph Pappalardo.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>The Hill:\u00a0House Ethics Committee reviewing two GOP lawmakers over campaign finance<br/>By\u00a0Cristina Marcos<br/>The committee announced that it is extending reviews of Reps. Ross Spano (R-Fla.) and Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) and would announce next steps, such as deciding to open formal investigations, by Nov. 14.<br/>Spano is under scrutiny for accepting about $180,000 in loans from friends and using it for his congressional campaign as if it were his own money\u2026<br/>Huizenga, meanwhile, faced a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint from the Michigan Democratic Party alleging that he misused campaign funds for personal expenses.<br/>The FEC later recommended a dismissal of the allegations after finding no \u201creasonable inference\u201d that Huizenga\u2019s campaign used campaign funds for personal use, according to The Detroit News\u2026<br/>The Ethics Committee also announced earlier Monday that it is extending a review of freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) over accepting a salary from her 2018 campaign.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Political Parties</emphasis><br/>Politico:\u00a0Dems seek lobbyist cash to fund Milwaukee convention<br/>By\u00a0Maggie Severns and Theodoric Meyer<br/>Two top operatives planning the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 convention in Milwaukee went to K Street last week to pitch lobbyists on their plans for the $70 million event.<br/>Against the backdrop of the Democratic primary, it was an awkward pairing \u2013 representatives for special interests meeting with top Democrats while the party\u2019s leading presidential candidates reject corporate PAC and lobbyist cash. But Democratic National Committee officials explained during the meeting how corporations can help foot the bill for the convention, regardless of who the nominee is, addressing some lobbyists\u2019 worries that a crusading left-wing nominee like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could try to reject corporate money, embarrassing convention sponsors.<br/>The DNC doesn\u2019t plan to return any corporate money that is donated to the convention regardless of the nominee, convention CEO Joe Solmonese told POLITICO\u2026<br/>According to a summary of event packages obtained by POLITICO, which the convention planners circulated at the meeting with lobbyists, the perks for a $300,000 donation include access to two well-located hotel rooms. The price is steep even by the expensive standard of national party conventions: In 2016, a $200,000 donation included five hotel rooms at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia\u2026<br/>Asked what the DNC would do if the Democratic nominee asked for corporate donations to be returned, Solmonese said the DNC has to get the convention \u201cappropriately funded and get it paid for well in advance,\u201d which means accepting corporate PAC donations.<br/>\u201cWe can\u2019t know and try to, nor can I ever suggest that we ever try to, bend this towards any one candidate\u2019s philosophy,\u201d Solmonese said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>The Hill:\u00a0Free speech suppression online builds case to break up Big Tech<br/>By\u00a0Donald Trump Jr.<br/>As I have written many times, the greatest threat to free speech and our democracy today is not the government, but the technology giants that deplatform people at the behest of liberals and then justify the action as \u201ccombating hate\u201d and making the internet somehow safer\u2026<br/>The sustained pattern of leftward bias both within the companies themselves and in their conduct around elections has been clearly established. After all, when is the last time you heard a liberal complain about being unfairly stifled on social media?<br/>Technology companies are now openly claiming that they can engage in biased censorship, with Facebook arguing in court that it has the right to censor content because it is a publisher. If it were not for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the admission that it is a publisher would make Facebook liable for every word of defamation and slander on its various platforms. Instead, Facebook escapes liability because it is a provider of \u201cinteractive computer services\u201d protected specifically because it offers a forum for a \u201ctrue diversity of political discourse.\u201d\u2026<br/>The disdain shown by technology companies for viewpoint neutrality and their refusal to be honest about it shows the threat of the Silicon Valley monopoly over the modern public square.<br/>Thanks in large part to the White House, people are recognizing the gravity of the situation. A majority of Americans support breaking up the technology giants, including a majority of liberals, while 50 state and territory attorneys general have brought the first antitrust investigation of its kind against Google. This comes in addition to antitrust investigations into Google, Facebook, and Amazon that have already been announced by both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Reason:\u00a0Why Is the Colorado Governor\u2019s Office Trying to Censor Rural News Outlets?<br/>By Scott Shackford<br/>[W]hen two small Colorado newspapers, the Kiowa County Press in Eads, and the Chronicle-News in Trinidad, published the story, they heard from Conor Cahill, Polis\u2019 spokesman, who asked them to take the articles down.<br/>Cahill did not challenge any of the facts presented in the story. He, instead, objected to them having run news stories from The Center Square because he does not see them as an objective source of information. The Center Square is a product of the Franklin News Foundation\u2026<br/>Cahill\u2019s argument is that donors to Franklin News Foundation may come from libertarian or conservative backgrounds, and the fact that writer Draplin is also an editor at The Daily Caller, a right-leaning outlet, apparently taints everything The Center Square writes, even if the story is completely accurate\u2026 In an email to The Denver Post, Cahill explains his justification for reaching out to these newspapers:<br/>\u201cWhen we looked into this group and discovered that it was not an objective wire service, but instead a branded website funded by the Koch Brothers\u2019 political organization, we were alarmed that it was being reprinted by reputable news outlets in the state. The people of Colorado deserve quality, objective news they can trust so they can make their own informed decisions\u2026\u201d \u2026<br/>What\u2019s alarming here is that, again, he provides no evidence that anything written in the very brief news story is inaccurate, just written by a group that gets funding from people with an agenda might not match that of the governor\u2019s office. Cahill is also implying that an organization with a political bent cannot also produce fact-based journalism. This would come as news to publications like Rolling Stone, Mother Jones, and, well, Reason.<br/>And without question, it\u2019s most certainly not the place of the governor\u2019s press office-whose role is to push forward Polis\u2019 agenda to the media-to be weighing in on what \u201cobjective\u201d journalism is. That\u2019s especially true since Cahill, upon repeated request, cannot actually point to anything in The Center Square\u2019s piece that is factually inaccurate.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 10/1 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-77038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5W-6921-DY1R-B3M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3120\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COMMON CAUSE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Hebdon, is challenging Alaska's stringent campaign finance rules that limit how much candidates for state-level offices can raise from out of state.<br/>Wisconsin resident David Thompson filed the case after he tried to give $100 in 2015 to the re-election bid of his brother-in-law, former Alaska state Rep. Wes Keller. Thompson's contribution couldn't be accepted because the Republican lawmaker had already reached the $3,000 limit on out-of-state contributions to his campaign...<br/>The case is now pending before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after a lower court upheld the contribution limit.<br/>One of Alaska's legal arguments has been that the contribution limit is analogous to the federal ban on foreign money in U.S. elections. \"Just as a Canadian citizen is not part of the political community governed by the U.S. federal government, a Florida resident is not part of the political community governed by the Alaska state government,\" the state's attorneys wrote in court filings.<br/>But David Keating, president of the Institute for Free Speech, which supports the deregulation of campaign finance, said the analogy falls short on a fundamental point.<br/>\"It's quite different from Russian money influencing U.S. elections,\" Keating said. \"Alaska isn't an independent, sovereign state that can do whatever it wants to do. It has to respect the people's constitutional rights just like the other 49 states do - unless, of course, it manages to secede from the country.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance Sues State Over Compelled Speech Requirements<br/>Today, Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance (MassFiscal), a nonpartisan nonprofit represented by the Institute for Free Speech, will file a federal lawsuit alleging that some Massachusetts campaign finance laws are unconstitutional. Unlike most states, Massachusetts requires ads that name candidates within 90 days of a general election to include a statement from a principal officer of the organization running the ad, a list of the organization's top five contributors, and a link to a government website. The group believes this information is irrelevant and cannot be required in disclaimers.<br/>\"There is no legitimate reason for the government to require a group's CEO to appear on-screen during an ad. Nor is there justification for listing individual donors on ads they may know nothing about. These requirements simply raise the cost of speaking about government by forcing speakers to waste their resources promoting the government's message,\"\u00a0explained Institute for Free Speech Legal Director Allen Dickerson...<br/>\"The two major revisions to our state's campaign finance laws that have occurred over the last several years are classic examples of intimidation legislation, plain and simple. Our state government should be working to expand our First Amendment rights, not contract them. This lawsuit is not about getting rid of disclosure. Rather, this is about removing intimidation from the process,\"\u00a0commented Paul Craney, a member of the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance Board of Directors and spokesman for the organization...<br/>MassFiscal wants to advertise legislative scorecards and educate the public on the Legislature's vote to increase its pay while raising taxes. However, MassFiscal will choose silence rather than allow the government to co-opt its message and violate the rights of its members.<br/>MassFiscal's dilemma illustrates the ultimate effect of political speech laws: fewer groups are willing to speak about government...<br/>To read more about the case,\u00a0click here.<br/>Verified Complaint in Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance v. Sullivan (U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts)<br/>\"[T]he First Amendment 'has its fullest and most urgent application'\" in the context of \"[f]ree discussion about candidates for public office.\" Eu v. S.F. Cty. Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989) (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 272 (1971)).<br/>Nevertheless, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts compels speakers that mention representatives or candidates for office to accompany their \"nonpartisan public discussion of issues of public importance,\" Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.2d 821, 870 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (en banc), with a number of State-mandated pronouncements, some publicizing otherwise private information.<br/>Plaintiff contends that this compulsory regime, principally codified at Massachusetts General Laws chapter 55, \u00a7 18G and its attending regulations, violates the First Amendment's instruction, incorporated against the States by operation of the Fourteenth Amendment, that governments \"shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech.\" U.S. Const. amend. I.<br/>Additionally, these requirements unconstitutionally infringe upon the First Amendment liberty of all Americans \"to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others in so doing.\" NAACP v. Ala., 357 U.S. 449, 466 (1958).<br/>Brief for Amicus Curiae Institute for Free Speech in Support of Respondent in Nieves v. Bartlett (U.S. Supreme Court)<br/>With Floyd Abrams, Counsel of Record<br/>If this Court were to create a new exception to Mount Healthy which barred retaliatory arrest claims in cases in which probable cause can be demonstrated, people could be arrested in retaliation for criticizing the police or offending them for any reason, including their expression of political views not shared by a particular police officer. In a nation awash with criminal statutes that are enforced with varying degrees of regularity-and thus often generally unenforced-it is not difficult to find probable cause to arrest. For example, the case at hand arose in Alaska, a state that regulates alcohol so strictly that it is illegal to be intoxicated inside a bar or any other establishment licensed to sell liquor. AS \u00a7 04.16.040 (\"A drunken person may not knowingly enter or remain on premises licensed under this title.\"). This statute is routinely violated, but police retain the discretion to enforce it, and have stated to the press that they do so selectively. It is not difficult to imagine a plainclothes policeman who cannot feasibly arrest every intoxicated person on the premises being drawn to target a patron loudly proclaiming political views with which the officer vehemently disagrees.<br/>Petitioners acknowledge, as they must, that their framework \"might preclude recovery for meritorious claims.\" Pet Br. at 48. Notwithstanding their acknowledgement of the risk, articulated by this Court in Lozman, that \"some police officers may exploit the arrest power as a means of suppressing speech,\" Pet Br. at 49 (quoting Lozman, 138 S. Ct. at 1953), they maintain that the likelihood that officers will actually suppress speech is minimal in practice, and that the speech suppressed is not terribly important. Pet Br. at 51-52. These contentions simply overlook numerous non-hypothetical scenarios memorialized in court cases and news reports.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Amendment\u00a0</emphasis><br/>ACLU:\u00a0Trump Administration Seeks to Stifle Protests Near White House and on National Mall<br/>By Arthur Spitzer<br/>[T]he Trump administration proposes to dramatically limit the right to demonstrate near the White House and on the National Mall, including in ways that would violate court orders that have stood for decades. The proposal would close 80 percent of the White House sidewalk, put new limits on spontaneous demonstrations, and open the door to charging fees for protesting.<br/>Fee requirements could make mass protests like Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic 1963 March on Washington and its \"I have a dream\" speech too expensive to happen.<br/>The public has until October 15 to comment on the plans, and on Monday, we submitted our\u00a0formal written comment\u00a0explaining why the planned changes are unconstitutional.<br/>In 1967, in the middle of the Vietnam War, the federal government tried to impose severe limits on protests near the White House. The ACLU of the District of Columbia sued, and after years of litigation, the courts rebuffed the government's effort and\u00a0reminded\u00a0the National Park Service, which administers these areas, that Lafayette Park is not Yellowstone and that the White House area and the National Mall \"constitute a unique [site] for the exercise of First Amendment rights.\" Under court orders, the park service issued\u00a0regulations\u00a0allowing large demonstrations, guaranteeing quick action on applications for permits, and accommodating spontaneous protests as much as possible. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Reason:\u00a0Partisans United Against Free Speech<br/>By Matt Welch<br/>The Supreme Court this June expanded First Amendment protections to cover public employees who don't want the state extracting union dues, voters who seek to wear political clothing or paraphernalia at the polls, and some businesses that chafe at being told by the government that they must display certain information...<br/>The citizenry, meanwhile, was moving in the opposite direction. In a memo leaked in June, staffers at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) agonized that the organization's fabled commitment to the First Amendment might have a \"harmful impact on the equality and justice work to which we are also committed.\" All summer long, rightists and leftists took turns trying to get their political opponents fired from their jobs and banished from social media platforms over speech deemed intolerable. Even on the Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan warned that her conservative colleagues were \"weaponizing the First Amendment.\" ...<br/>[W]e don't have to wait to see whether the cultural turn against free speech will filter into law and the enforcement thereof. It's already happening...<br/>[E]ven on issues like antitrust enforcement and the long-dead, ill-advised Fairness Doctrine, Republican politicians and commentators are abandoning positions they've held for decades...<br/>Politicians respond to incentives created by voters, and right now voters want speech suppressed. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and nine of their colleagues have asked the FCC to consider revoking Sinclair's license altogether, based on content concerns. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) recently said that breaking up big tech companies in the name of free speech is an issue he is \"looking at seriously.\" ...<br/>The culture of free speech has been deteriorating for long enough that politics, sadly and predictably, is catching up.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>The Atlantic:\u00a0The Trump Campaign Says Exploiting Hacked Emails Is Free Speech<br/>By Natasha Bertrand<br/>In a motion to dismiss a new lawsuit accusing President Donald Trump's campaign team of illegally conspiring with Russian agents to disseminate stolen emails during the election, Trump campaign lawyers have tried out a new defense: free speech.<br/>The lawsuit, filed last month by two donors and one former employee of the Democratic National Committee, alleges that the Trump campaign, along with former Trump adviser Roger Stone, worked with Russia and WikiLeaks to publish hacked DNC emails, thereby violating their privacy.<br/>But the Trump campaign-represented by Jeffrey Baltruzak, Michael A. Carvin, Nikki L. McArthur, and Vivek Suri, all of the law firm Jones Day-responded in a brief filed Tuesday that the campaign can't be held legally responsible for WikiLeaks's publication of the DNC emails.<br/>Furthermore, the Trump lawyers argued, the First Amendment protects the campaign's \"right to disclose information-even stolen information-so long as (1) the speaker did not participate in the theft and (2) the information deals with matters of public concern.\"<br/>Inside Sources:\u00a0PayPal, Tech Companies Have the Right to Free Association<br/>By Michael McGrady<br/>Alex Jones, the controversial right-wing conspiracy theorist, filed a lawsuit on behalf of his holdings company against PayPal. Jones' suit is a result of PayPal's business decision to cancel merchant accounts for his Infowars web store...<br/>According to the suit brought by Jones and his counsel, PayPal's actions, in this case, are a violation of the First Amendment. Not to mention, the suit claims discrimination under the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, unfair business practices, monopolization of a particular market segment, and failure to act in good faith on the part of PayPal and the company's working relationship with Jones and his properties.<br/>The sentiment that eludes the suit, based on a sampling of legal experts, is a recognition of PayPal's right to regulate usage of its platform.<br/>If you apply the principal protections of the Communications Decency Act, Section 230, under settled federal positive law, PayPal, as an interactive computer service broadly defined under this statute, can pursue \"any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\" Berin Szoka of TechFreedom, a tech policy think tank, believes that this standard merits dismissal of this case.<br/>\"I've read the complaint,\" he said. \"This will be tossed out on 230 grounds easily.\" ...<br/>Elliot Harmon of the Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote: \"Online platforms are within their First Amendment rights to moderate their online platforms however they like, and they're additionally shielded by Section 230 for many types of liability for their users' speech. It's not one or the other. It's both.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>San Diego Union-Tribune:\u00a0Federal election officials question Rep. Duncan Hunter campaign's identification of donors<br/>By Morgan Cook<br/>The Federal Election Commission sent a letter to Hunter's campaign treasurer this week informing him that \"information requested per best efforts\" is not an acceptable answer to the question of a contributor's occupation or employer - information that was missing not just for Hunter's uncle on Hunter's campaign forms...<br/>James H. Hunter is among more than 90 donors for whom Hunter's campaign has reported employer and occupation as \"information requested per best efforts\" since 2007, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune's review of FEC records. Their contributions totaled more than $67,000.<br/>Hunter and his wife and former campaign manager, Margaret, were indicted in August on 60 counts of felony crimes including fraud and conspiracy to knowingly falsify entries in reports to federal agencies including the FEC. The couple allegedly committed the crimes to cover up more than $250,000 allegedly stolen from Hunter's campaign over several years. The two pleaded not guilty to all charges at their federal court hearing in August and were quickly released on bond.<br/>The letter this week regarding missing occupational information is unrelated to the criminal case - although the origin of the criminal investigation was a similar inquiry letter from the FEC about campaign reports. The FEC is asking Hunter's campaign to amend its filings to add occupation information or to document its \"best efforts\" to gather the information.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>MetroWest Daily News:\u00a0Question 2 asks Massachusetts voters to consider money in politics<br/>By Eli Sherman<br/>American Promise is the organization behind the political group People Govern, Not Money, which is calling on voters to approve Question No. 2. The ballot measure, which voters will address on Nov. 6, would establish a nonpartisan, 15-member Citizens Commission to consider and recommend an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<br/>The amendment - if approved by Congress and ratified by the states - would essentially overhaul the current system of political finance, including the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Citizens United that determined campaign spending by companies and other groups is protected by the free-speech clause of the First Amendment...<br/>American Promise is pushing the idea across the country, claiming to have established grassroots operations in all 50 states. The group is led by its president, Jeff Clements, a lawyer who served under former Mass. Attorney General Martha Coakley.<br/>The nonprofit, which touts widespread bipartisan support, has set a goal to get the amendment - which would become the 28th Amendment - ratified within the next seven to eight years. The Mass. Citizens Commission would become the first in the nation, and Gubits hopes it will be replicated in other states.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-38973</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3142\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 10, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0008F3U</classCode><className>SIOUX FALLS ARGUS LEADER</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Ads\u00a0must also include an on-camera statement from the organization's principal officer.</p><p><br/>Allen Dickerson, director of the Virginia-based Institute for Free Speech, who is filing the case for the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, said the eight seconds it takes to state the government disclosure in an ad costs organizations hundreds of dollars. \"These requirements simply raise the cost of speaking about government by forcing speakers to waste their resources promoting the government's message,\" Dickerson said.<br/>The Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance says it wants to run TV, radio and online ads in Sen. Marc Pacheco's district. Pacheco, a Taunton Democrat, is not facing a contested election. The ads call attention to legislative votes to raise taxes on income over $1 million and to raise lawmakers' pay.<br/>The Alliance says if the regulations are not repealed, it will not run the ads.<br/>The group objects to the need to disclose donors who only gave to the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance's general purpose, not to the particular ad; to the extra time and space needed in the ads, including the need to publish the address of the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance's website; and to the requirement that the chairman appear on camera. They say the names of these donors are \"irrelevant,\" and it is also irrelevant to require the chairman to appear on camera and reveal personal characteristics, such as race, gender and disability.<br/>The group says the disclosure laws infringe on its\u00a0First Amendment rights.\u00a0<br/>\"The only way that the Alliance ... can avoid these burdens is to remain silent,\" attorneys for the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance wrote in the lawsuit.<br/>Courthouse News Service:\u00a0Opponents of Millionaire Tax Fight Massachusetts Disclosure Rules<br/>By Zack Huffman<br/>A conservative nonprofit that plans to attack Massachusetts taxes in a pre-election ad campaign brought a\u00a0federal complaint\u00a0Wednesday to keep its donors secret.<br/>Represented by Foley Hoag and the Institute for Free Speech, the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance would fall under the state's reporting scheme merely because it plans to mention state Senator Marc Pacheco in an ad.<br/>But the alliance insists that mentioning Pacheco is not sufficient to compel its speech. Since the \"does not promote, support, attack, or oppose a specific candidate,\" it says it should be allowed to keep its donors private as a 501c4 organization.<br/>\"The alliance's ads are about legislative issues regarding the revenue generation and spending priorities of the Massachusetts General Court, not the evaluation of candidacies for office - indeed, while Senator Pacheco is up for re-election, he is running uncontested,\" the 32-page complaint states...<br/>Because ads mention a candidate's name and air within 90 days of an election, meanwhile, the state would have the alliance include a statement of support from one of its officers and identify its top five donors. Such requirements were created by laws passed in 2010 and 2014.<br/>\"The two major revisions to our state's campaign finance laws that have occurred over the last several years are classic examples of intimidation legislation, plain and simple,\" Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance spokesman Paul Craney said in a statement. \"Our state government should be working to expand our First Amendment rights, not contract them. This lawsuit is not about getting rid of disclosure. Rather, this is about removing intimidation from the process.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supreme Court\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Election Law Blog:\u00a0Utah Republican Party Files Interesting Cert Petition on Whether State Can Force Parties to Use Primary Rather than Caucus<br/>By Rick Hasen<br/>You can find the cert. petition in Utah Republican Party v. Cox at this link. Here are the questions presented:<br/>As a private expressive association, \"[a] political party\" enjoys a general First Amendment right \"to choose a candidate-selection process that will in its view produce the nominee who best represents its political platform.\" N.Y. Bd. Of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196, 202 (2008). The First Amendment thus gives \"special protection\" to \"the process by which a political party selects a standard bearer\" California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 575 (2000). Here, however, the Tenth Circuit has joined the Ninth in permitting a government to force a political party to select candidates through a primary rather than a caucus system, for the viewpoint-based purpose of avoiding candidates with \"extreme views.\"<br/>The questions presented are:<br/>Does the First Amendment permit a government to compel a political party to use a state-preferred process for selecting a party's standard-bearers for a general election, not to prevent discrimination or unfairness, but to alter the predicted viewpoints of those standard-bearers?<br/>When evaluating the First Amendment burden of a law affecting expressive associations, may a court consider only the impact on the association's members, instead of analyzing the burden on the association itself, as defined by its own organizational structure?<br/>Cato:\u00a0Objecting to Compelled Speech Is More than Sour Grapes<br/>By\u00a0Ilya Shapiro\u00a0and Michael Finch<br/>In Delano Farms v. California Table Grape Commission, Cato, joined by the Reason Foundation, Institute for Justice, and DKT Liberty Project, is continuing to support a farm business's challenge to a California state-established commission that compels grape growers to contribute money for government-endorsed advertisements. We had previously filed in the California Supreme Court, which was a losing battle, and are now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case...<br/>The California Table Grapes Commission has claimed that it is part of the government and that its speech is thus \"government speech.\" But the commission isn't the government; it's a commercial entity or trade group that uses compelled subsidies to fund speech...<br/>[N]o person employed by the California government has ever written, produced, or even reviewed the speech the commission compels. In all other cases where the government programs were held constitutional, the government took direct control of the message and maintained oversight of a regulatory entity. None of that is true here. The commission here is a private entity, with the power to exact fees from members who have no choice but to pay for whatever message it ends up promoting.<br/>In our brief, we argue that the Supreme Court should take this case and treat forced subsidies for generic advertising the same way it treats other such subsidies: as violations of the First Amendment freedoms of speech and association. The California courts relied on a decision recently overturned in the Supreme Court's Janus holding this past June, in which compelled association and speech in union representation was deemed a violation of the First Amendment. The Court should continue with this line of reasoning here: no one should be compelled to support a non-government message.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Politico:\u00a0Mueller gets longest sentence yet for man who helped Russian trolls<br/>By Darren Samuelsohn<br/>A federal judge on Wednesday sentenced a California man to six months in prison and six months of home confinement after he pleaded guilty to a felony identity fraud charge tied to Russian troll activity that rocked the 2016 presidential campaign.<br/>The sentence for Richard Pinedo, 28, is the most severe penalty handed down yet in special counsel Robert Mueller's high-profile investigation into Moscow's meddling to help elect President Donald Trump.<br/>Pinedo's case stemmed from his admission in February to unwittingly selling stolen bank accounts to Russian internet trolls who used the credentials to buy internet ads that sowed discord among Americans in the lead-up to Trump's upset victory almost two years ago.<br/>In brief statement before U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich handed down his sentence, Pinedo said he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions and pleaded for leniency because of both his full cooperation with Mueller's investigators and the threats that he's experienced since being publicly identified in the wider Russian efforts to influence the White House race...<br/>Pinedo said his life had been turned \"upside down,\" and that he worried for his safety after his home address was published online. \"Every knock on the door comes with anxiety about who it may be,\" he said.<br/>While Friedrich's sentence was the longest Mueller has obtained, it was on the low end of the sentencing guideline recommendations.<br/>Cook County Record:\u00a0Uber, Lyft video ads maker, City Hall face off in court over Chicago's ridesharing ad ban<br/>By Dan Churney<br/>Technology company Vugo Inc. and the city of Chicago both filed court papers Oct. 5, regarding the lawsuit the company brought in February 2017 against the city in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois...\u00a0<br/>Vugo defeated the city's attempt to dismiss the lawsuit in August 2017. Now, Vugo and the city have lodged motions for summary judgment, which would declare one or the other the victor.\u00a0<br/>In 2014, Chicago enacted a ridehailing ordinance that prohibited ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft from displaying commercial advertising on or inside their vehicles...\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Under Vugo's service, drivers download an app onto tablet computers, which then generates interactive advertising...<br/>Vugo said it is paid by advertisers, and then pays a percentage of revenue, which could be about $100 per month, to drivers using its service.\u00a0<br/>Vugo said it wants to offer this service in Chicago, but Chicago's ordinance allegedly stifles the company's right to free speech and, because the ordinance doesn't similarly effect traditional taxis, also runs counter to the constitutional guarantee of equal protection before the law...<br/>The city is contending commercial speech enjoys less protection than other speech and the ban\u00a0promotes safety, aesthetics and passenger comfort by reducing \"visual and audio clutter,\" which can distract drivers and pedestrians, as well as intrude on \"captive\" passengers.\u00a0<br/>Further, the ban prevents private ride-hailing vehicles from having exterior adornment that could cause them to look like taxis, which prevents people from confusing a Uber or a Lyft for a taxi, in the city's view.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>New York Times:\u00a0Made and Distributed in the U.S.A.: Online Disinformation<br/>By Sheera Frenkel<br/>In 2016, before the presidential election, state-backed Russian operatives exploited Facebook and Twitter to sway voters in the United States with divisive messages. Now, weeks before the midterm elections on Nov. 6, such influence campaigns are increasingly a domestic phenomenon fomented by Americans on the left and the right... <br/>The shift toward domestic disinformation raises potential free speech issues when Facebook and Twitter find and curtail such accounts that originate in the United States...<br/>On Thursday, Facebook said it had identified 559 pages and 251 accounts run by Americans, many of which amplified false and misleading content in a coordinated fashion. The company said it would remove the pages and accounts. Among them were Right Wing News, which had more than 3.1 million followers, and left-wing pages that included the Resistance and Reverb Press, which had 240,000 and 816,000 followers.<br/>Facebook said it would be the most domestic pages and accounts it had ever removed related to influence campaigns...<br/>\"If you look at volume, the majority of the information operations we see are domestic actors,\" said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of security. He added that the company was struggling with taking down the domestic networks because of the blurry lines between free speech and disinformation...<br/>Domestic disinformation is harder to root out than foreign disinformation, researchers said, because in many cases it mirrors genuine networks of Americans engaging in free speech online.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Washington Examiner:\u00a0Senate committee votes to ban foreigners who interfere in US elections<br/>By Kelly Cohen<br/>The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday passed legislation that would ban foreign nationals who try to interfere with U.S. elections.<br/>The Defending Elections against Trolls from Enemy Regimes, or the DETER Act, is aimed at cracking down on people outside the U.S. who try to change the outcome of elections, an issue members of both parties have raised as a priority this year. Under the bill, which passed in a unanimous voice vote, foreigners who are deemed to have meddled in a U.S. election couldn't get a U.S. entry visa.<br/>The bill targets \"improper interference,\" which is defined as conduct that violates federal criminal, voting rights, or campaign finance law, or is under the direction of a foreign government. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sponsored the DETER Act...<br/>The passage of the DETER Act out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and to the full Senate floor comes with less than a month until the November midterms.<br/>Still, there is no immediate guarantee Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will call it up on the Senate floor before the midterm elections in November.<br/>Last month, Trump signed an executive order authorizing sanctions against foreigners who seek to meddle in U.S. elections.<br/>American Prospect:\u00a0House Democratic Challengers Demand Campaign-Finance Reforms<br/>By Fred Wertheimer<br/>The Supreme Court this June expanded First Amendment protections to cover public employees who don't want the state extracting union dues, voters who seek to wear political clothing or paraphernalia at the polls, and some businesses that chafe at being told by the government that they must display certain information...<br/>The citizenry, meanwhile, was moving in the opposite direction. In a memo leaked in June, staffers at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) agonized that the organization's fabled commitment to the First Amendment might have a \"harmful impact on the equality and justice work to which we are also committed.\" All summer long, rightists and leftists took turns trying to get their political opponents fired from their jobs and banished from social media platforms over speech deemed intolerable. Even on the Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan warned that her conservative colleagues were \"weaponizing the First Amendment.\" ...<br/>[W]e don't have to wait to see whether the cultural turn against free speech will filter into law and the enforcement thereof. It's already happening...<br/>[E]ven on issues like antitrust enforcement and the long-dead, ill-advised Fairness Doctrine, Republican politicians and commentators are abandoning positions they've held for decades...<br/>Politicians respond to incentives created by voters, and right now voters want speech suppressed. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and nine of their colleagues have asked the FCC to consider revoking Sinclair's license altogether, based on content concerns. Sen.

Kanefield and\u00a0Christopher M. Proczko<br/>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) released a draft advisory opinion (draft AO) yesterday, holding that a nonprofit corporation providing certain cybersecurity services to candidates and political parties are not in-kind contributions.<br/>Defending Digital Campaigns, Inc. (DDC) is a nonprofit corporation under Washington, D.C., law, exempt from federal income tax under \u00a7 501(c)(4). Its stated purpose is \"to provide education and research for civic institutions on cybersecurity best practices and assist them in implementing technologies, processes, resources, and solutions for enhancing cybersecurity and resilience to hostile cyber acts targeting the domestic democratic process.\" DDC's request for an AO seeks the FEC's guidance on whether the Federal Election Campaign Act, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30101-45 allows DDC to provide certain cybersecurity services, software, and hardware to candidates for federal office and political parties for free or at a reduced cost, or whether those actions would constitute in-kind contributions...<br/>The draft AO determines that DDC's activities would not constitute in-kind contributions. The FEC noted that DDC's organizational structure ensured that its activities remain nonpartisan, and that several provisions of the act and FEC regulations allow corporations to engage in certain nonpartisan activities without those activities being prohibited in-kind contributions (e.g., encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote, distributing registration or voting information, preparing and distributing voter guides). The through-line of these activities, and that DDC's proposed activities share, is that they are offered on an objective, nonpartisan basis and are meant to facilitate the proper functioning of the electoral process rather than to support or oppose any candidate or party.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Vox:\u00a0Citizens United is fueling outsider candidates<br/>By Cory Manento<br/>Political parties and interest groups don't always prefer the same candidates. It used to be that the party-backed candidate had a better chance of winning the nomination, but since the Supreme Court's decision in\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0(2010), interest groups are increasingly calling the shots.<br/>Party organizations are used to seeing their preferred candidates win congressional primaries, due in large part to the spending advantages they can provide. However, since the federal courts have allowed for Super PACs to boost candidates friendly to their agenda, interest groups have been able to spend enough to challenge the party's consensus in congressional primaries if they so choose...<br/>Recent studies have shown that establishment-friendly candidates fared well in congressional primaries in 2018. To be sure, party organization-preferred candidates in my analysis won open seat House primaries more than 60 percent of the time from 2006 to 2016. However, the story becomes more complicated when the party organization and interest groups disagree on which candidate to support.<br/>Though fundraising does not guarantee success, interest groups' preferred candidates have become increasingly successful once limits on their spending were effectively removed. Prior to 2012, the first full primary cycle in which Super PACs existed, the interest groups' preferred candidate defeated the party organization's preferred candidate 29 percent of the time in the races in which the two groups preferred different candidates. From 2012 to 2016, interest group-preferred candidates won 60 percent of the time when interest group and party preferences clashed.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wisconsin John Doe</emphasis><br/>Heartland Institute:\u00a0Wisconsin's John Doe Raids, Five Years Later (Guest: Matt Kittle)<br/>By Jesse Hathaway<br/>Five years ago, Wisconsin law enforcement officers conducted predawn, armed raids on the homes of everyday citizens seeking evidence of campaign finance violations connected to Gov.

Henry McMaster said Wednesday they want to see the state toughen its ethics laws in the wake of a grand jury report into corruption at S.C. State House.<br/>Grand jurors called for a number of reforms in the report, including eliminating \"dark money\" and defining the difference between lobbyists and consultants.<br/>That report said a \"weakness\" in S.C. laws allowed major S.C. institutions to pay GOP consultant Richard Quinn Sr. to exert his influence at the State House without ever disclosing his aid, the state grand jury said in its report Tuesday.<br/>The General Assembly, meanwhile, has \"failed\" to pass legislation that would expose donors behind so-called \"dark money\" - money from unknown sources - that is spent to influence elections and sway S.C. voters, the 270-page report also said.<br/>\"It is shocking that this has gone on,\" said state Rep. Gary Clary, R-Pickens, who, last year, proposed a handful of bills that would have closed loopholes - for example, requiring politicians to disclose which special interests give them money - in the state's ethics laws.<br/>But those proposals went nowhere, never receiving a committee hearing...<br/>State lawmakers and advocates for ethics reform said Wednesday they are ready to see action on \"dark money.\" ...<br/>But passing legislation to overturn state law on dark money will be a tough fight, said state Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield. However, he said, \"dark money (disclosure) is something we definitely ought to push for.\" ...<br/>Gov. McMaster has backed strengthening the state's ethics laws.<br/>On Wednesday, McMaster - who was appointed by former S.C. Gov. Nikki Haley to co-chair an ethics reform task force in 2012 - said he wants to require more special interests to register as lobbyists and strengthen the Ethics Commission.<br/>Quartz:\u00a0Which US state is most corruption-prone? Look away, North Dakota<br/>By Max de Haldevang<br/>The US public has spent the past two years riveted by high-level corruption scandals and allegations in Washington, DC. They should also be looking closer to home, according to a new report by anti-corruption NGO Coalition for Integrity.<br/>The NGO graded all 50 states plus Washington, DC, on the strength of their anti-corruption laws and regulations, and found that only sixteen got a passing grade of 60% or more. North Dakota came in last with 0% and Wyoming behind it at 12%.<br/>Both states have some draft measures on the horizon. However, at present, North Dakota doesn't have any rules against officials accepting gifts of any size from lobbyist. It also has no ethics commission; doesn't require that outside entities like Political Action Committees disclose their contributors; and doesn't ask sitting lawmakers to file any financial disclosures.<br/>In contrast, Washington and California come out on top, with scores of 78% and 75%, respectively...<br/>The report, named the S.W.A.M.P. Index, grades each state according to how its corruption and ethics framework hold up to eight questions, focused on: whether they have an ethics enforcement agency (and whether it has any teeth); rules around giving gifts to officials; campaign finance reporting requirements for entities like PACs; and officials' personal finance reporting requirements. Most weight was given to the strength of enforcement and the rules surrounding gifts.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-39119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 11, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Smith, Lee E. Goodman, and Michael E. Toner<br/>A Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election recommends that Congress consider mandating \u201cpaid for by\u201d tags for online political advertisements. In response, Democrats are renewing a push to pass a bill misleadingly called the Honest Ads Act. The legislation has some bipartisan support; its co-sponsors include Sen. Lindsey Graham and 18 House Republicans. But the bill, which goes far beyond the Senate report\u2019s recommendation, wouldn\u2019t prevent foreign meddling and it would harm First Amendment rights.</p><p><br/>The FEC already requires online advertisers to identify themselves on ads that support or oppose candidates. As former FEC chairmen, we know these rules need updating, but a rule-making to do so, which we support, is already before the FEC\u2026<br/>Advocates of the bill argue that television and radio are regulated, so why not the internet too? But regulation of broadcast outlets evolved around the limited nature of the spectrum. That\u2019s not an issue with the internet, and the speech-related burdens of regulating online advertising are much greater because of the sheer volume of content.<br/>When states have implemented similar restrictions, the liability has scared platforms out of the political ad-business entirely. Maryland and Washington state created extensive regulations for online political ads in 2018. Google simply stopped accepting state and local political ads in those states, and Facebook wouldn\u2019t take political ads in Washington. If major platforms exit the market nationally, political speech on the internet will be sharply reduced.<br/>A coalition of press organizations, including the Washington Post and the Baltimore Sun, sued to challenge the Maryland law, and a federal district court rightly ruled in January this year that it violated the First Amendment.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>The Hill:\u00a0Reddit, Google to testify before House panel on tech\u2019s legal protections<br/>By\u00a0Emily Birnbaum<br/>The public hearing scheduled for Wednesday marks the latest sign that the House Energy and Commerce Committee is seriously looking at the possibility of tweaking or even partially pulling back the industry\u2019s liability shield.<br/>Reddit chief Steve Huffman will testify at the hearing alongside Katherine Oyama, Google\u2019s global head of intellectual property policy, as well as leading experts on the law that protects tech \u2013 including Danielle Citron, a law professor at Boston University School of Law, and Corynne McSherry, the legal director of top privacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2026<br/>At issue is a provision called Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects internet platforms from being sued over content posted by users and how it chooses to moderate those user-generated posts.<br/>Increasingly, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in both chambers have hammered Section 230 as a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d that protects Big Tech from dealing with issues on their platforms including hate speech, terrorist content and disinformation\u2026<br/>[T]he Energy and Commerce Committee has primary jurisdiction over Section 230, and over the past several months, top members of the panel have expressed interest in various proposals to hold platforms \u201caccountable\u201d for their content moderation decisions.<br/>\u201cThis hearing will explore whether online companies are appropriately using the tools they have \u2013 including protections Congress granted in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2013 to foster a healthier Internet,\u201d Pallone said in the statement with Reps. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.)<br/>Washington Times:\u00a0House set to vote on bill requiring political campaigns to report foreign offers of assistance<br/>By Andrew Blake<br/>In a Dear Colleague letter addressed to fellow Democrats, Rep. Steny Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, said the chamber will consider the legislation during the week of Oct. 21.<br/>Called the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act, the bill contains several provisions meant to protect the U.S. electoral process from foreign meddling as related concerns linger ahead of next year\u2019s presidential contest.<br/>Among the bill\u2019s language is a requirement for political campaigns, parties and political committees to report attempts by foreign governments, foreign political parties and their agents to influence U.S. elections by offering assistance.<br/>Political campaigns and candidates who fail to disclose any offers of foreign help would be subject to criminal and civil liabilities if the bill becomes law as written.<br/>The Hill:\u00a0House Dems introduce bill to fight social media disinformation<br/>By Maggie Miller<br/>A group of House Democrats on Friday introduced legislation intended to increase media literacy among Americans in order to combat social media disinformation campaigns.<br/>The Digital Citizen and Media Literacy Act would establish a $20 million grant program at the Department of Education to help fund K-12 media literacy curricula. The funds would be available to local education agencies to create programs on media literacy and to state agencies to create \u201cadvisory councils\u201d to establish state-wide media literacy guidelines.<br/>The bill was introduced days after the Senate Intelligence Committee released its bipartisan report on Russian social media disinformation efforts in the run-up to the 2016 elections\u2026<br/>The committee also included a set of recommendations for Congress, the Trump administration and social media companies in order to prevent future foreign disinformation efforts, including the idea of creating a \u201cpublic initiative\u201d aimed at promoting \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d to help Americans identify disinformation online.<br/>\u201cAddressing the challenge of disinformation in the long-term will ultimately need to be tackled by an informed and discerning population of citizens who are both alert to the threat and armed with the critical thinking skills necessary to protect against malicious influence,\u201d the committee wrote. \u201cA public initiative-propelled by federal funding but led in large part by state and local education institutions-focused on building media literacy from an early age would help build long-term resilience to foreign manipulation of our democracy.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Power Up: \u2018Just the tip of the iceberg.\u2019 FEC chair warns charges against Giuliani associates highlight big dark money problems<br/>By\u00a0Jacqueline Alemany<br/>FEC Chair Ellen Weintraub warns that the charges brought against two associates of President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer highlight the flow of dark money in the U.S. political system \u2014 which she says is just the \u201ctip of the iceberg.\u201d<br/>\u201cThere may well be a lot of money that is slipping into our system that we just don\u2019t know about,\u201d Weintraub said in a Friday interview, a day after prosecutors accused Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman of scheming to funnel foreign money to U.S. politicians\u2026<br/>She wouldn\u2019t comment on the specifics of the charges against Parnas and Fruman, who also assisted in Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s shadow agenda on behalf of the president in Ukraine, but she stressed that \u201cthe ban on foreign money, obviously, is needed to make sure we have American elections for Americans.\u201d\u2026<br/>\u201cThe ban on contributions in the name of another \u2026 is at the core of the FEC\u2019s mission to ensure that the voters are informed about where the money is coming from and where it\u2019s going and who politicians are indebted to.\u201d\u2026<br/>Weintraub also refused to answer whether Trump\u2019s calls for governments to investigate Biden actually broke any rules: \u201cI\u2019d rather not answer that question because it\u2019s too close to the facts of an actual thing that could come before the commission in an enforcement context,\u201d she said.<br/>But she says the laws surrounding foreign national cases are clear: \u201cIt is certainly illegal to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,\u201d Weintraub told us. \u201cThat\u2019s just black letter law.\u201d\u2026<br/>Last week, the ranking Republican on the House Administration Committee requested an ethics investigation into Weintraub\u2026<br/>Weintraub, who originally responded that she would \u201cnot be silenced,\u201d told Power Up: \u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable how these supposedly deregulatory advocates suddenly don\u2019t like it so much \u2013 free speech isn\u2019t so appealing when they don\u2019t like what you\u2019re saying.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>USA Today:\u00a0Elizabeth Warren targets Facebook fact-checking policy with false ad saying Zuckerberg endorsed Trump<br/>By\u00a0Jeanine Santucci<br/>Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has been in a feud with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and now she\u2019s using his own platform against him with a new ad calling out the Facebook policy against fact-checking politicians.<br/>\u201cBreaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\u201d the ad begins.<br/>\u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018how could this possibly be true?'\u201d it continues. \u201cWell it\u2019s not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Trump free rein to lie on his platform \u2014 and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\u201d<br/>Warren is referring to a Facebook advertising policy that allows for politicians to present false or misleading information in ads due to the belief that any statement from a political figure is important to the public interest\u2026<br/>\u201cFacebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you-even about Facebook itself-while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies,\u201d Warren tweeted Saturday about her new Facebook ad.<br/>CNN:\u00a0Elizabeth Warren targets Facebook\u2019s ad policy \u2014 with a Facebook ad<br/>By\u00a0 Brian Fung<br/>On Saturday, Warren explained her ad was meant \u201cto see just how far\u201d the policy goes.<br/>\u201cWe intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook\u2019s ad platform to see if it\u2019d be approved,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cIt got approved quickly.\u201d<br/>Facebook\u2019s willingness to run the ad, she said, shows how the company prioritizes profits over protecting democracy.<br/>Warren\u2019s escalating criticism of Zuckerberg highlights the backlash Facebook has faced as it has defended its policy on political advertising. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, another Democratic candidate, tweeted on Thursday that online platforms like Facebook need a \u201ctruth standard for paid ads.\u201d And Biden\u2019s campaign has compared Trump\u2019s ads to Russian-backed disinformation.<br/>\u201cWhether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,\u201d Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said on Tuesday.<br/>In a statement Friday responding to Warren\u2019s ad, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said the company believes political speech should be protected.<br/>\u201cIf Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,\u201d Stone said.<br/>Facebook\u2019s policy on truthfulness in political ads has been in place for over a year, according to Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications\u2026<br/>Other analysts say Facebook has made the right decision not to involve itself in regulating political speech. Lee Goodman, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Elections Commission, told CNBC Thursday that he believed Facebook\u2019s policy is \u201cfair\u201d because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be the arbiter and doesn\u2019t want to take sides in these political debates.\u201d<br/>The Hill:\u00a0Warren turns up heat over Facebook\u2019s ad rules<br/>By\u00a0Emily Birnbaum<br/>Democrats and prominent tech critics have clamored to force Facebook\u2019s hand, claiming the company enables \u2013 and profits off of \u2013 political disinformation when it does not take action against high-profile instances of falsehoods in advertisements. And Facebook has faced heat across the political spectrum, including from conservatives who allege that social media companies are biased against them.<br/>But the company has held tightly to its position, even doubling down in a tweet at Warren on Saturday night.<br/>\u201cBroadcast stations across the country have aired this ad nearly 1,000 times, as required by law,\u201d Facebook\u2019s public relations Twitter account tweeted to Warren, referring to the Trump advertisement she has been criticizing. \u201cFCC [Federal Communications Commission] doesn\u2019t want broadcast companies censoring candidates\u2019 speech. We agree it\u2019s better to let voters-not companies-decide.\u201d<br/>The tweet drew Facebook deeper into the contentious debate over its role in handling political speech, reinvigorating long-standing questions over whether Facebook should be subject to regulations similar to those imposed on public radio and television stations.<br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0The Warren-Zuckerberg Clash<br/>By\u00a0Editorial Board<br/>Ms. Warren enjoys having a high-profile corporate foil. Yet she also is no doubt sincere when she says she wants Facebook to suppress ads by her political opponents, and if elected she would have more tools to make the platform comply with her wishes.<br/>Ms. Warren says her objection is to \u201clies,\u201d but such a blanket prohibition would immediately force Facebook to adjudicate purely political disputes. The website TechCrunch, in backing Ms. Warren\u2019s argument, cites as an example of Mr. Trump\u2019s false advertising a claim that Democrats \u201cwant\u201d to repeal the Second Amendment. Many Democrats certainly want to repeal the Supreme Court\u2019s Heller ruling that the right to bear arms resides with individuals. The Second Amendment means different things to different people, and different Democrats want different things. Ms. Warren expects friendly social-media speech regulators to embrace her worldview, but they could also censor her own controversial claims\u2026<br/>Conservatives have listened to many lectures that they are abetting America\u2019s supposed descent into autocracy. Yet these same lecturers don\u2019t seem to mind that Ms. Warren wants to rewrite the First Amendment to limit political speech (see her campaign-finance positions) and join with America\u2019s largest corporations to take her opposition off the air.<br/>TechCrunch:\u00a0Facebook should ban campaign ads. End the lies.<br/>By\u00a0Josh Constine<br/>Permitting falsehood in political advertising would work if we had a model democracy, but we don\u2019t. Not only are candidates dishonest, but voters aren\u2019t educated, and the media isn\u2019t objective. And now, hyperlinks turn lies into donations and donations into louder lies. The checks don\u2019t balance. What we face is a self-reinforcing disinformation dystopia.<br/>That\u2019s why if Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube don\u2019t want to be the arbiters of truth in campaign ads, they should stop selling them. If they can\u2019t be distributed safely, they shouldn\u2019t be distributed at all.<br/>No one wants historically untrustworthy social networks becoming the honesty police, deciding what\u2019s factual enough to fly. But the alternative of allowing deception to run rampant is unacceptable. Until voter-elected officials can implement reasonable policies to preserve truth in campaign ads, the tech giants should go a step further and refuse to run them\u2026<br/>Surely, there would be some unfortunate repercussions from blocking campaign ads. New candidates in local to national elections would lose a tool for reducing the lead of incumbents, some of which have already benefited from years of advertising. Some campaign ads might be pushed \u201cunderground,\u201d where they\u2019re not properly labeled, though the major spenders could be kept under watch.<br/>The Verge:\u00a0Why Facebook can\u2019t stop politicians from lying<br/>By\u00a0Casey Newton<br/>Certainly it would be nice if politicians stuck to the truth in their campaign advertising. And we live in a nation that has truth-in-advertising laws, enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. But like Facebook, the FTC also declines to weigh in on the truth of political advertising. And in a case earlier this decade where a state attempted to mandate truth in political advertising, the law was struck down by a federal judge\u2026<br/>Facebook\u2019s decision not to determine the merits of political speech in advertising seems to me to come from the same sensible place. If you don\u2019t want the state making calls on political speech, you probably don\u2019t want a quasi-state with 2.1 billion daily users making calls on political speech, either\u2026<br/>And yet it strikes me that some of the same people mad at Facebook for failing to police the claims in political ads are the same people complaining that the company is too big, too powerful, and lacks any real accountability to the public or its shareholders. To worry about Facebook\u2019s vast size and influence \u2013 and I do! \u2013 while also demanding that it referee political speech seems like an odd contradiction.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOJ\u00a0</emphasis><br/>New York Times:\u00a0Giuliani Is Said to Be Under Investigation for Ukraine Work<br/>By\u00a0Michael S. Schmidt, Ben Protess, Kenneth P. Vogel and William K. Rashbaum<br/>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the inquiry.<br/>The investigators are examining Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to undermine the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, one of the people said. She was recalled in the spring as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader campaign to pressure Ukraine into helping his political prospects.<br/>The investigation into Mr. Giuliani is tied to the case against two of his associates who were arrested this week on campaign finance-related charges, the people familiar with the inquiry said. The associates were charged with funneling illegal contributions to a congressman whose help they sought in removing Ms. Yovanovitch\u2026<br/>Federal law requires American citizens to disclose to the Justice Department any contacts with the government or media in the United States at the direction or request of foreign politicians or government officials, regardless of whether they pay for the representation\u2026<br/>Mr. Giuliani said that federal prosecutors had no grounds to charge him with foreign lobbying disclosure violations because he said he was acting on behalf of Mr. Trump, not the Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, when he collected the information on Ms. Yovanovitch and the others and relayed it to the American government and the news media.<br/>\u201cLook, you can try to contort anything into anything, but if they have any degree of objectivity or fairness, it would be kind of ridiculous to say I was doing it on Lutsenko\u2019s behalf when I was representing the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said\u2026<br/>The lobbying disclosure law contains an exemption for legal work, and Mr. Giuliani said his efforts to unearth information and push both for investigations in Ukraine and for news coverage of his findings originated with his defense of Mr. Trump in the special counsel\u2019s investigation.<br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Indicted Donors Spread Campaign Cash Widely<br/>By\u00a0Julie Bykowicz<br/>At least 14 Republican candidates and groups directly received a total of $675,500 in campaign contributions last year from Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the Soviet-born Florida businessmen indicted this week on campaign-finance violations.<br/>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan say six of their donations involved either a shell company used to hide the men\u2019s identities or foreign money meant to curry favor with U.S. politicians. The pair made numerous contributions between February and July, many of them to umbrella political groups that then parceled out money to dozens of GOP politicians, a Wall Street Journal review of state fundraising and Federal Election Commission records found.<br/>\u201cIt appears that Fruman and Parnas made their political contributions in order to buy access and advance their own interests, and in some instances the interests of foreign officials,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, which filed a complaint with the FEC in July 2018 about the fundraising activities of Messrs. Parnas and Fruman. \u201cEvery single one of these contributions is suspect because they were made with an ulterior motive.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Vox:\u00a0Warren issues a challenge to other 2020 candidates: name your donors<br/>By\u00a0Ella Nilsen<br/>Sen. Elizabeth Warren is issuing a challenge to her fellow 2020 competitors with hours to go before the fourth Democratic debate: be extremely transparent about who is funding their campaigns.<br/>Warren \u2013 who has made getting money out of politics the centerpiece of her presidential campaign \u2013 has published a new plan to tighten campaign finance laws. She also vowed not to accept donations over $200 from executives at large tech companies, including Google and Facebook, as well as big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds. Former Vice President Joe Biden released his own wide-ranging campaign finance and ethics plan on Monday.<br/>\u201cIf Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so \u2013 but they shouldn\u2019t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post revealing her plan\u2026<br/>Warren\u2019s and Biden\u2019s campaign finance plans certainly have some similarities.

That\u2019s a question the Supreme Court may answer if it decides to hear the Libertarian National Committee\u2019s case against the Federal Election Commission.<br/>In 2015, Joseph Shaber left more than $235,000 to the LNC in his will with no strings attached. The LNC had no idea the contribution was coming. Mr. Shaber had only donated $3,315 to the party over twenty-five years before his death, making the large bequest even more unexpected.</p><p><br/>Amazed at its good fortune, the LNC wanted to use the money to promote its message and candidates right away. But the FEC said no; the party had to wait. Under federal campaign contribution limits, the LNC could only accept a fraction of the total bequest ($33,400 in 2015). The rest of the money would have to sit in an escrow account to be distributed over six more years. Or the party could use the whole amount immediately, but only if it spent the funds on certain things like the party\u2019s national convention, its headquarters, or on legal fees.<br/>The LNC decided to let the money wait in escrow and bring a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of restricting Mr. Shaber\u2019s gift. After losing its challenge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the LNC recently asked the Supreme Court to review the case. It should\u2026<br/>Contribution limits exist to prevent\u00a0quid pro quo\u00a0corruption or its appearance. But when, as here, the evidence shows corruption is impossible, contribution limits should not apply. Mr. Shaber wanted to continue his legacy by supporting a cause he believed in after his death. He wanted nothing in return other than for the LNC to continue pursuing their shared ideals. There is nothing more American than that. As applied here, the Supreme Court should rule that the law\u2019s contribution limits are unconstitutional.<br/>The Institute filed an\u00a0amicus brief\u00a0calling on the Supreme Court to hear the case above.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Lawmakers Urge Trade Officials to Remove Tech Liability Shield<br/>By\u00a0Naomi Nix and Rebecca Kern, Bloomberg<br/>A bipartisan group of lawmakers is stepping up efforts to have U.S. trade officials eliminate a legal liability shield that tech companies are pushing to keep in new agreements\u2026<br/>\u201cIncluding provisions in trade agreements that are controversial to both Republicans and Democrats is not the way to get support from Congress,\u201d House Energy and Committee Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. said as he addressed a Wednesday hearing of subcommittees that included executives from Reddit Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.<br/>The lawmakers, who also heard from experts on law and cyber crime, were examining whether tech giants should continue to benefit from Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act\u2026<br/>Democratic Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, the chairman of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, told reporters after the hearing that language similar to Section 230 has no place in a trade agreement.<br/>\u201cIt is a uniquely American law, and we\u2019re in the midst of a discussion about it, and this is a gift to big tech to insert it into trade agreements,\u201d Schakowsky said\u2026<br/>The panel had invited U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to testify, but he declined to appear\u2026<br/>Pallone and Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, the top Republican on the committee, had sent a letter to Lighthizer in August asking him not to include provisions similar to Section 230 in future trade agreements. Walden said he was frustrated with the lack of response\u2026<br/>Lawmakers at Wednesday\u2019s hearing showed an increasing willingness to modify the legal liability shield but stopped short of calling for its repeal all together\u2026<br/>Republican Representative Bill Johnson of Ohio urged tech companies to do a better job at moderating their platforms if they don\u2019t want onerous regulations.<br/>\u201cI would suggest to the entire industry of the internet, social media platforms, you better get serious about this self-regulating,\u201d Johnson said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>ABC News:\u00a0\u2018I am very concerned\u2019: FEC chairwoman on 2020 election interference<br/>By\u00a0Pierre Thomas and Luke Barr<br/>\u201cI can only tell you that from the FEC perspective as I understand the law, if a foreign government is investing resources in producing something that will be a value to a campaign here in the United States, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d she stressed\u2026<br/>She would not discuss the president calling for China to investigate Joe Biden, but said that any foreign interference is unwelcome and on the issue of Trump\u2019s alleged involvement in asking Ukraine to investigate Biden, Weintraub wouldn\u2019t comment but defined what the law said.<br/>\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on what any individual may have done but I can just tell you that it is illegal for anyone to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,\u201d she said.<br/>\u201cWell, without commenting on the decision that the Justice Department made in any particular instance just talking about the law in general, I can tell you that the FEC has looked at things of value in a variety of context and sometimes they\u2019re not even ascertainable when you\u2019re talking about money that could be coming from foreign sources. The bar is pretty low on what you would want to investigate. I think because any interference at all is going to be illegal,\u201d she said.<br/>\u201cSo we have looked at in the domestic context \u2026 things like mailing lists, contact lists, opposition research things that people sometimes pay for. I mean that is one issue that is a thing of value that something that people normally pay for. We would also look at whether somebody spent money in order to acquire the information in order to produce the information that would also be a relevant factor for us,\u201d she said.<br/>Her analysis directly contradicts the decision the Justice Department rendered about President Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine because it didn\u2019t amount to a thing of value.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0The Technology 202: Tech issues divide Democrats, including Twitter\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s tweets<br/>By\u00a0Cat Zakrzewski<br/>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) pressed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who is leading in many polls, to join her in calling on Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account for tweets she argued obstruct justice or incite violence, just hours after the company defended its policy of preserving newsworthy tweets that would otherwise violate its policy. Warren wouldn\u2019t agree to the challenge, prompting Harris to take a swipe at the core of Warren\u2019s messaging and suggest she has a double standard on corporate accountability.<br/>\u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re for corporate responsibility if it doesn\u2019t apply to everyone,\u201d Harris said.<br/>Warren hit back by touting her recent pledge to turn down contributions over $200 from executives at large tech companies as many 2020 Democratic candidates \u2014 including Harris \u2014 have been aggressively fundraising in Silicon Valley.<br/>\u201cYou can\u2019t go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws,\u201d Warren said\u2026<br/>O\u2019Rourke said if elected, he would treat the companies as publishers. O\u2019Rourke has previously proposed making changes to a key Internet law shielding tech platforms from liability for the content others post on their sites, covered by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. He attacked Facebook\u2019s recent decision to run a Trump campaign ad that made false claims.<br/>\u201cThey curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are,\u201d he said.<br/>Politico:\u00a0Inside Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s private meetings with conservative pundits<br/>By\u00a0Natasha Bertrand and Daniel Lippman<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been hosting informal talks and small, off-the-record dinners with conservative journalists, commentators and at least one Republican lawmaker in recent months to talk about issues like free speech and discuss partnerships\u2026<br/>News of the outreach is likely to further fuel suspicions on the left that Zuckerberg is trying to appease the White House and stay out of Trump\u2019s crosshairs. The president threatened to sue Facebook and Google in June and has in the past pressured the Justice Department to take action against his perceived foes.<br/>\u201cThe discussion in Silicon Valley is that Zuckerberg is very concerned about the Justice Department, under Bill Barr, bringing an enforcement action to break up the company,\u201d said one cybersecurity researcher and former government official based in Silicon Valley. \u201cSo the fear is that Zuckerberg is trying to appease the Trump administration by not cracking down on right-wing propaganda.\u201d\u2026<br/>When asked about the gatherings, a senior Trump administration official said \u201cthe White House is looking for meaningful steps from Facebook on a number of fronts,\u201d including \u201ccompetition, free speech for everybody including conservatives, and privacy.\u201d<br/>\u201cNominal outreach won\u2019t cut it,\u201d the official added\u2026<br/>The ongoing talks between Zuckerberg and prominent conservatives have attracted the attention of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which conducts oversight on issues related to telecommunications and consumer protection and is \u201caware\u201d of allegations that conservatives \u201care trying to work the refs\u201d ahead of 2020, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.<br/>The committee\u2019s Democrats sent a previously unreported letter to Facebook in June, after a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went viral on the platform, asking what the company was doing to address \u201cthe spreading of political disinformation by real accounts.\u201d\u2026<br/>Facebook\u2019s vice president of U.S. public policy, Kevin Martin, responded three weeks later in a letter, also obtained by POLITICO.<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Under pressure to suspend Trump, Twitter restates that world leaders don\u2019t always have to follow its rules<br/>By\u00a0Tony Romm and Isaac Stanley-Becker<br/>Facing a request to boot President Trump from its platform, Twitter on Tuesday affirmed that world leaders are not above its rules but defended its discretion to preserve some tweets that violate its policies.<br/>The update, detailed in a blog post, seemed unlikely to quiet increasingly forceful appeals for technology giants to regulate Trump\u2019s use of social media\u2026<br/>The dispute stems from Twitter\u2019s announcement this summer that it would label tweets from world leaders whose comments violate site policies, including those designed to prevent harm and abuse\u2026<br/>But Twitter\u2019s application of the policy ultimately invited widespread criticism, after the company opted not to label a number of Trump\u2019s tweets Democrats and digital watchdogs saw as improper\u2026<br/>In an attempt to clarify its rules, Twitter said Tuesday it would take enforcement actions against \u201cany account\u201d in certain, dire circumstances, including instances when a world leader threatens a user with direct violence or publishes private information, such as a home address.<br/>But Twitter also noted there were cases when the company may not act, such as when heads of state have \u201cdirect interactions\u201d with their peers or engage in \u201cforeign policy saber rattling on economic and military issues,\u201d which it said are not violations of rules. Nor would the company seek to \u201cdetermine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent,\u201d it said.<br/>For those tweets that are labeled as violations, Twitter said it would also take steps to limit their spread on the site: Users would not be able to retweet or like that content, for example. The company said it has not yet applied this label\u2026<br/>The update from Twitter on Tuesday shows, however, that the conundrum facing social media companies extends far beyond paid advertising. The megaphone they offer politicians \u2013 including those with a penchant for mistruths \u2013 can be just as valuable and just as fraught.<br/>BuzzFeed News:\u00a0Facebook Said Politicians Can Lie In Ads. It\u2019s Taking Down Ads From Warren, Biden, And Trump For Other Reasons.<br/>By\u00a0Ryan Mac and Zahra Hirji<br/>According to a BuzzFeed News review, Facebook has removed more than 160 ads posted this month by President Donald Trump and some Democratic candidates, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former vice president Joe Biden, and businessperson Tom Steyer. In some cases, Facebook appeared to apply its policies unequally, removing some ads for breaking rules around profanity, fake buttons, and advertising in certain states while leaving others that seemed to do the exact same thing untouched.<br/>In several instances, Facebook quietly removed ads that ostensibly violated its policies after BuzzFeed News inquired about them on Monday. By one count, the social network took down an additional 32 ads from the Biden campaign after the inquiries\u2026<br/>\u201cNone of these political ads were rejected on the basis of being deemed false by our fact-checkers,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThey were removed for violating one or more of Facebook\u2019s other advertising policies, such as our policy against using fake buttons in ads.\u201d\u2026<br/>Facebook killed [Warren\u2019s] climate ad over a local disclosures rule.<br/>Last year, the state of Washington sued Facebook and Google for allegedly violating its campaign finance laws by failing to maintain data on the purchasers of election ads and later adopted new laws on ad disclosures. In response, Facebook implemented a blanket ban on \u201cads that relate to Washington\u2019s state or local elected officials, candidates, elections or ballot initiatives.\u201d<br/>Because the text of this ad and a handful of others created by the Warren campaign mention Jay Inslee, the Washington governor and former Democratic presidential candidate, they were removed.<br/>New York Times:\u00a0A Spice Company Spent $92,000 on Pro-Impeachment Facebook Ads in a Week<br/>By\u00a0Jacey Fortin<br/>Candidates, campaigns and companies have unleashed a flood of Facebook advertisements related to impeachment, and it might come as no surprise that President Trump and his re-election campaign are far outspending everyone else.<br/>But last week, the second biggest spender was an entity you might not be familiar with: a purveyor of pepper, paprika and poppy seeds based in Wisconsin.<br/>Penzeys Spices, a family-owned company in Wauwatosa, spent nearly $92,000 on Facebook advertisements related to impeachment from Sept. 29 to Oct. 5, according to data from a communications agency that tracks political spending\u2026<br/>Facebook\u2019s publicly available data shows that from Oct. 2 to 8, Penzeys was the seventh-biggest spender on ads about \u201csocial issues, elections or politics\u201d \u2013 a broader category than just impeachment \u2013 and the only entity in the top 10 that was not a politician or a policy-oriented organization.<br/>Penzeys spent nearly $120,000 on Facebook advertisements addressing politics during those seven days, Facebook data showed. (That\u2019s less than Democratic presidential candidates like Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Elizabeth Warren, but more than Pete Buttigieg.)\u2026<br/>The New York Times reported in 2006 that Mr. Penzey had started a food magazine that touched on prison reform, immigration policy and international adoption\u2026<br/>The politics haven\u2019t hurt Mr. Penzey\u2019s business, he said, adding that he has lost some customers but gained some, too.<br/>\u201cIf you are a company and you have values, now is the time to share them,\u201d Mr. Penzey said. \u201cNow is the time that it\u2019s important to share them.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fundraising\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Time:\u00a0Warren\u2019s New Campaign Finance Plan Is Putting Rivals Like Biden and Buttigieg on the Spot<br/>By\u00a0Charlotte Alter<br/>Warren\u2019s new plan was released just a day after Buttigieg drew blowback from online progressives for comments about his fundraising strategy. \u201cMy competitors can go with whatever strategy they like, but we\u2019re going to make sure that we have the resources to compete because we we are going up against the sitting President of the United States,\u201d Buttigieg told Snapchat\u2019s Peter Hamby. \u201cHe has tremendous amounts of support and allies at his back, and we\u2019re not going to beat him with pocket change.\u201d<br/>Progressives online slammed him immediately. \u201cSmall-dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttigieg insults here as \u2018pocket change,\u2019 out-fundraise him by millions,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted in responses. \u201cOur nation\u2019s leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Joe Biden Releases Ethics Agenda Amid Focus on Ukraine<br/>By\u00a0Ken Thomas<br/>It includes a ban on lobbying by foreign governments; an expansion of lobbying and disclosure laws; and legislation that would require all candidates for federal election to disclose 10 years of tax returns\u2026<br/>As he has said previously, Mr. Biden would also introduce a constitutional amendment to eliminate private funds from federal elections as a way of overturning the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed unlimited political expenditures.<br/>Mr. Biden, a longtime advocate of public financing of elections, would propose legislation to provide public matching funds for small-dollar donations to federal candidates as part of the constitutional amendment effort\u2026<br/>Lastly, Mr. Biden\u2019s plan includes creating a Commission on Federal Ethics, a government agency that would oversee federal anticorruption and ethics laws. The agency would be able to enforce its own subpoenas and refer matters for criminal investigations to the Justice Department.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Arizona Capitol Times:\u00a0Group tries to dodge fine for campaign finance law violation<br/>By\u00a0Howard Fischer, Capitol Media Services<br/>Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Christopher Whitten ruled in August that the lawyers for the [Legacy Foundation Action Fund]\u00a0were misreading the law.<br/>Now the fund is seeking intervention by the state Court of Appeals\u2026<br/>The case stems from a commercial that ran in early 2014 when Smith was pursuing the Republican gubernatorial nomination.<br/>Produced by the Legacy Foundation Action Fund, it noted that Smith, who was mayor of Mesa, also was president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. More to the point, it focused on some of the stands the conference had taken\u2026<br/>Jason Torchinsky, one of the attorneys for the fund, argued there was nothing improper about the commercial.<br/>More to the point, he said it was not designed to influence the election but simply to educate Arizonans about Smith. Torchinsky noted that the ad made no reference to Smith\u2019s race against Ducey nor even to Smith\u2019s status as a candidate.<br/>The Clean Elections Commission, however, concluded otherwise, ruling that its true purpose was to affect the GOP gubernatorial primary. And what that meant, the commission concluded, was that the Legacy Foundation Action Fund, by virtue of attempting to influence an election, was required to publicly disclose the spending, which it did not.<br/>That failure led to the $96,000 penalty\u2026<br/>Attorney Brian Bergin argues that the commission, in concluding the purpose of the commercial was to affect the 2014 GOP primary, ignored the plain language of what viewers saw.<br/>\u201cThe Arizona advertisement discusses issues: government spending, Second Amendment rights, and the regulation of carbon emissions,\u201d Bergin wrote, while telling viewers the policies \u201care wrong for Mesa\u201d and urging them to call Smith \u201cand tell him to support policies that are good for Mesa.\u201d<br/>U.S. News &amp;World; Report:\u00a0Big Questions Remain for NY\u2019s Public Campaign Finance Plan<br/>By\u00a0Marina Villeneuve, Associated Press<br/>A New York commission began crafting a small-donor public campaign financing system Monday but has yet to tackle big issues\u2026<br/>The Public Campaign Financing Commission has until Dec. 1 to announce rules that will become law unless lawmakers hold a rare end-of-year special session to reject them.<br/>Commissioners moved ahead on issues such as the number of small-dollar contributions that candidates would need to qualify for matching funds. Commissioners agreed Monday to continue their work following an Oct. 22 hearing and also requested legal advice from two attorneys.<br/>But questions on key issues remain unanswered. It\u2019s unclear, for example, when the program would launch or how exactly it will be implemented\u2026<br/>It\u2019s also unknown whether the commission will lower contribution limits for candidates who don\u2019t participate in public financing. The Brennan Center for Justice, which has long supported public campaign financing in New York, said the state\u2019s current limits are so high that they would undermine a public financing system\u2026<br/>Commissioners also discussed a proposal to offer higher matches based on a district\u2019s income level. Jay Jacobs, the chair of New York\u2019s Democratic Party and an appointee of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said a \u201cone-size fits all approach\u201d may not be fair for low-income districts that could struggle to raise enough contributions to quality for public matching funds.<br/>The Brennan Center in a memo to commissioners dated Sunday said the group didn\u2019t oppose the idea but warned about \u201cadopting an untested model.\u201d The group said its research suggests New York City public campaign funding system, which matches all eligible donations 6:1, has helped city districts across income levels.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 10/16 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-78678</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X92-RR01-DY1R-B36Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3588\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

MacDonald, the ACLU of New Hampshire is challenging New Hampshire\u2019s criminal libel statute\u2026<br/>The ACLU is arguing that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, and today, U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante held that the challenge could go forward (though he did not definitively rule on whether the statute was indeed unconstitutional):</p><p><br/>The court\u2019s vagueness concerns are two-fold. First, the criminal defamation statute arguably fails to provide \u201cpeople of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits\u201d and what speech is acceptable\u2026. [A] statute cannot criminalize conduct \u201cin terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application'\u201d \u2026.<br/>Second, Frese has sufficiently pleaded that the criminal defamation statute may be prone to arbitrary enforcement. Frese alleges that, \u201c[o]n information and belief, individuals throughout New Hampshire routinely violate the criminal defamation statute, but [he] was arrested and prosecuted because he criticized law enforcement officials.\u201d As clarified by his objection, Frese urges this court infer that because the statute \u201cgives law enforcement far too much discretion in deciding whom to prosecute,\u201d the motivation to prosecute criminal defamation is often political\u2026<br/>I appreciate the judge\u2019s argument on this, but I\u2019m inclined to think that criminal libel laws that punish knowing lies that damage reputation are constitutional; here\u2019s the analysis from my forthcoming\u00a0Anti-Libel Injunctions\u00a0article: \u2026<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0The Technology 202: Democrat drafting bill to stop Facebook from profiting off politicians\u2019 ads containing falsehoods<br/>By\u00a0Cat Zakrzewski<br/>Rep. David Cicilline is working on legislation targeting Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing politicians to lie in ads, insisting that Congress has a \u201cresponsibility to prohibit\u201d the social media giant from making money off information it knows to be false.<br/>The Rhode Island Democrat at the helm of the House antitrust investigation into Big Tech says it\u2019s \u201cnot acceptable\u201d for Facebook to insist it won\u2019t fact-check or remove politicians\u2019 ads even when they contain false information.<br/>It is \u201cshocking,\u201d Cicilline said in an interview, that the company sees \u201cno responsibility in ensuring that that platform is not being used to completely mislead or lie to the American people on the most critical issues of the day.\u201d\u2026<br/>\u201cFrom a business perspective, the very small percent of our business that is made up of political ads does not come anywhere close to justifying the controversy that this incurs for our company,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cSo this really is not about money. This is on principle, I believe in giving people a voice.\u201d\u2026<br/>[Cicilline] tells me the First Amendment is \u201cnot a basis\u201d to allow Facebook to profit off lies. \u201cRather than being a First Amendment issue, it\u2019s really a kind of revenue generation issue for a business,\u201d he said.<br/>Rep. Garland \u201cAndy\u201d Barr (R-Ky.) commended Zuckerberg\u2019s position on ads in this week\u2019s hearing. \u201cI do find it highly troubling that politicians are trying to bully you to be a fact checker and to be the speech police especially in politics at the core of the First Amendment,\u201d Barr said during the hearing\u2026<br/>Cicilline tells me his plans for a bill are in the early stages, and that his staff is researching how the law approaches false information in ads.<br/>\u201cThere are a number of places in our economy and in our communications system where this kind of advertisement is prohibited,\u201d Cicilline said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s by consumer protections, sometimes it\u2019s by [Federal Communications Commission] regulations.\u201d<br/>NTV:\u00a0Senator Ben Sasse condemns SHIELD Act<br/>By\u00a0KHGI<br/>\u201cToday Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are voting to gut the First Amendment and silence free speech. This bill is a pile of hot garbage that would give federal bureaucrats the power to decide what is and isn\u2019t political speech and then demand that records are kept on who says what.<br/>\u201cThis bill is so blatantly un-American that it has managed to unite constitutional conservatives and ACLU liberals against it. Speaker Pelosi says that this is about stopping foreign interference in our elections, but here\u2019s the deal: the whole reason America\u2019s adversaries try to interfere in our elections is because they hate that we\u2019re free and, by stripping us of our freedoms, Speaker Pelosi\u2019s bill would give them exactly what they want.\u201d<br/>The SHIELD Act passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday\u2026<br/>Critics said it\u2019s too broad and brings up First Amendment concerns.<br/>The White House has threatened to veto the bill if it makes it to the president\u2019s desk.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Amendment\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Reason (Volokh Conspiracy):\u00a0Free speech and LGBT rights<br/>By\u00a0Dale Carpenter<br/>In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Schenck v. United States and Abrams v. United States, the SMU Law Review has published an important symposium issue with a range of outstanding contributors\u2026<br/>My own essay, \u201cBorn in Dissent: Free Speech and Gay Rights,\u201d can be viewed and downloaded on SSRN here. My focus in this particular essay is on a little-known gay political organization that formed almost fifty years before the Stonewall Inn riots in 1969. From the abstract:<br/>It is no stretch to say that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes created the modern First Amendment a hundred years ago in his opinions in Schenck and Abrams. It is equally true that the First Amendment created gay America. For advocates of gay legal and social equality, there has been no more reliable and important constitutional text. The freedoms it guarantees protected gay cultural and political institutions from state regulation designed to impose a contrary vision of the good life. Gay organizations, clubs, bars, politicians, journals, newspapers, radio programs, television shows, web sites-all of these-would have been swept away in the absence of a strong and particularly libertarian First Amendment. It shielded gay political efforts when most of the country thought homosexuals were not just immoral, but also sick, dangerous, and criminal\u2026<br/>This history of protected dissent, I assert in the conclusion, should inform how we think about symmetrical protection for those who dissent from various LGBT-rights projects today:<br/>The norms the state enforces are as changeable as culture itself. When LGBT advocates defend the role of the state as enforcer of social norms at the expense of speech and expressive association, I think about the painful gay ordeal with the caretaker state. In Gerber\u2019s Germany, there were nightclubs for gays in the 1920s and concentration camps for them in the 1940s. The relative tolerance of Gerber\u2019s pre-Depression New York gave way to the repression of the 1930s.<br/>There is a cautionary lesson in this. Somewhere, someday we may again hear the state\u2019s call to heel. Comes that day we will look for sanctuary. We will be relieved to find the constitutional experiment known as the First Amendment still going strong, large enough to accommodate dissent about ultimate good and sturdy enough to fend off the state\u2019s long and ready list of worthy causes.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>ABC News:\u00a0Facebook clarifies Zuckerberg remarks on false political ads<br/>By David Klepper,\u00a0Associated Press<br/>[D]uring an exchange with Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Zuckerberg explained that his company will not remove political ads from candidates \u2013 even if false \u2013 because he believes voters deserve unfiltered access to the words of politicians. He said exceptions would be made for political ads that encouraged violence or seek to suppress voting.<br/>Facebook on Thursday sought to set the record straight, noting that while it will not fact check political ads from candidates, it does evaluate the accuracy of political ads from political advocacy groups or political action committees.<br/>\u201cIn a democracy, people should decide what is credible, not tech companies,\u201d the company wrote in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s why \u2013 like other internet platforms and broadcasters \u2013 we don\u2019t fact check ads from politicians.\u201d\u2026<br/>\u201cGiven the sensitivity around political ads, we have considered whether we should ban them altogether,\u201d Facebook said in its statement to the AP on Thursday. \u201cBut political ads are important for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that use our platform to reach voters and their communities.\u201d\u2026<br/>Zuckerberg\u2019s comments on Facebook\u2019s hands-off policy also failed to satisfy Waters, who said Wednesday it would give \u201canyone Facebook labels a politician a platform to lie, mislead and misinform the American people, which will also allow Facebook to sell more ads. The impact of this will be a massive voter suppression effort.\u201d<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Civil rights leaders thought they\u2019d figured out how to deal with Facebook. But now they are \u2018livid.\u2019<br/>By\u00a0Craig Timberg<br/>\u201cThe only principle is business as usual and trying to line their pockets,\u201d said Arisha Hatch, vice president for Color of Change, one of several civil rights groups that had been in regular contact with Sandberg and others at the company. \u201cThere is no principled stand that people can take that would allow them to behave on the platform as voter suppressionists have behaved in our country for decades.\u201d<br/>Hatch and others view the company\u2019s tolerance of deception against the backdrop of the nation\u2019s ugly history of voter suppression, much of it conducted by politicians and government officials\u2026<br/>Facebook\u2019s policies still prohibit voter suppression \u2013 even when practiced by politicians \u2013 but civil rights leaders express little confidence that the platform will enforce this with sufficient speed and breadth. Addressing obvious falsehoods, such as lies about the dates or locations of polling, would not be enough to defeat politicians\u2019 efforts to hold down minority voting participation on the platform, say civil rights leaders.<br/>They express particular worry that American political figures could engage in tactics similar to those used in Russia\u2019s disinformation campaigns. The Internet Research Agency, in St. Petersburg, used fake social media accounts in 2016 to target African Americans concerned about police violence and other issues. The Russian-based Facebook group \u201cWoke Blacks,\u201d for example, wrote, \u201cWe cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201d\u2026<br/>Facebook has made strides in detecting and shutting down such foreign operations, but civil rights groups and disinformation researchers express little faith in the company\u2019s ability to find and act against domestic political figures who may attempt similar tactics. The exemption allowing politicians to lie makes that problem worse, they say, even if Facebook does not officially tolerate voter suppression.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Independent Groups\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0A super PAC won\u2019t save Joe Biden<br/>By\u00a0Paul Waldman<br/>More money is always better than less money, of course, but in the primaries it\u2019s hard to imagine that whatever problems Biden has can be solved with a bunch of ads being dropped on TV in Des Moines or on Facebook (since super PACs can\u2019t coordinate directly with candidates, they usually dump most of their money on ineffectual advertising).<br/>If instead he\u2019s looking forward to the general election, that could be a different story, provided that the pro-Biden super PAC spent its money wisely, which is never a guarantee. But there, too, the same question comes up: Is money going to be a problem for the Democratic nominee?<br/>Given the enormous sums Democrats are already contributing to primary candidates, it\u2019s likely that the party\u2019s nominee will have all the money they need, as Democrats desperate to be rid of Trump contribute whatever they can. And after a certain point, a few extra million \u2013 or even a few extra hundred million \u2013 may not make much difference. Don\u2019t forget that Clinton outspent Trump in 2016 by more than $300 million, but he still won.<br/>And consider this: Trump and the super PACs supporting him have already spent an incredible $171 million on the 2020 campaign. He has spent more than $25 million on Facebook and Google ads alone. And for what? He trails all the leading Democrats in many polls, his approval rating is stuck around 40 percent, and he\u2019s about to be impeached.<br/>As far as campaign sins go, accepting the help of a super PAC is pretty minor, and I don\u2019t doubt that Biden would sincerely prefer a system in which they didn\u2019t exist. But if he\u2019s going to become the Democratic nominee and then the president, it\u2019ll be because he was the best candidate. Not because he was saved by a super PAC.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Media\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Trump to Tell Federal Agencies to Cut New York Times, Washington Post Subscriptions<br/>By\u00a0Andrew Restuccia<br/>The White House is planning to instruct federal agencies to not renew their subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post\u2026<br/>\u201cNot renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving-hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars will be saved,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in an email Thursday\u2026<br/>The decision comes days after Mr. Trump told his staff to cancel the White House\u2019s print subscriptions to the Post and the Times after expressing frustration with their coverage.<br/>\u201cWe don\u2019t even want it in the White House anymore,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the Times during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired Monday night. \u201cWe\u2019re going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They\u2019re fake.\u201d\u2026<br/>The president has repeatedly railed against and sought to discredit the newspapers\u2019 coverage of his administration, including its dealings with Ukraine and the resulting impeachment inquiry in the House. On Twitter and during campaign rallies, Mr. Trump has attacked the news media, calling it the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and dismissing some of the country\u2019s most venerable journalism outlets as \u201cfake news.\u201d<br/>In June, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that a Times story represented a \u201cvirtual act of Treason.\u201d The publisher of the New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, responded with an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal, saying the \u201cnew attack crosses a dangerous line in the president\u2019s campaign against a free and independent press.\u201d<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Facebook will begin paying some outlets for their content as it introduces its News tab<br/>By\u00a0Rachel Siegel<br/>After years of complaints from American news outfits that Facebook has used their work to boost its products without paying for it, the social media giant has agreed to compensate at least some news organizations as part of a specialized \u201cNews\u201d tab meant to steer users toward curated national and local news stories\u2026<br/>But the analysts also expressed skepticism that Facebook\u2019s new arrangement will help the small and medium-sized local outlets that have been most seriously undercut by the rise of online news distribution.<br/>\u201cThe vast majority of local news outlets are not included, and that is part of the news ecosystem that\u2019s most at risk,\u201d said David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, a trade association of news publishers\u2026<br/>Meanwhile, the news industry has taken massive hits from declines in print advertising and competition from digital platforms for online ad revenue. Many established media companies have laid off staff or consolidated, while a slew of digital start-ups have failed. A July study from the Pew Research Center found that U.S. newsroom employment had dropped by a quarter since 2008, with the greatest decline at newspapers \u2013 from 114,000 in 2008 to about 86,000 last year.<br/>On Friday, Facebook launched its News tab to more than 200,000 Facebook users in the United States, with a broader rollout planned for early next year\u2026<br/>At the launch event in New York on Friday, Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said that every Internet platform has a responsibility to fund and support partnerships with news organizations and that Facebook News is a step toward \u201ca long-term, sustainable business model.\u201d<br/>The initiative could reach 20 million to 30 million people over a few years, Zuckerberg said, and will eventually include a wider set of local and international publishers.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOJ</emphasis><br/>New York Times:\u00a0Justice Dept. Is Said to Open Criminal Inquiry Into Its Own Russia Investigation<br/>By\u00a0Katie Benner and Adam Goldman<br/>Justice Department officials have shifted an administrative review of the Russia investigation closely overseen by Attorney General William P. Barr to a criminal inquiry, according to two people familiar with the matter. The move gives the prosecutor running it, John H. Durham, the power to subpoena for witness testimony and documents, to convene a grand jury and to file criminal charges.<br/>The opening of a criminal investigation is likely to raise alarms that Mr. Trump is using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies. Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director under whose watch agents opened the Russia inquiry, and has long assailed other top former law enforcement and intelligence officials as partisans who sought to block his election.<br/>Mr. Trump has made clear that he sees the typically independent Justice Department as a tool to be wielded against his political enemies\u2026<br/>The move also creates an unusual situation in which the Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into itself.<br/>Mr. Barr\u2019s reliance on Mr. Durham, a widely respected and veteran prosecutor who has investigated C.I.A. torture and broken up Mafia rings, could help insulate the attorney general from accusations that he is doing the president\u2019s bidding and putting politics above justice.<br/>It was not clear what potential crime Mr. Durham is investigating, nor when the criminal investigation was prompted.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 10/25 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-79641</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XC0-GBX1-JBJN-M2TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2994\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 25, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He enjoys his extracurricular activities, computers and, above all else, the New York Mets. But unlike other teenage Mets fans, Ben has a super PAC to prove his loyalty.</p><p><br/>Ben recently completed the Federal Election Commission (FEC) paperwork to register the \"Mets Are A Good Team Committee\" super PAC...<br/>According to Ben, his goal wasn't to promote the (crazy) idea that the Mets are actually a good team. Instead, as Ben revealed in an interview with Sports Illustrated, he created the super PAC as a joke and to illustrate the problem he sees with money in politics. \"Look how easy this is to do. If I could do it, anyone can,\" Ben told SI.<br/>Wait a minute. Isn't that a good thing?<br/>Super PACs are just groups where Americans pool their money and speak out about candidates they support or oppose. Americans speaking about a cause or candidate they believe in is what the First Amendment is all about.<br/>The fact that the FEC made the forms simple enough for a high school student to figure out (although he later received help from a lawyer in his family) is a feature, not a bug. Unalienable rights guaranteed by the Constitution should be easy to exercise for anyone, not restricted by a maze of red tape...<br/>Although his group started as \"sort of a joke,\" Ben quickly realized it was more serious than he intended. He is now looking to use his group to support candidates who will work against corruption and who lack the means to get their message heard. This is exactly the kind of speech that super PACs were created for.<br/>Idaho Press-Tribune:\u00a0Lawmakers on campaign finance reform panel spar over definition of 'electioneering communication'<br/>By Betsy Z. Russell<br/>The Idaho Legislature's Campaign Finance Reform Interim Committee is meeting at the state Capitol today, and heard dueling presentations this morning from attorneys for differing institutes that are for and against requiring more disclosure of electioneering communications and independent expenditures. After Tyler Martinez of the Institute for Free Speech told the lawmakers, by phone, that he thought their proposal would make someone disclose as an electioneering communication a comment made while playing an X-Box live game, because the X-Box live requires a subscription, the panel asked Deputy Idaho Attorney General Robert Berry to respond, in the context of Idaho law.<br/>Berry said that wouldn't qualify as an electioneering communication in Idaho, because the cost wasn't incurred for sending that particular communication; the subscription was a \"sunk cost\" that occurred whether or not the communication was sent. Similarly, he said, someone retweeting a paid political message wouldn't themselves be engaging in a reportable electioneering communication, because they've made no expenditure that could be reported. \"I don't believe that is an electioneering communication that needs to be filed with the the Secretary of State,\" Berry told the committee. \"It ties back to when the expenditures are made. Really it's a two-fold analysis: Is it an electioneering communication, have there been funds expended, and when were they expended.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Supreme Court Should Hear Challenge to Montana Law, IFS Brief Says<br/>The Institute for Free Speech and the Cato Institute yesterday filed a friend of the court brief asking the Supreme Court to hear a challenge to Montana campaign finance laws. The case presents an opportunity to shield groups who speak about government from overregulation.<br/>\"The Supreme Court has said that only groups with the major purpose of influencing elections can be heavily regulated. Yet many states now require anyone who spends small amounts on advocacy to register and report their activities like a PAC,\" said Institute for Free Speech Legal Director Allen Dickerson.<br/>The case, Montanans for Community Development v. Mangan, challenges Montana's reporting and disclosure requirements for groups that may spend minimal sums on election-related activity. Montana is one of several states that fails to apply the \"major purpose requirement\" mandated by Buckley v. Valeo. In that landmark decision, the Supreme Court limited the reach of similar regulations to groups whose major purpose is influencing elections, generally defined as spending more than 50% of their resources on electoral advocacy.<br/>\"This rule, designed to save an otherwise overbroad statute from invalidation under the First Amendment, ensures that the registration and disclosure burdens of PAC status fell only upon unambiguously political organizations, those which are 'by definition, campaign related,'\" explains the brief by the Institute for Free Speech and the Cato Institute.<br/>Some lower courts of appeal have failed to uphold the major purpose requirement. That has sowed confusion in the law and permitted some states to regulate more broadly than the Court intended.\u00a0<br/>Amici Curiae Brief of the Institute for Free Speech and the Cato Institute in Support of Petitioner in Montanans for Community Development v. Mangan (U.S. Supreme Court)<br/>In 1976, this Court narrowly construed a\u00a0federal campaign finance law in order to shield civil\u00a0society from overregulation. Buckley v. Valeo, 424\u00a0U.S. 1 (1976) (per curiam). And while Buckley\u00a0remains this Court's cornerstone case governing\u00a0questions of money and elections, the Court has failed\u00a0to police one of its core holdings: the requirement that\u00a0comprehensive regulation may only be imposed upon\u00a0groups spending a majority of their funds on unambiguous\u00a0electoral advocacy. This case provides an opportunity for the Court to reassert that standard.\u00a0<br/>Certiorari\u00a0would do more than restore foundational case law. Several states, including Montana, have chosen to enforce\u00a0their campaign finance laws via a single, often politically involved, individual. As Commissioner Mangan's\u00a0predecessor's experience teaches, such arrangements raise the specter of partisan enforcement of the laws,\u00a0or at the very least, the appearance of such corrupt enforcement. Because the major purpose requirement is clear\u00a0and objective, it greatly reduces such risks compared to the vague political committee laws at issue here.\u00a0Mandating its application can alleviate the appearance of partisan enforcement not only in Montana, but nationwide.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supreme Court</emphasis><br/>Courthouse News Service:\u00a0Amicus Briefs Flood Supreme Court in Prison-Censorship Case<br/>By\u00a0Eva Fedderly<br/>Urging the Supreme Court to lift a ban it faces in Florida correctional facilities, Prison Legal News found support for its censorship appeal this month from more than 100 groups across the political spectrum.<br/>A monthly magazine put out by the Human Rights Defense Center, Prison Legal News brought its petition for certiorari last month after the 11th Circuit found that security concerns justified a blanket ban on the publication across Florida jails and prisons.<br/>In the last two weeks leading up to an Oct. 19 deadline for friend-of-the-court briefs, more than 100 groups and individuals argued that Supreme Court intervention is needed to correct arbitrary government suppression of the First Amendment.<br/>\"There is no evidence that ads in its magazine have ever caused a security breach,\" 18 media groups argued in the first brief, filed on Oct. 11 by attorneys at the Miami firm Gunster Yoakley &amp; Stewart. \"As amici are all too aware, this approach is a censor's dream. With enough time and ingenuity, prison officials and their lawyers can usually imagine some way in which some aspect of a particular written work might conceivably have some marginal effect on prison order or security.\"<br/>Supporters of Prison Legal News filed eight briefs in total, and editor Paul Wright noted in an email that the support it has received \"is unprecedented in criminal-justice circles at the cert stage.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Amendment\u00a0</emphasis><br/>U.S. News &amp; World Report:\u00a0In Chaotic Era, Conference Aims to Amplify 1st Amendment<br/>By Ted Anthony, AP<br/>For two days in Pittsburgh, a national exploration of what the First Amendment means to America in 2018 dug into every corner of this notion to understand where we are, and where we're going, in terms of the rights Americans have to express themselves.<br/>\"Too many people in this country don't understand how freedom works in their native land,\" said Maxwell King, former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and head of the Pittsburgh Foundation, a philanthropy that co-sponsored the event at Duquesne University...<br/>Among news leaders, government officials and academics, the consensus seemed to be this: In an era upended by technology and the behaviors that have grown up around it, the First Amendment remains pivotal to a functioning democracy - perhaps more so than ever in a society increasingly suspicious of the role that the mass media plays.<br/>\"I don't believe democracies can exist without a free press,\" Tom Ridge, secretary of Homeland Security under former Republican President George W.

It exists for other reasons as well, but the core of it is to protect political speech. Now we're running around treating political speech like it is somehow inherently suspect? So suspect that the government has to know-needs to know-who's doing it?\"<br/>And so the Goldwater Institute has gone to court to defend this essential right: The Institute is currently involved with two donor privacy cases, one in Denver, Colorado and another in Santa Fe, New Mexico. What's the big issue? Namely, these cities are trying to police political speech by requiring organizations to disclose their donors' names, home addresses, and employer information, then posting said information online for anyone to see.<br/>\"In both cases, the cities have passed laws that require nonprofits, or any other group, who are communicating with voters about ballot measures to disclose their donors to the government,\" Miller explained. \"So if you choose to engage in speech that is trying to influence people's decision about a ballot measure, you then have to disclose your donors in a report that is filed with the government and then provided by them on a website for anybody who wants to access it.\"<br/>\"These are laws that target quintessential political speech about ballot measures that the government is trying to pass,\" Miller said.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Fox News:\u00a0Rep.

Social media are now part of every American's life, and big social media companies have unbelievable control over the type and flow of information. If they can restrict certain types of speech, then their ability to impact elections and public policy is virtually unlimited.<br/>The First Amendment was written to protect speech - and not just speech that we agree with.\u00a0Congress needs to have more hearings and more oversight, which would mean more\u00a0information for the American people.<br/>Congress should also look to appoint a task force to examine all restrictions placed on the First Amendment, with a specific focus on social media companies.

When it occurred during the Vietnam War, the Park Service was sued for attempting to curtail these freedoms.

Russell<br/>A panel of Idaho lawmakers on Wednesday endorsed a slate of campaign finance reforms that it will pitch to the full Legislature in January, from requiring more frequent reporting, to expanding disclosure requirements to all levels of government, to changing rules for independent expenditures....<br/>While most of the senators and representatives on the panel favored requiring more reporting of those to get at \"dark money\" in Idaho politics, others raised concerns that free speech could be infringed upon, and onerous reporting requirements placed on Idahoans who just are having their say about politics.<br/>Lawmakers agreed to extend the reporting period for those types of expenditures to run from the close of the candidate filing period in the spring through the general election. But they also agreed to raise the reporting threshold from the current $100 to $1,000...<br/>The panel also split over requiring more reporting from those independent groups of who funded their efforts. Rep. Sage Dixon, R-Ponderay, said he was concerned about \"fear of reprisals\" against people who may donate to a cause, and then be identified in state reports. While the committee had been considering requiring all donors of $50 or more toward independent campaign expenditures or electioneering communications to be named, Dixon proposed raising the reporting threshold to $1,000...<br/>The committee finally settled on $250 as the point at which donors would have to be identified when they've donated toward independent expenditures or electioneering communications. Idaho's current law requiring identification of donors of $50 or more to candidates or political committees would remain unchanged.<br/>Action News Jax:\u00a0Attempts to regulate protests in St. Augustine raises questions about free speech<br/>By\u00a0Kevin Clark<br/>St. Augustine city commissioners are taking up a controversial ordinance aimed at regulating protests in the city's Plaza de la Constitucion.<br/>This is where major events, such as the Nights of Light's kickoff are held.<br/>During last year's event, there was a large protest against city Confederate monuments, led by the Rev. Ron Rawls of St. Paul AME Church.<br/>The proposed ordinance requires protesters and counter-protesters to remain on the perimeter sidewalk while event participants occupy the Plaza.<br/>According to the ordinance, protest and counter-protest participants may also be separated by law enforcement personnel at a designated location in order to maintain peace.<br/>Rev. Rawls says protesters are being targeted, and he sees this as an attack on First Amendment rights and free speech.<br/>\"To put us on the outside and to limit our ability to do what we're there to do, they are definitely trying to silence our voices,\" he said.<br/>New York Times:\u00a0New York Sues Exxon Mobil, Saying It Deceived Shareholders on Climate Change<br/>By\u00a0John Schwartz<br/>The investigation has spanned the tenures of two New York attorneys general and has also involved attorneys general from other states. Exxon has attempted to block the inquiry in courts in three states, and has painted it as an attempt by bullies to restrict the company's First Amendment rights and as part of an anti-fossil-fuel conspiracy backed by, among others, the Rockefeller family.<br/>Scott J. Silvestri, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said Wednesday that the New York attorney general's office had \"doubled down on its tainted, meritless investigation by filing a complaint against Exxon Mobil.\"<br/>The \"baseless allegations,\" Mr. Silvestri said, \"are a product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing. The company looks forward to refuting these claims as soon as possible and getting this meritless civil lawsuit dismissed.\" ...<br/>The investigation first came to light in November 2015, about a year after it was begun by former Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman. Before long, other state attorneys general announced their support for Mr. Schneiderman's efforts; some, notably Maura Healey of Massachusetts, started investigations of their own...<br/>The company pledged to stop funding groups that directly challenged the science of climate change in the mid-2000s...<br/>In addition, Exxon recently announced it would spend $1 million over the next two years to finance a group promoting \"carbon dividend\" legislation that would tax carbon dioxide emissions and then return the money that is collected back to taxpayers.<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Watchdog group says D.C. mayor's rally may have violated campaign finance rules<br/>By\u00a0Fenit Nirappil<br/>A government watchdog group has accused D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) of violating campaign finance rules by holding a rally to boost council candidates in the most competitive race of the November general election.<br/>The complaint filed by Public Citizen alleges that the Bowser campaign's Oct. 14 get-out-the-vote rally featuring at-large council contenders Anita Bonds (D) and Dionne Reeder (I) constituted an improper donation to their campaigns.<br/>It's not unusual for elected officials to campaign for other candidates. But Public Citizen, a nonprofit organization advocating to reduce the influence of money in politics, said Bowser appeared to have crossed a line by spending campaign funds on the event.<br/>A mailer advertising the rally sent to households across the city and signs posted at the event described it as a \"get-out-the-vote\" rally and referred to the two candidates as \"special guests.\" Bowser, who faces no serious competition in November, endorsed Bonds and Reeder at rally.<br/>In its complaint, Public Citizen said the event appeared to be coordinated with Bonds and Reeder and therefore subject to a $1,000 limit for in-kind campaign contributions. The complaint cited no specific evidence of coordination, but urged campaign finance officials to investigate.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-40552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3357\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NEW YORK METS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkU5NzdDMzI5QTcxNDQ5QTg3NDAwNjNGM0MwMTgxNEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODdEMDhDREQzOEQ2NDE2RkE2Njk3RTNEMUM0NTE3MEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDk1NjM1M0M1QUYxNDlEMDgxNjI1Qzk3NkRDNDhCRjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwRjUxMDRFN0JBNEMxMEI3MDhDNzhBMjA4NzU2MzM</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Political Speech</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTU4MjU4OEY5QjEwNEEzMUE0MEQ3OEVCMDhERTE5MDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Scope</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFFNzEwMUYzNEU3NDdGRTg4RUM2OUM0ODI1ODg2QjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Control &amp;

Smith<br/>Days after Mark Zuckerberg planted his flag in favor of free speech by announcing that Facebook wouldn\u2019t censor political advertising, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, apparently bowing to pressure from his platform\u2019s largely liberal user base, announced a contrary policy: Twitter will no longer accept any political ads\u2026<br/>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach,\u201d explained Dorsey. But of course it\u2019s about free expression. Speech-particularly speech about elections-is worth little without an audience. In modern society, it takes money to \u201creach\u201d most audiences. That\u2019s why businesses advertise, governments spend millions on public education programs, and people spend money to travel to mass rallies, buy bumper stickers, and engage in other forms of political communication. It\u2019s an elementary principle of First Amendment law that you can\u2019t limit spending in order to limit the reach of speech. You can\u2019t prevent Planned Parenthood, for example, from speaking about abortion rights, and you can\u2019t end-run the First Amendment by prohibiting them from spending money to advocate for that same cause\u2026<br/>Twitter will ban not just candidate ads, but \u201cissue ads,\u201d because they \u201cpresent a way to circumvent.\u201d Does this mean that an ad promoting a documentary warning about (or dismissive of) climate change should be banned?</p><p> How about an ad promoting a magazine profile of a candidate? Does a Gillette commercial lecturing men on the dangers of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d qualify as an issue ad?<br/>Twitter\u2019s new policy, and Dorsey\u2019s explanation for it, demonstrate a muddled understanding of the purpose of speech. Dorsey worries that Twitter advertising might influence voters-but influencing people is the essence of speech in a free society, and persuading others is presumably why Dorsey sent out a tweet stream explaining himself. Removing a major source of low-cost political advertising from Twitter harms those who don\u2019t yet have a large audience but are looking for an inexpensive way to reach voters and identify new supporters.<br/>St. Louis Post-Dispatch:\u00a0Federal appeals court says Missouri lobbying rules don\u2019t apply to activist<br/>By Erin Heffernan<br/>The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that requiring Ron Calzone to sign up as a lobbyist unjustly limits his First Amendment rights because he isn\u2019t paid to press his views with members of the state Legislature and offers them nothing of value.<br/>The 6-5 ruling overturned a decision last November by a three-judge panel of the same court. That panel had declared that the Missouri Ethics Commission could require Calzone to register in the name of transparency and preventing corruption\u2026<br/>Calzone\u2019s legal battle began in 2014 when he was the subject of a complaint to the ethics commission for failing to file the $10 registration form and follow other reporting requirements for lobbyists.<br/>The commission decided the next year that Calzone should have been registering and would need to in the future. The commission also ordered him to pay a $1,000 fine.<br/>Calzone sued to overturn the decision and the case eventually landed in the federal appeals court. After the three-judge panel\u2019s ruling against Calzone last year, the full court made the unusual move this summer to review the panel\u2019s ruling\u2026<br/>Lawyers from the Institute for Free Speech and the Freedom Center of Missouri represented him in the case.<br/>Calzone attorney Allen Dickerson argued that requiring him to register as a lobbyist would set a dangerous precedent.<br/>\u201cThe government would have treated every civically-engaged Boy Scout troop and Audubon Society chapter like a group of paid lobbyists, merely for speaking with their elected representatives,\u201d he said in a statement.<br/>Election Law Blog:\u00a0Divided En Banc 8th Circuit Strikes Down Application of Lobbying Law to Lobbyist Who Was Uncompensated and Engaged in No Spending; But Decision Ominous for Constitutionality of Lobbying Disclosure Laws Generally<br/>By Rick Hasen<br/>If I had more time, I\u2019d write this up, but for now I will leave you with just the link to\u00a0Calzone v. Summers.<br/>Cato:\u00a0The SHIELD Act and Free Political Speech (Podcast)<br/>Featuring Scott Blackburn and Caleb O. Brown<br/>New legislation aimed at curbing foreign influence in U.S. elections also appears to be aimed at curbing Americans\u2019 influence in U.S. elections. Scott Blackburn of the Institute for Free Speech comments.<br/>Politico:\u00a0Eyes turn to Google as political ads divide Silicon Valley<br/>By\u00a0Steven Overly<br/>\u201cGoogle has been very adroit at ducking a lot of attention, whether it\u2019s the result of purposeful action or not,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told POLITICO on Thursday. \u201cBut it bears equal scrutiny.\u201d<br/>Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) told POLITICO they also want to see Google explain itself or rethink its policies.<br/>The search giant has never spelled out whether it allows political candidates to put false messages into paid ads, but in practice, its approach appears similar to Facebook\u2019s permissive policy\u2026<br/>Political ads represent a fairly minuscule portion of the billions in advertising revenue pouring into tech giants like Facebook and Google, but the debate over how to handle them could have enormous implications for the messages that voters see during the 2020 campaign, including from President Donald Trump\u2019s big-spending reelection campaign. And that has provoked a sharp partisan divide on the policies the big platforms should pursue, with Democrats urging a hard line against fakery while many Republicans warn against censoring online speech\u2026<br/>Schatz suggested the company should be able to put a hard ban on misleading ads without pulling out of political advertising altogether. \u201cI just think every platform of consequence has to determine their way forward in terms of whether or not they\u2019re going to allow explicit lies on their platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not that hard to have a policy that says, we will not allow you to lie explicitly and take money for it.\u201d<br/>Others, though, are less convinced that\u2019s a tenable position.<br/>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt for people to wait and see how some of these things play out,\u201d said Brad Smith, founder of the Institute for Free Speech and a former GOP chairman of the FEC, who sharply criticized Twitter\u2019s political ads ban. \u201cBut I think the choice really comes down to allow it all or ban it all. Policing it is something you can never do satisfactorily.\u201d<br/>Bloomberg Government:\u00a0Adelson, Thiel Among Givers to GOP Group Forced to Reveal Donors<br/>By\u00a0Kenneth P. Doyle<br/>Their donations to the nonprofit, Americans for Job Security, were revealed after a long court battle and a settlement with the Federal Election Commission\u2026<br/>\u201cThese people tried to get around the law and keep their massive political money secret. It took a long time, but transparency and the rule of law prevailed,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder executive director of the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which spearheaded the legal battle to reveal the group\u2019s donors\u2026<br/>Donors can still give to campaign spending groups that promise secrecy, but \u201cthe likelihood of remaining anonymous forever is significantly diminished\u201d due to recent rulings favoring disclosure, said election law attorney Brett Kappel in a phone interview.<br/>Groups wanting to maintain confidentiality must be more careful about not spending too much of their money on campaign messages, said Kappel, who is a partner at Akerman law firm\u2026<br/>Opponents of disclosure warn that forcing greater transparency for groups speaking out on controversial policy issues could suppress free speech across the board. Alex Baiocco of the nonprofit Institute for Free Speech, a critic of campaign finance regulation, noted that some liberal groups like the American Civil Liberties Union have lobbied against increased donor disclosure.<br/>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s often lost in the discussion, nonprofit donor disclosure laws affect groups across the ideological spectrum,\u201d Baiocco said in a recent blog post. Disclosure requirements undermine democratic debate by threatening free speech and privacy in association, he said.<br/>AJS had promised its donors they would never be revealed. The group\u2019s president, Stephen DeMaura, told the FEC in a deposition that avoiding donor disclosure was a major factor in how and where the nonprofit decided to conduct its activities, according to a report from the FEC general counsel\u2019s office.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Volunteers Are Not Lobbyists, Rules Eighth Circuit<br/>Nearly five years ago, the Missouri Ethics Commission (\u201cMEC\u201d) ordered Ron Calzone, an unpaid grassroots activist, to pay a $1,000 fine and prohibited him from discussing policy with lawmakers until he registered and filed reports as though he was a professional \u201clobbyist.\u201d Because the First Amendment guarantees the freedom to share one\u2019s policy ideas with public officials, Calzone challenged the MEC\u2019s order. [Friday], the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals sitting en banc confirmed that the Constitution does not allow states to treat unpaid citizen activists like professional lobbyists\u2026<br/>\u201cIt has been a long time coming, but I\u2019m pleased that the Court of Appeals got this right,\u201d Mr. Calzone said. \u201cUnpaid citizen activists like myself keep our elected officials informed and accountable by sharing our views about public policy. A government cannot force unpaid activists to jump through regulatory hoops in order to exercise their First Amendment rights.\u201d<br/>Lawyers from the Institute for Free Speech and the Freedom Center of Missouri represented Mr. Calzone.<br/>\u201cThe State of Missouri\u2019s dogged pursuit of Mr. Calzone completely ignored the cost its policy imposed on civil society,\u201d said Allen Dickerson, Legal Director of the Institute for Free Speech. \u201cThe Government would have treated every civically-engaged Boy Scout troop and Audubon Society chapter like a group of paid lobbyists, merely for speaking with their elected representatives. Thankfully, the Court held that the First Amendment stands against the professionalization of our right to petition the government.\u201d<br/>\u201cOur system of government depends on people like Ron actively sharing their policy ideas with those in power, but for years powerful legislators have been trying to silence him,\u201d said David Roland, Director of Litigation for the Freedom Center of Missouri. \u201cToday\u2019s decision should make clear that the Constitution shields these citizen activists against these efforts to restrict their First Amendment rights.\u201d<br/>To read the full opinion,\u00a0click here.

Even the most sophisticated Arab diplomats that I dealt with did not understand why the First Amendment allows someone to burn a Koran. Why, they asked me, would you ever want to protect that? \u2026<br/>The modern standard of dangerous speech comes from Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) and holds that speech that directly incites \u201cimminent lawless action\u201d or is likely to do so can be restricted. Domestic terrorists such as Dylann Roof and Omar Mateen and the El Paso shooter were consumers of hate speech. Speech doesn\u2019t pull the trigger, but does anyone seriously doubt that such hateful speech creates a climate where such acts are more likely?<br/>Let the debate begin. Hate speech has a less violent, but nearly as damaging, impact in another way: It diminishes tolerance. It enables discrimination. Isn\u2019t that, by definition, speech that undermines the values that the First Amendment was designed to protect: fairness, due process, equality before the law? Why shouldn\u2019t the states experiment with their own version of hate speech statutes to penalize speech that deliberately insults people based on religion, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation?<br/>All speech is not equal. And where truth cannot drive out lies, we must add new guardrails.\u00a0<br/>Reason:\u00a0Former Time Editor and CEO of Constitution Center (!) Wants To Cancel First Amendment, Pass Hate Speech Laws<br/>By\u00a0Nick Gillespie<br/>If you need more proof that free expression is under serious and sustained attack, look no further than The Washington Post, that legendary and often self-congratulatory bastion of First Amendment support, which has just published an op-ed calling for hate speech laws because \u201con the Internet, truth is not optimized. On the Web, it\u2019s not enough to battle falsehood with truth; the truth doesn\u2019t always win.\u201d<br/>What\u2019s even more disheartening is that the author is Richard Stengel, a former managing editor of Time, chairman of the National Constitution Center, and Obama-era State Department official whose soul-searching apparently began when challenged by diplomats from a part of the world notorious for particularly brutal forms of censorship. As a journalist, Stengel avers, he loved, loved, loved the First Amendment and its commitment to free speech. But then he got stumped by unnamed representatives of unnamed governments who asked banal questions\u2026<br/>Older boomers are syncing with millennials and younger Americans, who show a strong predilection to limiting \u201cbad\u201d speech (a 2015 Pew survey found 40 percent of millennials supported censoring \u201coffensive statements about minorities\u201d). These are not good developments, and neither is an op-ed in The Washington Post calling for an effective revocation of the First Amendment. Throw in bipartisan interest in regulating social media platforms as public utilities, the president\u2019s interest in \u201copening up\u201d the libel laws so he can more easily sue his critics, the rise of \u201ccancel culture,\u201d and we\u2019re one Zippo lighter short of a good, old-fashioned book burning.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Courthouse News Service:\u00a0Maryland\u2019s Online Political Ad Law Debated in Fourth Circuit<br/>By\u00a0Brad Kutner<br/>Maryland\u2019s effort to regulate online political ads was met with skepticism by a Fourth Circuit judge Wednesday, as a state attorney defending against a challenge by The Washington Post and other newspapers argued the law doesn\u2019t violate digital publishers\u2019 right to free speech\u2026<br/>[A]t Wednesday\u2019s hearing in the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court, U.S. Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson zeroed in on who is actually burdened with generating information about the ad buyer and their political links under the law\u2026<br/>While Wilkinson admitted the burdens imposed by the current law might be innocuous, he was unsure what approving them now would open the door to later.<br/>\u201cTrying to stop [foreign influence] with regulation of political speech, the most treasured speech in a democracy\u2026.turns the First Amendment on its head,\u201d he said\u2026<br/>When Seth D. Berlin, an attorney with Ballard Spahr who argued on behalf of the publishers, began his oral arguments, Wilkinson did offer some support to Maryland\u2019s efforts.<br/>\u201cDark money is concerning, disclosure is a disinfectant,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we not want to add to the fund of information made with disclosures?\u201d<br/>Berlin agreed, but argued the sections of the law that aren\u2019t burdensome were duplicitous to campaign finance laws already on the books.<br/>He argued political campaigns must report what they spend to the state board of elections, which in turn makes that information available online. Asking online platforms to also publish this information, he suggested, would harm smaller publishers without the means to financially support such an endeavor.<br/>ACLU:\u00a0The FBI is Tracking Our Faces in Secret. We\u2019re Suing.<br/>By\u00a0Kade Crockford<br/>[W]e\u2019re asking a federal court to intervene and order the FBI and related agencies to turn over all records concerning their use of face recognition technology.<br/>The FBI\u2019s troubling political policing practices underscore the urgent need for transparency. Under the leadership of the agency\u2019s patriarch \u2013 the disgraced J. Edgar Hoover \u2013 the FBI obsessively spied on left-wing, Indigenous rights, anti-war, and Black power activists across the country. Hoover infamously tried to blackmail Martin Luther King, Jr., encouraging the civil rights leader to kill himself to avoid the shame Hoover\u2019s leaks to journalists would bring to him and his family. The FBI was also involved in the 1969 killing of Fred Hampton, a brilliant Chicago leader in the Black Panther Party who was assassinated by Chicago Police while he lay asleep in his bed next to his pregnant girlfriend.<br/>While Hoover\u2019s reign may be history, the FBI\u2019s campaign against domestic dissent is not.<br/>Since at least 2010, the FBI has monitored civil society groups, including racial justice movements, Occupy Wall Street, environmentalists, Palestinian solidarity activists, Abolish ICE protesters, and Cuba and Iran normalization proponents. In recent years, the FBI has wasted considerable resources to spy on Black activists, who the agency labeled \u201cBlack Identity Extremists\u201d to justify even more surveillance of the Black Lives Matter movement and other fights for racial justice. The agency has also investigated climate justice activists including 350.org and the Standing Rock water protectors under the banner of protecting national security.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>The Hill:\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg is right, Jack Dorsey is wrong<br/>By\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz<br/>It should come as no surprise that leftist politicians and media influencers praised Dorsey\u2019s announcement, urging Facebook and Google to follow suit and jump on board the censorship train by banning political ads as well.<br/>Doing so would be profoundly harmful. Here\u2019s why.<br/>First, if banning political ads \u2013 from candidates, groups, or individual citizens \u2013 becomes the norm, that only stands to benefit two groups: incumbent politicians and the mainstream media.<br/>Incumbent politicians have tons of money and a huge megaphone to spread their message. If you ban political advertising from social media, how on earth is any upstart challenger supposed to beat an incumbent? \u2026<br/>Twitter\u2019s rule also bans you, the individual citizen, from speaking about politics. If you want to run an ad that says \u201cI\u2019m from Venezuela, and I\u2019ve seen first-hand that socialism doesn\u2019t work,\u201d you can\u2019t. If you want to run an ad that says \u201cTed Cruz is a nincompoop,\u201d you can\u2019t either.<br/>What Jack Dorsey is proposing is to stop you, individually, or in a group \u2013 whether it be the Sierra Club, the NRA, Planned Parenthood, AIPAC, or a totally new not-for-profit group trying to advocate for a particular idea \u2013 from being able to speak actively about public policy.<br/>And if citizens are silenced, then the media and politicians are the only ones left\u2026<br/>Second, Twitter\u2019s ban only further empowers Silicon Valley billionaires, who already have a stronghold on defining what is truthful or acceptable speech, to now define what is and what is not \u201cpolitical.\u201d It\u2019s up to them to determine where to draw the line \u2013 and they won\u2019t stop here. Banning ads is just the beginning.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Don\u2019t abolish political ads on social media. Stop microtargeting.<br/>By\u00a0Ellen L. Weintraub<br/>Here\u2019s a move that would allow political ads while deterring disinformation campaigns, restoring transparency and protecting the robust marketplace of ideas: Sell political ads, but stop the practice of microtargeting those ads\u2026<br/>One of the primary ailments of the current online political advertising system is the way Internet platforms sell their ads. Microtargeting by foreign and domestic actors in 2016 proved to be a potent weapon for spreading disinformation and sowing discord. There is no reason to think it will not be wielded even more effectively going forward. The microtargeting of political ads may be undermining the united character of our United States.<br/>Such ads also undermine the main remedy that the Supreme Court has set out for lies in politics: counterspeech. Counterspeech is most possible where a broad public can hear the speech and respond\u2026<br/>The remaining large sellers of Internet advertising \u2013 Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Verizon \u2013 would do well to consider voluntarily stepping back from microtargeted political ads. This would entail foregoing \u201ccustom audiences\u201d programs and allowing express-advocacy ads and electioneering communications (ads that mention candidate names and run right before Election Day) to be targeted only by large and fully disclosed geographic areas\u2026<br/>It would be unwise, unnecessary and counterproductive for political speech to be shut out of the Internet advertising market altogether. The overall advertising market has moved decisively toward the Internet. Political advertising on the Internet is an important part of our political discourse \u2013 perhaps the most important. I favor more political speech, not less.<br/>The far less drastic step of forswearing the microtargeting of political ads would in essence turn back the clock about a dozen years.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>USA Today:\u00a0Facebook: We shouldn\u2019t become the gatekeeper of truth on candidate ads<br/>By\u00a0Katie Harbath and Nell McCarthy<br/>Anyone who thinks Facebook should decide which claims by politicians are acceptable might ask themselves this question: Why do you want us to have so much power?<br/>In our view, the only thing worse than Facebook not making these calls is for Facebook to make these calls.<br/>Our approach is consistent with companies like YouTube and Twitter. And broadcasters are required by federal law not to censor candidate ads.<br/>In fact, the ad that touched off this debate ran nearly 1,000 times on local TV stations in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.<br/>So if people have a problem with Facebook\u2019s policy, they have a problem with the way political speech is protected in this country.<br/>Speech from candidates and elected officials is already highly scrutinized; it\u2019s a good thing. But for that to happen, the public and the news media have to see it. In fact, if Facebook became the gatekeeper of truth, the first people to complain would be those who are complaining now \u2013 for good reason.<br/>Our policies don\u2019t mean that politicians can say whatever they want. They can\u2019t spread misinformation about where, when or how to vote, for example, or content that risks imminent harm or incites violence\u2026<br/>We realize not everyone agrees with our decision, and we welcome that debate. But fundamentally we believe that, in a democracy, it\u2019s better to let voters make their own decisions, not companies like Facebook.<br/>CNN:\u00a0This man is running for governor of California so he can run false Facebook ads<br/>By\u00a0Donie O\u2019Sullivan<br/>Adriel Hampton, a political activist who runs his own marketing firm in San Francisco, registered at his local post office on Monday morning as a candidate for governor of California.<br/>Hampton told CNN Business that he will use his new status as a candidate to run false ads on Facebook (FB) about President Trump, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and other Facebook executives\u2026<br/>His goal is to force Facebook to stop allowing politicians to run false ads\u2026<br/>Hampton is the treasurer of \u201cThe Really Online Lefty League\u201d PAC, which last Thursday began running a false ad on Facebook claiming that Senator Lindsey Graham backed the Green New Deal.<br/>The ad spliced together different audio of Graham speaking to make it sound like he said, \u201cSimply put, we believe in the Green New Deal.\u201d Graham never said that.<br/>The ad was eventually flagged by Facebook\u2019s fact-checkers and was removed. While Facebook allows politicians to lie in ads, it does not allow PACs or other political groups to do so.<br/>Hampton hopes that by being a candidate he will be able to run false ads without Facebook stopping him.<br/>\u201cThe genesis of this campaign is social media regulation and to ensure there is not an exemption in fact-checking specifically for politicians like Donald Trump who like to lie online,\u201d he told CNN Business\u2026<br/>Hampton said he anticipates his campaign will start accepting donations to run false ads and even suggested others could join him in his quest to call-out Facebook. \u201cIt is actually easy to file to run for office and basically 100 people could do what I just did,\u201d he said.<br/>While his main motivation for running for governor at the moment is to run Facebook ads, Hampton suggested his campaign could become a fully fledged gubernatorial campaign. \u201cDon\u2019t count me out,\u201d he said.<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0The Technology 202: Here\u2019s why Twitter may have trouble enforcing its own political ads ban<br/>By\u00a0Cat Zakrzewski<br/>Twitter will likely be judged on whether it can accurately identify the ads it says will be prohibited. Major questions also remain about how Twitter plans to define third-party \u201cissue ads.\u201d<br/>The company says it intends to also prohibit such ads advocating for hot-button political issues such as immigration or climate change. But many journalists and technologists have noted there aren\u2019t clear lines when it comes to determining what an issue ad is.<br/>My colleague Philip Bump outlined how difficult it could be to set such limits in a recent column:<br/>\u201cAn ad from House candidate Joe Smith would be banned,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAn ad from Citizens for Green Space that touts Smith\u2019s record on creating Municipal Park is a bit murkier but still pretty clear. But what about an ad from the Westside Neighborhood Association inviting people to come out to an event at beautiful Municipal Park, which is a central part of Smith\u2019s campaign pitch? The line gets quite blurry, quite fast.\u201d<br/>The ambiguous nature of issue ads is one of the key reasons that Zuckerberg says Facebook has not adopted a policy prohibiting political ads.<br/>\u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to define where to draw the line,\u201d Zuckerberg said on a recent earnings call. \u201cWould we really block ads for important political issues like climate change or women\u2019s empowerment?\u201d\u2026<br/>Larger technology companies have struggled to enforce bans on political ads. The Verge\u2019s Makena Kelly wrote that both Google and Facebook decided to ban political ads in the state of Washington because of the complicated campaign finance laws in place there. But those bans haven\u2019t stopped local politicians from trying to disseminate ads on their platforms. In Seattle\u2019s city council elections, high-profile ads covered by the media were often removed. But many smaller ads managed to pass through, Kelly writes.<br/>\u201cInstead, it\u2019s resulted in a tangle of uneven enforcement and confusing rules, making it a cautionary tale for what a poorly implemented ad ban might mean for the 2020 campaigns,\u201d she wrote.<br/>Reason:\u00a0Twitter\u2019s Ban on Political Ads Will Help Incumbent Politicians Maintain Power<br/>By\u00a0Scott Shackford<br/>Nobody really likes political ads. But they do serve important purposes to advance democracy, particularly for those challenging the status quo. Incumbent politicians have a massive advantage not just in money raised but the fact that they have years of \u201cearned media\u201d over the work they do. Incumbents are operating with a much higher level of name recognition among their constituencies. With very few exceptions (almost always very rich citizens), anybody who seeks to challenge incumbents or our more powerful political organizations starts off at a huge disadvantage.<br/>For Dorsey to treat the reach of these politicians as something that just happened organically is to deliberately ignore that their power and control over government strongly incentivizes voters to be aware of what decisions their elected officials are making.<br/>The ability to spend money to improve the reach of a candidate\u2019s message is not a corrupting influence on democracy-it\u2019s a powerful balancing tool that allows a challenger to let people know he or she exists in the first place. Democracy is improved when challengers to power have avenues to reach voters that aren\u2019t under the control of the government\u2026<br/>Twitter representatives insist that this is all about the \u201cprinciples,\u201d even though the beneficiaries of this decision are incumbent and entrenched political players who have massive amounts of reach precisely because of how much power they wield.<br/>And, of course, we cannot ignore the political context of this decision. Politicians on the left and the right want to push around social media platforms, treat them as public utilities, and either force them to ban messages the politicians disapprove of or force them to carry messages that the politicians support. While it may be Twitter\u2019s \u201cchoice\u201d to self-censor political advertisements, we cannot ignore the politicians who are using their power to influence this decision.<br/>Daily Signal:\u00a0Facebook Isn\u2019t Broken. Government Shouldn\u2019t \u2018Fix\u2019 It.<br/>By\u00a0Casey Mattox<br/>While the concerns that motivate the two parties are different, the so-called solutions to the alleged problems posed by Facebook and other social media sites that have been proposed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., aren\u2019t all that different: Regulate Facebook or break it up.<br/>Their rhetoric is also virtually indistinguishable.<br/>Warren argues that \u201ctoday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power-too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\u201d and the solution is to regulate them like public utilities that would be \u201crequired to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users.\u201d<br/>Who gets to determine what\u2019s \u201cfair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory\u201d? Rest assured: It won\u2019t be you.<br/>Hawley, who has called Facebook \u201can extremely creepy company,\u201d says \u201cthe line-drawing problems are not as difficult as folks make it sound.\u201d<br/>But who gets to determine who draws the lines? Again, not you\u2026<br/>Once we breach the dam of government regulation of social media, there is no certainty that you\u2019ll end up with Hawleybook instead of Warrenbook\u2026<br/>There are also the practical consequences. Some conservatives flippantly call for ending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the provision that ensures that Facebook and Twitter-as well as the comments section of The New York Times, Amazon, and Yelp-are not liable for what their users post.<br/>There are many responses to that, but the bottom line is that ending Section 230 would be the end of social media (and a lot of other user-created online content).<br/>If every social media company is responsible for libel by every user, expect to see the following pop up on your next Facebook status: \u201cThank you for your status update. It will be posted once it has been reviewed by our legal team. The current wait time is 3 days, 12 hours, 16 min.\u201d<br/>The post Daily Media Links 11/4 appeared first on Institute For Free

Powerful platforms have allowed movements like #BlackLivesMatter, #Not1More, and #MeToo to flourish and influence the national dialogue on issues that affect all Americans, including the most vulnerable people in the United States. But these services have also provided law enforcement with unprecedented power to monitor these growing movements and the people they represent.<br/>Often covert and conducted without oversight, social media surveillance gives law enforcement agencies the ability to monitor and archive information on millions of people\u2019s activities. This includes tracking people\u2019s political actions, a practice that endangers activists and undermines our First Amendment rights to speech and association. This is particularly concerning given repeated recent reports of targeting and surveillance of Black protesters and activists, family separation protestors, and border groups by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.<br/>At the same time, few law enforcement agencies have publicly available policies showing how they use social media data on the communities they are supposed to protect. As with other surveillance in the United States, it appears that social media monitoring has been focused disproportionately on communities of color and other marginalized communities.<br/>These monitoring tactics and law enforcement secrecy lead to civil rights and civil liberties harms. Here are six of the harmful impacts from social media surveillance that lawmakers and the public must take into account in any discussion about surveillance of social media users.<br/>PDF of coalition letter available here<br/>IFS Mourns the Passing of Donald G. Smith<br/>By Brad Smith<br/>All of us at IFS mourn the passing of Donald G. (Don) Smith this week. Through his family foundation, Don was one of the earliest IFS donors, and it was through the generous support of he and a handful of others that IFS was able to take flight back in 2005-06.<br/>Don was a true believer in free speech and open debate. My first opportunity to talk with Don at length came when he invited me to New York to participate in a debate on campaign finance, one of many his foundation sponsored on a wide variety of topics. I don\u2019t recall Don ever not coming down on the side of freedom, but he understood that there were multiple sides to every issue, and he always sought to persuade rather than bully or isolate. And then he\u2019d buy his adversary a drink.<br/>Though Don had become very successful, he was always low key, self-deprecating, and down to earth. He remembered where he came from \u2013 a picture of his family farm hung in his offices \u2013 and he was always grateful for the country and the freedom that made his success possible. Beyond that, I will simply endorse the comments of my friends\u00a0Robert Levy\u00a0and\u00a0Larry Reed.<br/>All of us at IFS offer our sincere condolences to all of Don\u2019s family and friends.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ICYMI</emphasis><br/>City Journal:\u00a0Free Speech Means Free Speech<br/>By\u00a0Bradley A. Smith<br/>Presumably, under Twitter\u2019s new policy, a campaign will be able to pay a celebrity $50,000 to tweet out an endorsement or mention. However, a candidate without celebrity fans will be unable to spend $5,000 to promote a tweet. The paid ad may be truthful, while the celebrity tweet may contain what Dorsey calls \u201cunchecked, misleading information,\u201d but only the former will be banned. Or will Twitter disable the accounts of celebrities who accept payments for their tweets, or who relay \u201cunchecked, misleading information?\u201d As determined by whom? \u2026<br/>Twitter\u2019s new policy, and Dorsey\u2019s explanation for it, demonstrate a muddled understanding of the purpose of speech. Dorsey worries that Twitter advertising might influence voters-but influencing people is the essence of speech in a free society, and persuading others is presumably why Dorsey sent out a tweet stream explaining himself. Removing a major source of low-cost political advertising from Twitter harms those who don\u2019t yet have a large audience but are looking for an inexpensive way to reach voters and identify new supporters. By Dorsey\u2019s logic, free speech should be allowed only when it is ineffective.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Axios:\u00a0The free speech election<br/>By\u00a0Sara Fischer and Alison Snyder<br/>Disagreements about how to apply the First Amendment to the speed and scale of social media are consuming the political debate this election cycle and cementing unprecedented levels of polarization\u2026<br/>In the Trump era, Republicans have found a way to leverage the loose freedoms of social media to gain an upper hand in some elections. Now, Democrats are demanding that big tech companies do something about it.<br/>Speaking at an event in New York City Monday, Hillary Clinton said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u201cshould pay a price\u201d for what he is doing to democracy\u2026<br/>Almost every major Democratic presidential candidate has condemned Facebook for its political advertising policy, while conservatives for the most part have endorsed it, or stayed quiet.<br/>Conservatives are instead focusing their political attacks on censorship, arguing that Democrats and liberal firms are out to censor their speech to voters\u2026<br/>The issue of hate speech has become another political flashpoint, with Democrats and Republicans sparring over whether their political perspectives are fair game online.<br/>Minority advocacy groups have pushed Facebook to ban Trump\u2019s ads around immigration that use nativist undertones and false ads that allege two Muslim members of Congress are \u201c\u2018anti-Israel, anti-AMERICAN, and pro-terrorist.\u201d<br/>Meanwhile, Democrats on the campaign trail are calling for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, an internet provision that protects tech companies from liability for the content people post on their platform, to be reexamined\u2026<br/>The free speech debate is creating a hyper-polarized environment that candidates are exploiting ahead of the 2020 presidential election.<br/>It\u2019s also an entry point for politicians to talk about regulating Big Tech. Unlike with machine learning bias or anti-competitive behavior, the harm from lying in political ads is easy for voters to understand and legislators to act against.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supreme Court</emphasis><br/>New Republic:\u00a0The Political Corruption Legalized by the Supreme Court<br/>By\u00a0Matt Ford<br/>Over the past 15 years, the Supreme Court has aggressively struck down campaign-finance regulations on First Amendment grounds. The system they\u2019ve carved out of Congress\u2019s efforts to constrain public corruption rests upon a series of assumptions that have proven laughable.<br/>Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign is experiencing a cash crunch of sorts, with only $9 million in the bank as of last month\u2019s filing report\u2026<br/>His campaign\u2019s most recent solution to these money woes was the creation of a super PAC. Federal law limits the amount of money that individual donors can give to a campaign, as well as to how much can be given to party organizations and traditional political action committees. But donors face no such restrictions when giving money to super PACs. There\u2019s a catch, however: Candidates and super PACs are not allowed to \u201ccoordinate\u201d their activities, lest that coordination become a means to skirt federal donation limits. The Supreme Court first articulated this divide in the 1974 case Buckley v. Valeo when it struck down federal limits on \u201cindependent expenditures,\u201d concluding that the lack of coordination reduced the risk of quid pro quo corruption.<br/>In other words, Biden and his campaign staff can\u2019t create a super PAC themselves or personally ask donors to fund one. They are, however, permitted to take the steps the Biden campaign took last month: reveal to reporters that they\u2019ve dropped their opposition to super PACs and let news outlets publicize that information\u2026<br/>Federal campaign finance laws are supposed to reduce the reality or appearance of corruption in American politics. In recent years, however, this regulatory regime has lent corruption a legal structure in which to flourish.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Office of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch\u00a0McConnell:\u00a0Twitter\u2019s Ban on Paid Political Speech Follows Anti-Speech Headwinds from Washington<br/>U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered the following remarks today on the Senate floor discussing the First Amendment: \u2026<br/>\u201cJust a few days ago, on October 23rd, I explained how the threat of a heavy regulatory burden has already, quote, \u201cfrightened media platforms into rejecting political ads altogether. It\u2019s a textbook example of policy designed to reduce the amount of free speech in this country.\u201d End quote.<br/>\u201cAnd then, seven days later, here\u2019s what happened: Twitter announced their platform will ban all political ads\u2026<br/>\u201cTwitter\u2019s announced policy would not level the playing field. It would only reinforce echo chambers. It would prevent a local candidate on a shoestring budget from using a small amount of money to promote a tweet so more of his neighbors can learn about his campaign. And it would seemingly reserve a special privilege for major media corporations while denying nonprofits the same opportunity.<br/>\u201cSuch a policy would not bolster our democracy. It would degrade democracy. It would amplify the advantage of media companies, celebrities, and certain other established elites while denying an important tool to the Americans who disagree with them\u2026<br/>\u201cObviously, Twitter can set whatever policy they want. This is a private-sector company. But companies respond to incentives. It is easy to see the influence of Washington D.C. and leading Democrats behind this announcement.<br/>\u201cMy Democratic colleagues have threatened to impose huge regulatory liability on platforms that run political ads. . .and now a prominent platform has preemptively decided that allowing certain kinds of political speech is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.<br/>\u201cIt does not serve our democracy for Democratic leaders to chill or suppress the free exchange of ideas through federal policy. And it does not serve our democracy for private-sector leaders to take away a crucial tool that helps less-prominent speakers make their case to the American people.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>CNBC:\u00a0Elizabeth Warren slams Twitter for a policy that bans ads from groups fighting climate change<br/>By\u00a0Salvador Rodriguez<br/>On Tuesday, Sen. Warren, who\u2019s running for president, slammed Twitter\u2019s new ad policy that bans political ads. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, the Massachusetts Democrat attacked the company for blocking organizations that are fighting climate change from running ads on the social network while allowing ads from companies like Exxon on the same topic.<br/>Her criticism comes a week after Twitter said it would no longer allow political ads on its service, a policy that blocks ads from politicians, ads that refer to an election or candidate or ads related to politically-sensitive issues.<br/>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded to Warren with a tweet on Tuesday, saying that the company will announce the specifics of its new ad policies on Nov. 15.<br/>Warren has been on a crusade against Big Tech throughout her presidential campaign. In March, she proposed the breakup of companies like Facebook and Amazon, and last month she criticized Facebook for its own political ad policies, which allow candidates to run ads that include false information.<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended his company\u2019s political ads policy, saying in a speech at Georgetown University that \u201cbanning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers.\u201d\u2026<br/>Part of Twitter\u2019s policy bans \u201cads that advocate for or against legislative issues of national importance (such as: climate change, healthcare, immigration, national security, taxes),\u201d according to a tweet from Vijaya Gadde, Twitter\u2019s lead for legal, public policy and trust and safety lead.<br/>Gen (by Medium):\u00a0Facebook\u2019s Knee-Jerk Reaction Could Hand Trump the Election<br/>By\u00a0Tara McGowan<br/>Last week, after Twitter announced its decision to ban political advertising from its site, a growing chorus of Democratic operatives and pundits began advocating for Facebook to follow suit. I\u2019ll be blunt: A blanket political advertising ban on Facebook would have disastrous consequences for Democrats \u2013 and my friends on the left should reconsider advocating for such a move.<br/>I\u2019ve built my career working at the intersection of digital advertising and progressive politics. I also wholeheartedly believe in campaign finance reform and the critical need for the government regulation of Facebook. My organization, Acronym, builds digital infrastructure and runs progressive campaigns online\u2026<br/>If Facebook were to eliminate political advertising tomorrow, Trump would still be able to communicate with his supporters organically, while the Democratic nominee would be permanently resigned to a much smaller audience for the general election.<br/>While organic reach on the platform is a huge advantage for any candidate, the ability to collect data about voters on Facebook through political ads, which a campaign can then use to reach those voters off Facebook and on other platforms, is an even greater advantage. Trump\u2019s campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars amassing data on tens of millions of voters for this very purpose. Without political ads, no Democratic candidate or organization will be able to catch up.<br/>On top of that, Democratic campaigns have historically relied on small-dollar, grassroots donors at a higher rate than their Republican opponents \u2013 and Facebook is the prime marketplace for finding new supporters to ask for money. Especially in an election year where one of the leading Democratic candidates, Elizabeth Warren, has sworn off large-dollar fundraising altogether, this would cut off a vital artery of cash to our side. It\u2019s worth noting that while Warren has been one of Facebook\u2019s biggest critics, she\u2019s yet to call for a ban on political Facebook ads \u2013 because it could cripple her campaign.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Bloomberg:\u00a0Empower the FEC to Fight Election Crime<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, two Soviet-born associates of Rudolph Giuliani, are charged with funneling $325,000 in foreign money into a super-PAC supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign. Their indictment should serve as a warning about the threat of foreign manipulation of U.S. elections. It also proves the need for a functioning Federal Election Commission.<br/>After a resignation in August, the six-seat commission is down to only three members. The commission needs four for a quorum, and requires a quorum to authorize investigations by its office of general counsel. So FEC lawyers can work on cases previously authorized, but they can\u2019t investigate new ones until the president nominates, and the Senate confirms, at least one new commissioner.<br/>Trump has nominated Texas lawyer James \u201cTrey\u201d Trainor III \u2026<br/>McConnell should immediately schedule hearings on the Trainor nomination. The commission needs another Republican to restore its partisan balance as well as to form a quorum. Then, he and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer should offer Trump five qualified nominees, enabling a clean sweep of old members (all of whose terms have nominally expired) by new replacements.<br/>New York Times:\u00a0GOP Files Complaint Against Possible McConnell Challenger<br/>By Associated Press<br/>The Republican Party of Kentucky has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against a radio host who is considering a run to unseat U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.<br/>The complaint, filed Tuesday, seeks an investigation of Matt Jones, who has announced an exploratory committee to run as a Democrat in next year\u2019s Senate race. Another Democrat, Amy McGrath , has already filed to run.<br/>The complaint alleges Jones is already a candidate and is using his statewide sports radio show to promote himself. The complaint cites \u201cegregious violations\u201d of federal campaign finance law concerning corporate contributions\u2026<br/>The complaint alleges that iHeartMedia, the company that syndicates Jones\u2019 radio show, is making \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions to his campaign by airing his opinions of McConnell on his show. The complaint also says Jones\u2019 book publisher is paying for Jones to take a tour around the state.<br/>\u201cMr. Jones used his radio show to broadcast the statewide tour, which serves to promote both his candidacy and his campaign-related book,\u201d the complaint said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>The Atlantic:\u00a0Too Much Democracy Is Bad for Democracy<br/>By\u00a0Jonathan Rauch and Ray La Raja<br/>Two filters are better than one. Electoral and professional perspectives check and improve each other. Each provides the other with vital information that otherwise would be missed. Among the reasons: \u2026<br/>Professional vetting checks the power of donors and the media. Thanks to court decisions such as SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission, political fundraising and spending by independent groups effectively have no limit. Formerly compelled to seek funds from many establishment donors, candidates can now be bankrolled by quirky billionaires with pet agendas\u2026<br/>Among progressive candidates, it has become popular to abstain from raising money from deep-pocketed individuals and corporations, and instead to rely on small donations from grassroots supporters. Like many other observers, we value the participatory enthusiasm of small donors, yet there\u2019s a troubling downside. Academic research suggests that small donors are not representative of the electorate. They are as extreme and polarized as large donors, perhaps more so. They are also skewed demographically compared with the rest of America: They are wealthier, whiter, and older.<br/>Extremist candidates tend to do better at raising small-donor money, because they get the media\u2019s attention by staking out bold (if unrealistic) positions and making attention-grabbing statements, many of which violate political norms. It is no coincidence that in the 2016 election, Trump shattered records, bringing in more money from small donors than Barack Obama did in his 2012 campaign and accumulating slightly more than both Clinton and Sanders combined.<br/>Our point is not that small donations are necessarily bad or good. It is that small donations are more constructive in a system that provides professional vetting than in a free-for-all. Then there are the media, who have completely different incentives than political professionals when they evaluate candidates. The media prefer the novel, the colorful, and the combative, qualities that drive compelling narratives, not ones that make for effective governing. Restoring insider influence in the nominating process will not vitiate the role of the media in covering campaigns, nor should it. But it will help ensure that candidates are vetted for competence.<br/>Los Angeles Times:\u00a0\u2018Deep fake\u2019 videos could upend an election \u2013 but Silicon Valley may have a way to combat them<br/>By\u00a0Evan Halper<br/>On Tuesday, leaders in artificial intelligence plan to unveil a tool to push back \u2013 it includes scanning software that UC Berkeley has been developing in partnership with the U.S. military, which the industry will start providing to journalists and political operatives. The goal is to give the media and campaigns a chance to screen possible fake videos before they could throw an election into chaos\u2026<br/>The worry that has gripped artificial intelligence innovators is of a fake video surfacing days before a major election that could throw a race into turmoil. Perhaps it would be grainy footage purporting to show President Trump plotting to enrich himself off the presidency or Joe Biden hatching a deal with industry lobbyists or Sen. Elizabeth Warren mocking Native Americans\u2026<br/>A new California law, AB 730, which takes effect in January, will make it illegal to distribute manipulated audio or video of a candidate that is maliciously deceptive and \u201cwould falsely appear to a reasonable person to be authentic.\u201d There is a bipartisan effort in Congress to pass similar legislation.<br/>Such bans, though, are legally precarious and could prove difficult to enforce in part because the line between a malicious fake and a satirical video protected under the 1st Amendment is a difficult one to draw\u2026<br/>A company like Facebook, for example, might not be able to distinguish between a deep fake and a run-of-the mill political video with real footage that has been legitimately and obviously altered for effect \u2013 maybe to highlight the candidate, or to make a satirical point\u2026<br/>And even if the detection technology turns out to be flawless, the reluctance of Facebook and other social media giants to take down even demonstrably false and misleading content threatens to limit its effectiveness.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Media\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Salt Lake Tribune:\u00a0In historic shift, The Salt Lake Tribune gets IRS approval to become a nonprofit<br/>By\u00a0Matt Canham<br/>The Salt Lake Tribune is now a nonprofit, an unprecedented transformation for a legacy U.S. daily that is intended to bolster its financial prospects during a troubling time for journalism nationwide.<br/>The IRS approved the shift in a letter dated Oct. 29, deeming The Tribune a 501(c)(3) public charity. That means supporters can start making tax deductible donations now.<br/>The move from a for-profit model was spurred by Tribune owner Paul Huntsman, who, in agreeing to turn Utah\u2019s largest paper into a nonprofit, is giving up his sole ownership.<br/>\u201cThe current business model for local newspapers is broken and beyond repair,\u201d said Huntsman, who also serves as The Tribune\u2019s publisher. \u201cWe needed to find a way to sustain this vital community institution well beyond my ownership, and nonprofit status will help us do that. This is truly excellent news for all Utah residents and for local news organizations across the country.\u201d\u2026<br/>Other U.S. newspapers, such as The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Tampa Bay Times, draw support from nonprofits, and newspapers including The New York Times and Seattle Times benefit from foundations. No other legacy newspaper has made the full switch to nonprofit status\u2026<br/>The IRS accepted The Tribune\u2019s application without limitation. That means The Tribune will continue to provide its full breadth of coverage on politics, the arts, religion, environment, sports, opinion and more.<br/>The Tribune will, however, stop any endorsements of political candidates going forward as required by the law governing nonprofits, but the editorial board, which is separate from the news staff, will continue to opine on the big issues of the day. The change has no bearing on columnists or cartoonist Bagley.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Common Dreams:\u00a0\u2018Historic\u2019 Alaska Ruling Could Provide Roadmap to Defeating Citizens United<br/>By\u00a0Eoin Higgins<br/>Anchorage Superior Court Judge William F. Morse ordered the state to impose limits on donations to political groups in Alaska, saying in the ruling (pdf) that the Alaska Public Offices Commission (APOC), which handles election enforcement, \u201cshould reinstate enforcement of the contribution limits at issue.\u201d The decision is expected to head to the Alaska Supreme Court.<br/>In a statement, election reform group Equal Citizens founder Lawrence Lessig said that the decision in favor of three Alaskan citizens contesting the unlimited donations was \u201chistoric.\u201d<br/>\u201cThis decision gives Alaskans and all Americans a chance to revisit those destructive decisions,\u201d said Lessig, who helped develop the legal strategy for the case. \u201cAnd it will allow us to continue to make our case that the Framers did not wish to see super PACs. Just the opposite: they would have despised the kind of corruption we have seen recently, and the Constitution gives states the power to eliminate it.\u201d \u2026<br/>\u201cIt shows what we have known for many years,\u201d said Lessig. \u201cCitizens United did not create the super PAC; instead, unlimited donations have flown into independent groups because of incorrect interpretations by lower courts and state elections agencies.\u201d<br/>Equal Citizens chief counsel Jason Harrow said that Morse\u2019s ruling provides a pathway to the U.S. Supreme Court via appeals. That\u2019s an opportunity, Harrow said, that his group has been waiting for.<br/>\u201cThe judge\u2019s opinion said that \u2018immediate review\u2019 by the Alaska Supreme Court is appropriate in a case of this magnitude,\u201d said Harrow. \u201cWe look forward to taking the case there and, hopefully, to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d\u2026<br/>\u201cWe are confident we have a theory that the Constitution does not require the states to get out of the business of curbing unlimited donations to super PACs,\u201d said Harrow.<br/>North Jersey:\u00a0\u2018Dark money\u2019 is poisoning our democracy<br/>By\u00a0Editorial Board<br/>A recently signed \u201cdark money\u201d law in New Jersey would have forced the groups to file more detailed reports about donors two months after the election \u2013 but that law was put on hold by a judge in early October. Even that would not have allowed donors to be identified before January, which, of course, would have been no help to would-be voters\u2026<br/>Yet this growing dark money menace, and especially the groups\u2019 ability to keep major donors\u2019 names secret, is an obvious and willful threat to the democratic process.<br/>Indeed, as much as the nation has been transfixed over the last several months by questions concerning Russia\u2019s efforts to tamper with the 2016 presidential election, and what seems a constant threat by \u201cforeign actors\u201d to interfere with our democracy, the influence of dark money groups exerting influence in New Jersey represents a danger as well.<br/>Even as the courts seem to continue to send mixed and confusing messages about campaign funding in general, there is absolutely nothing to keep such groups from identifying donors. What do these groups have to hide, anyway?<br/>Allowing seeds of this sort of shadowy campaign influence to continue to take root and thrive in and outside the halls of our government puts our democratic institutions at risk and invites the worst possible impulses and outcomes from those we elect and trust to lead us.<br/>San Francisco Chronicle:\u00a0SF voters pass Prop. F, the \u2018Sunlight on Dark Money\u2019 measure<br/>By\u00a0Trisha Thadani<br/>Prop. F is targeted at independent political action committees, which can raise an unlimited amount of money from corporations, unions and individuals. Those committees can then donate to individual candidate committees, which makes it less obvious who is behind the donations.<br/>Campaign ads now will have to display the names and contribution totals of the top three donors giving $5,000 or more.

Today\u2019s win was an important step toward securing those rights,\u201d Rita Bettis Austen, Iowa\u2019s ACLU legal director, said Monday\u2026<br/>The new law is similar to 2012 legislation that\u00a0a federal judge\u00a0ruled in January\u00a0was unconstitutional.\u00a0The\u00a0state is appealing\u00a0that\u00a0decision.<br/>The legal challenges are moving through the courts separately\u2026<br/>In Monday\u2019s order granting the preliminary injunction,\u00a0James Gritzner, a senior judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, said \u201cthe deprivation of First Amendment rights is a serious harm, and plaintiffs have shown that their planned undercover investigations will not proceed due to the risk of prosecution.<br/>New York Times:\u00a0Prominent Political Donors Charged in Campaign Finance Scheme<br/>By\u00a0Daniel Victor<br/>An influential political power broker who was a witness named in the\u00a0Mueller\u00a0report was among eight people charged with conspiring to conceal the source of excessive contributions to groups supporting Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department announced on Tuesday.<br/>Prosecutors say George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman who was a cooperating witness in Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, conspired with Ahmad \u201cAndy\u201d Khawaja, the owner of an online payments company, to conceal more than $3.5 million in donations to the groups. The donations let Mr. Khawaja gain access to Mrs. Clinton during the campaign\u2026<br/>Prosecutors said Mr. Khawaja made the donations in the names of himself, his wife and his business, but that the money actually came from Mr. Nader. While arranging the payments, Mr. Nader reported to an official of an unspecified foreign government about his efforts to gain influence, according to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday.<br/>Mr. Khawaja, who\u00a0hosted a fund-raiser\u00a0in Los Angeles for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, was charged with conspiracy, making illegal contributions through someone else, causing excessive contributions, making false statements, causing false records to be filed, and obstruction of a federal grand jury investigation.<br/>New York Times:\u00a0Duncan Hunter\u2019s Guilty Plea: Answers to 5 Crucial Questions<br/>By\u00a0Ruth Marvin Webster\u00a0and\u00a0Patrick J. Lyons<br/>Representative Duncan D. Hunter, Republican of California, pleaded guilty in federal court on Tuesday to conspiracy to steal campaign funds. The guilty plea threatened to end what had once been seen as a promising career in conservative politics\u2026<br/>As he left the courthouse afterward, he told a crowd of reporters that he had \u201cmade mistakes,\u201d but he did not respond to questions\u2026<br/>Mr. Hunter is scheduled to be sentenced on March 17 and faces a maximum of five years in prison, though a lesser sentence is more likely\u2026<br/>In August 2018, a federal grand jury in San Diego\u00a0indicted Mr. Hunter\u00a0and his wife, Margaret Hunter. They were charged with converting more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses, and with filing false campaign finance records with the Federal Election Commission.<br/>The indictment\u00a0details scores of instances, beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2016, in which the Justice Department said the Hunters spent campaign money on themselves. The department said that the improper use of campaign funds continued despite \u201cnumerous warnings\u201d and \u201crepeated inquiries\u201d from Mr. Hunter\u2019s campaign treasurer about questionable purchases.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Vox:\u00a02020 Democrats weigh in on the biggest issue in tech<br/>By\u00a0Rani Molla\u00a0and\u00a0Emily Stewart<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">[Vox]: </emphasis>What\u2019s the most important tech-related issue that Americans are facing in the next four years?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bernie Sanders:\u00a0</emphasis>[I believe] the most important tech-related issue of today is the enormous concentration of economic and political power in the hands of a few massive, unaccountable technology firms.

At the end of the day, I just think that in a democracy, people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d<br/>At another point in the interview, Zuckerberg reiterated his opinion that Facebook shouldn\u2019t be in the business of fact-checking ads.<br/>\u201cWhat I believe is that in a democracy, it\u2019s really important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying, so they can make their own judgments,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, I don\u2019t think that a private company should be censoring politicians or news.\u201d\u2026<br/>The Facebook exec dodged King\u2019s questions about his recent meeting with President Donald Trump, who is an opponent of political ad monitoring.<br/>Epoch Times:\u00a0Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg Says Trump Didn\u2019t Lobby Him During Private Dinner<br/>By Henry Jom<br/>In a\u00a0recent interview\u00a0with CBS,\u00a0Facebook\u2019s CEO Mark\u00a0Zuckerberg\u00a0said that President\u00a0Trump\u00a0did not lobby him during a private dinner in October\u2026 <br/>Financial Times reporter Kadhim Shubber criticized CBS\u2019s question posed to Zuckerberg.<br/>\u201cNo better example of Facebook\u2019s power than Zuckerberg being asked here whether Trump lobbied him, rather than whether he lobbied Trump,\u201d Shubber wrote on Twitter.<br/>News of the private dinner\u2026received criticism from Sen.

Ilhan Omar Banned From Twitter for Rhetoric Trump Uses All the Time<br/>By Matt Novak<br/>Danielle Stella, a Republican who\u2019s trying to unseat Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, has been banned from Twitter. Stella\u2019s last tweet, while admittedly horrible, is pretty damn close to the kind of tweets that President Donald Trump sends on a daily basis. <br/>\u201cIf it is proven @IlhanMN passed sensitive info to Iran, she should be tried for #treason and hanged,\u201d Stella tweeted from her account\u00a0@2020MNCongress\u00a0last week\u2026<br/>Stella\u2019s other Twitter account,\u00a0@StarDanielle, has also\u00a0been suspended.<br/>Stella followed up on\u00a0Facebook, complaining that she said Omar should be tried in court first, and only be executed if she\u2019s guilty\u2026<br/>\u201cTreason is the only thing mentioned in the constitution for the death penalty, punishable by hanging or firing squad. I believe all involved should be thoroughly investigated. I did not threaten anyone,\u201d Stella wrote on Facebook\u2026<br/>Trump also regularly accuses Democratic politicians of \u201ctreason,\u201d something that is punishable by death\u2026<br/>But Trump has never been suspended from Twitter, based on a principle that political speech by politicians is inherently newsworthy\u2026<br/>\u201cWho\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump said at a fundraiser this past\u00a0September. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right?

Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) acknowledged in interviews that\u00a0editorials\u00a0they\u00a0published\u00a0separately about the single-payer health proposal included language provided by John MacDonald, a lobbyist and consultant in the state who disclosed in private emails that he worked for an unnamed client.<br/>Gross said MacDonald contacted her on behalf of the Partnership for America\u2019s Health Care Future, a multimillion-dollar industry group\u2026funded\u00a0by hospitals, private insurers, drug companies and other private health-care firms.<br/>Additionally, an aide to Ohio state Sen.

They can use it for moving expenses, pay campaign staff, purchase gifts of \u201cnominal\u201d value to those who aren\u2019t a member of their family, donate it to charity, move it to a state or local party committee, transfer it to a future campaign, or to a state/local candidate\u2026<br/>Candidates can also return funds to their donors, but that might be easier said than done.<br/>\u201cSometimes, they do [give it back],\u201d says Ann Ravel, former chair of the FEC. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the usual thing to do. But I have seen it. For me, that seems to be the appropriate way to go, though obviously, it might be a difficult computation problem.\u201d\u2026\u00a0<br/>Sometimes, candidates keep the money flowing from their campaigns, long after they\u2019ve stopped running for office. An investigation earlier this year from the\u00a0Tampa Bay Times\u00a0discovered some 50 campaigns that were still paying for goods and services, despite a candidate not running.<br/>These \u201cdormant\u201d campaigns, Ravel says, are a \u201creally big issue,\u201d pointing out the case of Hawaii\u00a0Rep.

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, issued a formal report on Sunday. The report recommended lowering caps on individual campaign contributions, increasing the support thresholds for minor political parties to appear on the ballot and multiplying political donations of up to $250 with public funds.<br/>Progressive groups that pushed for the public-matching system said the commission\u2019s framework was unworkable and are petitioning lawmakers to reject it. Minor parties have panned the new thresholds and are pursuing legal action to stop them from taking effect\u2026<br/>The recommendations will become law on Dec. 22 unless Mr. Cuomo and lawmakers agree to reject or modify them.<br/>Democrats, who control the state Senate, are scheduled to hold a retreat next week. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said in an interview last month that tweaks to the commission\u2019s work can also be made through separate legislation when lawmakers begin their new session next year.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WSKG</emphasis>:\u00a0Due To Missing Provision, Courts Could Sink New York\u2019s Public Campaign Finance Plan<br/>By\u00a0Karen DeWitt<br/>Earlier this week, the state\u2019s public campaign finance commission\u00a0issued a plan\u00a0to allow candidates for state offices to receive public matching grants for some campaign donations under $250.<br/>But advocates worry that the final report left out a key legal clause \u2013 and that could jettison the entire program if any one part of it is successfully challenged in court.<br/>It\u2019s called a severability clause, and it\u2019s often included\u00a0to protect a new law from court challenges.<br/>Chisun Lee, who is senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, said in layman\u2019s terms, it means that if one part of a new statute is successfully challenged and struck down in court, then the rest of the law still stands.<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s a standard, boilerplate piece of the legislation,\u201d she said.<br/>But Lee said even though the commission, in its final meeting on Nov. 25, voted to include the provision, she was surprised to see that it was left out of the final report.<br/>\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about that,\u201d Lee said.<br/>The commission\u2019s recommendations include a public matching fund program for the races for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller and Senate and Assembly seats, which Lee said is an \u201cenormous step forward.\u201d<br/>Los Angeles Times:\u00a0L.A. is planning to limit campaign money from developers. But first, more fundraising<br/>By\u00a0David Zahniser<br/>L.A.\u2019s elected leaders are on the brink of passing a law that would deprive them of one of their biggest sources of political money \u2013 real estate companies with projects pending at City Hall.<br/>Under the proposal, those companies and their executives would be prohibited from giving directly to the election campaigns of city candidates. But enforcement of those new restrictions could still take a while \u2013 more than two years\u2026<br/>Rob Quan, an organizer with the group Unrig L.A., said he believes council members slow-walked the new donation restrictions so they could continue collecting checks from real estate interests \u2013 and improve their odds of staying in office in 2022. As many as seven incumbents could seek re-election that year\u2026<br/>The proposed ordinance, scheduled for a vote Wednesday, comes little more than a year after FBI agents\u00a0raided\u00a0the home and offices of Councilman Jose Huizar, who for years ran the powerful council committee that greenlights large-scale real estate projects. It also comes as a developer in Harbor Gateway is facing bribery and campaign money-laundering\u00a0charges\u00a0tied to city approval of an apartment complex in 2015\u2026<br/>Council members first proposed a ban on developer donations in January 2017, when city leaders were trying to defeat a ballot measure that would have barred the approval of many large-scale development projects. After voters rejected the measure, the proposal languished. But it was revived in the wake of the FBI raids.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 12/4 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-83414</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNH-GN91-DY1R-B50F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 4, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjhGMjQyM0UzQTUwNDE1QUE0NUMwQTY1QjI2RTU0Qzc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTg4NzU0QUVDMEFGNEE2NzhCNzQyMDM5RjQ3NTRDMDM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Obstruction of Judicial Processes</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjMzNURDNDlFOEJENEI3MDlCMTVDRTQ2OEZGNDMxNTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTZDMUQ3Q0Y1OTMyNEVDNThFNDJGQzhBMEUyRDE2RTk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota all support mandatory public financing for federal elections, which would limit campaign spending and prohibit outside financial support-including self-funding. The idea would\u00a0likely require a constitutional amendment, as the Supreme Court has in two major decisions enshrined political spending as free speech\u2026<br/>Campaign finance experts across the ideological divide agree that restricting the amount of money a candidate can spend on his or her own race isn\u2019t permissible. The Supreme Court\u2019s 1976 decision in a case called Buckley v. Valeo held that it is unconstitutional to limit a candidate\u2019s spending of his or her own money in her own election. (The current public-financing system aligns with that ruling because it is optional.)</p><p><br/>Bradley Smith, a law professor and Republican former member of the Federal Election Commission, said that the Supreme Court had enshrined self-funding campaigns as \u201cvaluable speech activity.\u201d<br/>\u201cIt is the epitome of free speech, to spend your own money to promote your own values,\u201d he said. \u201cNot too much more to say about it.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Albuquerque Voters Say No to Subsidizing Political Candidates<br/>By Tiffany Donnelly<br/>On Election Day, Albuquerque residents registered their opinion on a\u00a0ballot initiative\u00a0that, if approved, would have forcibly used their tax dollars to finance local political campaigns. In a 51-49 vote, Bernalillo County voters\u00a0rejected\u00a0the measure.<br/>Deceptively named the \u201cDemocracy Dollars\u201d program, the initiative would have provided registered voters with $25 in taxpayer-funded vouchers to donate to eligible political candidates. Advocates claim the program would decrease the influence of wealthy donors, increase competition, and broaden political participation.<br/>In reality, the\u00a0tax-financing scheme\u00a0would do just the opposite.<br/>When Seattle passed its own \u201cDemocracy Voucher Program\u201d in 2015, proponents similarly insisted that the vouchers were the key to\u00a0reducing \u201cbig money\u201d in politics. But now, just two years after implementing the program, the Seattle City Council has been flooded by more political spending than ever before. Business and labor PACs\u00a0raised more money\u00a0for the 2019 council elections than was spent by independent committees in all previous council races combined, since at least 1995. Advocates said the possibility of receiving a large number of small donations would incentivize candidates\u00a0to focus on ordinary people instead of the wealthy. But in fact, in 2017,\u00a0only 3.4%\u00a0of the issued vouchers were used, while total campaign spending increased by 60%. Hardly the deluge supporters expected.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>The Fulcrum:\u00a0Regulation of online political ads violates the First Amendment, federal appeals court rules<br/>By Sara Swann<br/>A Maryland law intended to prevent foreign election interference by regulating online political advertising has been struck down by a federal appeals court.<br/>At a time when controlling the surge of misleading campaign spots on social media and news sites has proved easier said than done, Maryland was the first state to expand disclosure mandates. Its General Assembly enacted a law in time for the closing months of the 2018 midterm campaign requiring such platforms to publish information about ad purchases and keep records for the state to review.<br/>But a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals says the law unconstitutionally singles out political expression for special scrutiny and promises a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on free speech. The unanimous ruling on Friday, upholding a federal trial judge\u2019s position, is the latest in a series of federal judicial decisions against efforts to regulate campaign financing\u2026<br/>Online platforms were also ordered to keep detailed records about the content of the ads for inspection by the Board of Elections. The records had to include the candidate or ballot issue the ad referred to, whether the ad was supportive or opposing, a description of the geographic locations where the ad was disseminated and a description of the audience that received or was targeted\u2026<br/>The court cited Google\u2019s decision to stop hosting political ads in Maryland last year as one example of the law\u2019s \u201cchilling effect.\u201d Several other publishers promised to do the same if the law was upheld.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOJ</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0What Horowitz Actually Debunked<br/>By Daniel Henninger<br/>Whatever the Horowitz review of four FBI Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and its Crossfire Hurricane investigation did or did not \u201cdebunk,\u201d the report is mind-boggling, shocking and damning. It is page after page-indeed, paragraph after paragraph-detailing gross errors of judgment and violations of FBI investigation protocols\u2026<br/>From reading this report, it is clear that what has had the attorney general in a seething white heat has little to do with defending Donald J. Trump and a lot to do with protecting John Q. Public.<br/>The abuses identified in the Horowitz report-by the Crossfire Hurricane team and others at FBI headquarters-are a potential threat to the civil liberties of any American who becomes a target. In a better world than we\u2019ve got now, the press-or some of it-would step back from the Trump-Barr obsessions and revisit its historic role of protecting individual freedoms from such raw, unaccountable government power. The Horowitz report contains at least 19 references to the status quo\u2019s threat to \u201cconstitutionally protected activity,\u201d notably the \u201cFirst Amendment.\u201d<br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0William Barr on Why He Disagrees With the IG Report\u2019s Conclusions<br/>By Gerard Baker<br/>BAKER:\u00a0The report does make clear there were concerns about that and discussions at very high levels within the FBI as to the sensitive information-<br/>MR. BARR:\u00a0What is the basis you have for looking into something? And what are reasonable steps to take, taking into consideration the weight of the evidence that\u2019s prompting you to do that, the alternatives available, and exactly what you were trying to accomplish, and also the sensitivity of the area involved here, a political campaign-core First Amendment activity.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Amendment</emphasis><br/>The Guardian:\u00a0Fox host lambasts Trump over \u2018most sustained assault on press freedom in US history\u2019<br/>By David Smith<br/>A leading host on Fox News, a conservative network notorious for its loyalty to the White House, has lambasted\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0for mounting the most direct attack on press freedom in American history.<br/>Chris Wallace,\u00a0widely admired for breaking ranks from Fox colleagues by putting tough questions to administration officials, delivered his most stinging critique yet of the US president at an event celebrating the first amendment.<br/>\u201cI believe that President Trump is engaged in the most direct sustained assault on freedom of the press in our history,\u201d Wallace said to applause at\u00a0the Newseum,\u00a0a media museum in Washington, on Wednesday night.<br/>\u201cHe has done everything he can to undercut the media, to try and delegitimise us, and I think his purpose is clear: to raise doubts when we report critically about him and his administration that we can be trusted. Back in 2017,\u00a0he tweeted something\u00a0that said far more about him than it did about us: \u2018The fake news media is not my enemy. It is the enemy of the American people.'\u201d\u2026<br/>The veteran broadcaster added:\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the president\u2019s attacks have done some damage.\u00a0A Freedom Forum Institute\u00a0poll, associated here with the Newseum, this year found that 29% of Americans, almost a third of all of us, think the first amendment goes too far. And 77%, three quarters, say that fake news is a serious threat to our democracy.\u201d<br/>FIRE:\u00a0UPDATED: FIRE statement regarding executive order on campus anti-Semitism<br/>By FIRE<br/>UPDATE, 12/11/19: The text of the executive order is now\u00a0publicly available. The order directs federal agencies charged with enforcing Title VI to \u201cconsider\u201d the\u00a0IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and its accompanying examples, both of which may apply to core political speech protected by the First Amendment. While the order is couched in language intended to paper over the readily evident threat to expressive rights, its ambiguous directive and fundamental reliance on the IHRA definition and its examples will cause institutions to investigate and censor\u00a0protected\u00a0speech on their campuses. Having spent 20 years defending\u00a0speakers\u00a0from across the political spectrum, FIRE knows all too well that colleges and universities will rush to punish student and faculty speakers in an attempt to avoid federal investigation and enforcement.<br/>\u2013<br/>According to news\u00a0reports, President Trump will sign an Executive Order directing the Departments of Education and Justice to employ a\u00a0specific definition and examples of anti-Semitism\u00a0in evaluating institutional responses to alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. If true, the Executive Order would threaten freedom of expression on campus.<br/>AdExchanger:\u00a05 Questions For Political Ad Disclosure Advocates<br/>By Jordan Lieberman<br/>What does expenditure disclosure mean?<br/>Nearly all political professionals agree that disclosure with digital advertising is a good idea. What that means is open to wide interpretation.<br/>Should disclosure imply a \u201cPaid for\u201d disclaimer, which puts campaigns on par with direct mail? Should it refer to the publishing of client data in a searchable database, which meets and exceeds what the FEC requires for federal campaigns? Going further, should vendors be required to expose their entire tech stack or even markup by listing every sub-vendor? The most extreme example is Washington state, whose\u00a0policy\u00a0requiring commercial advertisers to disclose details such as who paid for political ads and the cost went so far that the largest platforms\u00a0pulled out of the state.<br/>Regardless of the outcome, there needs to be far more education before enforcement. During the last campaign cycle, an election law enforcement official from a midwestern state mistakenly asked to see our FCC disclosures for digital ads. It was surprising because we don\u2019t file digital ads with the FCC, but the election official didn\u2019t understand that. Of all the people who should understand the rules governing political digital ads, he should be near the top.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citizens United</emphasis><br/>Brennan Center:\u00a0How Citizens United Reshaped Elections<br/>By Tim Lau<br/>While wealthy donors, corporations, and special interest groups have long had an outsized influence in U.S. elections, that sway has dramatically expanded since the\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0decision, with negative repercussions for American democracy and the fight against political corruption\u2026<br/>A 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court sided with Citizens United, ruling that corporations and other outside groups can spend unlimited money on elections.<br/>In the court\u2019s opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that limiting \u201cindependent political spending\u201d from corporations and other groups violates the First Amendment right to free speech. The justices who voted with the majority assumed that independent spending cannot be corrupt and that the spending would be transparent, but both assumptions have proven\u00a0to be incorrect.<br/>With its decision, the Supreme Court overturned election spending restrictions that date back\u00a0more than 100 years. Previously, the court had upheld certain spending restrictions, arguing that the government had\u00a0a role in preventing corruption. But in\u00a0Citizens United, a bare majority of the justices held that \u201cindependent political spending\u201d did not present a substantive threat of corruption, provided it was not coordinated with a candidate\u2019s campaign.<br/>As a result, corporations can now\u00a0spend unlimited funds\u00a0on campaign advertising if they are not formally \u201ccoordinating\u201d with a candidate or political party.\u00a0<br/>Newsweek:\u00a0Is the Anti-Democratic Decade Finally Drawing to a Close?<br/>By\u00a0Robert Reich<br/>We\u2019re coming to the end of what might be called the anti-democracy decade. It began January 21, 2010, with the Supreme Court\u2019s shameful decision in\u00a0Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission\u00a0opening the floodgates to big money in politics with the absurd claim that the First Amendment protects corporate speech.<br/>It ends with Donald Trump in the White House, filling his administration with corporate shills and inviting foreign powers to interfere in American elections.<br/>Trump is the consequence, rather than the cause, of the anti-democratic surge. By the 2016 election, the richest 100th of 1 percent of Americans-24,949 very wealthy people-accounted for a record-breaking 40 percent of all campaign contributions. That same year, corporations flooded the presidential, Senate and House elections with $3.4 billion of donations. Labor unions no longer provided any countervailing power, contributing only $213 million.<br/>Big corporations and the super-wealthy lavished their donations on the Republican Party because Republicans promised them a giant tax cut if they won. As Lindsey Graham warned his Republican colleagues \u201cfinancial contributions will stop\u201d if the GOP didn\u2019t come through.<br/>The anti-democracy decade has been hard on American workers\u2026<br/>Even if\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0isn\u2019t reversed by the Supreme Court or defanged by constitutional amendment, a principled Congress and decent president could still rescue our democracy.<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Capitalism is broken. It\u2019s time for something new.<br/>By Katrina vanden Heuvel<br/>[C]apitalism is undermining democracy. In the\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0era, the amount of money in politics has exploded, resulting in elected officials from both parties who are more beholden to wealthy donors \u2013 and their business interests \u2013 than ever before.\u00a0Corporate concentration\u00a0is reducing competition and rendering both workers and consumers increasingly powerless against rising plutocracy. And this is happening as the forces of private equity and big tech conspire to annihilate the local and independent journalism that is vital to maintaining a democratic society.<br/>It doesn\u2019t take a socialist to see capitalism\u2019s corrosive impact on democracy. In fact, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a former McKinsey consultant who was forced on\u00a0Monday to finally agree to disclose\u00a0his campaign bundlers,used to recognize it earlier in the campaign,\u00a0saying, \u201cThere\u2019s tension between capitalism and democracy, and negotiating that tension is probably the biggest challenge for America right now.\u201d\u2026<br/>[C]apitalism is destroying nature. As corporate lobbyists work to dismantle the regulatory apparatus, the companies they represent are irrevocably harming our environment, our health and our collective future\u2026<br/>American politics is finally having a long-overdue debate about how to respond to these trends. Many of the ideas being discussed in the presidential race are undoubtedly part of the solution.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Conservatives hit Colorado\u2019s Hickenlooper with FEC complaint<br/>By\u00a0Nicholas Riccardi, Associated Press<br/>A conservative watchdog group filed a complaint Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Democratic Senate candidate John Hickenlooper improperly used footage from ads shot for his 2014 reelection campaign as Colorado governor in a video in August.<br/>The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust alleges that the use of the prior footage amounts to a donation from Hickenlooper\u2019s gubernatorial campaign to his new Senate bid that was never reported to the FEC. The brief clips of Hickenlooper in a factory and talking to patrons of a brewpub he founded are publicly available on the website of Hickenlooper\u2019s media strategist. But the complaint alleges that they are still copyrighted and therefore an \u201casset\u201d whose transfer should have been reported.<br/>The complaint is the second one filed against Hickenlooper as the former governor explored running for federal office. Last year, as he was gearing up for a presidential bid, a Republican group filed a complaint with the Colorado Ethics Commission over Hickenlooper\u2019s use of private planes as governor. FACT was once run by Matthew Whitaker, who briefly served as U.S. attorney general in the Trump administration, though the group says it has filed complaints against both Democrats and Republicans.<br/>[Hickenlooper\u2019s] campaign on Wednesday said that it followed normal, legal practice in using the footage and that the complaint is groundless.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fundraising</emphasis><br/>OpenSecrets News:\u00a0Corporate PAC cash takes a winding route to Democratic Senate challengers rejecting it<br/>By\u00a0Karl Evers-Hillstrom<br/>Democrats\u2019 narrow path to taking the Senate in 2020 goes through a handful of well-funded challengers, most of whom are banking on a pledge that worked wonders for the party during the 2018 midterms.\u00a0<br/>The top Democratic challengers want voters and donors alike to know they are rejecting corporate PACs\u2026<br/>For non-incumbents, the pledge to reject corporate PACs is a\u00a0largely symbolic gesture\u00a0to indicate a candidate wants to get big money out of politics. The pledge doesn\u2019t become a sacrifice until they\u2019re elected to Congress, as corporate PACs\u00a0give almost all of their money to incumbents\u00a0to curry favor with lawmakers\u2026<br/>After getting thwacked by those\u00a0no-PAC Democrats\u00a0last year, Republicans intend to portray Democratic Senate hopefuls as hypocritical and dishonest with voters on the subject of corporate PACs in 2020\u2026<br/>Top Democrats, like Republicans, fund their leadership PACs partly from PACs representing powerful corporations. One-third of money going to Democratic leadership PACs comes from\u00a0business PACs\u00a0associated with corporations, trade associations and other business interests\u2026<br/>Business PACs give upwards of 90 percent of their money to incumbents, so these Democratic challengers aren\u2019t losing much of anything by rejecting their checks. Still, their incumbent opponents certainly have an advantage\u2026<br/>And many of the House candidates who rejected corporate PACs in 2018 are now incumbents, meaning they are passing up hundreds of thousands of dollars to stick by their pledge. Many of them are\u00a0top recipients of leadership PAC money.<br/>The Hill:\u00a0Democrats spend big to put Senate in play<br/>By Reid Wilson<br/>For years, Democrats have complained that Republicans have benefitted from outside groups that are not legally required to disclose their donors, so-called dark money organizations that grew out of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Citizens United v. FEC case.<br/>But now it is Democrats who are using those same laws to funnel money through innocuously named groups that do not have to disclose the identities of their donors.\u00a0<br/>Virtually all the money spent on television advertising so far this year has come from dark money groups\u2026<br/>Those groups are spending early in hopes of framing the races that will develop over the course of the next year\u2026<br/>Running early advertising \u201cis a good strategy and, budget allowing, necessary in the current volatile environment, whether it is for an incumbent, challenger or open race,\u201d said Craig Varoga, a longtime Democratic strategist\u2026<br/>\u201cEarly spending has an effect, no question. They begin framing the narrative before some of our guys can afford to communicate,\u201d said Mike Slanker, a Nevada Republican strategist who guided former Sen.\u00a0Dean Heller\u2018s (R) campaign as Heller weathered a barrage of attacks for more than a year before Election Day 2018. \u201cSince it is harder to reach folks these days with the number of cord cutters increasing, it takes longer to get messages through than it used to. You have to start earlier.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms </emphasis><br/>Vox (Recode):\u00a0Facebook\u2019s political ad problem, explained by an expert<br/>By Peter Kafka<br/>For years, political advertisers ignored Facebook (along with most of the internet) but that\u2019s not the case anymore:\u00a0Digital political ad spending may approach $3 billion in 2020\u00a0\u2013 about a third of the money politicians and their campaigns will spend in 2020\u2026<br/>As Facebook defends its ad policy,\u00a0Twitter has announced that it will ban all political ads, and\u00a0Google has announced that it will limit targeting for its political ads. Facebook seems very unlikely to ban political ads altogether, but it has signaled that it may make other changes that might make its advertising machine less effective, in some ways, when it comes to politics.<br/>If all of this sounds confusing to you, you\u2019re not alone. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve asked former Facebook executive Alex Stamos to help out.<br/>Stamos spent three years as Facebook\u2019s chief security officer, helping the company fend off all kinds of attacks.<br/>But after leaving Facebook in 2018, Stamos has become a sort of Facebook attacker, offering a steady stream of criticism of the company and its leadership \u2013 for instance,\u00a0he would like CEO Mark Zuckerberg to step down.<br/>Stamos has also been a loud and consistent voice calling on Facebook, and other digital advertising companies, to make a very specific reform: He wants them to place limits on the microtargeting, or hypertargeting, they offer political ad buyers.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>The Week:\u00a0Bloomberg and Steyer are showing money doesn\u2019t matter much in politics<br/>By Bonnie Kristian<br/>To date,\u00a0FiveThirtyEight\u00a0estimates\u00a0Steyer has dropped around $46 million on TV ads. And yet, per the\u00a0RealClearPolitics\u00a0average, he is polling at all of 1.7 percent.<br/>With numbers like that, does campaign cash matter anymore?<br/>Conventional wisdom, especially in the post-Citizens United\u00a0era, holds that access such a massive war chest is access to victory \u2013 that money is a corrupting force in politics which allows corporations and rich individuals to buy power in a way the poor and middle class struggle to replicate, even with collective action\u2026<br/>This conventional wisdom isn\u2019t entirely wrong. It would require a bizarre and willful naivete to pretend money has no effect in politics, that Americans are universally diligent voters who make sure they give each candidate an equally fair shake. If you\u2019re running a remotely viable, national campaign for president, you\u00a0do\u00a0need millions of dollars. Note that in all of the\u00a0last 10 presidential elections, the candidate who spent more in the general won \u2013 except, that is, for President Trump, who was substantially outspent by Clinton in 2016 and also received less support from single-candidate super PACs\u2026<br/>Another, bigger lesson is that money doesn\u2019t function in\u00a0presidential politics\u00a0(smaller races\u00a0can work very differently) as it did in the past\u2026You cannot buy your way to the top five in a crowded primary field. Even name recognition and basic biographical awareness is increasingly difficult to purchase if voters simply are not interested in you and your message, while candidates who generate legitimate grassroots enthusiasm can attract a large following on a relatively small budget.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Tennessean:\u00a0Appeals court tosses Tennessee laws that created a donation blackout for nonpartisan PACs<br/>By Adam Tamburin<br/>Tennessee laws barring nonpartisan political action committees\u00a0from donating to candidates within 10 days of an election violate the state constitution and cannot stand, an appeals court found Thursday.<br/>The ruling from the Tennessee Court of Appeals reinforces\u00a0an earlier judgement from Nashville Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle, and will end the donation restrictions facing nonpartisan PACs.<br/>State campaign finance laws had created a 10-day blackout period when those PACs couldn\u2019t give to a candidate. But PACs controlled by a political party still could.<br/>The group Tennesseans for Sensible Election Laws argued that the law created a double-standard that unfairly penalized nonpartisan groups while giving political parties a leg up.<br/>The Court of Appeals agreed with that argument, ruling against the state.<br/>Attorney Daniel Horwitz, who\u00a0represented\u00a0Tennesseans for Sensible Election Laws alongside attorney Jamie Hollin, cheered the decision.<br/>\u201cPolitical parties cannot lawfully censor non-partisan speakers while reserving special treatment in the political process for themselves,\u201d Horwitz wrote in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cTennesseans for Sensible Election Laws is proud of this historic First Amendment victory, which makes Tennessee\u2019s democratic process just a little bit freer for everyone.\u201d<br/>City &amp;State;:\u00a0Is the state Legislature delegating, or derelict?<br/>By Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff<br/>The legal issue is clear: Did the Legislature\u2019s delegation of power to the commission violate the state constitution?\u00a0<br/>Opponents of the commission\u00a0argue\u00a0that Article III of the state constitution vests the power to make laws in the state Legislature alone. Acknowledging that the Legislature routinely delegates to administrative agencies authority to adopt rules \u201cfilling in the details\u201d necessary to implement public policy, they assert that such delegation is permissible only when limited in scope and that agency rules must be consistent with public policy as established by the Legislature via a duly enacted statute. Similar, or higher, standards should apply to delegations of legislative power to independent bodies that are not administrative agencies with rulemaking authority. In sum, the opponents contend that the Legislature impermissibly granted the commission authority to make, rather than implement, legislative public policy.<br/>The commission\u2019s defenders\u00a0counter\u00a0that the delegation was both constitutional and consistent with longstanding practice. They argue that the commission\u2019s enabling statute reflected the Legislature\u2019s affirmative policy decision to establish a public financing program and contained appropriate criteria to guide and limit the commission\u2019s discretion in executing that policy. The defenders also note, with evident relief, that the state\u2019s highest court recently declined to review a lower court\u2019s decision that upheld the Legislature\u2019s creation of an independent salary commission endowed with arguably similar authority.<br/>Seattle Times:\u00a0Spending on Seattle elections doubled, led by Amazon. Now council member wants to \u2018get big money out of politics\u2019<br/>By Daniel Beekman<br/>Massive contributions to unrestricted political committees drove spending on Seattle City Council candidates to more than double this year compared with the\u00a0council\u2019s\u00a0last major round of elections.<br/>Councilmember M. Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez noted the spike Wednesday as the committee she chairs began considering\u00a0her nationally watched proposal\u00a0to limit contributions to independent political-action committees (PACs).<br/>Such PACs today can raise and spend as much as they want, as long as they don\u2019t coordinate with candidates, and they spent $4 million\u00a0for and against the Nov. 5 general-election candidates\u00a0in Seattle\u2019s seven council races,\u00a0according to Dec. 3 data presented by council staff.<br/>That\u2019s six times more than such PACs spent on Seattle\u2019s general-election candidates in 2015, when all nine of the council\u2019s seats were up for grabs\u2026<br/>Spending by independent PACs accounted for about 55% of the total this year, up from 20% in 2015.<br/>Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s legislation\u00a0would, among other provisions, cap contributions to most independent PACs to $5,000. Dubbed the \u201cClean Campaigns Act\u201d by the council member, the legislation would make\u00a0an exception\u00a0for groups using money from many small donors to make large PAC contributions\u2026<br/>The proposal is backed by reformers who hope to see such a law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2026They want to challenge the idea that the 2010 Citizens United case, which greatly expanded spending by PACs, also prohibits limits on donations to those PACs.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>The post Daily Media Links 12/13 appeared first on Institute For Free

The president has denied the relationships.</p><p><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Where\u2019s the Liberal Outrage?<br/>By Daniel Henninger<br/>On Tuesday, in one of the most astounding public documents in years, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in Washington announced that its relationship with the FBI is broken.\u00a0<br/>The simple, direct title of the court order is\u00a0In Re Accuracy Concerns Regarding FBI Matters Submitted to the FISC.\u00a0What follows is the obliteration, by a federal court, of the FBI\u2019s reputation. The order ends with a demand that the government submit in detail what it plans to do to restore that reputation\u2026<br/>The Horowitz report described in detail the flaws and even malfeasance in the FBI\u2019s four warrant applications to the FISA court, from 2016 through mid-2017, to conduct electronic surveillance of-in the court\u2019s pointed words this week-\u201ca U.S. citizen named Carter W. Page.\u201d<br/>The court continues, \u201cIn order to appreciate the seriousness of that misconduct,\u201d it is necessary to review the FBI\u2019s legal obligations under [FISA].<br/>The law provides that an application for a warrant requires \u201cprobable cause.\u201d The agent filing it \u201cswears to the facts in the application,\u201d which \u201ccannot be solely based on activities protected by the First Amendment.\u201d A primary purpose of these rules is \u201cto protect the fourth amendment rights of U.S. persons.\u201d And because \u201cthe government does not face an adverse party\u201d-the target isn\u2019t represented in court-the government \u201chas a heightened duty of candor.\u201d\u2026<br/>The order, signed by Presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer, gives the government until Jan. 10 to provide a \u201csworn written submission\u201d of what it intends to do to ensure the accuracy of future FBI applications to the court. It demands \u201can explanation of why, in the government\u2019s view, the information in FBI applications submitted in the interim should be regarded as reliable.\u201d<br/>The Advocate:\u00a0BRPD officer injured in Alton Sterling protest can pursue negligence claim against organizer<br/>By Joe Gyan Jr.<br/>A Black Lives Matter organizer cannot be held liable for the conduct of an unidentified person who seriously injured a Baton Rouge officer during a protest after the 2016 killing of Alton Sterling, but the officer\u2019s negligence claim against the organizer can go forward, a divided federal appeals court said late Monday in its third ruling in the case this year.<br/>Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Don Willett, the dissenting member of the three-judge panel, said he originally agreed with denying DeRay Mckesson\u2019s First Amendment defense but has since had a \u201cjudicial change of heart.\u201d<br/>Willett took issue Monday with some of the reasoning of his colleagues.<br/>\u201cSuch an exotic theory would have enfeebled America\u2019s street-blocking civil rights movement, imposing ruinous financial liability against citizens for exercising core First Amendment freedoms,\u201d Willett wrote in a partial dissent.<br/>Reason (The Volokh Conspiracy):\u00a0Negligence Claims Brought Against Protest Organizers: More on the Tort Law Side of Doe v. Mckesson<br/>By\u00a0Eugene Volokh<br/>In\u00a0an earlier post, I suggested that the lawsuit in\u00a0Doe v. Mckesson\u00a0should lead to a victory for Mckesson-but on a legal theory (the professional rescuer\u2019s doctrine, which sharply limits negligence claims brought by police officers) that hadn\u2019t been raised in the case, though it still might be in later phases. The opinion, though, raises an interesting and complicated question that can\u2019t always be dealt through that doctrine. Let me talk about this, in the context of a hypothetical.<br/>Say that John Smith organizes an illegal protest in an abortion clinic\u2019s parking lot-illegal because it\u2019s a trespass (analogously to how Mckesson\u2019s protest was, according to the Fifth Circuit, plausibly pleaded to be an illegal blocking of a public street). Unsurprisingly, and thus foreseeably, some clinic employees come out to try to get the protesters to leave, and even use lawful defensive force (pushing) to eject the protesters. Unsurprisingly, and thus equally foreseeably, one of the protesters (Mary Baker) punches the employee who is pushing him. (Indeed, perhaps this has happened before at this group\u2019s protests, so it is indeed foreseeable.)<br/>Would Smith be liable under normal tort law negligence principles for the injury to the employee? Yes, I think so. By organizing the protest, he caused a foreseeable risk that an employee will be injured. And because the protest involved trespass, it\u2019s pretty likely that this would be viewed as unreasonable conduct.<br/>Reason (The Volokh Conspiracy):\u00a0When Does First Amendment Preempt Negligence Liability?<br/>By\u00a0Eugene Volokh<br/>I blogged yesterday about the tort law questions raised by\u00a0Doe v. Mckesson. As I understand it, DeRay Mckesson has a total defense to the lawsuit against him, simply because it was brought by a police officer and the\u00a0Professional Rescuer\u2019s Doctrine\u00a0thus applies-it\u2019s just that Mckesson\u2019s lawyers haven\u2019t yet raised that argument. But if the lawsuit weren\u2019t brought by a police officer, then there would have been a solid case for allowing the case to go forward on a\u00a0negligence theory\u2026<br/>But should First Amendment limit negligence law here, as it has limited the torts of libel, intentional interference with business relations, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and the like? That turns out to be a complicated question, which the Supreme Court hasn\u2019t addressed, and which lower courts have occasionally touched on but haven\u2019t fully resolved. Let me offer some tentative thoughts (the embryo of a law review article I\u2019m planning).<br/>[A.] Negligence claims sometimes must be sharply constrained by the First Amendment.\u00a0Say, for instance, an author with a huge readership harshly condemns some group (capitalists, Communists, Jews, blacks, whites, police officers, abortion providers, etc.), in a way that foreseeably leads some listeners to attack members of that group, or perhaps vandalize their property.<br/>Under standard negligence principles, one can imagine an injured party suing the speaker for that: The speaker\u2019s speech has foreseeably caused a harm. That the harm came through the voluntary act of a third party doesn\u2019t block liability, so long as that act was foreseeable (see\u00a0my earlier post). Therefore, tort law might suggest, a jury should decide whether the speaker was acting unreasonably in giving his speech.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Amendment</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0The University\u2019s New Loyalty Oath<br/>By Abigail Thompson<br/>Seventy years ago the University of California introduced a loyalty oath, requiring employees to swear they were \u201cnot a member of the Communist Party.\u201d After a contentious period in which 31 faculty were fired for refusing to sign, the requirement was reconsidered. An eventual consequence was the current Standing Order of the Regents 101.1(d): \u201cNo political test shall ever be considered in the appointment and promotion of any faculty member or employee.\u201d\u2026<br/>Now the university appears to be abandoning this principle. In the past few years \u201cDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d statements, in which applicants for faculty positions profess their commitment to these social goals, have become required on eight UC campuses and at colleges across the country\u2026<br/>This spring the university issued guidelines instructing each campus to develop and use a scoring system, called a \u201crubric,\u201d for applicants\u2019 diversity statements. No longer will faculty hiring committees use their own judgment about how best to create a diverse and inclusive environment in their fields.<br/>Instead, each candidate\u2019s commitment to diversity will be assigned points. To score well, candidates must subscribe to a particular political ideology, one based on treating people not as unique individuals but as representatives of their gender and ethnic identities\u2026<br/>Rather than helping achieve inclusion, these DEI rubrics act as a filter for those with nonconforming views.<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Trump has made it nearly impossible to formulate a policy against disinformation<br/>By\u00a0Editorial Board<br/>The lies and propaganda that ran amok on the Internet during the last election cycle still appear to be sprinting: Misleading political posts have already topped\u00a0158 million views\u00a0this year. The New York Times\u00a0reports\u00a0that few, if any, 2020 candidates have employed teams devoted to rooting out this malicious content. The reality is a little more complicated\u2026<br/>The problem is that tracking disinformation has become one of those essentials, with foreign enemies following in Russia\u2019s meddling fingerprints, and domestic actors who refuse to respect free and fair elections close behind. That puts campaigns in a tough spot. It\u2019s also discouraging to mount a truth offensive when companies refuse to fact-check even the political advertisements they accept money to promote: Former vice president Joe Biden did report an ad relying on a conspiracy theory, after all, and\u00a0Facebook didn\u2019t help\u2026<br/>The [Democratic National\u00a0Committee] is helping by providing campaigns with trainings, disinformation detection tools and points of contact at social media companies\u2026<br/>President Trump has made it\u00a0nigh impossible\u00a0for the government to formulate a comprehensive policy\u2026Campaigns, committees and companies now must figure out for themselves how best to safeguard democracy.<br/>Daily Caller:\u00a0Former FEC Chair Who Sought To Regulate Drudge: Big Tech Should Approve Political Ads<br/>By Rudy Takala<br/>The former federal official who sought to regulate online media outlets would like Facebook, Google and Twitter to start fact-checking political content on their platforms ahead of the 2020 election, suggesting that while Facebook has taken some measures to that effect, the public is \u201coutraged\u201d over the failure to do more.<br/>\u201cAmidst the outrage, Facebook is considering changing how political ads are targeted and labeled,\u201d former FEC Chair Ann Ravel wrote in a Dec. 18\u00a0op-ed\u00a0for CNN. \u201cBut as long as it stands by its no fact-checking policy \u2013 which it so far has done \u2013 Facebook has given tacit approval to those running for office to say anything they like, while not granting the same privilege as others.\u201d<br/>Facebook has said that while it will not fact-check ads from political candidates, it will fact-check ads from other groups. Ravel similarly criticized Google and Twitter\u2026<br/>As a member of the FEC from 2013-17, Ravel fought to enact rules that would have regulated unpaid political content online, a move that Republicans viewed as a backdoor effort to regulate conservative media such as the Drudge Report. The effort extended to deadlocked votes over\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0YouTube.<br/>Los Angeles Times:\u00a0Facebook to tackle efforts to interfere with 2020 U.S. census<br/>By Associated Press<br/>Facebook Inc. plans to clamp down on attempts to use its services to interfere with the 2020 U.S. census, including the posting of misleading information about when and how to participate, who can participate and what happens when people do\u2026<br/>Facebook said Thursday that it will prohibit advertisements that portray taking part in the census as \u201cuseless or meaningless\u201d or that encourage people not to participate. The company also said it will try to identify and remove misleading census posts before people see them. But it will also remove any posts it misses after the fact, using both technology and humans to spot violations. The company said it will begin enforcing the census policy in January\u2026<br/>False and inaccurate information is\u00a0already circulating online\u00a0about the census. For example, posts in neighborhood chat groups warned that robbers were scamming their way into people\u2019s homes by asking to check residents\u2019 identification for the census. That was a hoax, but it left Census Bureau officials scrambling to get the posts removed from Facebook.<br/>The Hill:\u00a0Facebook to ban misleading census content<br/>By\u00a0Maggie Miller, Emily Birnbaum and Chris Mills Rodrigo<br/>Advertisements that \u201cportray census participation as useless or meaningless or advise people not to participate in the census\u201d will also be barred starting next month under the new policy, even if they come from political figures, which are normally exempt from fact-checking\u2026<br/>The social media giant\u2019s new policy comes after discussions with civil rights groups who have\u00a0raised concerns\u00a0that content Facebook allows on the platform could hurt vulnerable communities.<br/>Some of the those groups praised the company\u2019s announcement, calling it the \u201cmost comprehensive policy to date to combat census interference efforts on its platform.\u201d\u00a0<br/>\u201cThe Leadership Conference and other civil rights groups have long raised serious concerns about this issue, and it appears that Facebook has finally listened,\u201d Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition representing more than 200 national organizations, said in a statement\u2026<br/>Read more on Facebook\u2019s announcement here.<br/>Morning Consult:\u00a0Could Influencers Help Campaigns Sidestep Social Media Crackdown on Political Ads?<br/>By Sam Sabin<br/>[T]here\u2019s at least one advertising tool that marketing experts say campaigns can use to combat new industry rules: social media influencers\u2026\u00a0\u00a0<br/>A Twitter spokesperson confirmed that while political advertising is banned, political influencer marketing is still allowed on the platform, so long as no paid promotion is attached to it. And a Google spokesperson said the platform approaches influencer marketing on YouTube in the same way it does editorial content, and all creators are asked to check a box if their videos include any paid product placements or endorsements.<br/>Although campaigns on Google can still target audiences in other ways, Simpson, who previously led creative at Las Vegas-based influencer marketing agency Influential, said the company\u2019s micro-targeting ban could mean partnerships with YouTube influencers will become more valuable to campaigns as an alternative.\u00a0<br/>The crackdown on political ads comes at a time when industry experts say influencer marketing was already starting to attract more attention from political campaigns looking to target younger voters. For example, NextGen America, the progressive political action committee founded by Tom Steyer to mobilize young voters, was already planning before the digital ad policy changes to work with 3,000 micro-influencers, primarily on Instagram, in 2020.\u00a0<br/>Vox (Recode):\u00a0The 14 charts that explain tech in 2019<br/>By Rani Molla<br/>All eyes are on digital platforms for 2020<br/>Ahead of a presidential election year, all eyes are on technology and social media platforms, whose effects on the 2016 election still are not fully understood. Digital political ad spending is expected to\u00a0hit about $3 billion next year\u00a0or about one-third of overall campaign ad spending. Some tech platforms have\u00a0sought to mitigate election interference and misinformation\u00a0through an outright ban on political ads (Twitter) or by limiting candidates\u2019 ability to\u00a0microtarget\u00a0voters (Google). Facebook, however, the\u00a0largest platform for digital campaign ad spending, has failed to make significant changes.\u00a0Facebook has even stood by its controversial stance of not touching political ads, even if they contain lies. It remains to be seen how these choices will affect\u00a0the next election.<br/>The Guardian:\u00a0The dark side of tech: why the Guardian asks tough questions about Silicon Valley<br/>By Julia Carrie Wong<br/>Over the past week alone, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has run more than 16,000 different advertisements on Facebook. And that\u2019s just one week, just one candidate, and just Facebook! At any given moment, the Trump campaign will have between 1,000 and 5,000 different ads running simultaneously. If you want to take a peek, head to this\u00a0link\u00a0and start scrolling. Chances are you\u2019ll give up \u2013 or the page will freeze \u2013 before you get to the bottom.<br/>Many of these ads are minor variations on a single theme, targeted at narrow slices of the electorate in ways that are opaque. This lack of transparency reveals the dishonesty in Zuckerberg\u2019s claims that Facebook supports the democratic process by allowing people to \u201csee for themselves what politicians are saying\u201d.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Rolling Stone:\u00a0Warren, Buttigieg Had Themselves a Real Spicy Fight Over Campaign Finance<br/>By Tessa Stuart<br/>Is the Democratic Party supposed to serve the interests of wealthy, well-connected donors? Or is it supposed to serve the interests of working people? The candidates who hold exclusive, expensive fundraisers argue they can accept money from rich people without becoming beholden to them; while\u00a0both Warren and Sanders insist the country ended up in the dire position it is today because politicians have catered to the interests of the wealthy and well-connected\u2026<br/>[Buttigeg said to Sen. Warren],\u201dSenator, your net worth is 100 times mine. Suppose you went home and felt the holiday spirit\u2026 and gave the maximum donation allowable by law, would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person? No. I would be glad to have that support.\u201d<br/>Warren doubled-down. \u201cI said to anyone who wants to donate to me, if you want to donate to me, that\u2019s fine. But don\u2019t come around later expecting to be named ambassador.\u201d She went on: \u201cHere\u2019s the problem. If you can\u2019t stand up and take the steps that are relatively easy, can\u2019t stand up to the wealthy and well connected when it is relatively easy, when you are a candidate, then how can the American people believe you will stand up to the wealthy and well-connected when you are president and it is really hard?\u201d<br/>Buttigieg snapped back, noting that Warren transferred money to her presidential campaign that she raised as a senator in the kinds of fundraisers she was now condemning. \u201cDid it corrupt you, Senator? Of course not.\u201d<br/>The Week:\u00a0Pete Buttigieg endorses corruption<br/>By Ryan Cooper<br/>Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders attacked Pete Buttigieg over his gigantic big-dollar fundraising\u2026<br/>In response, Buttigieg endorsed political corruption, arguing that it was good to rake in tens of millions of dollars from American oligarchs. It\u2019s a false argument, and a horrible look for a 2020 Democratic candidate\u2026<br/>Buttigieg then went on to argue that taking big checks from the billionaire class is fine, actually: \u201cIf you decided to go to [his campaign website] and give the maximum allowable by law, $2,800 would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person? No, I would be glad to have that support! We need the support from everybody who is committed to helping us defeat Donald Trump.\u201d<br/>This is risible nonsense that undermines years of progressive organizing\u2026<br/>More importantly, Buttigieg casually skates past reams of evidence and argument about the festering cancer of money in politics. For instance, the\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0Supreme Court decision released a flood tide of money into American politics \u2013 indeed, as economist Thomas Philippon writes in his book\u00a0The Great Reversal, there is today fully\u00a050 times as much\u00a0political campaign spending in the United States as in comparable European countries, and the top 0.01 percent of U.S. donors account for 40 percent of all spending.<br/>Are we really to think that wealthy Americans are not getting\u00a0something\u00a0for all that money \u2013 or that Europe\u2019s far more restrictive regulations on political spending have nothing at all to do with their\u00a0more equal economies? Please.<br/>HuffPost:\u00a0Fighting Corruption Is The Most Electable Thing A Democrat Can Do In 2020<br/>By Kevin Robillard<br/>To Warren and her team, a believable promise to battle corruption is the best way to win over swing voters. Both recent political history and polling suggest they might be right: A survey conducted for the Democratic campaign finance reform group End Citizens United found that 89% of voters in 26 congressional swing districts rated cracking down on political corruption as either a \u201ctop\u201d or \u201cmajor\u201d priority\u2026<br/>\u201cTrump isn\u2019t going to quit lying about how he drained the swamp,\u201d said Tiffany Muller, the president of End Citizens United, which is neutral in the 2020 presidential primary. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Democrats to make the case about how they\u2019re going to reform the system and how it impacts their day-to-day life.\u201d\u2026<br/>Democratic officials and candidates have with Warren\u2019s push to crack down on the influence of lobbyists, corporations and money in politics. Of the 40 (mostly moderate) Democrats who won Republican-held House seats in 2018, 27 of them had sworn off money from corporate PACs \u2013 a point nearly all of them emphasized in television advertising.<br/>Brennan Center:\u00a019 Things We Learned About Money in Politics in 2019<br/>By Ciara Torres-Spelliscy<br/>6.

Grewal, all as part of an undercover sting that began in early 2018.<br/>Those targeted were both Democrats and Republicans, and included the Jersey City school board president and a former state assemblyman.<br/>Prosecutors said the cooperating witness at the center of the investigation also offered checks from illegal \u201cstraw donors\u201d \u2013 individuals reimbursed to write checks to the defendant\u2019s campaign in amounts that complied with the legal limit on individual donations. The complaints alleged that overall, more than $70,000 in bribes were paid.<br/>Catholic News Agency:\u00a0Texas Right to Life fined for illegal funding of political ad<br/>By CNA Staff<br/>Pro-life group Texas Right to Life has been issued a $7,500 fine by the Texas Ethics Commission for illegally funding a political radio ad for the 2018 re-election campaign of a Republican state senator, Texas sources have reported.<br/>The ethics commission\u2019s general counsel, Ian Steusloff,\u00a0told The Dallas Morning News\u00a0that corporations are normally banned by state law from politically funding candidates or representatives currently in office.<br/>The commission issued the fine to Texas Right to Life, the state affiliate of National Right to Life, in November after it was found that the group\u2019s corporate branch, not its political action committee, had paid $37,915 for a radio ad for the campaign of Senator Bob Hall.<br/>Kimberlyn Schwartz, director of media and communication for Texas Right to Life, told The Dallas Morning News that the group had already \u201cself-corrected and self-reported\u201d the error, and said that the ethics commission \u201cis known for targeting citizens and nonprofits, including Texas Right to Life.\u201d<br/>\u201cDue to the commission\u2019s web of rules aimed at limiting free speech, average citizens find it very difficult to be engaged in the political process without incurring hefty fines and lengthy court battles,\u201d Schwartz added.<br/>Anchorage Daily News:\u00a0Laid-off Alaska arts council employee threatens lawsuit, saying recall support doomed her chances for rehire<br/>By James Brooks<br/>Keren Lowell lost her job at the Alaska State Council on the Arts when Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed the agency\u2019s budget earlier this year. When the Alaska Legislature restored the council\u2019s funding and Dunleavy agreed, it appeared she would get her job back.<br/>Instead, she received an email saying she would not be rehired because she supports a campaign seeking Dunleavy\u2019s recall from office\u2026<br/>\u201cMy role with the state as a public servant does not mean I have to surrender my First Amendment rights,\u201d she said by phone Thursday morning\u2026<br/>[ACLU legal director Stephen] Koteff\u00a0said the position of the ACLU is that the state \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the right to make determinations about who will work for state government based upon whether they think their politics are acceptable.\u201d<br/>The organization is\u00a0already suing Dunleavy and his former chief of staff in federal court\u00a0over the firings of three former state employees. The state says those employees failed to properly sign documents during the transition from former Gov. Bill Walker. The ACLU says the documents amounted to a political loyalty pledge, thus any firings based on them are illegal.\u00a0A fourth employee has filed a separate lawsuit\u00a0in state

Energy Secretary Rick Perry was directed by Trump last month to develop a list of policy options and legal authorities to save coal and nuclear power plants, which are being forced to close due to increased competition from natural gas and renewables. But Trump saying it is a ?military plan? raises the question of whether the Department of Defense will be involved.FERC chief of staff spills the beans: Earlier this month, Anthony Pugliese, the chief of staff at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said at an industry conference that the Department of Defense is part of a plan meant to ensure that energy resources are able to survive a military strike on the nation, or a severe weather event.Echoing something similar, Trump told supporters Tuesday night that coal is an \"indestructible\" resource in times of war that is \"very important\" to the country.White House offers no explanation: The White House did not respond to emails to explain what Trump's \"military plan\" would entail. Nevertheless, Democrats have their own questions they want Kevin McIntyre, Trump's FERC chairman, to answer.Democrats launch letter campaign: Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington and Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrats on both the Senate and House energy committees, wrote McIntyre Wednesday to say that they are \"deeply troubled\" by Pugliese's comments, calling what he described as \"an ill-conceived plan to interfere with the operation of the nation?s wholesale electric markets.\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Welcome to Daily on Energy</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, compiled by Washington Examiner Energy and Environment Writers John Siciliano (@JohnDSiciliano) and Josh Siegel (@SiegelScribe).

Shelved reactor design now getting renewed attention: ?Molten salt reactors are getting a reboot,? the Energy Department tweeted, offering a schematic of the battery-like power plant modules that ?could power America's energy.?Big coal is teaming teams up with big tech on nuclear: The agency linked to a detailed description of how its Oak Ridge National Laboratory is teaming up with Southern Company, a big coal utility with several nuclear plants, and Gates? Terra Power to test and develop a type of reactor uses liquefied sodium ?as both coolant and fuel,? according to the Energy Department. \u00a0The power reactors are sometimes referred to as nuclear batteries because they are small, self-contained units, which theoretically can be deployed anywhere, although the version being tested at Oak Ridge appears to be one requiring a permanent structure and housing. It has been a long-time coming for these reactors: Almost 60 years after the designs for this type of reactor were first unveiled, several companies are starting to develop them as energy systems of the future -- including TerraPower, backed by Bill Gates,? the agency explained.The Department of Energy has so far invested over $28 million in cost-shared funds for the project to identify and test materials used in the reactor.Read John?s magazine feature to gain a more detailed understanding of what the reactors are and why they are getting renewed attention. SAUDIS PUSHBACK AGAINST REPORTS THAT OIL COMPANY ABANDONED SELL-OFF PLAN: A Saudi top official is trying to beat back reports that the kingdom?s oil company, Saudi Aramco, has abandoned its plan to begin selling 5 percent of the company?s stock as part of a broader economic diversification plan. ?The government remains committed to the [initial public offer] of Saudi Aramco at a time of its own choosing when conditions are optimum,? said Khalid Al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister and the company?s chairman, on Thursday. Reading the tea leaves: It?s unclear whether Al-Falih is committed to making the public offering, or if Aramco is actually trying to push back the timeline because of recent improvements in the price in oil. The plan to sell 5 percent of the largest energy company in the world is part of the oil-rich kingdom's Vision 2030 plan to diversify the country's economy away from oil. The move to go public followed a crash in the price of oil two years ago, which cut the nation's budget in half due to the losses in revenue.Saudi sell-off may be less needed with higher oil prices: Selling shares of stock in Aramco, an unprecedented move, was a bold attempt to increase revenue in an uncertain energy market. However, actions by OPEC and non-OPEC countries to cut oil production over the last year have helped force the global price of oil upward.The price of oil went from around $25 per barrel at its lowest point nearly three years ago, to nearly $80 per barrel this year. The Energy Information Administration expects the price to hold steady at around $70 per barrel going into 2019.CHINA STOPS BUYING US COAL AHEAD OF TARIFFS: Chinese coal traders have stopped buying U.S. coal ahead of tariffs that go into effect on Thursday.The Trump administration escalated its trade war with China, imposing 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods just after midnight. In retaliation, China slapped 25 percent tariffs on an equal amount of American products, including coal, diesel and gasoline. Crude oil is not subject to tariffs.China has been anticipating this move: Shanghai Runhei International, a major Chinese coal trading house, told Reuters it has no plans to import U.S. metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.?We have completely stopped U.S. metallurgical coal (imports), which is popular among steel mills, in late July. There is too much uncertainty in trade,? the company said. Shanghai Runhei said it will increase purchases of domestic coal instead.Potential harm for U.S. producers: China in recent years has been a bellwether for U.S. coal exports, especially of metallurgical coal, with the country accounting for roughly half of global steel consumption because of its aggressive urbanization and infrastructure investment.U.S. coal mining jobs saw a 1 percent increase last year to more than 50,000, a response to increased demand from Asia, mostly China, for metallurgical coal, experts say.SENATORS HAIL TRUMP?S SCIENCE ADVISER IN NOMINATION HEARING: Senators of both parties on Thursday morning hailed Trump?s nominee to be his first science director, Kelvin Droegemeier, an expert in extreme weather from the University of Oklahoma.?There is no question to your qualifications,? Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said at Droegemeier?s confirmation hearing before the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. ?Your work on extreme weather is very important to the country. If confirmed, you have a tough task ahead of you, but a lot of us on the committee are going to be happy you are the White House science adviser.?Science overcomes Trump?s politics: Trump had left the science and technology adviser position vacant for 19 months before nominating Droegemeier, providing fodder to critics who say his administration is downplaying science, especially as it relates to climate change. But Droegemeier, a Republican, has bipartisan credentials to take the helm of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a White House agency that helps set policy on issues involving innovations in medical research, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence -- and climate change. Supporters say he accepts established climate science.?Science has no politics. Science is just science,? Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said Thursday. ?He knows his stuff he will be doing a great job,? Lankford added of Droegemeier. ?There is no one in America better qualified for this position.?Advocate for climate research: Droegemeier served two six-year terms on the National Science Board, under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. A trained meteorologist, Droegemeier has also served as Oklahoma?s secretary of science and technology.John Holdren, who served as science adviser under Obama, has applauded Droegemeier?s nomination telling Science Magazine that the nominee would be ?energetic in defending the R&amp;D budget and climate change research in particular.?Droegemeier in his former roles has criticized efforts by congressional Republicans to cut funding for climate research.?Science needs to be conducted free from political interference,? Droegemeier said Thursday. ?The science has to lead the way in telling us what the facts are. My role is to make sure those scientific results unbiased are presented to the president and others for decision making and policy making,?GREENS OPPOSE TRUMP?S EX-IM BANK CHIEF: The Senate Banking Committee on Thursday voted 25-0 in favor of Kimberly Reed to lead the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the U.S. export credit agency, which the group Friends of the Earth fears could be a move to subsidize fossil fuels abroad. The bank still isn?t back to full operations: The Ex-Im Bank has been without a quorum for months. Reed?s confirmation would bring the bank a step closer to full operation, although another confirmation to the board would be needed for a quorum. The environmental group says restoring the bank to full operations would mean that billions of dollars in federal subsidies could potentially move to support up to 13 fossil fuel projects pending at the bank.Those projects would ?damage? the climate: ?There are serious concerns that Ex-Im under Reed will return to its past practice of supporting projects that damage the global climate, harm community health, violate human rights and hasten corruption,? said Kate DeAngelis, senior international policy analyst at Friends of the Earth, after the vote. ?If approved, Ex-Im?s fossil fuel projects will line the pockets of large U.S. corporations like General Electric and Exxon at taxpayers? expense while destroying our planet.?SENATE COMMITTEE DELAYS VOTE ON NOMINEE FOR ENERGY DEPARTMENT LAWYER: The August doldrums on Capitol Hill forced another casualty, as the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee announced it is delaying a vote scheduled for Thursday on Trump?s nominee to be the Energy Department?s top lawyer.The committee does not have enough members present to hold the vote on William Cooper, Trump?s pick to be DOE?s general counsel. Cooper, if confirmed, would be keep in defending the Energy Department?s potential use of emergency powers to subsidize coal and nuclear plants.The panel was also scheduled to vote on Lane Genatowski, Trump?s nominee to lead the Energy Department?s innovation and science research program. It did not announced a new date for the votes.TOP SPOKESMAN FOR OIL GROUP LEAVING FOR ENERGY DEPARTMENT: Michael Tadeo, a top spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, is leaving the top oil and gas lobbying group to join the Energy Department?s Office of Fossil Energy.Tadeo is joining the Energy Department as a senior adviser, a politically appointed job, he said Wednesday.He spent two years at API, focused on issues such as pipeline development and increasing exports of liquified natural gas. Before joining API, Tadeo was deputy communications director for the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.In his new role, he will help the Energy Department wing on research and development in fossil fuel technology, including carbon, capture and storage and power plant efficiency.OIL EXPORTS EXCEED IMPORTS FOR FIRST TIME ALONG TEXAS GULF COAST: Oil exports from the Texas Gulf Coast exceeded imports for the first time, according to new data released by the Energy Information Administration.In April, oil exports in the Houston-Galveston port district exceeded imports by 15,000 barrels a day, and in May, that difference grew to 470,000 barrels a day.Most of the oil imported to the U.S. goes through midwest or the Gulf Coast. The U.S. port district of Houston-Galveston accounted for 12 percent of total American crude oil imports as of May, with most of it coming from Mexico, South America, and the Middle East.Oil exports from the Gulf Coast mostly go to China, Italy, Canada, and Britain.EPA CHANGES LOCATIONS FOR HEARINGS ON FUEL EFFICIENCY RULE: The Environmental Protection Agency is changing its plans for public hearings on its proposal to relax Obama-era fuel efficiency rules for vehicles.EPA canceled hearings scheduled to take place in Washington D.C., Detroit, and Los Angeles. Instead, the agency plans to host hearings in Fresno, Calif., Dearborn, Mich., and Pittsburgh, Pa. They will occur on Sept. 24-26, according to a federal register posting on Wednesday.EPA on Aug. 2 proposed a rule freezing Obama administration fuel standards that would have increased year-over-year. California has led a group of states suing over the proposal, to keep their right to enforce tougher standards to combat air pollution and climate change.FORD RECALLS ELECTRIC CAR CABLES DUE TO FIRE RISK: American carmaker Ford is recalling charging cords for more than 50,000 plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles because they could cause fires in power outlets, the Associated Press reported.Ford said Wednesday that plugging the cords into outlets that aren't on a dedicated circuit or are on damaged or corroded circuits could cause the outlets to overheat. The company has received reports of four fires involving the cords, but no one has been injured.RUNDOWNAssociated Press Big oil asks government to protect its Texas facilities from climate changeWall Street Journal The new gas market: shippers needing cleaner fuelNew York Times Air pollution is shortening your life.

WTI is trending down Friday at $35.52 per barrel as of this writing, after slightly increasing earlier in the day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThe market optimists got a bit ahead of themselves,\u201d Frank Verrastro, senior adviser of the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Josh.</p><p>It\u2019s the economy, stupid: The oil market dive came at the same time as the stock market plunged Thursday, with the energy sector the worst performing part. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Wednesday the pace of economic recovery remaines \u201cextraordinarily uncertain.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe market wanted only good news and the Fed delivered mixed news,\u201d said Joe McMonigle, a former Energy Department chief of staff in the George W. Bush administration who is now president of the Abraham Group, an international strategic consulting firm. \u201cOil price declines followed the macro economic narrative,\u201d McMonigle told Josh.</p><p>Coronavirus infections, meanwhile, are rising in 21 states as governments have eased restrictions and people have begun to return to their routines, including driving, lifting gasoline demand.</p><p>Supply and demand questions: McMonigle expects oil demand to return close to normal levels by the end of the year, but the data has yet to bear that out. At least two states, Utah and Oregon, are pausing their re-openings.</p><p>\u201cWe may be entering a plateau period for oil prices that rose initially after some early demand increase signals but will now be waiting for more solid data of demand trends,\u201d McMonigle said.</p><p>Frederick Lawrence, an economist with the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said he is also bearish about supply factors. Last week saw an unexpected buildup of crude stocks, a continued signal of a glut in the market.</p><p>OPEC+ extended its production cuts through July, but Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Coast countries are not continuing additional voluntary reductions beyond this month. More U.S. wells are coming back online after prices rose from the depths of their fall.</p><p>\u201cProducers have quite a tightrope to walk given all the uncertainties and variables in play,\u201d Lawrence told Josh. \u201cThe system is fragile and oil will continue to be volatile.\u201d</p><p>Welcome to Daily on Energy, written by Washington Examiner Energy and Environment Writers Josh Siegel (@SiegelScribe) and Abby Smith (@AbbySmithDC).

Electricity generation from nuclear has declined only slightly in response to lower demand, and has provided flexibility to the grid allowing for large and reliable supply of low-carbon power.</p><p>\u201cDespite these strengths, the prospects for nuclear power have worsened and will require focused policy attention in countries that support its continuing role,\u201d the IEA said.</p><p>99 problems: Plant closures have been moving ahead due to competition from cheaper gas and renewables. Revenues from supplying electricity have been low, especially since the pandemic began, \u201cundermining the case\u201d for investing in lifetime extensions for existing nuclear plants or building new ones. Utilities that run nuclear plants are bringing in less revenue, leading them to reduce investments. For nuclear power to play a role in net-zero emissions by 2050 goals, new nuclear will be needed to replace aging plants.</p><p>\u201cThere is a risk that with aging capacity and financial strains, their [nuclear] contribution might gradually fade away, increasing energy security risks and making clean energy transitions even more difficult,\u201d IEA said.</p><p>CONSERVATION BILL KEEPS SENATORS UP AT NIGHT: The Senate approved another procedural vote to advance the \u201cGreat American Outdoors Act,\u201d but was forced to stick around until 1 a.m. to do so because of a disagreement over the amendment process.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had moved to end debate on the lands bill Wednesday night, aiming to cut off the possibility of amendments that he and bill supporters fear could splinter Republicans over what they see as a major conservation achievement that can be an asset for vulnerable members on the campaign trail. President Trump has endorsed the public lands package, which would fully fund the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund with $900 million annually and pay for a massive maintenance backlog in national parks and other federal lands.</p><p>Process matters: Conservative Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, however, tried to change McConnell\u2019s mind, proposing a vote on five amendments before Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, a chief backer of the bill, objected.</p><p>\u201cWe are abusing our constitutional privilege,\u201d Lee said in a lengthy floor speech early Thursday night. \u201cWe are doing this for no other purpose than for our own convenience. No wonder they can\u2019t stand us,\u201d he added, alluding to Congress\u2019 poor public approval rating.</p><p>Lee\u2019s criticism turned personal.</p><p>\u201cWho benefits from this? The small group of individuals involved in this decision. They do this in a dishonorable way at the expense of the relationships with their colleagues, and most damningly, at the expense of the voters who elected them.\u201d</p><p>Despite the process concerns, and other pushback by coastal senators, the public lands package is expected to pass early next week by a wide bipartisan margin.</p><p>MORE CORPORATE BUYERS OF WIND THAN EVER BEFORE: Commercial and industrial companies set a record last year for procurement of wind power, purchasing 4,447 megawatts, and their share of the wind market is only expected to grow, according to a first-time report on corporate buyers from the American Wind Energy Association.</p><p>More than 140 companies have now purchased wind power, and the interest is extending beyond big tech companies like Google and Facebook to include telecommunications giants like AT&amp;T and food and beverage companies. In 2019, McDonalds became the first fast food brand to ink a wind deal, according to the AWEA report.</p><p>There are still barriers for corporate buyers, though: It\u2019s become much easier for these companies to ink wind deals, especially through mechanisms like green tariffs, but they still struggle in the Southeast and places in the West where power markets are vertically integrated, said John Hensley, AWEA\u2019s vice president of research and analytics.</p><p>Corporate buyers would also benefit from new financial mechanisms that could allow several companies to buy into one contract, so they could \u201cbetter tailor fit to the amount of energy they actually need,\u201d Hensley added. </p><p>PEAK OIL PROJECTIONS: BloombergNEF analysts say oil demand for on-road transportation is set to peak in just 11 years, in 2031, at 47 million barrels per day, even as the number of kilometers driven annually by cars, bikes, and trucks could increase more than 55%.</p><p>Biofuels are also set to increase their market share to 6.3%, BNEF said in new research Thursday. The biggest factor driving down demand for oil, the analysts found, is the growth of electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, which could cut oil demand by as much as 14.7 million barrels per day by 2040. Improvements in fuel efficiency will also significantly affect oil demand and could disrupt it even further if governments tighten regulations.</p><p>The coronavirus effect: BNEF expects on-road fuel demand to dip 14% this year due to pandemic-related lockdowns, but pre-virus levels will return by 2022, driven by growth in commercial trucks. The coronavirus may have prompted peak oil demand for passenger cars in 2019, though, the analysts say.</p><p>EPA TO FACE LAWSUIT OVER FAILURE TO UPDATE FLARING RULES: Ten environmental groups say they plan to sue to force the EPA to update emissions standards for industrial flares, such as those used by chemical facilities and natural gas processing plants.</p><p>The EPA hasn\u2019t revised the standards in more than three decades, the environmental groups, led by the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a Thursday notice of intent to sue. They also note the EPA has recently updated flare requirements for petroleum refineries and ethylene production facilities, demonstrating the opportunity for improvements.</p><p>While flares are often used to control pollution, the environmental groups say the devices are \u201conly as good as the design and the operational requirements for flares.\u201d For example, they note that EPA and industry studies have shown flares that are over-steamed do not work as well and can release large amounts of toxic pollutants like benzene.</p><p>BROUILLETTE HAS GONE TO MIAMI: Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette is in South Florida today to receive a briefing from the state\u2019s utility on hurricane preparedness for what\u2019s expected to be an above-average season that starts this month.</p><p>He is visiting a storm center powered by Florida Power and Light, Brouillette tweeted Friday.</p><p>\u201cIt is imperative states such as Florida are prepared for any impending storm that may come near their shores,\u201d he said.</p><p>Brouillette is also touring Florida Power and Light\u2019s Turkey Point Nuclear Plant. In December, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted the Turkey Point plant approval to operate for up to 80 years, the first nuclear facility to receive an extension of that length.</p><p>UNDER THE SEA: The White House unveiled on Thursday two national strategies to map thousands of miles of coastline and millions of square miles of ocean waters in the next couple decades, fulfilling the directives of a November memorandum from Trump.</p><p>Under the strategies, the government will map the 66,000 miles of Alaska\u2019s coastline, and it will explore the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, which encompasses 13,000 miles of coastline and 3.4 million square miles of the ocean (larger than the land area of the entire U.S.). The White House also released recommendations to speed permitting and authorization for ocean research.</p><p>Reuters Scrub that: Pandemic forces ship owners to shelf anti-pollution gear</p><p>Miami Herald Florida Republicans insist Trump will not expand drilling off Florida\u2019s coast</p><p>New York Times Where\u2019s airborne plastic?

Obamacare?s open enrollment is more than halfway done, but a new poll found that one in four potential Obamacare customers don?t know that it ends on Dec. 15 if they want to buy a plan on healthcare.gov. The poll from the research firm Kaiser Family Foundation released Wednesday also found that one in five potential customers would buy a short-term plan, which are cheaper than Obamacare plans but offer fewer benefits. The poll found that 24 percent of potential customers that it interviewed know the correct date that open enrollment ends and 61 percent have no idea. Kaiser also looked into the effect of the loss of the individual mandate?s financial penalty, which is zeroed out in 2019. It found that 31 percent are aware of that the penalty doesn?t exist anymore. About 49 percent of potential Obamacare customers said they plan to buy coverage and 42 percent said they would go without it. Kaiser interviewed 1,201 people and has a margin of error of three percentage points. Of the 1,201, there were 168 potential Obamacare customers who either purchase their own insurance or are currently uninsured.Just 5 percent say coverage for all should be top healthcare priority for new Congress. Although the liberal push to expand Medicare to everybody has received a lot of attention in the past year, the same Kaiser poll suggests the issue is off the radar for most Americans. In the survey, Kaiser asked respondents to react to an open-ended question: \"Thinking about next year, which healthcare issue would you most like the next Congress to act on in 2019?\" Among the answers, 19 percent named \"affordability and cost\"; 10 percent named the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare); 6 percent named Medicare; and just 5 percent said, \"Healthcare/insurance for everyone.\" Even among Democrats, just 7 percent pegged healthcare for all as the top priority. Instituting some sort of \"Medicare for all\" plan would cost $32 trillion, necessitate historic tax increases on the middle class, cause massive disruption to medical providers, and kick more than half of Americans off their private insurance, passing anything close to it is going to be an uphill battle. To survive the onslaught of opposition to such a radical policy, liberal activists will have to generate a groundswell of demand on a near revolutionary scale. This survey suggests they are far from reaching that critical mass.

During a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing this morning devoted to analyzing healthcare costs, Chairman Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and top Democrat Sen. Patty Murray of Washington both expressed they would like to find a bipartisan way forward on Obamacare. Each side blamed the other for the failure earlier this year to pass a bill aimed at shoring up Obamacare that became known as Alexander-Murray. Republicans brought it to the floor but attached anti-abortion language to it, a provision common for spending bills but the root behind why Democrat said they rejected the deal. \"I?m hopeful we can revive those discussions in the new Congress, and find a way past the ideological standoffs of the past,? Murray said. Alexander said he thought senators could more broadly address healthcare costs, and perhaps even Obamacare. \"I regretted that that didn't work, and maybe we can find a way to make it work in the new session,\" he said. Watch the hearing here. Chances of partial government shutdown edge closer. Republicans and Democrats aren't budging in their fight over how much money to spend on President Trump's border wall, which is increasing the chances of a stalemate that leads to a partial government shutdown next month. President Trump has drawn a red line on the wall, telling GOP appropriators and leaders he wants $5 billion included in final fiscal year 2019 spending bill. The Homeland Security spending bill is where Republicans would like to include that money, and that bill needs to be passed by Dec. 7 to avert a partial government closure. But Senate Democrats say they want to stick to the $1.6 billion Senate lawmakers agreed to earlier this year. Neither side is backing down and Trump is threatening to use his veto pen if the spending legislation doesn?t provide his requested wall funding. With no deal in sight, Republicans are already considering whether to split off the Homeland Security spending bill and passing the six other bills that don't relate to border wall funding. The idea is to pass those bills, and then leave the contentious Homeland Security bill for last.House Democrats prepare for marathon days of leadership votes. Private voting is expected to start this morning for about a dozen leadership positions ? including House speaker, majority leader, and majority whip ? and may go on until Thursday. The members will shape the House?s agenda on healthcare and preview what a 2020 challenger to Trump can deliver to the public. Current minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is running unopposed for House speaker, and if she wins she will face a full House vote Jan. 3, where she will need 218 supporters to claim the top spot. Also running unopposed is Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who is running for majority leader, and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, who is running for majority whip. Pelosi and Hoyer have said if elected they plan to focus on fixing Obamacare, but the majority of rank-and-file House Democrats support the Medicare for All Act, a bill that would overhaul the healthcare system by rolling every person in the U.S. into Medicare. Clyburn is the only one in the top leadership slot who has co-sponsored the bill. In the Senate, Republicans hold 53-47 advantage, boosting confirmation of justices. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., on Tuesday easily defeated former Democratic Rep. Mike Espy in the runoff election in Mississippi, the final contest of the 2018 campaign cycle that will give Republicans 53 Senate seats in the next Congress. The latest tally in effect gives Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., three votes to spare when it comes to confirming Trump's judges. The added cushion also means that Trump and his team can have more leeway to nominate more conservative judges given that there is now less pressure to placate centrists. McConnell has said that he plans to confirm 35 justices by Dec. 14, a plan blasted by Planned Parenthood given the abortion cases making their way through the courts. Planned Parenthood on Wednesday calling out certain nominees for their ?hostile views on reproductive rights,? including Wendy Vitter, Jonathan Kobes, Matthew Kacsmaryk, and Michael Truncale.Anti-abortion groups urge White House to defund Planned Parenthood, fetal tissue research in 2019. Students for Life of America has outlined a list of priorities for the administration in 2019 that includes only signing budgets that defund Planned Parenthood and cutting off funds from the organization that go toward sex education. In a letter sent Trump this morning ahead of a planned meeting with members of the administration at the White House, Students for Life urged the Trump administration to cut off federal family planning grants from Planned Parenthood and for research arms of the government to discontinue medical research using fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood receives reimbursements for services such as birth control, STD testing, and cancer screenings, and anti-abortion groups say this frees up funds for abortion services. FDA finds 'disturbingly high' levels of metals in kratom. The Food and Drug Administration warned Tuesday that it had found \"disturbingly high levels of heavy metals\" in products using the herbal supplement kratom. FDA scientists said they discovered lead and nickel in 26 products when they were testing kratom for salmonella following an outbreak that had spread across multiple states. The metals were at levels \"not considered safe for human consumption,\" but were not likely to poison someone who had used kratom only once, the FDA said in a statement issued by its commissioner, Scott Gottlieb. \"Some of these products included levels that, with chronic use, could cause some people to suffer from heavy metal poisoning,\" the FDA said. \"We are concerned that there may be other kratom products on the market that also contain heavy metals.\"Maine GOP governor requests delay on Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. The Maine governor's office has asked for a stay on a court order for officials to implement Obamacare's Medicaid expansion as it seeks to appeal the decision to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.The lawyer who filed the stay on behalf of Republican Gov. Paul LePage on Tuesday said the order to start the expansion on Dec. 5 would cause a \"fiscal crisis\" to the state's Department of Health and Human Services. He wrote that the move would require the state to spend millions of dollars appropriated for other services and noted that the Trump administration had not yet signed off on the expansion. Under Obamacare, the federal government is supposed to pick up at least 90 percent of the tab. Last week, Kennebec County Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy ordered Maine officials to begin taking steps to carry out the Medicaid expansion, which would cover an additional 80,000 people in the state. Murphy wrote in her order that the expansion could be paid for through the current Medicaid fund until May 2019 and that the legislature needed to address the issue.Improper use of active shooter alarm shakes Walter Reed. A tenant command inadvertently set off a mass notification system on Tuesday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, causing widespread confusion and early conflicting reports about a possible active shooter on campus. The incident led to a lockdown on the sprawling Bethesda, Md.,-based campus, where people were urged to hide in safe areas as authorities investigated the scene. Initial reports said the alarm was part of a drill, but by nightfall officials said the alarm had been a mistake. \"While preparing for an upcoming drill, the notification system was inadvertently enacted without containing the words 'exercise' or 'drill,'\" the U.S. Navy said in a statement. The people who saw the notification alerted security on campus, which then sent out a widespread alarm. \u00a0The U.S. Navy originally tweeted that the incident was part of a scheduled drill. \"After investigating the call and the origin, NSA Bethesda has determined that this was a false alarm and not part of a scheduled drill as has been reported,\" the Naval Support Activity Bethesda said in a statement.Former opioid maker executive expected to plead guilty in kickback scheme. A former executive at the opioid maker Insys Therapeutics is expected to plead guilty for participating in a scheme to pay doctors to prescribe Insys? opioid product, according to a report in Reuters. Former executive Alec Burlakoff is expected to plead guilty for taking part in a racketeering scheme. Insys had paid the Justice Department $150 million in response to the scheme. Insys is the latest company embroiled in lawsuits surrounding the opioid epidemic. Purdue Pharma, maker of the popular painkiller Oxycontin, has been sued by several states for deceptively marketing Oxycontin and downplaying addiction risks.HHS issues strategy aimed at reducing doctor burden on health IT. Health and Human Services put out a strategy on Wednesday aimed at reducing the burden that clinicians have faced by adopting health IT such as electronic health records. The strategy has recommendations to help physicians incorporate EHRs and other health IT products into their practices. ?With the significant growth in EHRs comes frustration caused, in many cases, by regulatory and administrative requirements stacked on top of one another,? HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. HHS has made easing burdens for adopting health IT a major plank of its effort called Patients over Paperwork. The administration argues that documentation guidelines for adopting EHRs has led to ?note bloat,? as clinicians have reported spending more time entering data into an EHR than with their patients.FDA releases 63 product-specific regulatory guidances on generic drugs to increase competition. The Food and Drug Administration put out regulatory guidances on 63 drugs to help generic drug makers develop competitive generic versions of the products. The product-specific guidances show data on how a company can complete studies to get approval for a generic version of the product. The agency said that four of the 63 guidances are new and 31 are revised and updated guidances. The agency has made improving generic drug competition a major part of the Trump administration?s effort to combat high drug prices. The guidances are being updated to make it easier for companies to develop competitors. The agency approved or tentatively approved a record 971 generics in fiscal 2018.RUNDOWNThe Hill Google parent company seeking to eliminate mosquito-spread diseases globally: reportAxios What the criminal justice reform bill would mean for the opioid crisisWall Street Journal Big tech expands footprint in healthNew York Times JUUL?s new product: Less nicotine, more intense vaporReuters Humana cuts 2019 membership forecast for prescription drug plansAssociated Press At FDA, a new goal, then a push for speedy device reviewsKaiser Health News Chronically ill, traumatically billed: The $123,000 medicine for MS</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p/><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Calendar                                                            WEDNESDAY | Nov. 28Senate and House in session.

The opening minutes of Judge Brett Kavanaugh?s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee descended into chaos this morning, as numerous demonstrators protested his nomination and called for the members of the committee to oppose his nomination. Protesters raised issues including abortion and healthcare. Senate Democrats also repeatedly interrupted the opening, citing the release of approximately 42,000 pages of documents Monday evening from Kavanaugh's work in the George W. Bush White House, and a further 100,000 pages that have not been produced because President Trump asserted executive privilege. Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., among others, urged Chairman Chuck Grassley to delay the hearing in the wake of the document release. Blumenthal moved to adjourn the hearing. Watch the hearing live.

Like Chief Justice John Roberts in his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh plans to liken the role of a judge to an umpire when testifying in the Senate, describing himself as a ?pro-law judge? who does not decide cases by his ?personal or policy preferences.\" ?A good judge must be an umpire ? a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,\" Kavanaugh will say, according to his prepared remarks. \"I don?t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge.\" Kavanaugh plans to talk about his time serving with 17 other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, including Merrick Garland, the court's chief judge who President Barack Obama nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016 following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. ?If confirmed to the Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States,? Kavanaugh will say. ?I would always strive to be a team player on the Team of Nine.\" Kavanaugh will also offer words of praise for Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired from the Supreme Court at the end of July and whose seat Kavanaugh will fill if confirmed by the full Senate. Kavanaugh clerked for Kennedy on the Supreme Court. ?To me, Justice Kennedy is a mentor, a friend, and a hero. As a member of the Court, he was a model of civility and collegiality,? he will say. ?He fiercely defended the independence of the Judiciary. And he was a champion of liberty.?Delay, demand, derail: The Democrats' attack plan against Kavanaugh. For Senate Democrats, Tuesday?s hearing marks a culmination of weeks of effort aimed at derailing his nomination. Since President Trump named Kavanaugh as his nominee during a prime-time event at the White House on July 9, Democrats have worked to drum up opposition by highlighting his views on abortion, healthcare, and executive power, and launched a heated battle for access to Kavanaugh?s records from his tenure serving in George W. Bush's White House. Their goal: To defeat the president?s second nominee to the Supreme Court, one who, if confirmed, would shift the high court?s ideology to the right. But Democrats face an uphill battle, as they have control of 49 seats compared to Republicans? 50. Some Senate Democrats have no misgivings about the challenge they face as the minority party, but believe a thorough review of Kavanaugh?s record will give them a remote chance of convincing moderate Republicans to vote with them. As Kavanaugh?s confirmation hearing drew near, Democrats tweeted using the hashtags #StopKavanaugh and #WhatsAtStake, delivering soliloquies the Senate floor, and appearing at rallies hosted by advocacy groups.Planned Parenthood rolls out six-figure ad buy targeting Kavanaugh. Planned Parenthood announced a six-figure ad buy targeting Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh on the same day that his confirmation hearings start in the Senate. The TV and radio ads are expected to air in Alaska and Washington, D.C., the women?s health and abortion provider said on Tuesday. Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups have charged that Kavanaugh?s appointment could roll back Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion a constitutional right. The ads target centrist GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Her opposition alongside Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is key to sinking Kavanaugh?s nomination.Kavanaugh's four-day slog through the Senate. The main event started at 9:30 a.m., when the Judiciary Committee?s 21 members expected to hear introductions from former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Lisa Blatt, a self-described ?liberal feminist? lawyer. Over the course of the next two days, Kavanaugh will be grilled by Senate Democrats and Republicans in two rounds of questioning. The first round will begin Wednesday, when members of the Judiciary Committee will get 30 minutes apiece. On Thursday, each senator will have 20 minutes for the second round of questioning. The fourth day of Kavanaugh?s hearing, Friday, will hear from four panels of witnesses from the majority and the minority. Before the close of the hearing, senators will hear from a group that includes two former solicitors general, Kavanaugh?s ex-law clerks, legal scholars, and other members of the legal community, who will offer their support for the Supreme Court nominee. Among those scheduled to testify for Judiciary Committee Democrats are John Dean, the former White House counsel for President Richard Nixon, Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., and Aalayah Eastmond, a survivor of the February shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. The witnesses for the minority will speak about abortion, healthcare, executive power, gun violence, and abortion rights, among other issues, according to the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.Texas Obamacare suit ready for its first close up. A federal judge is expected to hear oral arguments starting Wednesday on a lawsuit brought by Texas and 19 states to strike down Obamacare. The hearing itself is on a preliminary injunction from the states that calls for federal enforcement of Obamacare to be halted while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts. The injunction would ensure that enforcement of the individual mandate penalty, which doesn?t go away until 2019, would stop. But It would also stop the federal government from enforcing requirements on Obamacare insurance plans like pre-existing condition protections. A collection of 17 states are defending Obamacare after the Justice Department decided earlier this year to not defend the law in court. A ruling is not expected to be delivered immediately after the hearing.Senate may consider opioid legislation this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Republicans had signed off on a legislative package, and that the bill may receive a vote as early as this week. Senate Democrats have not yet announced whether they will support the bill or whether they have any qualms with it. The legislation will likely include the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, which is meant to give the Postal Service more tools to stop shipments of illicit fentanyl from getting into the U.S.Immigrants dropping out of government aid program over fears of losing green card eligibility: Report. \u00a0Immigrants have begun dropping out of a federal aid program out of fear that relying on government support could hurt their chances of obtaining a green card following the Trump administration's reported plan to make those dependent ineligible for permanent residency, according to a report published Monday. Health providers who oversee WIC ? a federal nutrition program for pregnant women and babies ? in 18 states have noticed a decline of up to 20 percent in the number of people filing for help, Politico reported. Enrollment in the WIC program, begun in 1974, dropped from 7.4 million when Trump took office in January 2017 to 6.8 million in May, shortly after the administration's plans to change the public charge rule were leaked. However, the decline is also connected to improvement in the economy and a decrease in birth rates. Lawmakers search for answers on oversight of controversial drug discount program. Bipartisan lawmakers are looking to the Trump administration to boost oversight of a controversial drug discount program while the outlook for legislative fixes this year darkens. Lawmakers on both sides have been demanding greater transparency of the program, called 340B, as various legislation has stalled so far in Congress amid an intense lobbying war between pharma and hospital groups. So bipartisan lawmakers want the Trump administration to use existing power to clarify the requirements of the program, which Trump cut by $1.6 billion this year. While the administration has called on Congress for more authority, the leadership of the relevant committees believe it already isn't using its full power to oversee 340B. It wants the administration to do a better job of defining what the intent of the program is and the requirements for both participating hospitals and pharmaceutical companies providing the discounts.Healthcare costs cut into wage growth for workers, report says. Rising healthcare costs are taking a hit to take-home pay for U.S. workers, a new analysis released Tuesday found. The analysis from the Council for Affordable Health Coverage looks at how staggering healthcare costs have eclipsed wage growth. The average U.S. health expenditure was $10,348 per person in 2016. It also found that in 2001 employers allocated 41.9 percent of benefits to healthcare and 58 percent to retirement benefits. But by 2015, the split was in the other direction as 63.5 percent was for health benefits and 36 percent for retirement, the report found. ?Our analysis illustrates the escalation of health care premiums, which have absorbed most or all compensation growth in recent years for many workers ? leaving little or nothing to add to their paychecks,? said healthcare consultant Sylvester Schieber, one of the study?s co-authors. ?Wage gains have often been more than absorbed by higher employee premiums.?Pediatricians encourage kids to opt for flu shot over nasal spray. To protect against the flu season ahead, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children six months and older opt for the shot over the nasal spray. The AAP is prioritizing the shot because the nasal spray, known as FluMist, has a spotty track record of effectiveness. Still, the organization said the spray in children older than 2 was better than not being vaccinated at all, calling its effectiveness ?an unknown? this season. AAP had recommended against the nasal spray during the previous two flu seasons, though it can be popular with children who are afraid of needles. The last flu season resulted 179 deaths among children, a record. Eighty percent of those who died had not been vaccinated.

The opening minutes of Judge Brett Kavanaugh?s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee descended into chaos this morning, as numerous demonstrators protested his nomination and called for the members of the committee to oppose his nomination. Protesters raised issues including abortion and healthcare. Senate Democrats also repeatedly interrupted the opening, citing the release of approximately 42,000 pages of documents Monday evening from Kavanaugh's work in the George W. Bush White House, and a further 100,000 pages that have not been produced because President Trump asserted executive privilege. Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., among others, urged Chairman Chuck Grassley to delay the hearing in the wake of the document release. Blumenthal moved to adjourn the hearing. Watch the hearing live.

Like Chief Justice John Roberts in his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh plans to liken the role of a judge to an umpire when testifying in the Senate, describing himself as a ?pro-law judge? who does not decide cases by his ?personal or policy preferences.\" ?A good judge must be an umpire ? a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,\" Kavanaugh will say, according to his prepared remarks. \"I don?t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge.\" Kavanaugh plans to talk about his time serving with 17 other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, including Merrick Garland, the court's chief judge who President Barack Obama nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016 following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. ?If confirmed to the Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States,? Kavanaugh will say. ?I would always strive to be a team player on the Team of Nine.\" Kavanaugh will also offer words of praise for Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired from the Supreme Court at the end of July and whose seat Kavanaugh will fill if confirmed by the full Senate. Kavanaugh clerked for Kennedy on the Supreme Court. ?To me, Justice Kennedy is a mentor, a friend, and a hero. As a member of the Court, he was a model of civility and collegiality,? he will say. ?He fiercely defended the independence of the Judiciary. And he was a champion of liberty.?Delay, demand, derail: The Democrats' attack plan against Kavanaugh. For Senate Democrats, Tuesday?s hearing marks a culmination of weeks of effort aimed at derailing his nomination. Since President Trump named Kavanaugh as his nominee during a prime-time event at the White House on July 9, Democrats have worked to drum up opposition by highlighting his views on abortion, healthcare, and executive power, and launched a heated battle for access to Kavanaugh?s records from his tenure serving in George W. Bush's White House. Their goal: To defeat the president?s second nominee to the Supreme Court, one who, if confirmed, would shift the high court?s ideology to the right. But Democrats face an uphill battle, as they have control of 49 seats compared to Republicans? 50. Some Senate Democrats have no misgivings about the challenge they face as the minority party, but believe a thorough review of Kavanaugh?s record will give them a remote chance of convincing moderate Republicans to vote with them. As Kavanaugh?s confirmation hearing drew near, Democrats tweeted using the hashtags #StopKavanaugh and #WhatsAtStake, delivering soliloquies the Senate floor, and appearing at rallies hosted by advocacy groups.Planned Parenthood rolls out six-figure ad buy targeting Kavanaugh. Planned Parenthood announced a six-figure ad buy targeting Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh on the same day that his confirmation hearings start in the Senate. The TV and radio ads are expected to air in Alaska and Washington, D.C., the women?s health and abortion provider said on Tuesday. Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups have charged that Kavanaugh?s appointment could roll back Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion a constitutional right. The ads target centrist GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Her opposition alongside Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is key to sinking Kavanaugh?s nomination.Kavanaugh's four-day slog through the Senate. The main event started at 9:30 a.m., when the Judiciary Committee?s 21 members expected to hear introductions from former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Lisa Blatt, a self-described ?liberal feminist? lawyer. Over the course of the next two days, Kavanaugh will be grilled by Senate Democrats and Republicans in two rounds of questioning. The first round will begin Wednesday, when members of the Judiciary Committee will get 30 minutes apiece. On Thursday, each senator will have 20 minutes for the second round of questioning. The fourth day of Kavanaugh?s hearing, Friday, will hear from four panels of witnesses from the majority and the minority. Before the close of the hearing, senators will hear from a group that includes two former solicitors general, Kavanaugh?s ex-law clerks, legal scholars, and other members of the legal community, who will offer their support for the Supreme Court nominee. Among those scheduled to testify for Judiciary Committee Democrats are John Dean, the former White House counsel for President Richard Nixon, Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., and Aalayah Eastmond, a survivor of the February shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. The witnesses for the minority will speak about abortion, healthcare, executive power, gun violence, and abortion rights, among other issues, according to the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.Texas Obamacare suit ready for its first close up. A federal judge is expected to hear oral arguments starting Wednesday on a lawsuit brought by Texas and 19 states to strike down Obamacare. The hearing itself is on a preliminary injunction from the states that calls for federal enforcement of Obamacare to be halted while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts. The injunction would ensure that enforcement of the individual mandate penalty, which doesn?t go away until 2019, would stop. But It would also stop the federal government from enforcing requirements on Obamacare insurance plans like pre-existing condition protections. A collection of 17 states are defending Obamacare after the Justice Department decided earlier this year to not defend the law in court. A ruling is not expected to be delivered immediately after the hearing.Senate may consider opioid legislation this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Republicans had signed off on a legislative package, and that the bill may receive a vote as early as this week. Senate Democrats have not yet announced whether they will support the bill or whether they have any qualms with it. The legislation will likely include the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, which is meant to give the Postal Service more tools to stop shipments of illicit fentanyl from getting into the U.S.Immigrants dropping out of government aid program over fears of losing green card eligibility: Report. \u00a0Immigrants have begun dropping out of a federal aid program out of fear that relying on government support could hurt their chances of obtaining a green card following the Trump administration's reported plan to make those dependent ineligible for permanent residency, according to a report published Monday. Health providers who oversee WIC ? a federal nutrition program for pregnant women and babies ? in 18 states have noticed a decline of up to 20 percent in the number of people filing for help, Politico reported. Enrollment in the WIC program, begun in 1974, dropped from 7.4 million when Trump took office in January 2017 to 6.8 million in May, shortly after the administration's plans to change the public charge rule were leaked. However, the decline is also connected to improvement in the economy and a decrease in birth rates. Lawmakers search for answers on oversight of controversial drug discount program. Bipartisan lawmakers are looking to the Trump administration to boost oversight of a controversial drug discount program while the outlook for legislative fixes this year darkens. Lawmakers on both sides have been demanding greater transparency of the program, called 340B, as various legislation has stalled so far in Congress amid an intense lobbying war between pharma and hospital groups. So bipartisan lawmakers want the Trump administration to use existing power to clarify the requirements of the program, which Trump cut by $1.6 billion this year. While the administration has called on Congress for more authority, the leadership of the relevant committees believe it already isn't using its full power to oversee 340B. It wants the administration to do a better job of defining what the intent of the program is and the requirements for both participating hospitals and pharmaceutical companies providing the discounts.Healthcare costs cut into wage growth for workers, report says. Rising healthcare costs are taking a hit to take-home pay for U.S. workers, a new analysis released Tuesday found. The analysis from the Council for Affordable Health Coverage looks at how staggering healthcare costs have eclipsed wage growth. The average U.S. health expenditure was $10,348 per person in 2016. It also found that in 2001 employers allocated 41.9 percent of benefits to healthcare and 58 percent to retirement benefits. But by 2015, the split was in the other direction as 63.5 percent was for health benefits and 36 percent for retirement, the report found. ?Our analysis illustrates the escalation of health care premiums, which have absorbed most or all compensation growth in recent years for many workers ? leaving little or nothing to add to their paychecks,? said healthcare consultant Sylvester Schieber, one of the study?s co-authors. ?Wage gains have often been more than absorbed by higher employee premiums.?Pediatricians encourage kids to opt for flu shot over nasal spray. To protect against the flu season ahead, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children six months and older opt for the shot over the nasal spray. The AAP is prioritizing the shot because the nasal spray, known as FluMist, has a spotty track record of effectiveness. Still, the organization said the spray in children older than 2 was better than not being vaccinated at all, calling its effectiveness ?an unknown? this season. AAP had recommended against the nasal spray during the previous two flu seasons, though it can be popular with children who are afraid of needles. The last flu season resulted 179 deaths among children, a record. Eighty percent of those who died had not been vaccinated.

But where Leap appears to have gone off the rails is an assumption that customers weren't just frustrated by local buses, they ached for something fancier, and were willing to pay $6, or about triple a public bus ride, to get it.</p><p>The result: Swanky buses with organic snacks and drinks, plush seats, and - in keeping with fashion - distressed wood paneling. In short, d\u00e9cor that looked more like the lobby of Twitter than a bus.</p><p>It didn't work. The company had brushes with regulators and slow customer adoption. What's more, this start-up lobby on wheels quickly came to represent the well-heeled tech industry's disconnect from the rest of San Francisco.</p><p>Interestingly, privately owned mass transit is something of a San Francisco tradition, as this<url normalizedValue=\"http://missionlocal.org/2014/06/up-until-the-1970s-muni-had-competition/\">story in the local news website MissionLocal</url>explains. Even as late as the 1970s, jitneys, as they were called, were ferrying up to 7,000 people to and from downtown.</p><p>But there was one big difference: While Leap was targeting the moneyed set, the jitneys of old were mostly a working-class affair. Passengers usually spent 10 cents a ride. By comparison, Muni's adult fare was 25 cents and<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/TransitinSanFrancisco-CallwellChronologyweb.pdf\">jumped to 50 cents</url> in 1980.</p><p>At a recent auction, Leap's two buses fetched $11,100 and $12,100. The buyers were anonymous. But don't be shocked if they show up as moving art installations at next year's Burning Man event in Nevada.</p><p>Now for the fear: If 2014 was the year of the hacker, an optimist would say 2015 is the year companies are going to <url normalizedValue=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/hacking-for-security-and-getting-paid-for-it/\">the root of the problem</url>: Programming mistakes. A number of big tech outfits like Google and Facebook as well as start-ups and industry groups have begun significant efforts to root out programming mistakes, bugs, and other errors made in the industry's endless pursuit of improved technology.</p><p>Will they work? No doubt, there are still major weaknesses in critical infrastructure, and new technologies like the computerization of cars comes with risk. But in recognizing that hackers thrive on the imperfect work of people inside the industry, tech may finally be plugging the gaps that let the bad guys inside.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-22177168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYTBLG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H54-6X31-JBKK-517P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"438\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The News York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times Blogs <br/>(Bits)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>October 15, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>San Francisco (Calif)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Buses</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cyberattacks and Hackers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>San Francisco (Calif)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Start-ups</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Daily Report</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Security</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001624</classCode><className>STARTUPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DIDA</classCode><className>COMMUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000129</classCode><className>AUCTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001175</classCode><className>MOTORCOACHES &amp; BUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N485110CC</classCode><className>URBAN TRANSIT SYSTEMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001378</classCode><className>PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEVGRkVFM0VERTk5NERGMzk2QjAwMzczQTRFRkI1QkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk</classCode><className>Public Transportation</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX468</classCode><className>LAS VEGAS, NV, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS144</classCode><className>NEVADA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Commissioner Roger Goodell announcing each first round pick from the basement of his New York home. The league is set up cameras at the homes of nearly 60 prospects to capture this once in a lifetime experience. The draft kicks off tonight at 8:00 o'clock eastern. We'll be watching.</p><p>And then let's take a look at markets this morning investors eying initial jobless claims will cautiousness out there. They are due at 8:30 am eastern economists expect another 4.25 million people filing for unemployment last week. This would erase employment gains after the great recession and as you can see markets are fractionally high this morning going into that number.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning Leuthold Core ETF Chief Investment Officer and Co-Portfolio Manager Doug Ramsey is here with us this morning along with the King's College Business and Finance Program Chairman and Fox News Contributor Brian Brenberg Fox Business's Dagen McDowell and Forbes Media Chairman Former Presidential Candidate Steve Forbes. Great to see everybody, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me kick it off here with you Doug Ramsey, tell us what you're looking at in terms of markets and how you want to buy or allocate capital in an environment where we are seeing jobs really continue to see the jobless numbers move up with unemployment claims up today?</p><p>DOUG RAMSEY, LEUTHOLD CORE ETF CIO &amp; CO-PROTFOLIO MANAGER: I think it is too early to build up very aggressive equity exposure. I mean, just to put it in prospective I mean, this is pretty shocking to me that the NASDAQ 100, saw the big tech stocks at about half of that index is the 5 largest technology stocks, Microsoft, Facebook and the like. It is flat on the year.</p><p>I just find that astounding given the depth of the economic downturn we are going into. And I can't believe the most - the smartest way to play this downturn was to just buy the most expensive and trendiest stocks coming in to 2020 and hold them and you come out well.</p><p>So I still think there's another leg down whether we undercut the lows from a month ago today. I don't know but we really have inflicted a lot of damage on the large cap U.S. growth stocks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well it's hard to know where the growth is Brian Brenberg when you don't really know what kind of a recession we are going to have, how severe it would be in 2020 but we know it's coming.</p><p>PROFESSOR BRIAN BERNBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, in doubt you know so much is premised on the notion that the economy is going to bounce back or the question of when it's going to bounce back. We are seeing debate right now and even some fighting around when workers are going to be comfortable to come back online.</p><p>That's going to matter for companies, it's going matter for growth, earnings and equities, how do you view that uncertainty in light of where stocks will be later this year?</p><p>RAMSEY: There's no doubt it is going to be tricky to play that recovery because we will have a V when we get back to work here in a couple of months, I think. But the question is up to what level and I think - I think the government actions are probably going to limit the depth of the downturn but they could also prolong the downturn to some extent.</p><p>I mean, there's no question that there are some companies that we're going to be going bankrupt or even a mild economic downturn that are taking the stimulus just to take the money, now they are paying off employees over the next few months but then we'll take the remainder that did not have to be allocate to wages and we will see another round of them shutting down later this the summer.</p><p>So I think you're going to see a sharp drop in those unemployment claim numbers and then they are probably going to come back up you know after you know these first couple of rounds of stimulus expire.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So you're expecting a little bit of snapback. Let's squeeze in one more question real quick. Steve Forbes, go ahead.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN: Doug, what's your view on the politics in terms of the economic future in the markets. Looks like the Democrats might gain traction in the poll it's not going to hit the markets hard with the bad policies that are coming? When is the politics going to start to play in market pricing?</p><p>RAMSEY: You know it's very difficult to say. You know, right now, you know, obviously just enacted massive stimulus in a situation where we had a Republican in the White House and the Republicans in control of the Senate.</p><p>So I don't know. I mean, there are probably some prober's incentives out there in terms of reopening the economy if you are a state that's in dire fiscal straights. You know there might be an incentive and I hate to say this, but to prolong or push out the reopening in hopes of garnering more fiscal stimulus or Federal assistance down to the state municipality levels.</p><p>So that could certainly happen that would, again, cause this thing, maybe it won't be quite as deep because of all this stimulus but we could end up with more a - slower path to recovery because of all the intervention and, again, some of the political motivation involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That makes sense, Dagen, go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve, I just wanted you to respond to something you said that the behavior of some companies during this downturn and I will point right at the big banks. They are asking for the liberal hammer to come down on them.</p><p>In terms of how they turn their backs on small businesses and favor their biggest customers knowing dog on well what they were doing. So again, - they're asking for it. If Elizabeth Warren winds up the Vice President of the United States, they better look out and it's not just the big banks.</p><p>FORBES: Well, I think too if especially if Elizabeth Warren gets not Elizabeth Warren but Michelle Obama becomes the Vice Presidential Nominee, watch out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, it's a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve you got to drop that, Michelle Obama is not going back anywhere near Washington. I don't know why you keep bringing that up? You have got to let that one go. Michelle Obama can't way to stay away.</p><p>FORBES: Stay tune.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because somebody else brought it up this week again. Doug, thank you so much great to see you, sir.</p><p>RAMSEY: Thanks so much, all right take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Doug Ramsey joining us there. We're just getting started this morning a lot on tap coming up stay with us. Former Congressional budget Office Director Doug Akin is here and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's to allow states to declare bankruptcy.</p><p>Then in the 7:00 am hour we have got the CEO of Quest Diagnostics Steve Rokowski is here on \"First on Fox Business\" interview talking about the company's antibody testing that's real important in terms of getting back to work.</p><p>Hermetic Capital CEO Bill Browder here on markets and the disinformation campaign coming out of China about the COVID-19 pandemic. And the Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmidt is here live on his law suit against Beijing over the Coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>Then Former NFL Quarterback Joe Theismann is here on tonight's draft don't miss that. And then at 8:00 am eastern we're got Texas Congressman Michael Burgess on today's house vote. Allianz's Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed Elarian reacts to initial jobless claims.</p><p>And Former Pittsburgh Steelers Great and NFL on Fox Host Terry Bradshaw on the virtual NFL draft big show this morning. Don't miss a moment of it. Let's slip in a break. When we come back more economic relief details on the package that House lawmakers are set to vote on today and then send it over to the President's desk to sign into law back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, striking a stimulus bill. The House today poised to pass $484 billion relief plan. This bill passed in the Senate on Tuesday, it would add $321 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program. It would also grant money to economic disaster funds, hospitals as well as fund Coronavirus testing.</p><p>Meanwhile House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed off of her push to allow proxy voting of House members during the pandemic after speaking with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. They will instead form a bipartisan task force to look at the issue.</p><p>Joining us right now is Washington Examiner, Chief Political Correspondent Fox News Contributor Byron York. Byron it is great to see this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me get your reaction first to this House - the bill that the House is going to vote on today. And then interesting to see Nancy Pelosi pushing back, she was all in on that proxy voting until she and Kevin McCarthy had the meeting. Kevin apparently got her to back off on that.</p><p>YORK: Well, on the vote today it's just astonishing that there's going to be a vote today. Remember, that huge $2.2 billion aid package passed on was signed into law on March the 27th. That was a while back. It included that $349 billion for Paycheck Protection and at the time everybody knew it was not going to last long.</p><p>It was going to go really fast if it worked as plan which it did, so two weeks later it was all gone, money was all gone and Congress always knew they were going to have to replenish it. So they should have done that immediately on April 7th the administration sends a letter to Capitol Hill saying please let's put some more money in there, $251 billion.</p><p>And Nancy Pelosi has basically bought that for 2 weeks, I think for 2 weeks and 2 days into it and finally today she will allow a vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. I mean, why are they sitting on this like this when we know that businesses are on the brink? A lot of them will not make it. They will go bankrupt and yet they are still playing politics here.</p><p>In fact we have to mention also, Byron, that there's a group of Democrats right now that are once again investigating President Trump in the middle of all this they want to launch another investigation into his handling of Coronavirus. Do you think this is going to resonate with the people?</p><p>YORK: Well, it's too hard to say what will happen in November. But we do know that very early on in the Coronavirus crisis both the two lead employers in impeachment Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff both announced intentions to investigate President Trump.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi wants the creation of joint committee to investigate Coronavirus and they both want the creation of an outside commission, 9/11- style commission to investigate Coronavirus although if you go back to 9/11, we waited till things were over to start the investigation.</p><p>9/11 was of course September 11th, 2001, the 9/11 commission was created in November of 2002. It was not done when the heap of the World Trade Center was still smoking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I'm saying, and Brian. Brian, jump in here because that's what I'm alluding to. I mean, are people going to be upset with this nonstop investigation coming out of the skeptics of President Trump in the middle of a massive pandemic when we are looking at our economy shutdown and people's lives on the line?</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes, not only the nonstop investigation but Byron compounded on top of the delay in getting money to small businesses. I think small businesses look at Washington, D.C. and Pelosi in particular and they say why in the world did you delay there's nothing in this bill that you got that couldn't have been done earlier.</p><p>But my question for you is on the politics, does she pay a price? Do Democrats pay a price on this? It seems like that's not happening right now. Do we need to wait for that to play out?</p><p>YORK: That's a great question. We don't know the answer to that question. She has acted as if she has full confidence that she will not pay a price for this, that she will be not be screwed in the media in the midst of blocking this aid for small businesses.</p><p>She does kind of a publicity offensive goes on a late night show and shows of her incredibly expensive refrigerators which are fully stocked with expensive ice creams. It actually caused the Trump Campaign to call her Nancy Antoinette and say let them eat ice cream. Doing all these at a time when you're absolutely right, small businesses are absolutely struggling some of them are not going to make it. They need that money to cover the basic things like payroll and rent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, so you do think then that this could sway voters come November? This is what I was getting at as well. I mean, is this resonating are people going to be upset at this?</p><p>YORK: Well certainly the Trump Campaign hopes - some Republicans have seen Nancy Pelosi as a villain for a number of elections, sometimes it works and sometimes like in 2018 it does not work. This is a Presidential Election she is not--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron, it's great to get your insights this morning, Byron, thank you so much, we will see you good morning.</p><p>YORK: Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron York joining us there. Stay with us. We will be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, so ready to reopen. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is pushing full speed ahead on reopening his economy in Georgia giving the green light to nonessential businesses like hair salons, tattoo parlors, gyms to open as early as tomorrow. But President Trump is warning against hitting the restart button too soon, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I told the Governor of Georgia Brian Kemp that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities which are in violation of the phase 1 guidelines. At the same time he must do what he thinks it's right. They can wait a little bit longer because safety has to predominate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Georgia has more than 21,000 confirmed Coronavirus cases with death toll topping 800. Dagen McDowell in New York, this is a hard call. Everybody wants to get back to work, but you really have to be careful not to do it too soon because you know the number of Coronavirus will start to spike again?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right and not everybody quite frankly if you work in hair styling business, if you cut hair for a living and if you give manicures, if you have to be with a foot or too of an another individual and you don't have at least solid testing in a region, people don't want to go back to work.</p><p>And quite frankly a lot of the bosses and business owners who I'm in touch with or talking to, they are not comfortable bringing employees in to put them at risk until they are sure that there's been a dramatic, kind of the one thing is the first step is you need to see a dramatic drop in number of infections.</p><p>So it's going to be up to the business owners in part and also more dense metropolitan areas and urban areas you have got to think about how employees are coming to work? And you have to think of people crammed in mass transit onto busses, commute a train and even subways and that right now in many parts of the country is just not feasible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know it's more than that, even I mean, Steve Forbes, for those people who are making minimum wage they are looking forward to that $600 from the Care's Act. In some corners of the country some people are making more money staying home than they are at work and that program is in place until July 31st.</p><p>So you have got a worker like Dagen, said somebody working at a hair salon somebody working at a restaurant who is making more money to stay home than they are in the job, well, guess what, I don't think they are coming back until July 31st, until that program goes away. So that's another issue concerning this Paycheck Program, Steve.</p><p>FORBES: That's right when you get a $1000 a week for not working guess what you're going to stay on working at the end of July. Why they put the provision in there? I don't know but it's absolutely.</p><p>Another thing that which Dagen touched on is companies are going to want some kind of legal immunity in terms of wine down because you know there are going to be slew of law suits; somebody is going to sue about something.</p><p>So there is got to be some protection out there or this opening up is going to be slow down because people know that they are going to get hit with lawsuits even if they try to do everything possible to be responsible. And all you have to do is have one case by goalie the lawyers are going to be at the courthouse even if it's empty.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right there are a lot of layers to this. Let's take a break. When we come back we are looking at the fiscal implications of COVID-19. How Senate Majority Leader McConnell is thinking states should handle Coronavirus spending and that is coming up the debt now higher than the entire size of the economy, back in a minute.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS HOST, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, April 23rd. Your top stories right now 6:31 a.m. on the East coast. Coronavirus hitting jobs in America. Investors are awaiting initial jobless claims this morning. They will be released in two hours' time. 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Economists expect another four and a quarter million people filed for unemployment benefits in the last week.</p><p>Ahead of the number this morning markets are mixed. Dow Jones Industrial average down about 30 points. The S&amp;P is up a half a point, but the NASDAQ is lower, down nine and a quarter. Mixed market after a pretty good rally yesterday was fueled by a rise in the price of oil. At the close on Wall Street yesterday Dow Industrials were up 457 points. As you can see that was almost 2 percent. NASDAQ was up 232 points, almost 3 percent. And the S&amp;P 500 yesterday up 62 points, as you can see there, 2 and a quarter percent.</p><p>Oil prices adding to yesterday's gains this morning. We are looking at a rally this morning of about eleven percent. Crude oil now at $15.38 a barrel.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this, European indices are mixed as well. EU leaders meeting today to work on a united plan to revive the Euro Zone economy. Meanwhile Germany has approved the nearly eleven billion dollar aid package to help workers hit by the coronavirus pandemic as well as provide money for schools. The FQ100 is lower but the Quatre Quarante is higher and the DAX Index is also lower, down 19 points.</p><p>Asian markets mostly higher as you can see, with the exception of Shanghai. Japan's manufacturing and service sectors getting slammed in the month of April by the coronavirus. We had the manufacturing purchasing managers indexes out. They sank to levels not seen since April of 2009. The services PMI hitting the lowest level since the start of that survey.</p><p>Growing concern about a meat shortage that could leave supermarket shelves empty. Cheryl Casone with the details there. Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right, good morning to you Maria. Yeah, the coronavirus has impacted the nations biggest meat producer Tyson Foods. Company had to suspend operations at its plant in Waterloo Iowa, which accounts for nearly four percent of US pork processing capacity in this nation. More than one hundred eighty coronavirus infections have been linked to that plant and Tyson said it is not mass testing its 2800 workers there. Other meat producers, Smithfield Foods, JBS, they've already had to suspend operations over that same issue at some other plants. Tyson Foods up almost 1 percent in the pre-market.</p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is back. Back in charge at Amazon. The New York Times says the CEO, after stepping away for years to work mostly on longer term projects, is tackling the day to day challenges related to Amazon and its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Paper says that Bezos is weighing in on issues like soaring demand for Amazon products and testing for the company's workers. There is the stock up almost half a percent in the pre- market. It's actually been hitting some record high's amid the COVID-19 outbreak. 2,373 and change a share.</p><p>Alright, another company that's been doing okay during the pandemic, Netflix. They say they're not going to sell one billion dollars in bonds to raise money to produce more original shows. The news just one day after the company said that new subscribers doubled to a record of nearly sixteen million in the first quarter of this year. Netflix has been thriving as people spend more time at home amid worldwide lockdowns. A lot of their shows, Tiger King, Love Is Blind, and Ozark have had some pretty impressive numbers. Stock is slightly down more than half a percent in the pre- market, but Netflix shares up thirty percent so far this year.</p><p>And finally, Maria, SpaceX has launched another batch of its internet beaming satellites into the Earth's orbit. This sixtieth Starlight satellites rode on top of SpaceX's Falcon 9 on its eighty fourth flight. That makes the Falcon 9 the most flown US rocket, by the way, in use today. The satellites are going to allow the company to beam internet directly to terminals that consumers will set up in their homes or offices. The service expected to roll out across the United States and Canada, Maria, later this year. Because, as you know, our entire lives now, circle around the fact that we have strong Wi-Fi.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true. Yes. Good point. Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROME: Let's take a look at a live picture of Capitol Hill this morning, where later today the House is set to vote on phase 3.5., the coronavirus relief plan. Meanwhile, law makers are already talking about the next package likely giving state and local government emergency funding. That is the next focus. But a fight is still brewing between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and some of the nation's governors. McConnell making a strong statement yesterday in a radio interview. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY STATE SENATE, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I would certainly be in favor of allowing studies to use the bankruptcy route, if it saved some cities. My guess is their first choice would be for the Federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now, so they don't have to do that. That's not something I'm going to be in favor of.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the President of the American Action Forum, former Congressional Budget Office Director and former McCain campaign advisor, Douglas Holtz-Eakin. Doug it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DIRECTOR AND FORMER CAMPAIGN ADVISOR TO JOHN MCCAIN: Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you make of McConnell's statement there? So it's okay for the states to go bankrupt and just use it as cover.</p><p>HOLTS-EAKIN: Well some states, Illinois in particular, have extraordinary pension problems that have been around for a long long time, and it's been recognized that they're going to have to somehow deal with it and they simply haven't. It has nothing to do with the pandemic. Certainly, states and localities are suffering from the pandemic. The customers went away. The revenue went away for the businesses, but the sales taxes went away too. With all the unemployment the income taxes are going away, so there are some legitimate concerns about state and local governments. But borrowing money now to fix these pension problems has nothing to do with the pandemic. This is a problem that the states should take on if they had access to bankruptcy it would be a good way to work it out and have all the stakeholders share the pain. And I think it's a pretty common-sense observation by the majority leader.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what do you do though, in terms of all of the spending Doug? I mean Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that quote we need to spend what it takes to overcome the coronavirus crisis. And now we're talking about the amount of debt that this country faces. $22 trillion dollars, just about the size, even bigger, bigger, than the size of our economy.</p><p>HOLTS-EAKIN: Yes, this is an extraordinary moment. Certainly for someone like me. I never dreamed we'd see these kinds of numbers. We'll probably have a federal deficit of 4 trillion dollars this year, very easily. And the reality is that in this moment those monies are being used to keep the infrastructure of the US economy in place during the worst of this pandemic. To keep people attached to their employers, and those are dollars well spent. And I think the lesson here is two-fold. First, you shouldn't start a pandemic with a trillion dollar deficit because that's a trillion dollars we could have used every year to try to fight this nasty plague. In the aftermath of this, we are going to have to get the debt under control. Everyone's talked about, and played lip service to it, but no one's really done anything, and it's time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Brian Brenberg.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE KING'S COLLEGE: Yeah, Douglas, you know the longer that these stimulus bills go on, the more rounds that we get of this, the more likely that it is that they start to cover things that existed before the coronavirus pandemic ever arose. You're seeing that with the states now. They want to solve problems that really have nothing to do with coronavirus. You're seeing Congress talking about more and more regulations on business which ends up killing the growth that was driving the economy. It seems to me we need to stop these stimulus bills as soon as possible, because the longer they go on, the more they undermine the real strength of the economy.</p><p>HOLTS-EAKIN: Yeah, I think you make a good point. There are two different things. There is the act of preserving the businesses and their attachment to the workers through the lockdown and the worst of the plague. But then there's the what do you do afterwards. And afterwards, you go back to growth. The problem is not going to be stimulus, sort of throwing money at people. It's going to be getting people into their jobs. It's going to be making workplaces safe for people to interact. And if that's done, then the economy will take care of itself. The US economy has weathered enormous headwinds over the, you know, over 250 years that it's been around. It's become the largest, most powerful (INAUDIBLE) for a reason. You don't need to manage it from Washington. You need to get out of the way. The time for stimulus is past. We've done that job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOLTS-EAKIN: Now it's time to turn to just having the economy grow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Doug, it's Dagen McDowell. Is there any way taxes don't go up on the rich to pay for all this? Maybe two years from now, maybe four. Is there any way to avoid that?</p><p>HOLTS-EAKIN: I think if you roll the clock forward two, three, four years and you have any fiscal reality whatsoever, we're going to see revenue go up. So, the pressing question is, how? How do you raise the revenue? Do you do it in a punitive destructive fashion like the Sanders or Warren wealth taxes? Or do you do the things that we have always known are the right ways to raise revenue? Broaden bases, keep rates low, and let the economies growth drive the revenue up. I hope we see the latter. I'm certainly concerned about the former.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright Doug. Great to talk with you this morning. Thanks so much. Douglas Holts-Eakin joining us this morning on all of that debt.</p><p>HOLTS-EAKIN: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up. Reopening the economy, the medical implications of getting America going again. We're going to zero in on that when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have been talking this morning about reopening the economy. Georgia ready to be the first state to roll back restrictions on businesses. Allowing some to reopen to restart the stalled economy this week. Meanwhile the Mayor of Las Vegas also aiming to reopen some hotels and casinos, according to CDC guidelines. The debate now, how to pick up the economy while also making sure Americans health are in focus and people are safe. Joining me right now is former acting CDC Director and Robert Wood Johnson President and CEO, Doctor Richard Besser. Doctor Besser thanks very much for being here this morning. Good to see you. What are your thoughts in terms of reopening the economy right now?</p><p>DOCTOR RICHARD BESSER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION, FORMER ACTING CDC DIRECTOR: Well, you know, clearly everyone wants to get people back to work as soon as possible. From my perspective, it needs to be done slowly, carefully and based on the best public health science. These are still really early days, in terms of this pandemic. And if you go too fast, the concern is the health care system won't be able to handle the increased number of cases and we will be back in a worst position than we are right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think about the fall, and the conversation now that coronavirus may very well slow down in the summer, and be less pervasive. But it's coming back in the winter, and it may very well be even more significant and severe. This was initially said by the CDC head. What do you think about that?</p><p>BESSER: Well, I think it's one of those scenarios you have to plan for. It's predictable that in the late fall we'll see the flu season. It's predictable, when you have a virus that's been around for a long time you can say with some degree of certainty what's going to happen. Many respiratory viruses decrease in the warmer periods and then they come back when it gets cold again, when viruses are able to transmit more easily. We don't know yet with this one. And so being able to think, okay that's possible, is one thing to consider. Right now we're seeing in places that are seeing high activity, some slowing down, and that's a really good thing. But the consequences in terms of the economy are not sustainable for years. So, we have to figure out, how do we slow this down and then switch strategies to one where we are quickly identifying people are sick. We're isolating them so they can't spread disease further, but we're gradually letting people get back to work in safe ways, not the way we were three months ago, but in ways that continue to allow some social distancing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Doctor Besser, let me get your reaction to what went on at the CDC regarding these tests. It's a pretty scandalous story frankly. The CDC sends out 50 tests to the 50 states and then calls them back later and says wait don't use the tests, they're defective. One reason they were defective is, they were actually studying the coronavirus at the CDC in the same laboratory that they were actually looking at the tests and dealing with the tests. That's one of the reasons I was told for some of these tests to be defective. How does this happen at the CDC? You're the former acting director.</p><p>BESSER: You know, before I was the acting Director, I ran emergency preparedness and response for four years at CDC. I was never involved in any response where there were things that we tried that didn't work. Where there were mistakes that happened. And one of the things that's critical is that we are able to hear from the CDC every day so they can talk us through what they're seeing, what they're learning. Right now there's a lot that's being learned from other countries about what happens when you reopen. What ways may be the safest. We are seeing different things in different parts of this country and we have the opportunity to learn from those. In order to do that we should be hearing from CDC every day so they can explain what happened with that test and as we move forward, we--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, we-</p><p>BESSER: need more testing, what's necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we haven't heard much of an explanation about that. Real quick on these cats. Two cats in upstate New York. The first pets in the United States to reportedly test positive for coronavirus. You've got five tigers, three lions at the Bronx zoo also testing positive. Doctor Fauci said that there's no evidence of animals passing the virus to humans, but how can pet owners protect their pets? And why are we only seeing evidence in cats? Two cats now.</p><p>BESSER: Yes. I mean, most respiratory viruses are species specific. So, flu tends to stick to species. It doesn't mean that you're not going to find occasionally an animal that has it, but it doesn't mean that that's a route of transmission. So, I trust Doctor Fauci on these kinds of things. He's one of the most knowledgeable infectious disease doctors I've ever encountered. And so, continuing to look to make sure that things are safe is a good way to go, but I think pet owners can feel pretty comfortable that they're not going to get this from their pets, and that their pets aren't getting sick from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, Doctor Besser, thanks very much for joining us this morning. Good to hear from you. Doctor Richard Besser joining us there. Quick break and then America working together. How the US textile industry is helping to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Wait until you hear what's going on in the garment center in New York. Back in a moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT, DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: I brought in Kim Glass for the National Council of Textile Organizations as we speak. What's going to be over a million yards of fabric is being delivered, courtesy of UPS, from a factory, Owens &amp; Minor in North Carolina. It's going to go to cutters and sewers in Brooklyn, New York that are going to be making gowns for their brothers and sisters, doctors and nurses in the hospitals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Peter Navarro joining me on Sunday. Sunday Morning Futures highlighting how America is pulling together in this time of need. The US textile industry joining forces with the Trump administration to manufacture desperately needed personal protective equipment for medical workers on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis. Factories across the country like Haines and Fruit of the Loom retooling their supply chains overnight to produce millions of masks and gowns to keep medical workers safe in New York City and beyond. Joining me right now to talk more about that is the President and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations, Kim Glass. Kim, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. Peter Navarro had some great things to say about you and your participation and your collaboration with the White House. Tell us about this massive effort.</p><p>KIM GLASS, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF TEXTILE ORGANIZATIONS: Well we greatly appreciate being on today, and our partnership with Doctor Peter Navarro, who's been such a strong proponent of US manufacturing. You know, I'm sad Maria, I got a call the day after Easter from Doctor Navarro who had been in conversations with Mayor De Blasio in New York City about how to deploy the assets of New York and New York's garment district. Turn that into a cutting and sewing operation for gowns and very very very quickly we were able to mobilize out industry, Owens &amp; Minor, have fabric delivered, and now that fabric has been delivered to New York City and we are making gowns for local hospitals in the communities most in need.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is so fantastic. I mean, you're in charge of the largest advocacy group for the American textile industry. We've been, I know all about the garment industry in New York. Once a very profitable industry. Tell me about how the garment industry in New York is getting fired up again with this business, with this work.</p><p>GLASS: Well, it's an inspiring story. I mean many garment manufacturers in New York City have come forward to say how can we help in this crisis. What does New York City need right now? And the needs are enormous. Right now the priority need is actually isolation gowns that are used in hospital settings. So, a lot of these companies are retooling. Our industry that I represent, is providing fabrics and non wovens into New York City to be part of this effort.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Steve Forbes, real quick jump in here.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, EDITOR IN CHIEF, FORBES: Kim, Steve Forbes here. Looking at the US population over 300 million people. Do you have any idea, are there estimates yet of actually how many masks we need to produce in the next year or so since clearly even when this crisis abates, we're going to be wearing on numerous occasions. How many hundreds of millions of billions do we have to turn out for the next year or so?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point.</p><p>GLASS: You know, I don't the modeling on that, but it is a significant number. Many states have moved forward with executive orders mandating people wearing masks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GLASS: In grocery stores, in shopping centers, so it's going to be enormous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>GLASS: But I will say to you that we have overly relied on China for a lot of the importation for some of the protective equipment and our industry needs to be on the forefront of providing a solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Facemasks, the buying of facemasks increased eighteen-fold for the preceding four months before this pandemic from China. China was cornering the market. Kim, thanks very much for joining us this morning. Kim Glass. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I`m Carl Azuz at the CNN Center. We`re kicking off the month of April with the subjects of digital copyrights and clouds of pollen but before that we`re explaining a milestone involving the Dalai Lama. It has now been 60 years since the Buddhist leader fled from his homeland. That land is Tibet, officially it`s an autonomous region of China meaning Tibet has the authority to govern itself but is still ultimately ruled by China. The Dalai Lama is Tibet`s spiritual leader and he used to be its physical leader too. That changed in 1959 when the Dalai Lama left the region to live as a refugee in India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact today he jokes that he`s the longest guest of the Indian government. At 83 years old the monk has said age and exhaustion are the reasons why he`s cut back on travel recently and questions about who the next spiritual leader will be and how the position will be filled grow with each passing day. The current Dalai Lama is the 14th in Tibet`s history. The title`s traditionally given to the highest ranking leader among Tibetan Buddhists and millions of them see the Dalai Lama as a living god, but China`s communist government has strict controls over the practice of religion in the country.</p><p>It says the Dalai Lama must comply with Chinese laws and regulations and follow religious rituals and historical conventions. That`s why China wants to fully control the appointment of the next Dalai Lama. Many Tibetans living in the region and abroad are not willing to accept that and the current spiritual leader says if China chooses the next Dalai Lama, Tibetans will neither trust nor respect the person. So uncertainty clouds the future of this highly influential role.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s been 60 years since the Dalai Lama last set foot in the land of his birth, Tibet. He was identified as the new Tibetan leader by a delegation of monks when he was only a child and he was given full status as Dalai Lama at the tender age of 15. A process that was sped up as Chinese troops marched over the highlands into Tibet to take control in 1950. Chinese leader Mao Zedong offered autonomy but demanded obedience from people in the region.</p><p>The Dalai Lama took part in a series of peace talks with communist officials but then there was an unsuccessful armed uprising against the Chinese in Lhasa on March the 10th, 1959. And the same year this photo was taken showing the Dalai Lama on his throne in Lhasa, he fled across the Himalayas into India. Since then the Dalai Lama has lived in exile in northern India. In 1989 he won a Nobel Peace Prize for his dedication to the non-violent liberation of Tibet. The Dalai Lama has always said he is only ever wanted enough autonomy to protect traditional Buddhist culture in Tibet.</p><p>Chinese authorities insist he is a separatist trying to establish an independent Tibet calling him a wolf in monks robes. Beijing says the Tibetan region has been China`s territory for centuries and denies any oppression since 1950, saying living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. In 2008, there were days of demonstrations which turned into riots in Lhasa. That lead to a crackdown in which Chinese state media says 20 people were killed. Tibetan exiles say it was more like 150. In 2011, the Dalai Lama announced plans to devolve his political power to an elected leader of the Tibetan Exile Movement.</p><p>A few years later in an interview with CNN`s Christiane Amanpour he explained.</p><p>CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: - - or might you be the last Dalai Lama?</p><p>DALAI LAMA: Possible. (inaudible). I feel. I personally feel better. The people should take full responsibility.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Beijing says any new Dalai Lama chosen in Tibet would have to be approved by the communist government leading the current Dalai Lama to speculate his successor could come from outside of China. In 2016 CNN`s Matt Rivers was one in a group of journalists who were able to make a rare visit to Tibet on a state controlled trip. Buddhism is one of five officially recognized religions in China but under tight government supervision and surveillance and that is very much the case for the 6 to 8 million Tibetan Buddhists, many who have left the region.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AZUZ: 10 Second Trivia. Which of these nations is not currently a member of the European Union? Hungary, United Kingdom, Lithuania, or Switzerland. Switzerland isn`t a member of the European Union though it does have trade agreements and ties with the EU.</p><p>About a week and a half ago we told you how the European Union had hit Google with another fine for hindering competition. Well technology companies including Google could wind up owing more money to the EU under its new copyright rules. When it comes to books, songs, art and movies, a copyright gives a person or a business permission to make copies of the work or publish and sell it. Media companies and artists have said the EU needs to update its copyright protections for the internet age and make sure the copyright holders are fairly paid for their content. But critics of the EU rules say they`re too vague and they could lead technology companies to block too much content in an effort to stay out of trouble. European officials say it could take two years to implement the rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The EU is poised to deliver a major blow against big tech with new measures that could place an enormous responsibility on tech platforms when it comes to taking down copyrighted material. And this isn`t the first time that the EU has been on the forefront of regulating big tech whether it`s data protection, anti-trust violations, tax violations, on all those the EU has led the charge on cracking down on tech companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: - - and this is illegal under EU anti-trust rules.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But critics are arguing that these new regulations are not just a blow to big tech but also to internet freedom by potentially chilling the average user`s ability to create and post content. The rule is called the European Union Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market and it aims to protect copyrighted content on the internet. Sounds good in theory but various parts of the directive are proving to be controversial. One of those components would make online platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and ReadIt all liable for copyright infringement on their platforms.</p><p>Now this provision is extremely vague so no one knows exactly what it will look like in practice. But what it`s suggesting is that online platforms use content recognition technologies to examine every single piece of content that`s uploaded to their sites. That is an enormous task. For YouTube alone, that means filtering the more than 500 hours of new video uploaded to the site every minute and it`s not just video. Even memes could potentially get these sites into legal trouble since the images used in memes are often sourced from copyrighted content.</p><p>Supporters of the new law point out that memes are actually protected because a meme is a parody which the directive still permits. But critics argue that its unlikely that these automated content filters are going to be able to tell the difference between a copyright infringement case and a parody case which could mean that a lot of content used legally may get caught in the crossfire. And that`s not just theoretical, it happens all the time. In 2016 ironically enough, YouTube`s content filter mistakenly took down a speech made by the EU Trade Commissioner and that video was even uploaded by a member of the European parliament.</p><p>So the goal of this provision is to make sure that the original copyright holders are paid their fair share. But for a law that`s meant to shift some power away from big tech, it might actually end up helping them. That`s because right now building an automated content filter requires a lot of capital. Capital that only big tech companies might have access to. Google alone has spent more than $100 million for YouTube`s current content ID filter. A filter that still mislabels videos all the time.</p><p>For those platforms that don`t have $100 million to spend, the consequences of the rule change are unclear but what is clear is that companies like Google already have an upper hand in this space. So we don`t know how exactly this will all play out but what we do know is that this has the potential to change the internet as we know it around the world, not just in Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AZUZ: `Tis the season for some \"sneezein`\". If you find pollen \"upollen\" you`re going to hate this. This video was shot from a helicopter passing over the woods. The clouds you see are the pollen, the masses of yellow fertilizing grains that the helicopter is blasting off the pine trees. Those of you with allergies are thinking fly higher.</p><p>This is a shot recently in Georgia where allergy levels are high and that`s not helped by this low flying chopper. If your eyes are \"waterin`\", that 10 out of 10 is a bust. Allergic sinuses and noses all flare up, in a cloud of dust, it`s unjust. In a gust, a tissue for us is a must. Springtime everywhere, gets in your hair and coats your throat in crust. You can trust that when the rain comes, your head becomes aware. It grounds the pollen down, it`s bound to finally clear the air. I`m Carl Azuz taking a deep breath on CNN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019040101cbh06</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSK-R5F1-JB20-G09S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 1, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Dalai Lama</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Buddhist</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mao Zedong</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lhasa, China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tibet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Autonomous</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>European Union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Copyright</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pollen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Helicopter</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

I`m Carl Azuz at the CNN Center. We`re kicking off the month of April with the subjects of digital copyrights and clouds of pollen but before that we`re explaining a milestone involving the Dalai Lama. It has now been 60 years since the Buddhist leader fled from his homeland. That land is Tibet, officially it`s an autonomous region of China meaning Tibet has the authority to govern itself but is still ultimately ruled by China. The Dalai Lama is Tibet`s spiritual leader and he used to be its physical leader too. That changed in 1959 when the Dalai Lama left the region to live as a refugee in India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact today he jokes that he`s the longest guest of the Indian government. At 83 years old the monk has said age and exhaustion are the reasons why he`s cut back on travel recently and questions about who the next spiritual leader will be and how the position will be filled grow with each passing day. The current Dalai Lama is the 14th in Tibet`s history. The title`s traditionally given to the highest ranking leader among Tibetan Buddhists and millions of them see the Dalai Lama as a living god, but China`s communist government has strict controls over the practice of religion in the country.</p><p>It says the Dalai Lama must comply with Chinese laws and regulations and follow religious rituals and historical conventions. That`s why China wants to fully control the appointment of the next Dalai Lama. Many Tibetans living in the region and abroad are not willing to accept that and the current spiritual leader says if China chooses the next Dalai Lama, Tibetans will neither trust nor respect the person. So uncertainty clouds the future of this highly influential role.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s been 60 years since the Dalai Lama last set foot in the land of his birth, Tibet. He was identified as the new Tibetan leader by a delegation of monks when he was only a child and he was given full status as Dalai Lama at the tender age of 15. A process that was sped up as Chinese troops marched over the highlands into Tibet to take control in 1950. Chinese leader Mao Zedong offered autonomy but demanded obedience from people in the region.</p><p>The Dalai Lama took part in a series of peace talks with communist officials but then there was an unsuccessful armed uprising against the Chinese in Lhasa on March the 10th, 1959. And the same year this photo was taken showing the Dalai Lama on his throne in Lhasa, he fled across the Himalayas into India. Since then the Dalai Lama has lived in exile in northern India. In 1989 he won a Nobel Peace Prize for his dedication to the non-violent liberation of Tibet. The Dalai Lama has always said he is only ever wanted enough autonomy to protect traditional Buddhist culture in Tibet.</p><p>Chinese authorities insist he is a separatist trying to establish an independent Tibet calling him a wolf in monks robes. Beijing says the Tibetan region has been China`s territory for centuries and denies any oppression since 1950, saying living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. In 2008, there were days of demonstrations which turned into riots in Lhasa. That lead to a crackdown in which Chinese state media says 20 people were killed. Tibetan exiles say it was more like 150. In 2011, the Dalai Lama announced plans to devolve his political power to an elected leader of the Tibetan Exile Movement.</p><p>A few years later in an interview with CNN`s Christiane Amanpour he explained.</p><p>CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: - - or might you be the last Dalai Lama?</p><p>DALAI LAMA: Possible. (inaudible). I feel. I personally feel better. The people should take full responsibility.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Beijing says any new Dalai Lama chosen in Tibet would have to be approved by the communist government leading the current Dalai Lama to speculate his successor could come from outside of China. In 2016 CNN`s Matt Rivers was one in a group of journalists who were able to make a rare visit to Tibet on a state controlled trip. Buddhism is one of five officially recognized religions in China but under tight government supervision and surveillance and that is very much the case for the 6 to 8 million Tibetan Buddhists, many who have left the region.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AZUZ: 10 Second Trivia. Which of these nations is not currently a member of the European Union? Hungary, United Kingdom, Lithuania, or Switzerland. Switzerland isn`t a member of the European Union though it does have trade agreements and ties with the EU.</p><p>About a week and a half ago we told you how the European Union had hit Google with another fine for hindering competition. Well technology companies including Google could wind up owing more money to the EU under its new copyright rules. When it comes to books, songs, art and movies, a copyright gives a person or a business permission to make copies of the work or publish and sell it. Media companies and artists have said the EU needs to update its copyright protections for the internet age and make sure the copyright holders are fairly paid for their content. But critics of the EU rules say they`re too vague and they could lead technology companies to block too much content in an effort to stay out of trouble. European officials say it could take two years to implement the rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The EU is poised to deliver a major blow against big tech with new measures that could place an enormous responsibility on tech platforms when it comes to taking down copyrighted material. And this isn`t the first time that the EU has been on the forefront of regulating big tech whether it`s data protection, anti-trust violations, tax violations, on all those the EU has led the charge on cracking down on tech companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: - - and this is illegal under EU anti-trust rules.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But critics are arguing that these new regulations are not just a blow to big tech but also to internet freedom by potentially chilling the average user`s ability to create and post content. The rule is called the European Union Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market and it aims to protect copyrighted content on the internet. Sounds good in theory but various parts of the directive are proving to be controversial. One of those components would make online platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and ReadIt all liable for copyright infringement on their platforms.</p><p>Now this provision is extremely vague so no one knows exactly what it will look like in practice. But what it`s suggesting is that online platforms use content recognition technologies to examine every single piece of content that`s uploaded to their sites. That is an enormous task. For YouTube alone, that means filtering the more than 500 hours of new video uploaded to the site every minute and it`s not just video. Even memes could potentially get these sites into legal trouble since the images used in memes are often sourced from copyrighted content.</p><p>Supporters of the new law point out that memes are actually protected because a meme is a parody which the directive still permits. But critics argue that its unlikely that these automated content filters are going to be able to tell the difference between a copyright infringement case and a parody case which could mean that a lot of content used legally may get caught in the crossfire. And that`s not just theoretical, it happens all the time. In 2016 ironically enough, YouTube`s content filter mistakenly took down a speech made by the EU Trade Commissioner and that video was even uploaded by a member of the European parliament.</p><p>So the goal of this provision is to make sure that the original copyright holders are paid their fair share. But for a law that`s meant to shift some power away from big tech, it might actually end up helping them. That`s because right now building an automated content filter requires a lot of capital. Capital that only big tech companies might have access to. Google alone has spent more than $100 million for YouTube`s current content ID filter. A filter that still mislabels videos all the time.</p><p>For those platforms that don`t have $100 million to spend, the consequences of the rule change are unclear but what is clear is that companies like Google already have an upper hand in this space. So we don`t know how exactly this will all play out but what we do know is that this has the potential to change the internet as we know it around the world, not just in Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AZUZ: `Tis the season for some \"sneezein`\". If you find pollen \"upollen\" you`re going to hate this. This video was shot from a helicopter passing over the woods. The clouds you see are the pollen, the masses of yellow fertilizing grains that the helicopter is blasting off the pine trees. Those of you with allergies are thinking fly higher.</p><p>This is a shot recently in Georgia where allergy levels are high and that`s not helped by this low flying chopper. If your eyes are \"waterin`\", that 10 out of 10 is a bust. Allergic sinuses and noses all flare up, in a cloud of dust, it`s unjust. In a gust, a tissue for us is a must. Springtime everywhere, gets in your hair and coats your throat in crust. You can trust that when the rain comes, your head becomes aware. It grounds the pollen down, it`s bound to finally clear the air. I`m Carl Azuz taking a deep breath on CNN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019033101cbh06</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSK-R5F1-JB20-G09R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 31, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Dalai Lama</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Buddhist</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mao Zedong</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lhasa, China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tibet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Autonomous</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>European Union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Copyright</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pollen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Helicopter</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Last month, Black Lives Matter Toronto staged a sit-in during the city's gay pride march, which the group had been invited to join as an honored guest. The protesters brandished a list of demands, ranging from increased funding and support for black and South Asian groups at Pride to the removal of police floats and booths from future events. But the sit-in triggered something more: a fledgling conversation about race and racism that Canadians have been avoiding for years. </p><p>                     Canada is hailed for its tolerance but is it ready to confront its racism?                   </p><p>                   How black is Silicon Valley?                   </p><p>Following the live-streaming of Philando Castile's police shooting death on Facebook, the complexity of technology's interplay with social justice is only beginning to be calculated. Julia Carrie Wong considers whether big tech's solidarity with Black Lives Matter may be all about branding. While technology may play a crucial role in the movement for black lives, the companies involved - \"with their notoriously poor records of hiring black workers - are frequently cited as part of the problem of racism in the US, not the solution\". </p><p>                     Big tech stands with Black Lives Matter, but solidarity may be all about branding                   </p><p>                   How HSBC ducked US prosecution                   </p><p>A congressional report published on Monday shows that the UK chancellor, George Osborne, and British financial regulators urged their US counterparts to not pursue criminal charges against the UK bank because it could lead to 'global financial disaster'. Instead of prosecution, HSBC agreed to pay a record $1.92bn fine. In New York yesterday, Osborne sought to reassure Wall Street that post-Brexit, the UK won't become \"Little Britain\" ; meanwhile, US stocks closed at a record high.</p><p>HSBC escaped US money-laundering charges after UK intervention                                        </p><p>                   Naked in Hull                   </p><p>The artist Spencer Tunick has spent more than two decades photographing crowds of naked strangers.

and such was the clever way the content was presented, people found it hard to distinguish between the truth and the fake.</p><p>During the last US Presidential election, this included fake stories about brutal inter-racial crimes, and a sickening article about a paedophile ring that led a man to turn up at a pizza restaurant armed with a gun, looking to rescue the children he believed were being held there.</p><p>Such fake stories are bad at any time, but have the potential to cause even more damage during election campaigns.</p><p>Increasingly, people of all ages get their information from social media.\u00a0</p><p>Rather than reading a newspaper or website, or listening to radio or television, they receive it in bitesize pieces shared online, including through advertising.</p><p>On Facebook, advertisers can target you through your newsfeed, so that their messages are mixed in with those from your friends.\u00a0</p><p>You have no control over this and cannot block advertising from your Facebook newsfeed.</p><p>Communications agencies are gathering vast quantities of data to build up profiles on millions of Facebook users so that they know exactly who to target and what the message needs to say to have the greatest impact.</p><p>Some might say this is just advertising, but having a personalised message sent to your smartphone is very different to seeing a TV advert.</p><p>Facebook gathers data about everything we do on their website, and track us when we are elsewhere on the internet.</p><p>Academics believe that an analysis of all the things you have liked on Facebook gives a more accurate prediction of your personality than you would get from your closest friend.</p><p>And Facebook has failed to keep this data safe.</p><p>They have made it far too easy for political consultancies, such as the disgraced Cambridge Analytica, to scrape this data for their campaigns.</p><p>These techniques of data profiling and targeting using Facebook advertising tools have also been used by agencies in Russia to target voters in elections in other nations, which is against the law.\u00a0</p><p>They directly targeted 150 million Americans with political adverts during the 2016 Presidential election.</p><p>Our inquiry has heard evidence of their attempts to interfere in the Brexit referendum, using both Facebook and Twitter, and in elections in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>In France in 2017, Facebook was asked to investigate suspicious activity on its site linked to the presidential election and ended up deleting 30,000 fake accounts.</p><p>These Russian campaigns were run without Facebook spotting their activity. Users didn't spot them because there was no requirement for the advertisers to show their real identity.\u00a0</p><p>So an advert run from St Petersburg could be made to look like a message from a community group where you live.</p><p>The tech companies have made money out of the targeting techniques they have developed to help advertisers reach us. And these tools have been made available to bad actors - and used to spread disinformation.</p><p>That is why we have to act to safeguard our democracy.</p><p>In our report we say firms such as Facebook should have a legal obligation to act against known sources of content that could mislead and cause harm.\u00a0</p><p>There needs to be real transparency, so we know who is targeting us and where they are doing it from.</p><p>During election periods, political advertising should only be allowed by registered campaigns. In financial services, businesses contribute to the administration of consumer protection regulation.\u00a0</p><p>Similarly, the big tech firms should help the costs of the Information Commissioner's Office, which is responsible for enforcing our data protection laws.</p><p>They should also contribute through a levy to fund more media literacy programmes in schools, something they have started to do but could easily afford to support far more.</p><p>Technology is changing the world fast. We must act now to keep up and protect democracy.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-45994121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SX4-X321-F021-61D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><timeReceived>12:19 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) stomped on the Long Island City grave of Amazon HQ2 on Friday night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a cold warehouse adorned with graffiti on the concrete walls, the Massachusetts Democrat rallied in Queens to assail the big tech companies and their influence in the borough where Amazon had intended to build half of its second headquarters before abruptly reversing itself in the face of rising local and national resistance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWe have these giant tech companies that think they rule the earth,\u201d Warren said before a diverse crowd huddled in their coats. \u201cThey think they can come to towns, cities, states and bully everyone into doing what they want. They think they can scoop up all their personal data and sell it to whoever they want for whatever purposes. They think they can run their business to just roll right over every small business, every entrepreneur, every start-up that might threaten their position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the boldest and most aggressive plan so far,\u201d Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute who is writing a book on monopoly power in the 20th century, told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for democracy and it\u2019s a practical smart plan that would actually work.\u201d</p><p>That moment, which came weeks after Amazon, citing \u201cstate and local politicians\u201d who opposed the move, scuttled their plans, led to Warren declaring that \u201cit is time to break up America\u2019s tech companies.\u201d</p><p>The company\u2019s reversal left Gov. Andrew Cuomo raging at his fellow Democrats in the state, after he\u2019d negotiated behind closed doors along with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring the tech titan and 25,000 jobs to the Queens neighborhood just across the river from Manhattan.</p><p>\u201cAmazon dances around the country and says \u2018sector three what can you offer\u2019\u201d she said later, in response to an audience question, drawing a comparison between Amazon and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Hunger Games</emphasis>, the popular book and film series that hinges on a televised fight to the death.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Warren had introduced her plan to break up major tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. It\u2019s yet another policy proposal she has introduced in the Democratic presidential primary, adding to a set of ideas that have galvanized the terms of the debate on the left.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five years ago, Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn\u2019t exist,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said in a Medium post discussing her proposal. \u201cNow they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It\u2019s a great story \u2014 but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.\u201d</p><p>Charging that these companies have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren proposed two concrete measures to ameliorate the tech sector and allow for more competition therein.</p><p>First, Warren said that she intends to pass legislation that would designate a new category for companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more that \u201coffer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties.\u201d They would be deemed \u201cplatform utilities,\u201d and would be prevented from both owning the platform and any of its participants and also would have to \u201cmeet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users.\u201d The platform utilities would also not be permitted to share or transfer data to third parties.</p><p>Her plan would create a separate designation for companies with annual revenue of between $90 million and $25 billion, which would be required to meet the same standards standard but would not have to separate from a participant on the platform.</p><p>As a means of enforcement, Warren suggests that federal regulators, state attorneys general or private parties would have the right to sue and if a company is found to have violated these requirements, they would have to pay a fine of five percent in annual revenue. Some of the examples she provides that would turn into platform utilities include the Amazon Marketplace, Google\u2019s ad exchange and Google Search.</p><p>Additionally, Warren proposed that appointed regulators would work to undo recent mergers including Amazon\u2019s ownership of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook\u2019s ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram and Google\u2019s ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>\u201cUnwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market \u2014 which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy,\u201d she wrote.</p><p>The announcement comes as other contenders for the Democratic nomination have entertained the idea of reining in the influence of these companies, fuelled by a series of revelations about Facebook\u2019s violations of consumer privacy protections. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), another presidential candidate, pointedly questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a 2018 hearing on this very topic.</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has worked on a series of bills that focus on oversight with big tech companies and even emphasized this approach in her launch speech. Sen.

Our nation continues to face a multitude of serious and evolving threats ranging from homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) to cyber criminals to hostile foreign intelligence services and operatives. Keeping pace with these threats is a significant challenge for the FBI. Our adversariesterrorists, foreign intelligence services, and criminalstake advantage of modern technology to hide their communications; recruit followers; and plan and encourage espionage, cyber-attacks, or terrorism to disperse information on different methods to attack the U.S. homeland, and to facilitate other illegal activities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cyber Threats</p><p>Virtually every national security threat and crime problem the FBI faces is cyber-based or facilitated. We face threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, organized cyber syndicates, and terrorists. On a daily basis, these actors seek to steal our state secrets, our trade secrets, our technology, and our ideasthings of incredible value to all of us and of great importance to the conduct of our government business and our national security. They seek to hold our critical infrastructure at risk and to harm our economy.</p><p>The FBI is investigating a wider-than-ever range of threat actors, from transnational organized cybercrime to nation-state adversaries to terrorists using social medial for recruiting and radicalization purposes. The scale, scope, speed, and impact of cyber threats is constantly evolving, which may explain why we are also seeing a blending of threats, such as nation state adversaries using criminal actors as proxies to mask their activities. The frequency and severity of malicious cyber activity on our nation's networks have increased dramatically in the past decade when measured by the amount of corporate data stolen or deleted, the volume of personally identifiable information compromised, or the remediation costs incurred by U.S. victims. Companies that hold large amounts of Personally identifiable information (PII) are susceptible to loss of American's personal data to criminal organizations, terrorists, and nation-state cyber actors. Hotel chains, airlines, health care companies, credit bureaus, government agencies, and cleared defense contractors have previously been victims of PII theft.</p><p>Cyber Criminal Trends</p><p>Cyber threats are not only increasing in size and scope, but are also becoming increasingly difficult and resource-intensive to investigate. Cyber criminals often operate through online forums, selling illicit goods and services, including tools that lower the barrier to entry for aspiring criminals and that can be used to facilitate malicious cyber activity. These criminals have also increased the sophistication of their schemes, which are more difficult to detect and more resilient to disruption than ever. In addition, whether located at home or abroad, many cyber actors are obfuscating their identities and obscuring their activity by using combinations of leased and compromised infrastructure in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Such tactics make coordination with all of our partners, including international law enforcement partners, essential.</p><p>Increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques are also enabling actors to stealthily obtain data from victims or re-purpose victim computers into cryptocurrency-mining botnets. Botnets used by cyber criminals have been responsible for billions of dollars in damages over the past several years. The widespread availability of malicious software (malware) that can create botnets allows individuals to leverage the combined bandwidth of thousands, if not millions, of compromised computers, servers, or network-ready devices to disrupt the day-to-day activities of governments, businesses, and individual Americans.</p><p>Cyber threat actors are conducting ransomware attacks against U.S. systems, encrypting data and rendering systems unusablethereby victimizing individuals, businesses, and even emergency service and public health providers. Our threat reporting has demonstrated that ransomware attacks are becoming more targeted, sophisticated, and costly, even as the overall frequency of ransomware attacks is holding steady or declining. Since early 2018, the incidence of broad, indiscriminate ransomware campaigns has sharply declined, while losses from ransomware attacks have increased significantly. Allow me to restate that for emphasis: while the number of reported attacks has gone down, the effects and impacts of the attacks are going up. Meanwhile, state and local governments have been particularly visible targets for ransomware attacks. However, ransomware campaigns have also heavily impacted health care organizations, industrial companies, and the transportation sector.</p><p>Business email compromise (BEC) remains a pervasive threat due to its low barrier of entry and maturing social engineering techniques, and cyber criminals almost certainly will continue to use BEC to target industries indiscriminately. BEC threat actors have widened their money laundering networks, including domestic transfers prior to laundering the money overseas, which presents challenges and opportunities for countering this type of fraud. Readily available online personal and business information enhances the reconnaissance capability of actors, providing BEC threat actors with more credible social engineering lures. Spoofed domains are seen in the majority of BEC attempts, and likely will remain a technique used by cyber actors. BEC attacks combining social engineering with network intrusions demonstrate an increase in attack sophistication that can use keyloggers or other malware to identify potential targets, such as business vendors, as well as sell access to or further exploit compromised systems.</p><p>Actors have learned that BEC is effective and are adapting lures to target human resources departments for PII, such as W-2 tax forms to commit stolen identity return fraud, rather than requesting wire transfers. Additionally, industry partners have observed BEC actors increasingly instruct victims to send automated clearinghouse transfers to prepaid cards in the initial laundering phase.</p><p>Nation State Activities: China</p><p>While several nation-states pose a cyber threat to U.S. interests, no other country presents a broader and more comprehensive threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than the People's Republic of China (PRC) under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The threat takes many different forms. Beijing employs a whole-of-government approach to its intelligence collection strategy. While cyber network operations remain a primary and possibly increasing collection tool, the CCP also relies on techniques such as intellectual property theft, purchases of U.S. corporations, and physical and property theft to acquire U.S. data.</p><p>For example, less than a month ago, on February 10, the Department of Justice (DOJ), in coordination with the FBI, publicly unsealed an indictment against four Chinese cyber actors who allegedly acted as agents of the People's Republic of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). All four actors are currently located in China. The alleged crimes occurred between May 13, 2017 and July 30, 2017. The actors targeted a software vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to Equifax's network and ultimately obtain PII for 145 million American citizens, as well as the intellectual property of the U.S. company.</p><p>The indictment alleges the four individuals named therein reside in Beijing, China and are members of the 54th Research Institute. The 54th Research Institute is a component of the PLA. The indicted individuals gained unauthorized access, via a software vulnerability, to Equifax's internal network, where they allegedly ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's systems and obtained the names, birth dates, and social security numbers for approximately half of all adult American citizens. The defendants also took deliberate steps to evade detection in the system, including routing traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, using encrypted channels in order to blend in normal traffic within Equifax's network, and wiping log files on a daily basis to try to eliminate records of their activity.</p><p>DOJ, the FBI, and our partners will continue to work tirelessly to combat this threat posed by the Chinese government against our nation. Although the PRC continues to modify the ways in which it conducts nefarious cyber activity, including through working with criminal hackers, the cases prosecuted by the DOJ in partnership with the FBI reflect an increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute criminal conduct to the individuals and nation states involved. We will be relentless in our pursuit of such malicious activity against our citizens and our industry.</p><p>There are other risks. Chinese companies are increasingly acquiring or launching social media applications not housed in mainland China for the global consumer market. These applications generate big data and collect PII, such as biometric information, contact lists, location data, log data, communication metadata, content (text and photographic), bank and credit card details, and financial transactions of U.S. persons. The associated user agreements and privacy policies typically obfuscate the companies' data handling responsibilities or directly state any and all data can be transferred to other locations and associated entities to include the Chinese parent company. These data handling policies create a risk for U.S. big data and PII to be targeted and exploited by PRC actors. More broadly, consumers should be aware of the privacy implications of any application they install, especially applications from foreign countries with weak data protection laws.</p><p>In June 2017, the PRC introduced a new national cyber security law that requires foreign firms to store data locally and submit to data surveillance measures. Although implementing regulations are still being drafted, Beijing could likely use these authorities and policies to compel access to U.S. commercial and sensitive personal data, including sensitive information stored or transmitted through Chinese systems. U.S.-based subsidiaries of Chinese corporations and entities, or organizations in the U.S. partnering on cooperative research and development efforts, are among the entities affected by this law. The law has raised fears by those concerned with Beijing's control of sensitive company information and increased opportunity to steal intellectual property.</p><p>Threats Exposing Vulnerabilities on Critical Infrastructure Networks and the Public</p><p>Virtually all companies collect and maintain sensitive data either of their own employees or customer information. The overall trend of digitizing data for ease of use or access makes many different industries vulnerable to data breaches. For instance, over recent years the health care industry has moved to centralizing patient data and using Internet-connected devices,which has increased the sector's potential attack surface. Cyber actors benefit from this target-rich environment as the passage of patient data between health care departments and networks is critical to their care, but often levels of cybersecurity vary. Ransomware, denial of service attacks, and data breaches can all impede the ability to provide basic patient care and privacy for protected health information (PHI). Electronic medical records typically contain PII, which, combined with medical record information, is known as PHI.</p><p>It is also highly likely cyber actors target the IT sector to access their customers' data and networks. IT sector entities manage and store valuable customer data and have unique, privileged access to client networks. These vital services create an environment where IT sector networks are compromised as a means for malicious cyber actors to reach a final target for fraud, hacktivism, and counterintelligence purposes.</p><p>Entertainment and media companies use Internet-enabled systems for marketing, merchandising, ticketing, and reservations. As a result, owners and operators manage and protect databases of customer and employee data, including personal, financial, and credit card information. Since at least 2015, nation-state and criminal cyber actors have conducted computer network exploitation against the subsector likely to gain unauthorized access to non-public information, although the extent of the access in each case remains unclear.</p><p>Efforts Used to Combat, Prevent, and Investigate Hacking or the Misuse of this Data</p><p>In order to combat cyber threats, the FBI has taken a whole-of-society approach. We actively engage with our private sector partners through the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA), which is a non-profit partnership between private industry, government and academia all working together to identify and disrupt cyber-crime. We recently hosted a ransomware-focused summit, with incident response companies, representatives from the legal and insurance industries as well as other government entities, where we discussed collaborative efforts to address the threats.</p><p>The FBI also partners with the National Defense Cyber Alliance (NDCA), which is a non-profit organization bringing together the U.S. Intelligence Community and cleared defense contractor community to improve the security of their networks. Similar to how the NCFTA supports the financial/retail sector against criminal threats, the NDCA is designed to support the defense industrial base against national security threats.</p><p>Through undercover operations and confidential human sources, we are targeting and shutting down dark-net and Clearnet criminal forums where identities are sold and where cyber criminals gather to plan their next attack. We are actively engaging with our international partners through our Cyber Assistant Legal Attach program, through our annual FBI-sponsored International Task Force, and through our participation in the FBI-led International Cyber Crime Operations Summit, as well as the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group Cyber Crime Working Group.</p><p>The FBI understands the importance of stressing cybersecurity with individuals, not just with organizations. To do so, we hold a series of events aimed at educating and speaking with individuals about these issues. The FBI regularly takes part in public awareness campaigns,where we coordinate with other agencies on initiatives for engagement with the private sector to prevent threats to critical infrastructure, educate entities on serious cyber threats, and ultimately close intelligence gaps. Additionally, we disseminate Private Industry Notifications, FBI Liaison Alert System reports, and public service announcements to share cyber threat information with the private sector and the general public.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The FBI is engaged in myriad efforts to combat cyber threats, from improving threat identification and information sharing inside and outside of the government, to developing and retaining new talent, to examining the way we operate to disrupt and defeat these threats. FBI agents, analysts, and computer scientists are using technical capabilities and traditional investigative techniquessuch as sources, court-authorized electronic surveillance, physical surveillance, and forensicsto counter these threats.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123528530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC0-BKM1-DYTH-G29V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2651\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 4, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Last year, hackers stole the records of 1.5 million SingHealth patients in Singapore's worst cyber attack.</p><p> The Orvibo incident, however, reflects a newer concern.</p><p> Given that it involves a rapidly growing segment consisting of smart, Internet-connected home gadgets, are security and privacy incidents set to worsen'</p><p> \"By using voice-activated devices and security cameras in our homes and offices, it could be argued that we're building the infrastructure for those with malicious intent to spy on our conversations and actions,\" said Mr Jason Hatch, a senior director at cloud services provider Akamai Asia-Pacific.</p><p> Tech giants Amazon and Google made headlines recently for retaining audio conversations between users and their virtual assistant software - found in smart speakers and smartphones - that were to be reviewed by employees to improve speech recognition.</p><p> In Google's case, a Belgian news site reported last Wednesday it had obtained samples of these conversations from a contract worker - a breach of privacy.</p><p> While Orvibo is not a household name in Singapore like Amazon and Google, its devices have been adopted by smart home enthusiasts here. They were bundled by Sembcorp Power in a recent promotion for its electricity plans.</p><p>Orvibo also makes the Kyla range of smart home devices sold by local conglomerate Aztech. The latter told The Straits Times its data is secured in a different server from the one affected by the breach.</p><p> Smart home enthusiast S.H. Lim, 39, an IT consultant, first learnt about the breach from a friend. But he is not too worried as the \"more important things such as security camera and digital door lock\" are controlled by a separate system.</p><p> IT consultant Gayatri Satyavarpu, who bought an Orvibo product for a relative, said she will give Orvibo another chance if it improves its cyber security.</p><p> \"We have had security breaches in Google and other big tech firms, but we still use them as they sorted the problems out and regained our confidence,\" she said.</p><p>  Smart connected devices are increasingly finding their way into homes.</p><p> Research firm IDC said the global market for smart home devices is expected to grow by 26.9 per cent this year to 832.7 million shipments, with Amazon and Google dominating the market due to their popular smart speakers.</p><p> In Singapore, sales of these gadgets grew by 24 per cent last year compared with the year before, said research firm GfK Asia.</p><p> Mr Edwin Tan, who runs IoT (Internet of Things) consultancy Automate Asia, observed that sales have gone up by around 200 per cent last year compared with 2017.</p><p> He has also received a threefold increase in queries about smart homes since the launch of the Google Home smart speaker in Singapore last April.</p><p> The growth of these smart home devices \"increases the number of targets for attack and the potential impact of a breach - if the systems are not secured\", said Akamai's Mr Hatch.</p><p> Cyber-security firm Kaspersky Lab's general manager for South-east Asia, Mr Yeo Siang Tiong, expects cyber attacks against IoT devices to \"intensify in terms of volume as well as sophistication\".</p><p> Already, the variants of malware used against IoT devices last year had more than tripled compared with 2017, he said.</p><p> Cyber-security experts warned that the consequences of data theft related to smart home devices could be more serious than the usual data breach.</p><p> Mr Ofer Maor, director at tech firm Synopsys, said: \"With smart devices integrating into locks and windows, attackers can use cyber attacks to achieve a physical compromise - breaking into your house without having to pick a lock or break a window.\"</p><p> He added that once hackers get a foothold in the home network, they can target other devices in the home network that contain confidential data such as computers and smartphones.</p><p>Orvibo is not the only smart home vendor to suffer privacy or security lapses.</p><p> In recent years, manufacturers such as Asus and D-Link have been sued by the United States Federal Trade Commission over the poor security in their smart devices such as routers and security cameras.</p><p> Cyber-security experts offered several reasons for security lapses in the smart home industry.</p><p>Synopsys' Mr Maor said vendors in the smart home business are racing to launch new innovative products in the most cost-effective manner. As a result, security, especially for smaller firms, is often a secondary concern.</p><p> Consumers, too, are not helping matters by choosing smart home products based on price rather than factors such as the trustworthiness of the vendors, said Mr Tan of Automate Asia.</p><p> Mr Steve Tan, a partner at Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore and adjunct professor at the National University of Singapore's law faculty, said the poor state of IoT security is \"exacerbated by the fact that there is presently no mandatory global security standards\" for these devices.</p><p> But the situation looks set to improve.</p><p> Last year, California introduced a cyber-security law that will go into effect next year and requires IoT device makers to equip their devices with \"reasonable\" security features, such as having users set their own unique passwords the first time they use the devices.</p><p>US lawmakers are also considering legislation to encourage IoT manufacturers to build more secure devices by mandating that devices sold to the federal government meet specific security requirements.</p><p> While describing such regulations as long overdue, Mr Tan said it is insufficient for regulatory security standards to be specific to a country.</p><p> \"What is needed is a global standard, internationally recognised and implemented for IoT devices, requiring all manufacturers of such devices to conform to specific security standards,\" he said.</p><p> A spokesman for the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore told The Straits Times the Government \"currently has no plans to put in place legislation for IoT products\", though he said the IT Standards Committee has recently published guidelines to safeguard IoT systems.</p><p> Adopting these guidelines can help vendors \"achieve a baseline cyber hygiene level for their products, while avoiding piecemeal and costly retrofitting should their products be compromised by security at a later stage\", he said.</p><p> Mr Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerability research at cyber-security firm Check Point Software Technologies, said legislation could be an effective approach.</p><p> \"It's like when you buy a food product, you can see on the package what ingredients there are and the nutritional value. There is no reason why it is not the same with smart home devices.\"</p><p><br/>ST ILLUSTRATION: LIM YONG<br/></p><p> Minimise the risks of your smart home being compromised with these tips.</p><p>  That shiny new smart home gadget on the Kickstarter crowdfunding website may look tempting, but it is safer to buy from established brands with the resources to spend on security.</p><p>  Smart home security starts with your Wi-Fi router. Ensure that its default password has been changed to a strong password.</p><p> Vendors usually require users to create an account to manage smart home devices. Turn on two-factor authentication for the account if it is available.</p><p> Do not use the same password across multiple user accounts - consider using a password manager software to help you generate strong and unique passwords, then manage them with a single master password.</p><p>  Apply the latest software patches to fix potential security vulnerabilities. Check that the auto-update feature - available in newer smart home devices - is enabled.</p><p>  Consider using an IoT scanner to assess the security of your smart home devices. This could be a software app, such as the Kaspersky Smart Home &amp; IoT scanner (available for Android) or a hardware product such as Trend Micro's Home Network Security appliance.</p><p> Similar security features are also available in certain models of routers from Asus, D-Link and TP-Link.</p><p>  Do you really need to be able to control your home lighting while you are away from home'</p><p> Disable remote access for smart devices that do not require such functionality, such as smart plugs. Doing so will prevent them being targeted by hackers.</p><p>  Before you dispose of or sell any of your smart home devices, reset them to their factory default settings. This is usually done by pressing a tiny reset button with a pin. This ensures that personal information stored in the device is deleted.</p><p>  Because most smart home devices are managed using smartphone apps, it is important the phone itself is secure.</p><p> Lock the phone with a strong password or use biometric authentication like a fingerprint.</p><p> You can also install mobile security apps in your phone to reduce the risk of malware.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-603331</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK9-X371-JCF2-802C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1595\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002FZF</classCode><className>MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It set out to pave the way for new products and services from those offering mobile and digital banking to help consumers manage their money more effectively and secure better deals for financial services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Acting as a boon for the growing cohort of mobile-only banks, it has also been a wake-up call for more traditional players - prompting them fundamentally to reassess the way they treat their customers. In some respects, its introduction is the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) moment for the banking sector, which put the investor at the centre of the advice process to ensure transparency and fairness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, the introduction of the RDR led to the rise of a new class of investor - the so-called 'advice orphans', whose portfolios are too small to be profitable for advisers to service via traditional wealth management. Cue the entrance of robo-advisers such as Nutmeg and Wealthify to fill the void and the rise of passive investments, such as ETFs, relying on algorithms and automation to inform asset allocation.</p><p>With every new item of regulation comes industry disruption, seemingly creating an industry polarised by those clinging on to traditional business models and new market entrants offering a revolutionary way of approaching finance.</p><p>In banking, the familiar high street faces have historically relied on inertia to retain customers but this is no longer the case - open APIs (application program interfaces) enable these customers to share their financial information with other providers, switch to other banks much more easily and conduct transactions through banks and non-banks alike.</p><p>Monzo, the app-only challenger bank, has already attracted more than one million customers over its short history - a clear indication not only to banks but to all those offering financial services, the advisory community included, that they ignore innovation at their peril. Whether or not financial advisers may be resistant to embrace change, their clients increasingly are not.</p><p>Digital access and servicing are now part of banking life for many. Personal financial management tools and round-up savings services are more mainstream, which in turn have prompted customers to take greater control of their finances.</p><p>Marketplace banking and comparison sites also arm customers with sufficient information to make important financial decisions without the need for a human adviser. This collective set of nudges could be the tipping point for adviser interest in a more digital relationship with clients.</p><p>The perception among many financial advisers is that adopting digital change is either not relevant for their business models or is prohibitively expensive to implement - indeed, the thought of where to start might seem overwhelming.</p><p>What leads therefore can the adviser community take from the banking sector to help them along their digital journey? The experience among banks offers the advice industry a broad playbook covering product design and positioning, channel, service models and the construction of financial ecosystems or marketplaces.</p><p>First, product positioning. Within banking, services for SMEs in particular have often been criticised for being far too homogenous, not reflecting the needs of a highly diverse sector. Expect to see far more innovation in this area as the 'alterative remedies package' rolls out, distributing some \u00a3750m carved from RBS in recompense for its 2008 bail-out, to encourage greater competition in SME banking.</p><p>This should lead to much greater differentiation of offering to meet the needs of distinct business-types, putting the customer, not products, at the heart of the proposition. Similarly, advisers can evolve their businesses to create specific, highly-targeted offerings rather than a one-size fits all advice model.</p><p>Millennial investing, sharia investing, investing for women, investing at point of retirement - these all provide opportunities to tailor advice to differing client types. In the US, for example, Ellevest has built a business focused on the distinct investment needs of women.</p><p>Advisers can help retain clients or target new market niches by referencing what experience different groups demand rather than focusing on the vehicle that takes them along their financial journey.</p><p>And niches need not be exclusive. Sharia banking now attracts more non-Muslim than Muslim clients due to a combination of better returns and an approach to finance based on ethical considerations that increasingly have a strong resonance with a much wider spectrum of society. This mirrors the huge growth of interest in ESG investing in the wealth management sector.</p><p>How advisers service their clients can also be enhanced through technology. Banking customers have grown comfortable communicating with AI-driven chatbots to deal with complex requests.</p><p>By introducing this type of service model, advisory firms can free up time to concentrate on higher-value activities - from face-to-face annual reviews to ensuring compliance with shifting regulatory requirements. The greater efficiencies this creates can have a positive impact on a business&amp;acute;s bottom line, which should be welcomed in an environment of profit margin compression.</p><p>Chatbots, while introducing efficiency, may seem to dehumanise client interaction. Other communication channels can, however, be opened through technology to foster far closer client relationships. Banking customers increasingly rely on apps to engage with their providers, giving them budgeting advice, prompting them on overdraft limits and alerting them to new products or offers.</p><p>Financial advisers can similarly open a much more constant dialogue with their clients to provide real-time notifications on market movements and investment opportunities, reminders of tax deadlines and other helpful context-based nudges. These combine to nurture much closer engagement and foster a stronger connection between client and adviser.</p><p>Talk of creating a financial ecosystem or marketplace is increasingly common in the banking sector, led by online-only challengers. Legacy banks might be wary of introducing their customers to other financial service providers, preferring to cross-sell their own products and keeping business in the family, but digital newcomers have recognised they can engender client loyalty through a more altruistic approach.</p><p>Starling, for example, is focused on pure banking services but has built a platform through which its customers can access a wide range of related services, from accounting software to managing receipts to travel insurance.</p><p>Advisers can similarly benefit from a marketplace approach - for example, platforms providing access to robo-advice via an adviser&amp;acute;s own marketplace can extend the range of services available to clients without having to invest in developing the service themselves.</p><p>This enables them to retain the core client relationship, while adding specific products or services that would otherwise be provided directly by others. This should be a consideration for advisers at the smaller end of the spectrum who want to concentrate on their strengths in financial planning but are keen to embed themselves more deeply in clients' financial psyche.</p><p>The perceived expense of digital transformation or a lack of technological ability may be considered a barrier to entry for many smaller advisory firms but this need not be the case. In implementing a digital strategy, it is important to start small rather than contemplating a wholescale technological overhaul. The success stories in digital banking highlight the importance of focusing on features that delight customers over the completeness of a digital offering.</p><p>To return to Monzo, which is in effect a very simple banking app, the ability to freeze a lost card until it has been recovered is highly prized by customers. This combination of imagination and an understanding of their needs has impressed their clients far more than big tech investment.</p><p>Open banking has emphasised much greater collaboration between traditional market players and innovative fintechs. This is evidenced by the Capabilities and Innovation Fund, which encourages greater fintech participation in SME banking and the UK is arguably the most fertile environment for the sector in Europe.</p><p>This is something advisers should seek to exploit. Having identified which part of the overall customer experience they wish to own, financial advisers can capitalise on wider investment in fintech by partnering with businesses leading the technological revolution to complement the services they offer their clients.</p><p>This effectively outsources both the expense and risk of developing new technologies in-house to those with the expertise to do so. The potential offered by collaboration with fintechs is applicable equally to an adviser's front and back-office infrastructure. It can open new ways of interacting with clients and providing advice and services as well as streamlining administrative functions and reporting.</p><p>Just as in banking, where there are still many customers who prefer to visit a branch to conducting business online, so with financial advice there will continue to be clients who favour a face-to-face relationship with their adviser.</p><p>This need not change. Instead, by following the lead of banks in offering innovative and more efficient ways of working with customers, advisers can embrace the evolution of their industry.</p><p>A more digital approach can enhance a client's overall experience by streamlining specific areas of a service. This frees up an adviser to concentrate on those who have a much higher added-value impact to the relationship, essential in both retaining and growing a client base.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Daniel Meere is UK managing director of international management consulting firm Axis Corporate</emphasis></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFAD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFAD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC5-XSK1-DYWJ-F2JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">355720</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1661\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Incisive Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Professional Adviser</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"63985\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 6, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Good morning, everybody. I think it's probably time we should get going for our first presentation this morning. For those of you at the back, hope you're all well rested. I'm Alex Smith, and I cover European food and HBC for Barclays. So first up this morning, we have Danone. And it's my absolute pleasure to welcome up on stage, Emmanuel Faber, CEO; and C\u00c3\u00a9cile Cabanis, CFO. And I'd also like to thank Danone for providing all the delicious snacks which you might have had the chance to indulge in from across the room.</p><p>So most of us know Danone has transformed itself over the years into one of the most health focused and consumer on trend staples companies in our universe. And of course, culminating with the WhiteWave acquisition from earlier this year. I think in that context it's not too uncontroversial to say that the company's currently underperforming its significant growth potential. Growth is set to improve in the second half of this year and the company has a plan to take growth up to its target of 4% to 5% by 2020 and I'm sure we'll hear more from the team about that in due course. The group also has amongst the most ambitious cost-saving plans across the space, and a target to take the operating margin up by 300 basis points to (inaudible) by 2020. These are just a couple of the hot topics around Danone, which is a pretty busy equity story today. And with that backdrop I should probably stop talking now and hand it over to Emmanuel. Thank you very much, Emmanuel.</p><p>EMMANUEL FABER, CEO, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; NON-INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, DANONE: Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, 7:30, back-to-school. Thank you for the opportunity once again, we never miss this opportunity of back-to-school to offer us the opportunity to share our passion about what we create with Danone with your support finally to your benefit. It's as Alex said, a very rich story, which is driven by the vision that you have here with our new signature One Planet One Health. We believe this is a guiding point for every consumer in the world for the next possible future, and we want this to be our own guiding point in creating value today and tomorrow. Exactly 3 years ago we embarked, if I can get the charts, maybe this one would work better. Okay, let me try something else. I'm ready. Thank you.</p><p>I hope that's me doing this. Yes, apparently it is. We embarked, in exactly 3 years ago, in a very deep transformation for Danone. A transformation that is aimed at bringing an agenda of profitable growth, restoring that agenda. And bringing it in a vision that is truly addressing the needs of tomorrow and therefore, preparing the company for tomorrow. We've run that agenda for 3 years. And earlier this year, we decided that we needed to double down, to accelerate, adjust what is now a 3-year program to go to 2020 and I'd like to walk you through this transformation.</p><p>First of all, the first couple of years, 2014-2016, we delivered on a rebalanced agenda of profitability and growth. Starting with growth, with an average 4% like-for-like growth for the company on these 3 years. A sustained improvement in our recurring operating margin. Actually the 120 bps cumulative improvement is the highest ever that we had on a 3-year span and that will continue. And that led to what, for Danone, as you know is quite new. But I can tell you now extremely strong focus agenda on EPS growth. 8.8% average EPS growth, consistent EPS growth, during that period of time.</p><p>Then the future. The future because we saw, as we shared with you, number of opportunities to go faster. Number of challenges that we could resolve quicker if we were to decouple for the first time, not creating only one historical engine for Danone, which was growth. But using another one to fly, 2 engines to fly: growth and efficiency in a decoupled manner with one line of direction, consistent EPS growth through 2017 to 2020. Let me start by where we want to go. Where we want to go is very clear. Sales of 4% to 5% growth by 2020 on a like-for-like basis. Recurring operating margin beyond 16%, which combined together will create a consistent EPS growth over the period of time. And on capital allocation, a clear discipline with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 3x by 2020. And capturing the ROIC opportunity, the roadmap that we have back to about 12% by 2020. This way, we believe, we will prepare for what Danone remains uniquely a strong, profitable, sustainable growth potential as a company.</p><p>We actually started to deliver on that journey. If you look at our first half, there's been a widely discussed already slow start to the year. And despite that slow start to the year in terms of growth, we've actually posted the highest ever period-to-period improvement of our recurring operating margin, 91 basis points. No surprise that it delivered significant EPS growth, strong EPS growth of 11%, poising us well into our ability to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the full year of 2017. And in addition, about capital allocation and what we do with our cash, 24% free cash flow growth, which bodes well to the agenda of deleveraging that we have for the company.</p><p>Let me now start about the future. First of all, first of the 2 big engines. The 300 bps improvement target that we have for the next 3 years, driven of course by growth, but beyond this by an accelerated efficiency program. 300 bps based on enablers that are already in place. A Protein program, our own ZBB approach, which is going to save us EUR 1 billion on indirect purchasing. A big change in the way they're working. We intend to let EUR 300 million of this flow into the operating margin by 2020. And that number starts with next year, EUR 100 million additional operating profit led by the Protein program.</p><p>The second big driver of efficiency and margin improvement is our $300 million by 2020 WhiteWave synergies. As you know, $225 million of that are cost synergies, the $75 million of the rest is EBIT from revenue synergy. So very much skewed in our numbers, in our plan today on cost efficiency in the WhiteWave merger. Third, structural efficiencies, and I'll come back to that. We've continued to work on our organizations, on the way we purchase, on the way we manufacture, we transport and this is a multi-annual program that will continue to deliver productivities over time. A very disciplined approach in resource allocation. We actually discussed that exactly a year ago in this place about how we refused to fuel some tactical growth that we believed wouldn't create long-term sustainable growth through the period. And finally, our continued commitment on our legacy dairy business beyond WhiteWave to improve the margin in the next 3 years by an additional 200 bps from what it was in 2014 at constant exchange rates.</p><p>So these are the main drivers of our efficiency programs. I'm very confident in our ability to deliver because the key enablers are already in place. One big chunk of the transformation of the organization for Danone has been 2.5 years ago when we decided to go for a One Danone organization in 30 different clusters of geographies. As you know, this is now fully in place. This is the backbone of the local Danone organizations that allow us to mutualize cross categories, the organizations of these countries to run cross categories, a number of both top-line and cost initiatives, and to bring the right level of expertise to make sure we continue to drive our business in those clusters.</p><p>Second, Beyond Budget process that's been running for 18 months now, led by C\u00c3\u00a9cile, which allows us to quarterly reallocate resources on a very flexible manner and to make sure we put our money on profitable growth opportunities only and make sure we also resource our cost efficiency programs.</p><p>Third, procurement. DanTrade is a program that exists for 5 years at Danone, which we have not yet fully implemented both in terms of divisions and in terms of geographies. It's mostly covers today Europe and dairy. It's poised to cover the whole of the world. In a couple of weeks' time, maximum, I will have the pleasure to announce the creation and the recruitment of a very high caliber Chief Procurement Officer that will have, as a purpose, to make sure that this happens deep, fast and efficient in the organization. Thirdly, on the new regional footprints, you may remember 9 months ago, we decided that we would delegate from the executive committee of Danone, which I shrank to a limited number of people to accelerate the rate at which we are making decision, the efficiency of this limited team, we actually delegated to a team of 15 regional leaders company-wide decisions that they make at their level committing the whole company and this is to make sure that we're making decisions much faster closer to the markets because they direct with the 30 clusters that I just mentioned before every day. And so we believe they are at the right place to make those decisions for the future of Danone, whether this is on efficiency or whether this is on top line topics. So the enablers are already in place today from an organizational standpoint for us to deliver -- continue to deliver on our efficiency journey.</p><p>H1 2017 is actually on these programs on track starting with Protein, our ZBB program. We have started 3 pilots already live: Mexico; France, including our headquarters in Paris; and Germany. We will have the learnings of these by the end of the year. Already the Q4 is getting to see implementation of further geographies. And as I said, we expect EUR 100 million of savings into our margin next year from these programs.</p><p>The second is the adaptation of our European Dairy organization. I chose to share it with you again because I think this is an important example on how we're addressing those. Because the reality is that the market is evolving fast, you learn, you have to learn fast both from your failures and from your successes. In that case, when it comes to the Activia relaunch, that was much spoken about a year ago, we alerted you already back in December last year that it didn't reach the expected results. By the 15th of January, we'd made a decision to change the organization in Europe. By the 14th of Feb, during our full year release, I shared with you that we had change all the leadership team in Dairy Europe to make sure we readdressed properly the opportunities there.</p><p>4 months later, we had changed the organization itself, shrank it from 9 to 5 clusters. Making sure that we divided by 2 the number of processes and decision making in the top management of Dairy in Europe to speed up the decision making both in top line and on efficiency. And by the Q2, we had changed and populated with new leaders, all of the 5 clusters plus the leading person in Dairy in Europe. This was made in a swift manner. And I'd like to just add one thing. We did that because I'm -- we are strong believers that the fit of the people that we put on the mission with that task in a very fast evolving manner is the root of the success. But when we're wrong, we need to know fast, we need to decide and change fast, which is what we did, what we will continue to do. And by the way, I have to say that beyond making sure we pick the right people, are poised for success, we also have to continue to look at organizations as a very adaptive factor to success. So you have seen and you will continue to see our organization evolve as I think we are in a very fast changing environment and we need to continue to do this.</p><p>The third aspect is the WhiteWave synergy agenda. We finally closed WhiteWave in April, as you know. So we had about 2 months of running the company in the first half of the year. We used that 2 months to do very quick symbolic but important topics including grounding aviation, closing the Denver office, starting the synergies and the cost in organization synergies, making sure we had 1 sales force. In only a matter of a few weeks, we were able to create a slate of unparalleled salesforce organization in the refrigerated aisle here in the U.S. with great leaders from both sides making sure that all our customers here had their dedicated new key accounts. Most of the time they knew them before from either of the organizations. And that was one of the great successes of the first 2 months of the integration of WhiteWave in the first half of the year.</p><p>With, on top of that, the first few synergies, essentially cost synergies that started to flow in already in 2 months. And finally, I was talking about the structural work that we're doing on our efficiencies. I'm particularly satisfied in the context, which I think a number of you remembered us probably telling you already 2 years ago that we felt 2017 was going to be a challenging year from a raw material standpoint because after the big decline in the price of milk for a couple of years, we expected 2017 to go back in terms of input prices. This is what happened. And you can see that 400 bps of inflation in overall raw materials for Danone on the first half of the year. And yet 90% of it compensated by efficiency gains and the way we've managed our mix on the marketplace.</p><p>The next big engine to fly to the direction of 2020 is growth, obviously. And why is this, and how is this company uniquely positioned to sequentially accelerate our growth? Let me come back again to where we want to be by 2020. We shared these numbers with all of you who attended our investor seminar back in May. By 2020, our sales growth, organic, will be 4% to 5% with basically 3 of our macro categories beyond 5%. And one, the international essential dairy and plant-based business so outside of North America, between 3% and 4%. You heard me say and I can repeat, I'm extremely confident in our ability to reach these numbers. A few reasons why. I've said it, and I repeat it, we are constantly self-disrupting this organization to fit all growth opportunities that we see.</p><p>For those of you were at Evian and Evian with us for the seminar, we spent some time about discussing one of the critical topic I have as a manager in such a transformation, which is the pace of change. We are constantly measuring, taking the pulse of our organization to make sure that people keep up with the pace of change. That we are going as fast as we need to but in the same time as fast as they can go as well. And this is also why, from time to time we've been changing roles, people, organization to make sure that we mitigate and we optimize our ability to culturally change, to collectively change the pace at which this company moves, the direction in which it moves. In particular, and I'll come back to that, the collective efficiency agenda that we've created which is totally new for a company like Danone.</p><p>The second reason I think we're geared for a strong growth and by 2020 of 4% to 5% growth number on a like-for-like basis is from the comeback of emerging countries. You probably remember Latin America 15 years ago, you probably remember Russia not so far ago when we acquired Unimilk, merged it with Danone in Russia. And we started with a margin at 0 basically, given the ban on the number of foodstuff at that point in time by the government. Given the fires that had destroyed harvests and fields and the price of milk had skyrocketed 40% just before the closing. Anyway, we started with 0, we're now double-digit margin in Russia a few years later. We are growing in Russia as you know in CIS overall, low to mid-single digits in a difficult environment. So Russia had its highs and lows. We're managing this and that continues to deliver.</p><p>You know that China, we've been mentioning for now a number of quarters, the transition in China, of course, the Early Life Nutrition transition. But also the beverage transition into the new normal of China, which is now gradually fading away. As you know, we are at the end of that transition and that is good news for our Water business in total. So China's gone through its truth and it's going to grow again. Mentioning Early Life Nutrition, we've reached a record market share for our brands in China. Continue to be #1 in Early Life Nutrition. It's an incredible job that's been done by the teams locally. We've been talking with you about Brazil, probably a big point of disappointment for us for a few quarters already and this is not finished. But all in all, through this transition we continue to believe that there is a huge traction for our categories, for our brands in emerging countries going through a transition now and they'll be back.</p><p>And lastly it's because we are executing on efficiencies. And these efficiencies through our resource allocation process are already allowing us, and increasingly so in the future including with the put in program, to reinvest behind the right categories and the right brands. And talking about these like categories and brands, Danone has an unparalleled growth biased portfolio of categories. You can look at the past, horizontal; at the future, vertical. In dark gray, this is other food categories. In light gray -- sorry, other beverage categories. In light gray, it is other food category. In blue, this is our categories. You can look at in the way you want. They as categories globally were growing anywhere between 3% and 11%. In the past, they're poised to grow anywhere between 4% to 9% in the future. These are our categories.</p><p>On these categories, we believe we have incredibly strong brands and positions. Early Life Nutrition, #2 worldwide but the fastest-growing of all competitors in the marketplace with a great slate of brands. Which growth is going to be driven by secular consumer trends, which I have highlighted here. An increasing number of affluent middle-class and that is true anywhere in emerging countries short to midterm. And the resuming of growth of the market of Early Life Nutrition in China is a very, very good news for us. The 1,000 days awareness in which Danone is a global leader, how nutrition changes lives during the first 1,000 days. Favorite nutrition needs, allergies prevalence are growing everywhere. Very important because we are 1 of the 2 largest, most expert companies in the world to deliver appropriate solutions for babies and toddlers in that space. And journey management, which our own digital journey is helping us to improve, which is the way we carry our relationship with a pregnant mother through toddlership and even longer. When we see, for instance, that in the U.S. the point of disruption of a family diet going to organic, for instance, it is where baby is actually coming into the family. So if you enter at that point in time, you can create a lifelong relationship that changes the way people eat and drink and changes the way you interact with your brands with these people. So journey management is of course, a very important topic and that includes nutritionists, that includes health care practitioners, that includes the prescription that doctors are making for the solutions that we're bringing to the kid situations.</p><p>Advanced Medical Nutritions, which is our second export nutrition category. As you know, it's a smaller but fast-growing very profitable category; #1 in Europe but fastly growing in Latin America, in Russia, in China where we're #1 as well. This is a business that is poised for growth given our positions and given the underlying social health economics, I would say; aging population all over the world; and sometimes faster than we all anticipated is bringing special needs for people metabolisms beyond a certain point in age. The prevalence of chronic diseases and metabolism diseases, we're providing some absolutely vital solutions of nutrition for babies to the end of life. Some people are only eating our products and therefore, the ability for our teams to create recipes, to create solutions that embark all of the complexity of the metabolism through heavy science but in the same time a huge work from a food and alimentation standpoint creating the texture, the [organ electives], the consumer experience, the recipes.</p><p>The social experience that they get from using our products is critical because this is an element of compliance. And doctors who now have a clear understanding even on government level, how much nutrition is actually saving public money because it keeps people out of hospital basically for many reasons. It's the compliance with the prescription is critical. And when you have to take the same bottle of the same product in morning, midday and at night for your lifetime, you can imagine that the variety of the way you intake that food is critical to the way you actually make sure you get the right level of nutrient in the right way. So this is one of the very interesting patterns where expert nutrition really meets the cultural, the social aspects of what alimentation all means to all of us.</p><p>The importance of outpatient care is growing. So we've been developing also direct contact and digital, physical contacts and journey management out of hospitals and clinics for patients including in care homes. So we have services that we provide around nutrition that's broader than purely the product itself. And that brings us into a digital space, which is very interesting in terms of complementary services. And all the data that we can share and not only with our patients but also with the healthcare sector that we support through this division.</p><p>The third one is our Water business. We're #3 in volumes. We're also the fastest-growing global water business. It's an incredibly powerful slate of brands that we have, international and local. They're very -- they've been very innovative, innovation has been absolutely critical to revive the growth of this category. Sustainability has been fundamental to address the -- all the concerns but also the opportunities behind the Water category. Sustainability is critical, that's part of the DNA of our brands and that's really one of the points on which they are making a difference. And we believe there is growth as much as Euro Monitor and others are projecting for the future based on the various consumer drivers that you see here, including the fact that there is clearly a switch from sugary drinks to much healthier hydration solutions by consumers all over the place.</p><p>Whether they do that by themselves, whether they do that because there are taxes on sugary drinks or whether this is a combination of both because the offering is changing through government boost, through education boards in universities and schools or through even customers. We are seeing more traction in these than in the volumes of big soft drinks. So that will continue to grow and that's been a very successful business for us.</p><p>Fresh Dairy, #1 globally, of course. The unparalleled slate of brands that we have is also poised for growth. We are very clear on this. This is not a commoditized category. We've - we are seeing a lot of innovations. All the innovations are high-priced sophisticated innovations. So the problems that we see in this category is not related to the category, it's relating to our own execution and that's back to a couple of comments I made before. Why we believe where we'll grow is because there has been never such a conversation about gut microbiotas and the global metabolism of humans.</p><p>Here in the U.S., there is a new trend that I'm sure you've seen about probiotics. Probiotics started in 1919 for Danone. We have 3,000 of them research in our probiotics library that we can use to engineer new solutions against them. It's an unparalleled richness that we have. And it's clearly driven by the naturality, the simpleness of what dairy is overall. And dairy continues to grow in most of emerging countries. It will continue to grow and we are uniquely placed to catch up where we should be and where we are not yet and that's part, as you know, of our gradual re-acceleration plan.</p><p>The great addition of our plant-based and food and beverages -- food and WhiteWave acquisition, incredible slate of brands and businesses here with a #1 position in the U.S, #1 in Europe, as you know, 7x bigger in Europe but -- than the #2. White space is all over the place to continue to grow in plant-based and dairy alternative solutions across the world as more and more people are becoming flexitarian. They're not vegans, but they're flexitarian. It's become mainstream here in this country, which is really what triggered our interest into the WhiteWave acquisition.</p><p>WhiteWave team's been tremendously successful in bringing this as a mainstream solution now. Which requires, by the way, now that it's mainstream with 30% household penetration a different set in terms of how we innovate and continue to grow, which is also creating traction is the way we are organizing WhiteWave and DanonWave as the combined entity here in North America, to continue to the incredible potential growth of this plant-based categories. Lots of innovation whitespace too. I think there is an untapped opportunity to do something that our WhiteWave friends didn't have time to do probably or the opportunity, which is Alpro's been growing on their agenda with an innovation research development integrated ability, which is truly unparalleled in the world. That's a jewel for us as a company. And I think that can also continue to inspire the next wave of growth for the coming future of our brands here in the U.S. to restore the growth including of the great Silk brand. The good news being, that the category has restarted growing as we speak right now for plant-based in the U.S.</p><p>Finally, coffee creamers and beverages, a new, exciting category for us here in this country, potentially beyond. We're #2, as you know, to a significantly bigger one. But by far the fastest growing slate of brands. Hugely innovative, very successful innovations driven by the WhiteWave team here. Multi-brands, multi-formats, multi-nutritional solutions with the slate of growing from organic milk to plant-based and a number of different plant-based solutions. We see a lot of growth potential because of coffee popularity and the continued growth of the coffee consumption all over the world basically and here in the U.S. as well. We're offering better for you than traditional creaming solutions with a number of these solutions. And we see more and more creaming as the coffee consumption grows, because in particular, in this country where coffee is not exactly what we European people would call it, we see more and more consumers as they grow their consumption, willing to enrich, I would say, the flavor and the experiment with a variety you of creaming solutions. So great potential there as well.</p><p>In a nutshell, these categories, the positions that we have make Danone uniquely fit in a fast-changing consumer landscape. First of all, 100% healthy categories now in our portfolio. It's been 10 years of hard work to come to this portfolio; we're there now. Second, we see a lot of local traction. You heard me speak about local. I think this alimentation, this food revolution that we're seeing all over the world will mean, is already meaning that people want to understand locally what their food is, where it's coming. They feel that local is safer, that local is more sustainable, that local is closer but basically local means they reach their own sovereignty and food. And so the fact that more than half of our portfolio has been historically built as local brands. For us, compared to some meager brands that we see operating in the space is a big advantage that on which we are doubling down in terms of building strategically the agenda for these local brands.</p><p>And the third one is that we're not afraid of making bold moves. We're not about marginal changes. Everything we do since 3 years are radical, deep transformations. And when a year ago, we decided to go all non-GMO here, saying that by the end of this year, in 4 months' time, we will label GMOs in our product, whatever the regulation was. And when we decided to transition half of our slate of the brands here into non-GMOs, that's a very consumer friendly move that I think is just an example of what many brands should be doing if they want to be part of the future. Seven, before I conclude reasons why to summarize why I believe Danone is uniquely positioned in this consumer landscape.</p><p>We have a passion for what we do. And at Danone, everything starts with people. The level of engagement in our people, as you know, those of you who are at the investor seminar, the sustainable engagement, the passion that people have, as we measure it by going direct to 90,000 of them. Asking them directly the questions and looking at the answers is unparalleled. We are close to some very fancy big tech companies in terms of engaging the people. Way beyond our competition. I think that makes a huge difference in the pace at which we can change this organization.</p><p>Second, I said it. Leading brands, 100% healthy categories, a well-balanced geographical footprint. Third, we are self-disrupting ourselves. And I want to continue to build, and I said that an adaptive organization because I truly believe that we need to continue to move as fast as we see the opportunities around us. There is, I can assure you, a full new but full commitment to collective efficiency, which did not exist 3 years ago and we're creating the conditions for that every day. There is a pioneer, a very innovative, I would say, probably unparalleled in many ways, platform of socially-driven business rooted sustainability initiatives, which I think are going to be very important for the future of our brands.</p><p>The sixth is we have a very people-centric culture that allows us to engage in a truly different manner with companies, with NGOs, governments, with our people, recruiting people from smaller companies that join us very interestingly to re-nurture the culture and the DNA of Danone. And finally, I think it's very important, we are managing time horizons. We are not focusing on any of the 3 short, mid and long. We are just making sure we manage each and every of them. Just one is not enough. One is just not enough. And I think this is what makes the whole thing hold together because this is what actually brings the meaning of what we do every day.</p><p>So I'll just finish by saying that we have this arrow, you know it. That's our past 2, 1 day strong, profitable, sustainable growth. We continue to believe that company has the right way to aspire to be there. By 2020, we'll not be exactly there because growth will still be below 5%, so 4% to 5% in terms of growth. And working back from now to 2020, we will continue to build a profitable, sustainable growth agenda starting with this year, delivering consistent EPS growth.</p><p>Thank you for being with us. Thank you for your interest. I really believe we're creating a unique company with your support.</p><p>ALEXANDER PIERS SMITH: I would like to thank very much Emmanuel for his engaging presentation and for being with us here today.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

They promptly folded and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/03/inmarsat-left-3bn-debt-private-equity-buyout-gets-nod/\">Zilberman got his rubber stamp on Tuesday</url>.</p><p>\"These guys weren't long-term holders of Inmarsat,\" he says. \"They only bought the stock when they saw there was a merger. Their whole strategy was to wait to the last second and try to block the field and basically get a bribe. For our guys it was really a case of calling their bluff and saying 'look, take it or leave it'.</p><p>\"It's just unfortunate that the financial markets are such that they allow financial bullies to operate in this way.\"</p><p>The victory underscores what Zilberman says has been a record year for Warburg in Europe.</p><p>In April it was behind the \u00a32.2bn London float of the payments processor Network International, which has since gained more than a third in value. Overall Zilberman's team have complete 15 deals in 18 months and new funds have been raised to give it more than \u00a315bn in reserve for European buyouts.</p><p>\"For one firm to have the second-biggest IPO in Europe with Network International and the second-biggest take-private with Inmarsat is pretty cool,\" says Zilberman. \"We sold three companies in each case generating over a thirty per cent return.\"</p><p>Warburg, which having been founded a block away from the New York Stock Exchange in 1966 is about as venerable as it gets in private equity, appears to have at last hit on a formula that works after years of patchy performance on this side of the Atlantic.</p><p>Zilberman claims the progress is down to a long-term effort to train up staff in-house, in contrast to its earlier practice of poaching senior executives from rival firms and investment banks. After a few years, the policy is generating better ideas and better deals, he says.</p><p>\"Historically in Europe too often we went for the easy answer. We did what everybody else was doing.</p><p>\"So what we said about four years ago was 'we're going to try and build from within'. We're going to take some really talented young guys - I wish they were older but they're not - and we're going to back them and develop them. We're going to plant seeds and water them, and over time they're going to grow into really strong trees.\"</p><p>One such cultivar is Max Fowinkel, who closely watched Inmarsat's struggles as a listed company for years before pouncing. He says the deal is underpinned by a firm belief that over time commercial shipping and airliners will consume more data.</p><p>\"You have 25,000 planes outside of the US and some of the long haul fleets don't have basic internet access,\" says Fowinkel. \"Inmarsat have the ability over the next five to six years to get to something like a half thousand.\"</p><p>Zilberman adds: \"There are three times in my day when I don't use my phone. When I sleep, when I shower and when I get on a damn aeroplane!\"</p><p>Fowinkel teamed up on the deal with Rene Obermann, who is now a Warburg employee but in his previous role as Deutsche Telekom chief executive was one of Inmarsat's biggest customers. Bringing in such industrial experience and contacts has also helped deliver an \"edge\". Obermann has for instance opened doors to senior management at Vodafone on behalf of Warburg's German fibre-optic broadband business, Zilberman says.</p><p>In buyout markets where there are now tens of billions of dollars looking for a home, the ability to build up businesses is becoming more important in an industry once based almost entirely on financial engineering.</p><p>As private equity has expanded since the financial crisis, Warburg has nearly doubled its funds in the last four years to $65bn as low interest rates and a lack of corporate growth outside Big Tech send investors rushing into the arms of private equity firms. Zilberman says Warburg is further marked out by its willingness to take minority stakes to work with talented management teams who may not want to hand over control. Many public company bosses now look enviously at the pace and patience a buyout can deliver.</p><p>\"I sit on listed company boards as well,\" says Zilberman. \"I can tell you that the decision-making on my private boards is materially better than on public boards. If somebody said to you, 'I can build the next Google', I just need \u00a3100m and six years you say 'absolutely'.</p><p>\"Because my investment period is six, seven years, I can take that. But typical public market investor's average duration for holding a stock is 45 days.\"</p><p>For a company such as Inmarsat, which plans to invest \u00a32.5bn in new satellites over the next five years, the pressures of the public markets proved too much. It was unable to convince the City that with patience and capital, hurling a broadband network into space would pay off.</p><p>Zilberman says he is now \"looking at plenty\" more buyouts of public companies facing similar challenges. He is very bullish on Britain, Brexit or no Brexit, and given rapid progress at the Warburg portfolio company Reiss, even believes there is money to be made on the High Street.</p><p>\"What a disaster retail is,\" he says. \"You walk down the street. You see one failing store after another.</p><p>\"But Reiss is by far the best performing company in our European portfolio. Earnings are going to be up fifty per cent this year.</p><p>\"Why is it doing well and so many competitors doing poorly? Because Reiss is kicking ass. We put in an awesome management team who are putting on the shelves products people want to buy at a reasonable price.\"</p><p>All that remains to cap the year is to make the hedgies pay its legal fees. Oaktree have suggested to the court the company should cover their costs, but Zilberman won't have it.</p><p>\"That's like being mugged in the street and the guy turning round to you and saying 'why don't you buy me some trainers'. It's crazy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-58491477</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP4-RJP1-JCJY-G2V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1237\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

For whatever reason, the crowd that once wooed the VP is donating far more cash to the campaigns of his leading rivals, former senator Bill Bradley (his likely challenger for the Democratic Party nomination for president) and Governor George W. Bush (the likely Republican presidential candidate).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to an analysis of campaign contributions by the San Jose Mercury News newspaper, Mr Bush leads with $ 74,792, Mr Bradley has picked up $ 49,650, and Mr Gore has received a surprisingly paltry $ 26,075. No one seems quite sure why the Valley seems to be snubbing Mr Gore, but then again, he claimed earlier this year to have been the inventor of the Internet.</p><section sectionType=\"slug\"><bodyText><p>99120300195</p></bodyText></section><p>THE Mercury News is considered to be one of the top 10 newspapers in the US and no other paper holds a candle to it in terms of consistently solid technology coverage. So many have been wondering how and why the paper could have been so thoroughly scooped by its rival to the north, the San Francisco Chronicle.</p><p>The Chronicle, which has been working hard to catch up to the Merc, outshone the paper in a superb, just-concluded series that examined what it termed \"the dark side of the Valley\". Over five days, the paper ran lengthy, frontpage articles that exposed the sleazy, corrupt and immoral doings of some well-respected companies and key technology personalities in the region. The articles, which were the topic of shocked conversations all around the Valley, were the result of 10 months of work by two Chronicle investigative reporters. You can click through to the full series from <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sfgate.com/technology/\">www.sfgate.com/technology/</url>. </p><p>The reports examined everything from inventors who were allegedly cheated of their intellectual property by the technology companies they had partnered with, to company founders that discovered their venture capitalist supporters had stripped them of ownership of their own companies, to technology company executives accused of distorting sales figures to inflate their share price and then selling out before the price crash left investors in trouble. The reports highlighted the inability of law enforcement agencies and regulators - including a frustrated Securities and Exchange Commission - to prosecute, or even worse, to do anything at all. While outraged readers flooded the paper with letters, many observers wryly noted that many of the companies mentioned in the pieces suffered no damage in share price on the Street following the series. But perhaps that just proves the point the Chronicle was trying to make - nearly everyone accepts that the industry has become so powerful that companies are almost untouchable.</p><p>ASSUMING you've made your millions here, though, and want to blow some of them, you will still have a hard time finding any place to live. If you think Dublin is bad, consider Silicon Valley, where the median price of a home in October was $ 410,444 (E407,429). Valley estate agents expect that figure to rise to about $ 500,000 by year's end, mainly because only about 1,000 homes are currently on sale and buyers are panicked.</p><p>In a comment that has scary implications for Dublin, an estate agent noted in one newspaper that all the people who had decided to \"wait out the market\" were finding that prices just kept climbing. The agent noted that technology was not going to go away, and that the big tech companies weren't folding. In other words: welcome to permanent high prices - there's nowhere else to live and not enough homes for an endless stream of employees.</p><p>That's why this region has spawned a new term, which pops up in estate agent advertisements. The term is \"tear down\" is \"tear down\", and is used to refer to a house that is not grand enough for the now highly-valuable land it is built upon.</p><p>Thus one stumbles upon an advertisement for a $ 750,000 home which insists: \"Move right in! Not a tear down!\" If the house could be considered a tear down, the wary estate agent usually avoids using the word. The favoured euphemism is \"build new\" - as in one advert for a $ 615,000 \"classic bungalow\" in Palo Alto, which cajoles buyers to \"enjoy as is, remodel or build new\".</p><p>Of course, if you are a Valley tycoon and you're in search of that statement house, you'll probably be looking at the multi-million dollar properties in the hills above the silicon chip-producing flatlands.</p><p>Karlin Lillington is at klillington(at)irish-times.ie.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES1999</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3Y1B-SH60-0061-H12R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1999 The Irish Times</copyright><publicationDate month=\"12\" day=\"03\" year=\"1999\"><dateText>December 3, 1999</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mjg0MTE1QzIwODg2NDA3ODgzNUQxMUU4MzRGODZFRjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTIwNDgzMTY4QzQ5NDYzOEE0Njg0ODk0QzZBNEZFNUM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST000CZTI</classCode><className>STOCK PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000245</classCode><className>CAMPAIGN FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QD4</classCode><className>NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096T0</classCode><className>SALES FIGURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp;

It's a business model built on mass surveillance, with personal data becoming the economy's most valuable commodity.</p><p>And as that data become ever-more important to state-to-state relations, Mr. Keen says we're only one major hacking event away from a digital world war.</p><p>\"We still haven't had an Exxon Valdez or a Chernobyl on data,\" he said in an interview days before a U.S. federal grand jury indicted three Russian companies and 13 of their online operatives for a wide-ranging and well-funded online campaign to sow political discord during the 2016 election in support of <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>\"I think there will be some major hacking event in the not-too-distant future which may involve a foreign power that will wake people up to this.\"</p><p>Yet such a dystopian a future is far from inevitable, he says. The internet's early optimism, the belief that technology would save the world, was misguided. But so is today's digital determinism, which says that humans are powerless against algorithms, smart machines and cyberwarfare campaigns of hostile foreign governments.</p><p>To fix the future, Mr. Keen argues, we should look to the past. The social and economic upheaval caused by Industrial Revolution was tamed through a combination of labour strikes, government regulations that improved working conditions, the advent of a social safety net and the adoption of public schools. Mr. Keen believes the most damaging effects of today's digital revolution can be similarly managed through a combination of regulation, innovation, consumer and worker demands and education.</p><p>History lessons are particularly crucial for Silicon Valley's forward-looking tech titans. Mr. Keen points to the U.S. automotive industry, whose global dominance was undermined by safety and reliability issues until it eventually lost ground to innovative companies in Europe and Asia.</p><p>\"It's very important for Silicon Valley to wake up and recognize that there's no guarantee that they'll be dominant in 10 or 20 years,\" he said.</p><p>In Mr. Keen's vision of the war for the future, the villains are China and Russia, which are using online platforms to create surveillance states that undermine trust between citizens and their government.</p><p>The heroes are countries such as Estonia, which is creating a digital ID system for its citizens - one that alerts them each time a government agency accesses their data. The country also launched an \"e-residency\" program that gives foreign entrepreneurs access to the country's financial institutions. In the Estonian model, he says, building online trust means replacing anonymity and privacy with a system of open and transparent state surveillance.</p><p>Regulation will become increasingly important to reining in big tech, he says. But the U.S., with its chaotic political system and laws that shield social media companies from liability for content posted on their platforms, is ill-equipped to lead the push for reform.</p><p>Canadian regulators have likewise taken a largely hands-off approach to social media companies, though earlier this month Bank of Canada deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins called for tougher regulation of tech firms, given their growing power and control over vast troves of personal data.</p><p>\"Access to and control of user data could make some firms virtually unassailable,\" she said.</p><p>Facebook also launched a \"Canadian Election Integrity\" project last year to head off concerns over how its platform could be used to undermine the 2019 Canadian federal election.</p><p>But Mr. Keen expects European regulators to carry the fight, particularly European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager. \"She's the only one willing to take on Apple and force them to pay their taxes,\" he says. \"She's the only one who is really looking critically [at] Google.\"</p><p>Just as the U.S. government's antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s loosened the company's stranglehold on desktop computing and paved the way for startups such as Google and Facebook, Mr. Keen believes the multibillion-dollar fines Ms. Vestager has slapped on Silicon Valley giants are intended to foster innovation by preventing the big tech companies from using their global dominance to squash smaller competitors.</p><p>The most significant reforms will come this May, when the European Union launches the General Data Protection Regulation. The aggressive internet-privacy reforms will, among other things, give users the \"right to be forgotten\" by allowing consumers to delete the personal data that private companies hold about them.</p><p>While critics, including Mr. Keen, say the rules unintentionally favour companies large enough to afford to comply, he still sees the regulations as a good start. \"The important thing is that they are beginning to pass some laws around data and the protection of consumer data,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Keen won't predict how long it will be before Silicon Valley is forced to make meaningful changes to adapt to consumer and government pressure. But just as technology changes quickly, so can society's attitude toward it. Or as one venture capitalist in the book describes the process of social and economic disruption: \"it's nothing, nothing, nothing - and then something dramatic.\" </p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/dark-future-of-data-wars-inevitable-unless-consumers-push-back-author-warns/article38028827/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/dark-future-of-data-wars-inevitable-unless-consumers-push-back-author-warns/article38028827/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20180220escenic_38028827</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPD-VJX1-F072-J2T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1226\"/><timeReceived>1:48 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Mr. Kohm -- echoing Facebook's own argument -- cautioned that Facebookwas not responsible for the consulting firm's reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and most likely had not broken its promises to the F.T.C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The Cambridge Analytica data leak set off a  reckoning for Facebookand a far-reaching debate about the tech industry, which has collected more information about more people than almost any other in history. At the same time, the F.T.C., which is investigating Facebook, is under growing attack for what critics say is a systemic failure to police Silicon Valley's giants and their enormous appetite for personal data.</p><p>  Almost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The F.T.C. serves as the country's de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech firms accused of misleading people about how their information is used.</p><p>  But many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members, and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the F.T.C. has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebookinquiry looms as a referendum on the F.T.C.'s future.</p><p>  ''They have been asleep at the switch,'' said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. ''It's a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.''</p><p>  Even if the agency does not penalize Facebookover the Cambridge incident -- and some former F.T.C. officials disagree with Mr. Kohm's reasoning -- the commission could punish the company for other offenses. Former officials say they've been told that its inquiry has expanded to include recent security and privacy breaches as well as Facebook's secretive data-sharing deals with Amazon, Netflix and other companies. Facebookdeclined to comment on the inquiry.</p><p>  The agency -- overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president's party -- is habitually tight-lipped. Joseph J. Simons, the chairman, declined to comment on the Kohm memo.</p><p>  ''If the F.T.C. had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,'' Mr. Simons said in a statement. ''Our investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.''</p><p>  The agency's defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the F.T.C. to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.</p><p>  ''The act creating the F.T.C. was not designed with privacy in mind,'' said Jessica L. Rich, a consumer protection expert who formerly led the F.T.C.'s consumer bureau. ''That they've been able to bring hundreds of privacy and data security cases is actually quite a feat, not only given the limitations on their authority but the challenges companies have mounted, especially recently.''</p><p>  A Cautionary Tale</p><p>  As the federal government's main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the F.T.C. has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robo-callers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.</p><p>  But it is hampered by its relatively small size -- about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission -- and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency's enforcement arm, led by Mr. Kohm, doesn't have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the F.T.C. chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants.</p><p>  ''They have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,'' said Justin Brookman, a former F.T.C. official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.</p><p>  F.T.C. officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the last decade.</p><p>  Still, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech.</p><p>  Critics said a greater problem was cultural. The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as ''KidVid.'' Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the F.T.C.'s power to issue new regulations.</p><p>  Even today, ''in just about every meeting I have at the F.T.C., staff mention KidVid,'' said Josh Golin, the executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>  Fears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.</p><p>  ''They think of themselves as deal-makers, not cops,'' said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. ''They have an institutional culture of deference.''</p><p>  That has hobbled the agency's approach to tech giants, leading to inadequate responses to privacy violations or efforts to squeeze out emerging competitors, according to Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department and president of the consumer group Public Knowledge. The F.T.C. needs legislation to allow it to set new rules for the era of big tech, he argued.</p><p>  In 2013, for example, F.T.C. commissioners overruled a staff recommendation to sue Google for abusing its dominance in search to harm rivals. Three years later, when Google began merging data collected by several of its services, including Gmail and the ad technology platform DoubleClick, consumer groups filed a complaint with the F.T.C. calling the practice ''highly deceptive.'' The agency took no public action.</p><p>  Nor did the F.T.C. penalize Facebookafter it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union's antitrust chief fined Facebook$122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition.</p><p>  (The social network said it had notified users of the change with new terms of service and allowed them to opt out of aspects of how Facebookused the data.)</p><p>  The F.T.C. has defended its record on privacy, pointing for instance to a $22.5 million fine imposed on Google in 2012, for bypassing privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser in violation of a consent agreement. The fine was the largest civil penalty in the agency's history.</p><p>  Former officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.</p><p>  Ashkan Soltani, who was the F.T.C.'s chief technologist from 2014 to 2015, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn't see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi's data could not identify specific individuals.</p><p>  Mr. Soltani argued that the F.T.C. needed to get ahead of a technology that would soon become highly intrusive. (He eventually persuaded the agency to investigate, and in 2015 the F.T.C. approved a settlement with Nomi.)</p><p>  Today, dozens of companies gather, use or sell location information so precise that it can pinpoint a phone within a few yards. The data is so detailed that it can often be linked to a specific person -- and frequently harvested without clear consent.</p><p>  Proving Harm</p><p>  President Trump's arrival in Washington kicked off a period of uncertainty at the F.T.C. For 16 months, three of five seats remained vacant on the commission, which was initially led by an acting chairwoman, Maureen K. Ohlhausen, an advocate of ''regulatory humility.''</p><p>  Ms. Ohlhausen's staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic F.T.C. investigations.</p><p>  In an interview, Ms. Ohlhausen denied ordering a slowdown and cited privacy actions she had brought against PayPal and Lenovo. But she acknowledged having argued against going after what she regarded as small cases, like Nomi.</p><p>With limited resources, she said, the F.T.C. should ''pursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.''</p><p>  But that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebookand Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm.</p><p>  Two former staffers said Mr. Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.</p><p>  In recent months, F.T.C. employees meeting with Mr. Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users' locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Mr. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams, and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting.</p><p>  Mr. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Mr. Kohm ''has dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Top, the commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission, which is under attack for what critics say is a systemic failure to police tech giants for violations of consumer privacy</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>above left, Maureen K.

But some professionals may not have the time or money to go back to school and get a data science or computer engineering degree. As an alternative, these data and coding academies, which say they offer preparation for some coding and data scientist roles in only a few months, are popping up all around California.</p><p>One such academy is <url normalizedValue=\"http://zipfianacademy.com/\">Zipfian</url>--which is a big data boot camp of sorts that teaches students about coding, data and more in three months and for around $16,000 before deferral or hiring reimbursement plans, according       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.informationweek.com/big-data/big-data-analytics/become-a-data-scientist-in-12-weeks/d/d-id/1111537\">to an article in</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InformationWeek</emphasis> and the academy's site.</p><p>A typical day at the academy might include a communal breakfast with open office hours, followed by code review and a lecture in the morning, open work time and lunch with guest speakers mid-day and open work time or hack on exercises--and sometimes more guest lectures--in the evening, according to its site.</p><p>Zipfian's CEO Ryan Orban told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InformationWeek</emphasis> that the academy has even partnered with a few big tech companies--such as Facebook and LinkedIn--for post-camp positions. (Orban did not respond to a request for an interview with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FierceCIO</emphasis>).</p><p>But before IT hiring managers get too anxious, take note--some of these coding academies have come under scrutiny recently by the local regulators in California who say they <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.infoworld.com/t/it-training/california-threatens-code-boot-camps-the-boot-235409\">need to be regulated like other educational institutions</url>. </p><p>An article in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InfoWorld </emphasis>notes that the camps could face $50,000 fines or closed doors if they don't comply with the state's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bppe.ca.gov/\">Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education</url>, which claims they are running \"as unlicensed postsecondary educational institutions,\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InfoWorld </emphasis>said<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">. </emphasis></p><p>In addition to Zipfian,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> InfoWorld</emphasis> notes that Hackbright Academy, Dev Bootcamp, Hack Reactor, App Academy are also coming under scrutiny in the Golden State. Some of the groups have already started working with regulators, the article added. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InfoWorld</emphasis>  points out that while the likes of some academies \"have the flavor of a trade school and cite their graduates' offers for jobs with name-brand tech companies after completing their courses,\" other groups, like those that are promoted as more as learn-to-code, skills \"camps\" may see themselves as more unconventional--and thus in need of less regulation. </p><p>The first group of about a dozen students at San Francisco-based Zipfian started in mid-September and were set to finish up in early January. The next batch was slated to start late last month, according to the academy's site.</p><p>At a time when data scientists are in such high demand that they have been deemed the \"rock stars\" of the IT world, tech companies, aspiring data scientists--and those in the tech media--will no doubt be keeping a close eye on how this regulatory dance plays out. </p><p>Related Articles: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fiercecio.com/story/searching-data-scientists-they-come-sets-3/2013-12-19\">Searching for data scientists?

The address 1555 Blake St. is listed as its Denver location with the Colorado Secretary of State and on its LinkedIn profile, although it's not clear if that's where the ultimate headquarters will be.</p><p>The move comes after CEO Alex Karp <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.axios.com/palantir-alex-karp-headquarters-california-1dd44454-89c5-4773-a01d-c0f183654c08.html\">told Axios during a May interview on HBO</url> that he was getting close to a decision on whether to move the company out of California, citing in particular the \"increasing intolerance and monoculture of Silicon Valley.\" And he specifically cited Colorado as a potential destination.</p><p>\"We haven't picked a place yet, but it's going to be closer to the East Coast than the West Coast,\" Karp said during the interview. \"If I had to guess, I would guess something like Colorado.\"</p><p>Billionaire investor Peter Thiel and a group of partners that included Karp launched Palantir in 2003 out of the company PayPal. The firm creates data-analysis software and sells it to governments and to large companies.</p><p>While much of its work is noncontroversial - its platforms are used by sectors ranging from automotive to manufacturing to boost the efficiency of supply chains and increase vehicle safety - the company has become a target of protest for some of its efforts. The company, for example, works with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and counter-terrorism agencies as part of its large government focus, and Karp said in the Axios interview that he's lost some of his favorite employees because of their concerns over the work.</p><p>It is not clear how many employees it will relocate to Denver or hire new for the positions. Palantir has about 2,500 employees worldwide.</p><p>Deborah Cameron, chief business development officer for the Denver Economic Development &amp; Opportunity department, said Wednesday that while the city was aware of the project, it did not provide any financial incentives to Palantir. And based on a review of incentives approved over the past year by the Colorado Economic Development Commission, it does not appear that the company has sought or received any public funding for the relocation from the state, as many larger firms do when they move or expand to the state.</p><p>The company already has employees working in Colorado. It also has posted listings on sites such as LinkedIn and Indeed.com for new jobs in Denver and Aurora that include a software infrastructure engineer, a Splunk engineer/architect and an information systems security officer.</p><p>The relocation comes at a pivotal time for the firm, which filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July to go public at an undetermined date. It also noted in July that it is in the process of raising $961 million in financing, about $550 million of which it already has secured, according to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/08/13/palantir-technologies-direct-listing-seen-likely.html\">a story by the Silicon Valley Business Journal</url>, a sister publication of Denver Business Journal.</p><p>In relocating to Denver, Palantir, which has been headquartered in Palo Alto, joins a growing list of Bay Area technology companies that have moved from Northern California in recent years or have chosen to place expansions in Colorado that involve a larger workforce than that which is located at their headquarters. Those include the likes of workplace communications firm Slack Technologies (NYSE: WORK), fintech company Marqeta, background-check firm Checkr and payroll-software provider Gusto.</p><p>While many of those have cited both the rising tax and regulatory burdens in California, as well as the highly educated Colorado workforce and quality-of-life benefits of the Centennial State, Palantir appears to have chosen to exit Silicon Valley for more ideological reasons. During the Axios interview, Karp noted the increasing number of big-tech firms that have been pressured by employees to turn down government contracts, and he himself said he's been distanced from Silicon Valley for about 15 years, now working from a barn in New Hampshire.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?
