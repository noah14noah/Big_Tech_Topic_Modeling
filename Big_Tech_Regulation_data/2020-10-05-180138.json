German newspaper publishers have sued Google and Yahoo under copyright rules. And Facebook is awaiting a verdict from the European Court of Justice on whether it unlawfully shared information about European users with U.S. authorities, its latest battle here.</p><p>\"The approach in the EU toward this kind of Internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile,\" said Christian Wey, a competition expert at the University of Dusseldorf-Germany.</p><p>Google, in particular, is under the microscope, especially after a European Court of Justice ruling in May  allowed people the \"right to be forgotten\" - it requires Google to delete links from search results if users request them to be removed.

The EU has not been enforcing its own laws.\"</p><p>Facebook and Google deny such allegations, accusing local politicians of playing on public fears after the scandal surrounding mass surveillance by the National Security Agency.</p><p>Another area causing deep ire in Europe is American companies' aggressive push to win the best tax deals for themselves by jurisdiction-shopping - a common practice in the USA where  states compete to lure business with incentives.</p><p>The European Commission released documents last week explaining why it decided in June 2013 to open an investigation into whether Apple received unfair tax breaks from Ireland.</p><p>\"The approach in the EU toward this kind of Internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile.\"</p><p>Christian Wey, a competition expert at the University of Dusseldorf-Germany</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PNWSJL-pen-861603420</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PNWSJL2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DV1-BP31-DYJJ-P3NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Pensacola News Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pensacola News Journal (Florida)</publicationName><edition>2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 5, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The EU has not been enforcing its own laws.\"</p><p>Facebook and Googledeny such allegations, accusing local politicians of playing on public fears after the scandal surrounding mass surveillance by the National Security Agency.</p><p>Another area causing deep ire in Europe is American companies' aggressive push to win the best tax deals for themselves by jurisdiction-shopping - a common practice in the USA where  states compete to lure business with incentives.</p><p>The European Commission released documents last week explaining why it decided in June 2013 to open an investigation into whether Apple received unfair tax breaks from Ireland.</p><p>\"The approach in the EU toward this kind of Internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile.\"</p><p>Christian Wey, a competition expert at the University of Dusseldorf-Germany</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLATDY-brv-796373340</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLATDY2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D9M-1641-JC3H-03PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256483</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 FLORIDA TODAY All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FLORIDA TODAY (Brevard County, Florida)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 5, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The EU has not been enforcing its own laws.\"</p><p>Facebook and Google deny such allegations, accusing local politicians of playing on public fears after the scandal surrounding mass surveillance by the National Security Agency.</p><p>Another area causing deep ire in Europe is American companies' aggressive push to win the best tax deals for themselves by jurisdiction-shopping - a common practice in the USA where  states compete to lure business with incentives.</p><p>The European Commission released documents last week explaining why it decided in June 2013 to open an investigation into whether Apple received unfair tax breaks from Ireland.</p><p>\"The approach in the EU toward this kind of Internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile.\"</p><p>Christian Wey, a competition expert at the University of Dusseldorf-Germany</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWJNL-wil-1148194895</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWJNL2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K2V-R7T1-JC3H-045K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">255272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The News Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News Journal (Wilmington, Delaware)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 5, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

German newspaper publishers have sued Google and Yahoo under copyright rules. And Facebook is awaiting a verdict from the European Court of Justice on whether it unlawfully shared information about European users with U.S. authorities, its latest battle here.</p><p>\"The approach in the EU toward this kind of Internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile,\" said Christian Wey, a competition expert at the University of Dusseldorf-Germany.</p><p>Google, in particular, is under the microscope, especially after a European Court of Justice ruling in May  allowed people the \"right to be forgotten\" - it requires Google to delete links from search results if users request them to be removed.

The EU has not been enforcing its own laws.\"</p><p>Facebook and Google deny such allegations, accusing local politicians of playing on public fears after the scandal surrounding mass surveillance by the National Security Agency.</p><p>Another area causing deep ire in Europe is American companies' aggressive push to win the best tax deals for themselves by jurisdiction-shopping - a common practice in the USA where  states compete to lure business with incentives.</p><p>The European Commission released documents last week explaining why it decided in June 2013 to open an investigation into whether Apple received unfair tax breaks from Ireland.</p><p>\"The approach in the EU toward this kind of Internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile.\"</p><p>Christian Wey, a competition expert at the University of Dusseldorf-Germany</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESREG-des-1142144621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESREG2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FF9-VX41-JC3H-01M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">254399</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Des Moines Register All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Des Moines Register</publicationName><edition>2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 5, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Europe will succeed in finding a solution to this problem.\"</p><p>As a result, some of these companies are facing sanctions as regulators, companies and individuals on the continent bring case after case against them, and in some instances even speak about breaking them up. While the tech giants have not gotten a free pass on competition and privacy issues in the U.S., they run up against a higher degree of suspicion, or even animosity, in Europe.</p><p>Over the past year, EU authorities have accused Apple of exploiting tax loopholes and breaking anti-competition laws. German newspaper publishers have sued Google and Yahoo under copyright rules. And Facebook is awaiting a verdict from the European Court of Justice on whether it unlawfully shared information about European users with American authorities, its latest battle here.</p><p>\"The approach in the EU toward this kind of Internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile,\" said Christian Wey, a competition expert at the University of Dusseldorf-Germany. \"It makes sense, because a lot of businesses go downhill because (for example) of Google and in the end, politicians (are sensitive to voters) here.\"</p><p>Google, in particular, is under the microscope, especially after a European Court of Justice ruling in May allowed people the \"right to be forgotten\" -- it requires Google to delete links from search results if users request them to be removed. Tens of thousands have already applied.</p><p>Some say that case illustrates one major trans-Atlantic clash -- American business models hitting up against data-protection laws -- in Europe, privacy rights are paramount.</p><p>\"In the U.S., freedom of speech extends to ... Internet service providers such as Facebook and Google,\" said Jan Oster, who specializes in communication law and information technology at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. \"Europe takes a more balanced approach between freedom of speech and rights such as privacy or reputation.\"</p><p>Facebook has long run into problems with European data-protection regulators who want the social-networking giant to be more transparent about what it does with its users' data -- it has been hauled into court a number of times in Germany and in other European jurisdictions over this issue.</p><p>In the latest battle, the European Court of Justice is due to rule on a case brought by a student group, Europe Versus Facebook, that alleges the social network unlawfully transmitted its users' personal data from Facebook accounts to the U.S. government.</p><p>\"Under U.S. laws, the U.S. companies have to do surveillance or they have to help the U.S. government,\" said Max Schrems, founder of Europe Versus Facebook. \"Under European law, they are not allowed to do that. ... The EU has not been enforcing its own laws.\"</p><p>Facebook and Google deny such allegations, accusing local politicians of playing on public fears after the scandal surrounding mass surveillance by the National Security Agency.</p><p>Another area causing deep ire in Europe is American companies' aggressive push to win the best tax deals for themselves by jurisdiction-shopping -- a common practice in the USA where states compete to lure business with incentives.</p><p>The European Commission on Tuesday released documents explaining why it decided in June 2013 to open an investigation into whether Apple received unfair tax breaks from Ireland that could violate European anti-competition rules. The commission is also reportedly looking into a tax arrangement between Amazon and Luxembourg.</p><p>Those probes reflect increasing scrutiny of tax-avoidance schemes throughout the world, not just in Europe, said Emer Traynor, a spokeswoman for the European Commissioner for Taxation, Customs Union, Anti-Fraud, Audit and Statistics in Brussels.</p><p>\"Mismatches between member states' tax systems and those of non-EU countries (such as the USA) facilitate the type of aggressive tax (avoidance strategies) that we see today,\" said Traynor.</p><p>American companies doing business in the EU contacted by USA TODAY declined to speak on the record about their dealings with European officials. In private, however, tech executives said their companies tend to comply with EU demands because they want access to the continent's market of 500 million well-educated, tech-savvy consumers.</p><p>EU officials stressed that they aren't unfairly targeting anyone.</p><p>\"Companies from outside the EU are well aware that they must comply with EU rules if they are active in the EU,\" said Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, in an e-mail. \"The Commission enforces competition rules on all companies irrespective of the national flag they may carry.\"</p><p>Still, some say Europe won't gain from its antagonism toward the tech titans. If they come off as too harsh, EU regulators could send a signal to tech entrepreneurs that Europe is willing to stifle innovation challenging the status quo, analysts said.</p><p>\"We are wrong, however, to look at these companies in an antagonistic way,\" said Ben Tonra, head of the school of politics and international relations at University College Dublin. \"We need to look at these companies as an opportunity, not just in terms of their own direct employment within Europe and the innovation they bring to Europe. ... These are companies which are redefining technology, the use of technology. It is a very negative and short-sighted approach on the part of the European Union to go after them.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>photo Martin Meissner, AP</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-67733484</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D8P-4XN1-DYRR-92G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1094\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Gannett Company, Inc.

US companies have already invested billions of dollars to comply with the new rules,\" Wilbur Ross, the U.S. commerce secretary, wrote about the European General Data Protection Regulation rules <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ft.com/content/9d261f44-6255-11e8-bdd1-cc0534df682c\">in an op-ed in the Financial Times</url> in May.</p><p>It's not the first time Cook has gone on the attack. Earlier this year, he chastised Facebook following revelations that tens of millions of Facebook users' data was improperly harvested and used by the Trump-connected political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. \"I wouldn't be in this situation,\" Cook said then. \"The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer if our customer was our product. We've elected not to do that.\"</p><p>Shortly after, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg fired back that Cook's comments were <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/04/02/markzuckerberg-says-tim-cooks-facebook-criticism.html\">\"extremely glib</url>,\" explaining: \"I think it's important that we don't all get Stockholm Syndrome, and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

It appears that happened withBB&amp;T's agreement to buy SunTrust Banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The inescapable role that massive technology investments are playing in the future of banking is one of the biggest factors. While BB&amp;T and SunTrust have made tech a top priority, they realized they could make those investments more efficiently if they combined, industry experts said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, both companies were rapidly approaching the $250 billion asset threshold that triggers stricter regulatory capital requirements, so it made sense for them to vault over that mark together rather than inch over in coming years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The most important piece may have been that the banks' leaders - Kelly King at BB&amp;T and Bill Rogers at SunTrust - wanted the deal to happen.</p><p>\"We talked about the fact that, in order to survive in this quickly changing world, it's important to be willing to change,\" King, BB&amp;T's chairman and CEO, said during a Thursday conference call to discuss the $28 billion deal.</p><p>\"In a relatively short period of time, we were able to put the deal together because it's just such a logical deal,\" King added. \"I think it's just one of those natural things that just evolved when two good companies and, I'll speak for Bill, a great leader sees what the possibilities are.\"</p><p>BB&amp;T had long coveted SunTrust, but the Atlanta bank's prior leaders resisted, said Chris Marinac, an analyst at FIG Partners. Rogers, SunTrust's chairman and CEO, didn't allow a longstanding rivalry to stand in the way of a logical business move.</p><p>\"Taking the best of BB&amp;T and taking the best of SunTrust really does make sense,\" Marinac said. \"How do you get more earnings growth? You combine two companies and marry the back offices.\"</p><p>The need to continually make big tech investments probably led to the combination as much as any other supporting factor, said Rob Klingler, a banking lawyer at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.</p><p>\"You're not going to have to make the same technology investments twice,\" Klingler said. \"You don't need two mobile apps. Now you can hire one team of programmers instead of two teams.\"</p><p>The combined company's larger scale may provide better leverage to negotiate lower pricing on contracts with Microsoft, IBM or other vendors, Klingler said.</p><p>King, in a video message to BB&amp;T employees, touted the new company ability to compete with the nation's biggest banks.</p><p>\"Remember, as we go through this that we not only can compete with anybody - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup - we will be able to compete heads up with anybody,\" King said. \"We will be better, I believe, than any of those larger banks because we still have better touch. We can compete. We will compete. We will win.\"</p><p>Cost savings were a prime topic during the conference call.</p><p>The deal is expected to create a company with a 51% efficiency ratio, a level that would be unimaginable for each bank to achieve on its own.</p><p>BB&amp;T's efficiency ratio at Dec. 31 was 60.7%, while SunTrust's was 62.7%.</p><p>During a fourth-quarter conference call, SunTrust executives were peppered with questions about the company's high efficiency ratio. It was always going to be a challenge for SunTrust to improve due to the incentive-based compensation tied to its large investment bank, Marinac said.</p><p>\"Our business model, I think, given the way we're structured, we're not going to be a low-50% efficiency ratio company,\" Rogers said during last month's conference call to discuss earnings.</p><p>BB&amp;T and SunTrust will also cut costs by closing or selling branches and eliminating redundant jobs. About a quarter of the banks' branches are within two miles of each other.</p><p>\"This overlap is almost unparalleled in banking, particularly among larger institutions,\" Daryl Bible, BB&amp;T's chief financial officer, said during the call.</p><p>The companies plan to divest about $1.4 billion of deposits to receive regulatory approval.</p><p>The plan is to generate about $1.6 billion in annual pretax cost savings, net of investments, by removing redundancies with facilities, IT, shared services, branches and third-party vendors.</p><p>It's a move many other banks should seriously consider, as the combined company will be better equipped to handle a recession or a decline in loan demand, said David George, an analyst at Robert W. Baird.</p><p>\"This is what the sector needs, given the tougher growth outlook over the near-to-intermediate term,\" George wrote in a Thursday note to clients.</p><p>The new company, which will be rebranded and based in Charlotte, N.C., will not pocket all of those savings. The plan is to earmark an additional $100 million a year to technology investments.</p><p>BB&amp;T said in November that it spends about $1 billion a year on technology. SunTrust has not disclosed its level of tech spending.</p><p>\"Increasing technology investments by $100 million and still maintaining a 51% efficiency ratio shows the market how important scale is,\" said Stephen Scouten, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>The regulatory environment seems more conducive to big deals, especially transactions involving banks of this size, Klingler said.</p><p>When the threshold for systemically important financial institutions wasraised from $100 billion to $250 billionin assets, it removed a critical barrier to this level of M&amp;A.</p><p>\"Both BB&amp;T and SunTrust had already done the work and built up the infrastructure to go over $250 billion,\" Klingler said. \"Instead of growing slowly over $250 billion, just go ahead and combine.\"</p><p>The banks plan to complete the deal this year, with King even commenting that it could close on Sept. 12, his birthday. King, who will turn 71 on that date, had long hoped to pull off a huge deal before retiring from the only company he has ever worked for.</p><p>King expressed confidence during Thursday's call that the deal would get regulators' blessing.</p><p>\"There's nothing that I can see that will stand in the way of this combination,\" King said.</p><p>The final hurdle was more of a psychological issue than a financial one, industry observers said.</p><p>John A. Allison, BB&amp;T's former chairman and CEO, said those kinds of impediments prevented a deal between the two companies from happening sooner. Allison, who admitted talking to Regions Financial and Fifth Third while at the helm, always envisioned BB&amp;T striking a deal along the lines of what was announced Thursday.</p><p>\"We pursued SunTrust when I was there,\" said Allison, who retired as CEO in 2008 and as chairman a year later. \"We couldn't get the cultural issues resolved.\"</p><p>Addressing the deal as a merger of equals, with parity in the executive suite and the boardroom, seems to have solved those problems, Marinac said.</p><p>\"BB&amp;T had been pursuing SunTrust for decades, but the prior management at SunTrust didn't want to hear it,\" Marinac said. \"I think they realized that more is better economically. It's about trying to get the right sort of framework.\"</p><p>The effort makes sense, given King's long-held approach to bank M&amp;A.</p><p>\"I created a measurement system 25 years ago - I still keep the sheet in my desk - that's based on quality, profitability and growth in that order,\" King said in a 2015 interview after being chosen as American Banker'sBanker of the Year.</p><p>\"Growth is always third,\" King said. \"When I look at a merger, it has to be strategically and culturally right and the economics have to make sense. That's why you haven't seen us do any stupid things.\"</p><p>Paul Davis contributed to this article.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000168-c961-dc46-ab68-ef6bed2c0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCD-3HW1-F06X-W557-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1232\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

It appears that happened withBB&amp;T's agreement to buy SunTrust Banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The inescapable role that massive technology investments are playing in the future of banking is one of the biggest factors. While BB&amp;T and SunTrust have made tech a top priority, they realized they could make those investments more efficiently if they combined, industry experts said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, both companies were rapidly approaching the $250 billion asset threshold that triggers stricter regulatory capital requirements, so it made sense for them to vault over that mark together rather than inch over in coming years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The most important piece may have been that the banks' leaders - Kelly King at BB&amp;T and Bill Rogers at SunTrust - wanted the deal to happen.</p><p>\"We talked about the fact that, in order to survive in this quickly changing world, it's important to be willing to change,\" King, BB&amp;T's chairman and CEO, said during a Thursday conference call to discuss the $28 billion deal.</p><p>\"In a relatively short period of time, we were able to put the deal together because it's just such a logical deal,\" King added. \"I think it's just one of those natural things that just evolved when two good companies and, I'll speak for Bill, a great leader sees what the possibilities are.\"</p><p>BB&amp;T had long coveted SunTrust, but the Atlanta bank's prior leaders resisted, said Chris Marinac, an analyst at FIG Partners. Rogers, SunTrust's chairman and CEO, didn't allow a longstanding rivalry to stand in the way of a logical business move.</p><p>\"Taking the best of BB&amp;T and taking the best of SunTrust really does make sense,\" Marinac said. \"How do you get more earnings growth? You combine two companies and marry the back offices.\"</p><p>The need to continually make big tech investments probably led to the combination as much as any other supporting factor, said Rob Klingler, a banking lawyer at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.</p><p>\"You're not going to have to make the same technology investments twice,\" Klingler said. \"You don't need two mobile apps. Now you can hire one team of programmers instead of two teams.\"</p><p>The combined company's larger scale may provide better leverage to negotiate lower pricing on contracts with Microsoft, IBM or other vendors, Klingler said.</p><p>Cost savings were a prime topic during the conference call.</p><p>The deal is expected to create a company with a 51% efficiency ratio, a level that would be unimaginable for each bank to achieve on its own.</p><p>BB&amp;T's efficiency ratio at Dec. 31 was 60.7%, while SunTrust's was 62.7%.</p><p>During a fourth-quarter conference call, SunTrust executives were peppered with questions about the company's high efficiency ratio. It was always going to be a challenge for SunTrust to improve due to the incentive-based compensation tied to its large investment bank, Marinac said.</p><p>\"Our business model, I think, given the way we're structured, we're not going to be a low-50% efficiency ratio company,\" Rogers said during last month's conference call to discuss earnings.</p><p>BB&amp;T and SunTrust will also cut costs by closing or selling branches and eliminating redundant jobs. About a quarter of the banks' branches are within two miles of each other.</p><p>\"This overlap is almost unparalleled in banking, particularly among larger institutions,\" Daryl Bible, BB&amp;T's chief financial officer, said during the call.</p><p>The companies plan to divest about $1.4 billion of deposits to receive regulatory approval.</p><p>The plan is to generate about $1.6 billion in annual pretax cost savings, net of investments, by removing redundancies with facilities, IT, shared services, branches and third-party vendors.</p><p>It's a move many other banks should seriously consider, as the combined company will be better equipped to handle a recession or a decline in loan demand, said David George, an analyst at Robert W. Baird.</p><p>\"This is what the sector needs, given the tougher growth outlook over the near-to-intermediate term,\" George wrote in a Thursday note to clients.</p><p>The new company, which will be rebranded and based in Charlotte, N.C., will not pocket all of those savings. The plan is to earmark an additional $100 million a year to technology investments.</p><p>BB&amp;T said in November that it spends about $1 billion a year on technology. SunTrust has not disclosed its level of tech spending.</p><p>\"Increasing technology investments by $100 million and still maintaining a 51% efficiency ratio shows the market how important scale is,\" said Stephen Scouten, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>The regulatory environment seems more conducive to big deals, especially transactions involving banks of this size, Klingler said.</p><p>When the threshold for systemically important financial institutions wasraised from $100 billion to $250 billionin assets, it removed a critical barrier to this level of M&amp;A.</p><p>\"Both BB&amp;T and SunTrust had already done the work and built up the infrastructure to go over $250 billion,\" Klingler said. \"Instead of growing slowly over $250 billion, just go ahead and combine.\"</p><p>The banks plan to complete the deal this year, with King even commenting that it could close on Sept. 12, his birthday. King, who will turn 71 on that date, had long hoped to pull off a huge deal before retiring from the only company he has ever worked for.</p><p>King expressed confidence during Thursday's call that the deal would get regulators' blessing.</p><p>\"There's nothing that I can see that will stand in the way of this combination,\" King said.</p><p>The final hurdle was more of a psychological issue than a financial one, industry observers said.</p><p>John A. Allison, BB&amp;T's former chairman and CEO, said those kinds of impediments prevented a deal between the two companies from happening sooner. Allison, who admitted talking to Regions Financial and Fifth Third while at the helm, always envisioned BB&amp;T striking a deal along the lines of what was announced Thursday.</p><p>\"We pursued SunTrust when I was there,\" said Allison, who retired as CEO in 2008 and as chairman a year later. \"We couldn't get the cultural issues resolved.\"</p><p>Addressing the deal as a merger of equals, with parity in the executive suite and the boardroom, seems to have solved those problems, Marinac said.</p><p>\"BB&amp;T had been pursuing SunTrust for decades, but the prior management at SunTrust didn't want to hear it,\" Marinac said. \"I think they realized that more is better economically. It's about trying to get the right sort of framework.\"</p><p>The effort makes sense, given King's long-held approach to bank M&amp;A.</p><p>\"I created a measurement system 25 years ago - I still keep the sheet in my desk - that's based on quality, profitability and growth in that order,\" King said in a 2015 interview after being chosen as American Banker'sBanker of the Year.</p><p>\"Growth is always third,\" King said. \"When I look at a merger, it has to be strategically and culturally right and the economics have to make sense. That's why you haven't seen us do any stupid things.\"</p><p>Paul Davis contributed to this article.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000168-c961-dc46-ab68-ef6bed2c0000-27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCH-3251-F06X-W0HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1159\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

The commission won some praise for standing up to big tech. But theatrics aside, this decision is misguided, harmful to consumers and almost entirely beside the point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>Start with the alleged offenses. Google licenses its Android software to phone-makers for free. If they want to offer its app store, called Google Play, they must also install a suite of the company's other products, such as its search engine and web browser. All told, this is a pretty popular trade-off: Android is now used in about 80 percent of the world's smartphones.</p><p><br/>Europe's regulators object. \"These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits,\" said Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner. \"They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\"</p><p><br/>This statement is wrong in nearly every particular.</p><p><br/>For starters, Google isn't unduly inhibiting competition. Android users can select among more than 3 million apps on the Play store, including plenty of alternatives to the Google products that come pre-installed. It may be true, as Vestager said, that few users \"are curious enough to look for another search app or browser.\" But fostering curiosity probably isn't a job for antitrust regulators.</p><p><br/>More to the point, the decision conceives of competition too narrowly. Android may be a dominant operating system. But because it's free and open-source, it has vastly expanded the range of choices otherwise available to consumers. Developers around the world have built products using Android and often offer them free of charge.</p><p><br/>All this, though, is premised on that initial trade-off: Manufacturers get a free operating system; consumers get cheap phones and free apps; and Google gets the resulting data and advertising dollars. If the European Commission throws a wrench into this cycle by making it harder for Google to serve ads, the likely result is that it will start charging for Android -- thus leading to more expensive phones, reduced innovation and less choice for consumers.</p><p><br/>The damage doesn't end there. One way Google imposes quality control over this ecosystem is by prohibiting manufacturers from using \"forked\" or customized versions of Android if they want to keep offering Google's apps. The European Commission wants to stop this practice in the interests of competition. Yet doing so would erode security and worsen the problem of \"fragmentation,\" or inconsistencies across different versions of Android. Neither is in the interests of consumers.</p><p><br/>For all that, the European Commission's decision comes about a decade too late to achieve even its stated goals. Because Google's apps benefit from network effects and the power of big data, they get better as they become more popular. The better they are, in turn, the more people want them. After so many years of Google's dominance, few consumers want to do without its apps and few manufacturers want to make products that exclude them. No amount of meddling by Europe's bureaucrats is likely to change that dynamic.</p><p><br/>In imposing this admittedly arbitrary penalty, then, the European Commission is threatening to harm consumers, impede innovation, make life difficult for developers, and undermine the security and usability of applications, all in pursuit of thoroughly implausible goals. If it is solving any problems along the way, it has yet to explain how.</p><p><br/>Bloomberg Opinion (July 19)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRDLY-23537142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV3-BNJ1-DY6V-N482-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bangor Daily News</copyright><publicationName>Bangor Daily News (Maine)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 19, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009898</classCode><className>TRADE PRACTICES &amp;

To unions and some Democrats, it's more sinister: the push by Facebook's <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to expand the number of visas for high-tech foreign workers is an attempt to dilute a lucrative job market with cheap, indentured labor.</p><p><br/> The answer is somewhere in between, depending as much on new technologies and the US education system's ability to keep up as on the immigration law itself. But the sliver of computer-related jobs inside the US that might be designated for foreigners - fewer than 200,000 out of 6 million - has been enough to strain a bipartisan deal in the Senate on immigration reform, showcase the power of big labor and splinter a once-chummy group of elite tech leaders hoping to make inroads in Washington.<br/> 'A lot of people agree that employers should have access to (highly trained) immigrants - that they are a benefit to the country, and we are a country of immigrants,' said B. Lindsay Lowell, director of policy studies at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of International Migration. 'I think the question is how much of a good thing is good.'<br/> The Senate immigration bill - the result of months of quiet negotiations among eight influential senators - is on track to nearly double the number of highly skilled foreign workers allowed to work in the U.S. under what's called an H-1B visa, from 65,000 to 110,000. The number of visas could climb as high as 180,000 depending on the number of applications received and the unemployment rate.<br/> The Senate Judiciary Committee planned to take up the portion of the bill relating to H-1B visas on Thursday, paving the way for an eventual floor vote and setting the tone for debate in the House.<br/> The expansion of H-1B visas is considered the first major victory for <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>new nonprofit lobbying organization, FWD.us, which receives financial backing from such big tech names as <person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>of Microsoft, <person><nameText>Reid Hoffman </nameText></person>of <person><nameText>LinkedIn </nameText></person>and Napster pioneer Sean Parker. In announcing the group, pronounced 'forward us,' <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>in April called for changes so that U.S. businesses could attract 'the most-talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born.'<br/> But support for FWD.us appeared to crack this week after the group's subsidiary ran television ads backing Republican senators who support immigration reform but also unpopular environmental programs, including the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Two backers of FWD.us - including PayPal co-founder <person><nameText>Elon Musk, </nameText></person>who now runs electric-car maker Tesla Motors - pulled their support for the group, and several left-leaning groups, including the Sierra Club and MoveOn.org, protested the ads.<br/> Frustration by some tech leaders was captured on Twitter, where site co-founder Evan Williams linked to a blog post on his new company's website that accused FWD.us of 'employing questionable lobbying techniques, misleading supporters and not being transparent about the underlying values and long-term intentions of the organization.'<br/> In an emailed statement, FWD.us spokeswoman Kate Hansen said: 'We recognize that not everyone will always agree with or be pleased by our strategy - and we're grateful for the continued support of our dedicated founders and major contributors. FWD.us remains totally committed to supporting a bipartisan policy agenda that will boost the knowledge economy, including comprehensive immigration reform.'<br/> H-1B visa applications can be complex and often are used when a qualified American candidate can't be found for a specialized job in a specific city. The visa candidate typically costs the company money and time, including extensive paperwork.<br/> The flip side is that once a company is permitted to hire a foreign worker, that employee has little leverage to demand a raise or leave for a company's competitor without putting his or her visa at risk.<br/> Scot Melland, president and chief executive of Dice Holdings Inc., which operates a career website devoted to tech jobs, said Dice.com has more than 80,000 positions posted on its site, which turn over an average of every two weeks. And while his company doesn't track how many jobs result in H-1B visa hires, Melland said he predicts that the number of tech jobs and high salaries available to Americans is likely to grow for some time. He said expanding the H-1B program is necessary, so long as safeguards prevent companies from exploiting foreign workers.<br/> 'As long as it's not abused, you're still talking about a small fraction of the tech labor market,' Melland said.<br/> Lowell said the number of information technology jobs affected by H-1B candidates is closer to 2.5 million than the broader pool of 6 million computer-related jobs frequently cited by industry. He said this more specialized labor market could become distorted by the Senate's plan to increase the number of legal immigrants overall.<br/> According to a recent report by the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, the number of skilled guest workers has increased sharply in recent years while only 1 in 2 U.S. college graduates with high-tech degrees can find a job in their field.<br/> 'You have to question why we would want to import an increasing number of foreign workers,' said Lowell, who co-wrote the report.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/dawncompk.wordpress.com/3308194/\">http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/dawncompk.wordpress.com/3308194/</url><br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Majorities of Americans say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics, a view that cuts across ideologies and parties. These findings are from a recent Pew Research Center survey[1] released this week, and displayed in today's infographic. </p><p>In the poll, some seven in 10 American adults (72%) say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics, while about two in 10 (21%) say the companies have about the right amount, and less than one in 10 (6%) say not enough power and influence. While eight in 10 people in the U.S. calling themselves Republicans (82%) are more likely to say social media companies have too much power, a clear majority of Democrats \u2014 63 percent \u2014 agree with their Republican neighbors. A similar pattern of responses cuts across ideological lines. Among Republicans, nine in 10 self-professed conservatives (89%) say social media companies have too much power and influence, somewhat more than the three-quarters (74%) of moderate or liberals in the party. Likewise, two-thirds (68%) of people calling themselves liberal Democrats believe social media companies have too much power, not much more than the six in 10 (60%) of moderate and conservative Democrats. On a separate question, Pew researchers asked if major technology companies should be regulated more, less, or about the same as now. Nearly half (47%) of Americans call for more regulation, while one in 10 (11%) say less regulation, and four in 10 (39%) say about the same as now. Again, about the same percentage of Republicans (48%) and Democrats (46%) say there should be more regulation of big tech companies. The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google are set to testify before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee on Monday. The Pew Research Center conducted the survey 16 to 22 June with 4,708 U.S. adults taking part in Pew's American Trends Panel[2]. Panel participants were recruited from a random national sample of residential addresses, who completed online questionnaires, with responses weighted to reflect U.S. population demographics and partisan affiliations.

As the following chart shows, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple spent a combined total of $55 million on D.C. lobbying last year, up 11 percent from the year before and a whopping 500 percent compared to 2010. According to figures filed with the Senate Office of Public Records this week, both Facebook and Amazon spent a record amount on lobbying in the second quarter of 2019 as they are bracing for the so-called 'techlash'. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX1087671564029940443251764100025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN5-S6S1-JCMN-Y2VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"329\"/><timeReceived>4:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Developed for business leaders who need to rapidly grasp emerging information security threats and assess the potential business impacts, Threat Horizon 2021 balances today's realities with forecasts that push the limits of thinking. The latest report highlights nine major threats, broken down into three themes, that organizations can expect to face over the next two years as a result of increasing developments in technology. The impacts of these threats mirror day-to-day operations in today's increasingly fractured world. </p><p> \"By 2021 the world will be heavily digitized. Technology will enable innovative digital business models and society will be critically dependent on technology to function,\" said Steve Durbin, Managing Director, ISF. \"This new hyperconnected digital era will create an impression of stability, security and reliability. However, it will prove to be an illusion that is shattered by new vulnerabilities, relentless attacks and disruptive cyber threats.\"  Threat Horizon 2021 focuses on particularly difficult cyber security challenges in a way that is relevant to senior business managers, information security professionals and other key organizational stakeholders. The three key themes in the latest report include:  1 \u2013 DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY EXPOSES HIDDEN DANGERS: Vast webs of intelligent devices, combined with increased speeds, automation and digitization will create possibilities for businesses and consumers that were previously out of reach. The Internet of Things (IoT) will continue to develop at an astonishing rate, with sensors and cameras embedded into a range of devices across critical infrastructure. The resulting nexus of complex digital connectivity will prove to be a weakness as modern life becomes entirely dependent on connected technologies, amplifying existing dangers and creating new ones.  2 \u2013 DIGITAL COLD WAR ENGULFS BUSINESS: By 2021, a digital cold war will unfold, causing significant damage to business. The race to develop strategically important, next generation technologies will provoke a period of intense nation state-backed espionage \u2013 intellectual property (IP) will be targeted as the battle for economic and military dominance rages on. Cloud services will become a prime target for sabotage by those seeking to cause disruption to society and business. Drones will become both the weapon and target of choice as attackers turn their attention skywards.  3 \u2013 DIGITAL COMPETITORS RIP UP THE RULEBOOK: Competing in the digital marketplace will become increasingly difficult, as businesses develop new strategies which challenge existing regulatory frameworks and social norms, enabling threats to grow in speed and precision. Vulnerabilities in software and applications will be frequently disclosed online with ever-decreasing time to fix them. Organizations will struggle when one or more of the big tech giants are broken up, plunging those reliant on their products and services into disarray. Organizations will rush to undertake overly ambitious digital transformations in a bid to stay relevant, leaving them less resilient and more vulnerable than ever.  \"Organizations that adopt a proactive approach to the management of cyber risks should review the threats \u2013 the product of significant ISF Member engagement and research \u2013 in their own organizational context. Engaging with senior leaders and risk stakeholders they should further adapt the threats using the ISF Threat Radar to both visualize impacts and to agree business responses to those threats,\" continued Durbin. \"Above all, Threat Horizon 2021 is a powerful tool to engage and prepare organizations for the digital future.\"  The ISF Threat Radar (The Radar) has been developed as a visual aid created to accompany Threat Horizon reports. The Radar is designed to help record relevant future threats to information presented in Threat Horizon reports or that are identified as specific to the organization. This includes: assessing the potential impact of these threats, determining the organization's ability to manage these threats and prioritizing plans and investment needed to remediate threats. The Radar can also facilitate engagement with the board, offering a way to visualise the extent of impending threats to the organisation and to identify areas that require investment or further development to support the business in the future.  Threat Horizon 2021, aimed at senior business executives up to and including board level, provides a practical, forward-looking view of the increasing threats in today's always-on, interconnected world. This in turn enables a better prepared, strategic approach to managing and mitigating risk.

The three key themes in the latest report include:</p><p>1 -\u00a0DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY EXPOSES HIDDEN DANGERS:Vast webs of intelligent devices, combined with increased speeds, automation and digitization will create possibilities for businesses and consumers that were previously out of reach. The Internet of Things (IoT) will continue to develop at an astonishing rate, with sensors and cameras embedded into a range of devices across critical infrastructure.

The race to develop strategically important, next generation technologies will provoke a period of intense nation state-backed espionage - intellectual property (IP) will be targeted as the battle for economic and military dominance rages on. Cloud services will become a prime target for sabotage by those seeking to cause disruption to society and business. Drones will become both the weapon and target of choice as attackers turn their attention skywards.<br/></p><p>3\u00a0-\u00a0DIGITAL COMPETITORS RIP UP THE RULEBOOK:Competing in the digital marketplace will become increasingly difficult, as businesses develop new strategies which challenge existing regulatory frameworks and social norms, enabling threats to grow in speed and precision. Vulnerabilities in software and applications will be frequently disclosed online with ever-decreasing time to fix them. Organizations will struggle when one or more of the big tech giants are broken up, plunging those reliant on their products and services into disarray. Organizations will rush to undertake overly ambitious digital transformations in a bid to stay relevant, leaving them less resilient and more vulnerable than ever.</p><p>\"Organizations that adopt a proactive approach to the management of cyber risks should review the threats - the product of significant ISF Member engagement and research - in their own organizational context. Engaging with senior leaders and risk stakeholders they should further adapt the threats using the ISF Threat Radar to both visualize impacts and to agree business responses to those threats,\" continued Durbin. \"Above all, Threat Horizon 2021 is a powerful tool to engage\u00a0and prepare organizations for the digital future.\"</p><p>The ISF Threat Radar (The Radar) has been developed as a visual aid created to accompany Threat Horizon reports.

The latest report highlights nine major threats, broken down into three themes, that organizations can expect to face over the next two years as a result of increasing developments in technology. </p><p>The impacts of these threats mirror day-to-day operations in today's increasingly fractured world. 'By 2021 the world will be heavily digitized.

'This new hyperconnected digital era will create an impression of stability, security and reliability.

Threat Horizon 2021focuses on particularly difficult cyber security challenges in a way that is relevant to senior business managers, information security professionals and other key organizational stakeholders. The three key themes in the latest report include: 1 -DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY EXPOSES HIDDEN DANGERS:Vast webs of intelligent devices, combined with increased speeds, automation and digitization will create possibilities for businesses and consumers that were previously out of reach. The Internet of Things (IoT) will continue to develop at an astonishing rate, with sensors and cameras embedded into a range of devices across critical infrastructure. The resulting nexus of complex digital connectivity will prove to be a weakness as modern life becomes entirely dependent on connected technologies, amplifying existing dangers and creating new ones. 2-DIGITAL COLD WAR ENGULFS BUSINESS:By 2021, a digital cold war will unfold, causing significant damage to business. The race to develop strategically important, next generation technologies will provoke a period of intense nation state-backed espionage - intellectual property (IP) will be targeted as the battle for economic and military dominance rages on. Cloud services will become a prime target for sabotage by those seeking to cause disruption to society and business. Drones will become both the weapon and target of choice as attackers turn their attention skywards. 3-DIGITAL COMPETITORS RIP UP THE RULEBOOK:Competing in the digital marketplace will become increasingly difficult, as businesses develop new strategies which challenge existing regulatory frameworks and social norms, enabling threats to grow in speed and precision. Vulnerabilities in software and applications will be frequently disclosed online with ever-decreasing time to fix them. Organizations will struggle when one or more of the big tech giants are broken up, plunging those reliant on their products and services into disarray.

'Organizations that adopt a proactive approach to the management of cyber risks should review the threats - the product of significant ISF Member engagement and research - in their own organizational context. Engaging with senior leaders and risk stakeholders they should further adapt the threats using the ISF Threat Radar to both visualize impacts and to agree business responses to those threats,' continued Durbin. 'Above all, Threat Horizon 2021 is a powerful tool to engageand prepare organizations for the digital future.'

Technology will enable innovative digital business models and society will be critically dependent on technology to function. This new hyperconnected digital era will create an impression of stability, security and reliability. However, the ISF believes that it will prove to be an illusion that is shattered by new vulnerabilities, relentless attacks and disruptive cyber threats. </p><p> Driven by demands for increased speed, automation and efficiency, organizations are about to face a period of significant technological upheaval. Digitization promises much, and development of the next generation of technologies will bring significant benefits to business and society. To survive in the digital world, organizations will have to adapt. To thrive, they will need to evolve.  During this webcast, Steve Durbin, Managing Director of the ISF, will highlight nine major threats, broken down into three themes, that organizations can expect to face over the next two years as a result of increasing developments in technology.  According to Durbin, the top global security threats that businesses will face in 2021 include:  1 \u2013 DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY EXPOSES HIDDEN DANGERS: Vast webs of intelligent devices, combined with increased speeds, automation and digitization will create possibilities for businesses and consumers that were previously out of reach. The Internet of Things (IoT) will continue to develop at an astonishing rate, with sensors and cameras embedded into a range of devices across critical infrastructure. The resulting nexus of complex digital connectivity will prove to be a weakness as modern life becomes entirely dependent on connected technologies, amplifying existing dangers and creating new ones.  2 \u2013 DIGITAL COLD WAR ENGULFS BUSINESS: By 2021, a digital cold war will unfold, causing significant damage to business. The race to develop strategically important, next generation technologies will provoke a period of intense nation state-backed espionage \u2013 intellectual property (IP) will be targeted as the battle for economic and military dominance rages on. Cloud services will become a prime target for sabotage by those seeking to cause disruption to society and business. Drones will become both the weapon and target of choice as attackers turn their attention skywards.  3 \u2013 DIGITAL COMPETITORS RIP UP THE RULEBOOK: Competing in the digital marketplace will become increasingly difficult, as businesses develop new strategies which challenge existing regulatory frameworks and social norms, enabling threats to grow in speed and precision. Vulnerabilities in software and applications will be frequently disclosed online with ever-decreasing time to fix them. Organizations will struggle when one or more of the big tech giants are broken up, plunging those reliant on their products and services into disarray. Organizations will rush to undertake overly ambitious digital transformations in a bid to stay relevant, leaving them less resilient and more vulnerable than ever.  Durbin will offer expertise on ways of dealing with these threats and provide insight into how organizations of all sizes can increase their cyber resilience profile.

A recording will be available following the conclusion of the event.  About the Information Security Forum  Founded in 1989, the Information Security Forum (ISF) is an independent, not-for-profit association of leading organizations from around the world. The organization is dedicated to investigating, clarifying and resolving key issues in cyber, information security and risk management and developing best practice methodologies, processes and solutions that meet the business needs of its Members.  ISF Members benefit from harnessing and sharing in-depth knowledge and practical experience drawn from within their organizations and developed through an extensive research and work program. The ISF provides a confidential forum and framework, which ensures that Members adopt leading-edge information security strategies and solutions. By working together, ISF Members avoid the major expenditure required to reach the same goals on their own. Consultancy services are available and provide ISF Members with the opportunity to purchase short-term, professional support activities to supplement the implementation of ISF products. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN926393620190329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VS1-VKV1-J9XT-P4CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"776\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 29, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This call is being recorded.</p><p>At this time, I would like to turn the presentation over to the Index host this quarter, Bryan Bergin at Cowen and Company. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN, DIRECTOR, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Okay. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bryan Bergin, senior analyst covering IT and business services at Cowen. We're very pleased today to be moderating ISG's 68th Quarterly Index Call. ISG's role as a leading adviser and influencer in global sourcing offers a unique view of the state of the outsourcing and as-a-service markets.</p><p>The company has been hosting the Index call for over 16 years, and it's really evolved with the industry. We find its position between enterprise buyers and solution providers enables us to really key in on the leading trends. And we often find that it sets a tone for the upcoming earnings season.</p><p>The format of the call today will be a presentation of the key trends by the ISG team for 30 or 40 minutes, and then we'll open up the call for questions from the audience.</p><p>I'm going to now pass it over to Steve Hall, Partner and President of ISG to kick us off. Steve?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL, PRESIDENT OF ISG EMEA &amp; PARTNER OF DIGITAL ADVISORY SERVICES, INFORMATION SERVICES GROUP, INC.: Great. Thanks a lot, Bryan. And welcome, everybody, to the ISG Global Index Conference Call. And again, thanks to everybody at Cowen and Company for hosting today.</p><p>As Bryan mentioned, I'm Steve Hall. I'm the Partner and President and Global Leader for our ISG Index. And with me today, I've got 2 special guests, Clay Calhoun, who's a Partner for ISG sourcing solutions in the Americas; and Bob Krohn, who's our ISG Partner that leads our health care practice.</p><p>So we recognize that today is Yom Kippur, that not everyone's able to join the live call. But we appreciate those that have joined and really understand the priorities of others on this solemn day of prayer and fast.</p><p>So this is our 68th Quarterly Index Call, which provides a snapshot of technology and sourcing trends in the marketplace. And of course, global recessions concerns continue amid uncertainties fed by Brexit, unrest in Asia, geopolitical events and trade and tariff wars. Customers are weighing in whether to invest for growth or support cost take-out still. Though companies want to be recession ready, they continue to spend money on creating digital products. I think generally, ISG is optimistic about the broader market. Digital is now mainstream. As we've said on the last several calls, we think those digital tailwinds are pretty strong despite some of the economic headwinds that we see.</p><p>So if we go to the key headlines, despite some pockets of unrest in various parts of the world, the commercial outsourcing market performed well overall. The annual contract value in the global combined market returned to double-digit growth, with as-a-service continuing to set new record highs, and managed services came in 7% higher than the third quarter last year.</p><p>The Americas ACV reached a new high. The managed services found us [splitting] again after a slow first half of the year. And in fact, the third quarter ACV was its best ever in the history of the Index. The as-a-service also rebounded after a sequential decline in the first 2 quarters of this year. The European market took a bit of a hit this quarter, but managed services ACV declined moderately. And the ACV -- the as-a-service performed better but has not yet broken through the $2 billion mark.</p><p>And Asia-Pacific was perhaps the brightest spot this quarter. The combined market ACV rose considerably and celebrated its third consecutive $2 billion-plus quarter. The managed services grew more than 30% due to stepped-up activity in China and India, and the as-a-service ACV continued to rise but not quite as fast as we've seen in previous quarters.</p><p>If we focused on the global commercial trends, we note that the quarterly combined market ACV has grown by $3 billion in just the last 2 years alone. Managed services ACV fell back a bit this quarter but still closed more than 400 awards as it's done for 7 quarters in a row. So by number and value, managed services is enjoying a high sustained activity.</p><p>The as-a-service ACV did break through the $7 billion mark for the first time, nearly doubling what it was 2 years ago. Much of that strength this quarter came from the Infrastructure-as-a-Service market, which totaled more than $5 billion in ACV and reached an all-time high for activity.</p><p>Year-to-date, the row of green arrows says it all. The combined market grew at a brisk pace compared to this time last year. Managed services' narrow 2% increase was against the robust 2018, and it was one of only the few times it exceeded $20 billion.</p><p>Infrastructure-as-a-service ACV stood at 27% increase, while Software-as-a-Service was at 9%. When we break out the year-to-date performance by function, we see the ACV of ITO dip up by 1% compared to a strong 2018, but the application space remains very active. This client dismantled their legacy IT architectures, focus on DevOps modernization, next-gen application development, enterprise automation and cyber security. The technology solution providers are bringing in new technology that improves quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and we continue to see that over the next several years.</p><p>The BPO ACV has remained consistent between the 4 to 5 -- the $4.5 billion and $5 billion for the last several years, and it really remains in sort of that same space.</p><p>Software-as-a-Service ACV has ticked up steadily and has now surpassed $5 billion at the 9-month mark for the first time. The awards are getting larger, in part due to more strategic channel relationships and large enterprise adoption of SaaS. The conversations are becoming more portfolio-based as opposed to one-off product-related conversations.</p><p>The Infrastructure-as-a-Service has more than doubled over the past 2 years. Some very strong competitors are facing off depending on the geographic market-specific client base. AWS, which started with cloud-native and startups were on Microsoft focused on enterprise and productivity tools are in hot competition. And as more and more enterprises are bringing important workloads and enterprise-level workloads to the cloud. Moving from legacy IT to modern IT is no longer just an implementation exercise, it really involves the full value and process redesign, change management and cultural change for organizations.</p><p>So beginning this quarter, we're going to start parsing out how much of the value awarded in managed services has a digital component. So as we've said over the last -- probably the last 2 years, digital is really the key story of the industry. So what we're interested in is to really understand how digital has grown with more of the traditional service providers. So we realize that everyone has a different definition of digital. In this presentation, we're going to look at those contracts in which some form of cloud computing is included along with analytics and artificial intelligence.</p><p>By looking at the data on this relative basis, we see real meaningful trends that are correlated with what we've heard from providers as we've talked to the industry. So we examined what percent of transactions coming to award at the broader market have a digital-based scope. Then we laid out the charts to show how that trend has changed over time. The data shows the digital builds are fast becoming the new normal for the industry.</p><p>So in 3Q '19, you'll notice that 48% of the contracts awarded in the broader market have a digital-based scope, which is an all-time high for the quarter. And we believe there is high growth potential going forward.</p><p>Another way to look at this on a relative basis, digital was up 26% from a year ago and up 42% from 2 years ago. And interestingly, the average ACV for deals with this large digital component now exceed $18 million, up 14% year-over-year. So we're seeing strong growth on -- again, on the technology service providers doing digital, both on their relative numbers and certainly on the ACV.</p><p>We look at the global leaderboard. Our leaderboard now spans all 3 regions, featuring top-performing providers based on their awarded ACV for the trailing 12 months. You can find the leaderboards for the individual regions in the appendix of this presentation, which can be downloaded from the invitation you received or from the ISG corporate website.</p><p>In the Big 15, AT&amp;T joined the group due to large deals with IBM and Microsoft. AliBaba made its debut to the leaderboard by continuing to expand outside of China and into many parts of Asia. And among those holding onto their place on the list are public cloud infrastructure firms pushing deeper into the enterprise space. In this quarter, for example, AWS signed deal with NASCAR, Emirates NBD, Hyundai Electric &amp; Energy Systems and Sony Music Entertainment, Japan. And Microsoft Azure deals with State Street, National Australia Bank, Schlumberger, Emerson Electric. And finally, Google GCP, the Google Cloud Platform, began an enterprise push with new clients at WPP, Macy's and Sanofi.</p><p>In the traditionally static Building 15, a full 1/3 of the list turned over. Among the newcomers are Alight Solutions, an HR provider; and Teleperformance, a customer care and contact center provider. Fiserv made its debut after acquiring First Data. And ServiceNow returned. And Workday made the cut after wins at the Gap, Stanley Black &amp; Decker and Rockwell Automation.</p><p>In The Breakthrough 15, both Mindtree and Nordic provider, Tieto returned and were joined by NS Solutions, the Japanese service provider.</p><p>In The Booming 15, Birlasoft claimed a spot after merging last year with KPIT, then splitting into 2 publicly traded firms. SoftwareOne, a global technology trends consultant that acquired Comparex, a global IT service provider, also made the list, as did RingCentral, a provider of cloud-based communications and collaboration solution.</p><p>So we also wanted to highlight a couple providers that have done exceptionally well. And that's ISG introduced a Star of Excellence Awards in 2018 based on feedback from a survey of more than 1,400 enterprise clients. We asked them to rate their service providers who demonstrate the highest standards in quality. And these awards recognize providers by the people who know them best, again, their customers. So this year, we expanded to include 2 separate categories: One that recognizes service excellence among providers offering core technologies services, and the other acknowledging excellence in emerging technology services.</p><p>This year, Mindtree won in core technology services. And IBM received a star for emerging technology services.</p><p>Now let's take a look at the separate regions. Clay, you want to start us off with the Americas?</p><p>CLAY CALHOUN, PARTNER OF SOURCING ADVISORY SERVICE LINE, INFORMATION SERVICES GROUP, INC.: Yes. Thank you, Steve, and good morning, all. The Americas showed its strength this quarter by busting through the $7 billion mark for the first time in combined market ACV. Managed services and as-a-service continue to divide the combined market fairly evenly. Following a fairly light quarter, ACV picked up noticeably, which illustrates the lumpy nature of the deal flow that we've been talking about in our prior calls. The Americas region once again produced more than 200 deals as it has for the past 6 quarters, and more of them were in the upper range of deal sizes.</p><p>Managed services turned in a stellar performance, but the past 2 quarters were so soft that the year-to-date ACV dropped 1.3%. As-a-service ACV reached a new high after a brief pullback last quarter. The 2 segments combined posted a year-to-date gain of 12%.</p><p>By function year-to-date, within managed services, ITO slipped 2% compared to this time last year, while BPO edged up by the same percentage. ITO in the Americas reflects what we saw globally; that this sector is more active than we've seen since we began conducting these Index calls. Service providers are actively seeking market share by establishing partnerships with AWS, Azure and Google Cloud or with SaaS leaders such as Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow and SAP HANA.</p><p>BPO ACV rose 2%. One pocket of strength is finance and accounting. F&amp;A is a relatively easy entry into transformational deals. And it's no wonder that that's where many new clients start their business optimization journey. In the as-a-service market, ACV in both segments notched record highs.</p><p>Infrastructure-as-a-Service growth outpaced Software-as-a-Service in what has become a consistent pattern. The security issues of Capital One dominated many of the conversations this quarter. After the Capital One breach, Chief Security Officers have prioritized cloud security and compliance and want governance, security and collaboration. Nearly all enterprises see hybrid cloud as offering the best of both worlds. And most cloud providers have openly embraced the value proposition. The valuable intellectual property can be kept on-prem for enterprise and cloud, while other data can reside in the public cloud.</p><p>Software-as-a-Service continues to steadily tick upward and momentum remains strong.</p><p>Moving our focus to Asia-Pac. Combined market ACV stayed above the $2 billion market this quarter as it has for the past year. The as-a-service segment kept the winning streak alive as the third consecutive quarter at or above $1.4 billion in ACV. China and India produced strong gains in managed services, offsetting weaker results in Southeast Asia and ANZ.</p><p>Year-to-date, the quarterly combined market performance has more than doubled since 2016. Back then, as-a-service accounted for only 47% of the total ACV awarded. Now it comprises 65%. Managed services had its best year-to-date performance since 2014. All 4 sectors, ITO, BPO, Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service posted double-digit gains year-to-date over the like period in 2018.</p><p>ITO's 30% growth in ACV comes from strength in both applications and infrastructure markets. Network services is an active area in Asia-Pac where China and South Korea lead the way. BPO, a fairly small market in Asia-Pac grew its strength in industry-specific BPO in contact center and customer care opportunities. In the past 3 years, Infrastructure-as-a-Service ACV has nearly tripled and Software-as-a-Service ACV has almost doubled. Many Chinese cloud infrastructure providers are expanding outside of China. Baidu's recent foray into Singapore's cloud services market comes as Southeast Asia has become a focal point for global investors, start-ups and Chinese technology conglomerates. AliBaba is becoming a leading cloud player in Malaysia and has set up 2 data centers in Indonesia.</p><p>The Software-as-a-Service space has much long-term potential as providers continue to expand globally and reach out to countries they are not servicing currently, emerging markets still in their early cloud adoption.</p><p>Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve for the EMEA analysis.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Great, Clay. Thanks a lot. Good to see that the Americas is recovering to the extent that it has. So after briefly hitting the $5 billion level last quarter, EMEA's combined market ACV fell back nearly $1 billion this quarter, really becoming the weakest results since the start of 2018. The bulk of that loss came from managed services. The 3 largest markets, the U.K., DACH and France all were down by double digits. There were ACV gains in Nordics and Benelux, but they were not large enough to offset some of the losses in the other regions.</p><p>The more than $1.8 billion in as-a-service ACV was new high in EMEA. However, the region is not seeing the record-breaking numbers enjoyed by the Americas and Asia-Pac. Year-to-date, the combined market ACV increased 5% on the strength of as-a-service, which now accounts for nearly 40% of the market. And a robust first half for managed services overcame a weak third quarter to hold the year-to-date at very steady, kind of a 0.6% year-to-date increase.</p><p>Most of the economies posted substantial gains in managed services so far this year with the exception of U.K. and DACH. Those 2 markets faced very unique challenges. The U.K., of course from the uncertainty of Brexit, which has lingered for a couple years now, and is certainly impacting currency; and DACH from being a bit slower to embrace cloud and other digital technologies, although that is quickly changing and they're accelerating fast in that market as well.</p><p>European markets still remain concerned about a recession, much of it stemming from the manufacturing business in Germany. Trade wars are having an impact on German exports, which is affecting the overall GDP across Europe. Businesses are certainly getting recession ready by pulling different levers to reduce their overall cost structures.</p><p>By function, ITO slipped 7% against the 2018 year-to-date figure but made a good show compared to 2017. Compared to 2018, apps and infrastructure both lagged. However, ADM has grown significantly over the past several years compared to its historic averages in EMEA.</p><p>BPO found strength in facilities management and contact centers as smart buildings proliferate, enable the Internet of Things, facility management companies hold quite a bit of sway in the IoT ecosystem.</p><p>Software-as-a-Service ACV rose 7% year-to-date in Europe, while Infrastructure-as-a-Service grew more than twice that percentage in the same period. And the as-a-service ACV as a whole has nearly tripled in the past 3 years. We're seeing increased adoption of work areas like compute, data analytic products and machine learning services, the public cloud along with demand for private cloud, driven by the digital transformation of big enterprise clients.</p><p>Meanwhile, many SaaS providers are launching aggressive campaigns targeting clients with legacy technology. Those clients realize support for their systems is winding down, and they don't want to manage on-prem software. They know there's limited future in legacy platforms. Digital transformation is driving the accelerated pace of Software-as-a-Service solutions and cloud data app development.</p><p>So if we laid out the industry vertical information to more clearly delineate the information you told us is most useful. Across the top, you'd notice each industry's year-to-date ACV. First, we report on the combined market performance in each of the 3 areas. Directly below that line we've listed the year-to-date growth rate for managed services and as-a-service. And then finally, we break out the performance in each of these regions. So you should sort of have a single page now that you can see the up/downs associated with the industry by region and by vertical.</p><p>So today, we're going to give an update on BFSI, which remains the largest, almost 20% of the combined ACV in the market, then telco, and then Bob's going to take a deeper look at the U.S. health care market.</p><p>So the demand environment for BFSI is stable in the global markets. You can see that it's sort of at $8.4 billion ACV for the quarter. But in the capital markets, decision-making is slow due to pressure on core businesses from interest rate, fees and trade headwinds. And in that space, managed services has dropped 9%. On the other hand, digital spend is quite high for consumer-facing segment, be it a consumer bank, wealth management, consumer lending or the payment side. And many financial institutions kept their legacy technologies too long. Now they have to invest and move to the cloud and next-generation platforms to survive.</p><p>Cloud transformation and technology modernization continue to drive IT spend, investments will center on cloud-native app development, applications and data migration and infrastructure. Note there was a 22% increase in the as-a-service ACV in the BFSI space so far this year.</p><p>Telecom and media is interesting. So the featured metrics for telco and media seems strong due to compares against a very weak 2018. Increased cloud adoption, especially in critical business operations and core business applications is increasingly common. Virtualized networks and the emergence of 5G wireless are driving demand too because telcos are under pressure to invest. And successful providers are working with clients to develop advanced IoT use cases and underlying technologies that come into play. And the as-a-service now accounts for nearly 40% of the combined market in the telco space.</p><p>So let's take a brief look at health care before I hand the call over to Bob Krohn, who leads that sector for us in the U.S. The stats in this chart are commercial sector health care, which is predominantly in the U.S. Year-to-date, the vertical has generated $3.9 billion in ACV, up 5% from last year and up 67% from 2017.</p><p>So Bob, it looks like some great numbers. Can you tell us what's going on in healthcare?</p><p>ROBERT KROHN, PARTNER &amp; HEALTHCARE PRACTICE LEAD, INFORMATION SERVICES GROUP, INC.: Thanks, Steve. Disruption characterizes health care in the U.S. Today, we'll look at how the technology drivers and emerging trends are affecting service providers. Health care is among the most dynamic industries, maybe even more so with the acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health and of Express Scripts by Cigna, the Amazon consortium, Haven, and the investment of Oracle into a new claims platform. Disruption in the industry has [fermented] a lot of vertical integration as providers increasingly seek out partnerships to brace themselves for big tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Apple also entering the market. C-suite executives are focusing keenly on the patient, what the patient will be doing and feeling when interacting with these entities. Company decision-makers have shown interest in interacting with retail, CPG and other industries to borrow their best practices.</p><p>For example, Kaiser Permanente has invested substantially in digital transformation and has brought on a new Chief Digital Officer from consumer products. Increasing digital adoption is also fueling M&amp;A. When companies get acquired, they take out cost. Five years ago, payers were somewhat cost focused, but nowhere near as cost focused as other industries such as retail and CPG. Now that's changed. It's becoming an increasingly cost competitive environment. We expect more M&amp;A activity will occur, and we expect horizontal and vertical integration in the payer space. I can't overstate how the change in regulatory environments affects our clients on a regular basis. Think about it from a health care provider and payer perspective. Changes in health care legislation in their product definition. At the same time, evolving patient philosophies have increased the demand for 24/7 care.</p><p>Speed to market and adapting to the regulatory environment is a must, almost more important than cost. When the regulatory environment changes, companies must respond with new technology and new digital solutions as quickly and effectively as possible. Everybody talks about consumers in the health care industry, especially in the payer space. At the same time, the focus is on activities that are patient friendly. Digital labs are on the forefront of all our clients.</p><p>Medicaid Advantage and Medicare subscriptions have steadily increased with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Health care payers likely will be more aggressive, reinventing their business models through technology investments or innovative care delivery models. In short, flexible solutions are required in order to compete. Health care companies are leveraging emerging technologies to make use of the colossal amount of unstructured consumer data available in the industry. Blockchain is in the exploratory phase in the industry. Certainly, there is a whole bunch of prototyping going on and tremendous interest in blockchain technology. The efficiencies are well known and readily identified. The challenge we see is the ability of healthcare payers and providers to cooperate in a way that standards can be set and blockchain can evolve. We expect blockchain will be a staple of how our clients will do business in the foreseeable future. The only question is time.</p><p>A relatively new term has evolved. Internet of Medical Things, which generates measurable data that can improve the speed and accuracy of diagnostics. Many innovative solutions are emerging in the Internet of Medical Things, often fueled by the increased number of connected devices.</p><p>Look at your wristwatch, most of you now have a connected device of some sort on it. Think about the data generating from the device and the Internet of Medical Things. That's going to become available to payers and providers. We're not only talking about wearables, we're also talking about laboratory equipment, light switches in hospitals, medical equipment, printers, to name a few. There's a tremendous amount of unstructured data available now that needs to be harnessed through creative, innovative solutions in the Internet of Medical Things.</p><p>Predictive analytics are driving behavior too. Health care payers are leveraging predictive analytics tools to get an insight into an insured member's future health trajectories and predict patient outcomes. Predictive analytics is also used by health care providers for deciding the best course of action for treatment plans.</p><p>Clinicians are at the root of solutions, but the amount of data available now in predictive analytics will increase exponentially in the future and will enable better patient outcomes. Predictive analytics are at the core. The health care technology space has tremendous activity. To manage increased demand, there is a gradual shift from in-house technology initiatives over to sourced solutions. Scalability is a must. Companies needs to be able to scale these new applications that are being developed in a very rapid deployment basis. The industry is moving toward integration of managed health care and provider services. We expect a distinction between payers and providers to go away, to be replaced by a more vertically integrated model.</p><p>How does all this disruption affect technology service providers? Our clients are looking for speed and agility, almost over cost savings or time and materials long-term engagement. These trend appears to be growing. Clients are looking for firms able to be dynamic and scalable. We're seeing a migration away from large holistic deals with single service providers and a move toward the development of what our clients call ecosystems. They're small deals with less guaranteed money.</p><p>At its core, this is a dynamic -- this is a data analytics business. With the emphasis on high quality of data, there's concerns about the competition from Amazon, Microsoft and Google entering the space. These giants have a step-up on the ability to use automation in their core businesses, which will enable them to assist clinicians and move Big Data and digital apps in a very aggressive way. The largest players are viewing this as a potential disruption and adapting their planning accordingly. Where service providers used to compete on 3- to 5-year cycles, they're now forced to compete almost daily for smaller projects. Our clients are setting up these ecosystems, where they've got any number of service providers, and they create governance around the ecosystem. Then the service providers compete in open way for smaller projects. The guaranteed revenues just aren't there like they were in the past. The change in market dynamics is acute for incumbents and particularly being challenged.</p><p>Steve, that leaves you to talk about the incumbent's dilemma.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Great. Thanks a lot, Bob. And I'm looking at my Fitbit right now just wondering what they're doing with all the data on my health. So great job and great insights on what's happening in the healthcare market.</p><p>So this quarter, we've got a really special insider view. So for those that were on the call last quarter, you may recall we talked about the 3 generations in managed services. So today, we're going talk about the incumbency and how being an incumbent service provider has dramatically changed from Gen 1 20 years ago to Gen 3 deals today.</p><p>So as you may recall in Gen 1, being an incumbent meant a strategic advantage because enterprises usually transferred most of their assets through providers. This made it really financially difficult to switch. In Gen 2 companies, companies invested a lot of time and energy in running their processes from low-cost locations that were multiple time zones away, making it riskier and more time-consuming to switch. So this was the whole advent of the offshore model.</p><p>So on the whole, Gen 1, Gen 2, incumbents were relatively safe in early generations of our industry. However, things are a bit different today as we move into Gen 3 and beyond. Being an incumbent is no longer the advantage as once was. So we recently looked at a sample of ISG-advised managed services deals to see what was happening to incumbents. This was really interesting because we did the same research 3 years ago, so it really gave us a good chance to see the differences as the digital revolution was really kicking off at the enterprise level.</p><p>So the average TCV of the deals we analyzed was $78 million, 1/3 of these deals were sole-sourced and 2/3 of them were competitive. So if you zero in on the competitive deals, which was 2/3 of the pie chart on the left, we found that incumbents lost some or all of the scope 70% of the time, which is obviously a pretty sobering number. But it gets even more dire for incumbents, the average TCV of the deals where the entire scope was lost was $182 million. So you look at that and say, it's not just the small deals but there's large deals when they actually go competitive.</p><p>So what does this mean that the natural advantage incumbents used to have in Gen 1 and Gen 2 has been slipping away for at least the past 3 years. These incumbents are under siege from a host of new competitors. And based on what we're seeing, the deals we advise, the larger the deal, the more likely they are to lose some or all of the scope.</p><p>So let's talk about the 2/3 of the deals in our basket that are going competitive in the first place. First, enterprise perceived that the provider is delivering poor service. I am saying perceived here because in our experience, it's often due to communications and misunderstanding between the provider and the client on what's actually in the contract is actually being delivered. This does not mean that providers don't fall down in their service delivery. They do oftentimes. But there are usually other factors that lead to the perception of poor service.</p><p>Providers also struggle to demonstrate their capabilities. This may sound odd because providers love to tout their new capabilities. We hear in the market all the time. But what we see is they're really good at telling the market about these capabilities, but not so good about telling their own employees or even their current clients.</p><p>So to be fair, this can also happen at the beginning of the relationship when an enterprise has used a highly prescriptive RFP process that precludes providers from really showing their wares or really demonstrating all their strengths. But it also happens during the relationship when the provider delivery teams are in the dark as to what's happening back at corporate or are so focused on just delivering the day-to-day capabilities for the client.</p><p>And the final reason our data shows that deals go competitive is the perception by the client of a poor relationship. In our experience, this is usually a result of the provider not having a relationship at the right level with their clients and nurturing that relationship over time. An interesting data point here is if you zero in on the really big deals that went competitive, these are the $180 million TCV range deals, the most important reason they went competitive was because of a perception of a poor relationship.</p><p>But let me give you a little bit more color on how we see the situation playing out in big deals today. So imagine a large international bank that's in year 3 of the 5-year, $250 million data center deal. We'll categorize this as a Generation 2 relationship. And as the incumbent is a large provider from our big 15 leaderboard, the bank is looking to accelerate its digital transformation, but it's also concerned about the transition risk given how the integrated the provider is in its daily operations.</p><p>So they give the incumbent 90 days to come to a sole-source agreement. So that's the 1/3 that we talk about. However, during this period, the incumbent can't really develop an effective response to the bank within the time line. And this for a few reasons. First, the delivery and pursuit resources struggle to articulate the new capabilities that provider has developed over the past 3 years mainly because there is a disconnect between what's being developed at corporate or out in other areas and what happens on the ground at that specific client. Second, the relationship itself is tenuous. The client perceives service to be subpar, even though the provider can show that all the service levels are green.</p><p>And finally, this incumbent knows the client, shortcomings and all because they've been working together for 3-plus years. They've priced in the risk they know is inherent in the environment, and in this case, the fact that the client has not and likely will not change their operating model to accommodate working with a third party. So they see additional risk. They know they have to price that risk in, which puts them in a bit of a disadvantage when it goes competitive. And in this situation, in swoops a competitor, one that's likely smaller than the incumbent. The competitor's unaware of the dysfunction within the client, and they report their prices lower, since they haven't priced in that risk, plus the competitor comes in with a new set of eyes and they get this client excited about the future possibilities and possibility of solving part of the puzzle at the incumbent today, but not all of it. So the client decides to source a slice of this $200 million deal to the competitor. We see this pattern repeating itself over and over again, and this is truly what the incumbent's dilemma is.</p><p>So what can incumbents do to break the cycle? In general, we see providers misunderstanding their role in making these relationships a success. There's a lot of focus on winning the business, not nearly as much as keeping it. But ultimately, the incentive really lies with the provider to make this work because they will end up bearing the cost if they lose the business. So providers need to step up their game in building the relationship.</p><p>First, they need to be able to sustain and measure the relationship satisfaction and to do this on a continuous basis, not a onetime. This includes measuring things like trust and collaboration. This may sound straightforward, but it's the #1 reason that providers lose deals. Second, we're also of the opinion that providers need to take on a larger role in the overall governance of the relationship. This may sound strange, a provider governing its own services, but we think it's critical. Because it's in the best interest of the provider to own a bigger part of the overall governance to help ensure the right things are being done and the relationship is building. But it's important to remember that it takes 2 hands to clap, enterprises and clients clearly have a responsibility to remedy the situation as well.</p><p>In our experience, enterprises often misunderstand how much work is required to make a third-party relationship work. This is because many of them expect a lot of the process and software when they engage a provider, then in reality, a managed service relationship is just as much about people and relationships. This means that enterprises need to prepare a big change as well as in order to make a third-party relationship successful. They need to ensure executive sponsors are in place, train key delivery resources and make fundamental changes to their operating models. And by the way, our research shows that enterprises feel these things are important too, but unfortunately, time and cost pressure and organizational resistance to change mean these things often don't get done before or even during the relationship.</p><p>In our view, these areas will only become more important as companies digitally transform. This is because companies are moving away from projects that take months or years to complete and moving to a product-aligned operating model whereby products are rapidly built and improved using ongoing customer feedback. This means that speed based on rapid collaboration with small product teams is paramount to success. Providers that can add value within this new way of working, we think will be primed not only to win new digital business today, but retain even more in the future as the trusted incumbent provider. So next quarter, we're going to look at it from the other side of the equation, how and why do we see startup competitors and upstart competitors really taking share -- a market share from the incumbents.</p><p>So with that, let me summarize the third quarter. So political and trade uncertainties have contributed to mixed results and a divided viewpoint among businesses. Some are calling for growth, others are preparing for decline that may last into 2020, and many technology service providers are cautiously optimistic about their pipelines [in the van]. Overall enterprises remain watchful of external factors that could impact customer spending decisions. So year-to-date, the combined market registered double-digit growth, managed services made a slight positive turn and as-a-service gained more than 20%. I think I'd describe this broken momentum is really where the market is today in managed services ACV. The EMEA and Americas are really mirror images of one another. EMEA started the year strong but took a downturn this quarter. Americas on the other hand endured a weak first half and rebounded this quarter. So both are about even for the year-to-date. The as-a-service ACV though reached a new high in all 3 regions through the year. Overall growth rates are not as quite as dramatic as they once were. And looking ahead in the as-a-service market, we're projecting revenue growth of 22% year-over-year for the remainder of 2019. And we're casting a watchful eye on the continued U.S. trade talks with China and how technology firms prepare for demand issues, should China become more restrictive with U.S. firms.</p><p>We're going to take a more conservative perspective in managed services by lowering our 2019 growth forecast by about 50 basis points to 2.6% through the end of the year. This takes into account some of the risk that we just saw, some FX headwinds due to the strong U.S. dollar and possible top line softness from a few of the largest service providers.

KOOTMAN, RESEARCH ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. Wanted to touch on BPO, it looks like you guys are seeing some strength year-to-date versus last year, specifically in EMEA. Can you discuss the turnaround that you're seeing there and some of the drivers?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Yes. I think it's in a couple areas, Drew. It's certainly, as I mentioned, on the facilities management side, so there is some big growth there. If you just kind of tie it to what we've seen with WeWork, independent of what we think about the IPO or anything there, there's certainly a big movement in facilities management and those sort of shared workspaces that's helping drive the market in Europe. And then the contact center space saw some good growth, so we saw some growth there. Again, there is lots of technology and integration happening at the chatbot space and some of the call center piece. I would say the third piece is sort of this continued focus that we've seen on vertical BPO. So for specific industry, specific BPO solutions, that continues to expand across Europe.</p><p>DREW L. KOOTMAN: Great. And then with the recent market, the macro volatility, which sectors do you think will hold up best if there is a market downturn?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: So that's a fantastic question. So I think if I look at it, I'm to think about those industries that still have a lot to do with the digital transformation component, right. That are still going to invest in digital regardless of sort of an economic downturn. So when I think of those markets, I would say financial services and healthcare are likely to still invest heavily on digital transformation for lots of reasons. So both of them are very consumer facing and both of them, quite frankly, have a lot to do for back-end integration and their spend is just so much higher than the rest of the industry's. So I would expect both of those to do well. I think retail, you would expect higher spend there, but I think retail is always going to be pressured just because of margins there. And general business services, I think it's another one that will continue especially with the high-tech focus in there. I think it will continue to be a big spender there. I would probably be concerned about Telco a little bit in any kind of downturn just because of all the investments that have to be made, not only with 5G but SD-WAN and some of the returns there. It's just as we all know it's a big capital outlay right now.</p><p>ROBERT KROHN: Steve, if I may elaborate just a little on healthcare. So an economic downturn in our opinion will actually probably increase activity in healthcare. The disruption is real, the major platform players are coming in the space, and with an economic downturn and the additional cost pressures into the sector, we expect that activity would increase.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Good. Operator, can we turn a few questions over to Bryan as well? If you're on, Bryan?</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Yes. Sure, thanks, Steve. Wanted to follow up here just from a macro standpoint. Obviously some healthy growth metrics in Americas, U.S. stands out. But have you sensed any underlying caution that is actually caused mature pipeline deals to come off the table? And then when you think about the headline volatility, has it changed the nature of the deals that may be getting prioritized?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Bryan, you want it from a global perspective or from an Americas perspective first?</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: So I would say from Americas, just that -- the Americas performance was decent here, it sounded like, in the third quarter. So curious if it's -- the guarded optimism, is it just an underlying tone, is it actually changing behavior yet? That kind of what are you seeing there?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Yes. Absolutely. Yes, Clay, do you want to comment on that?</p><p>CLAY CALHOUN: Yes. So I think what we're seeing is that to degree, there is some guarded optimism. And I think what -- most recently, what I'm seeing is some of the larger deals are being taken and being so disaggregated is one word or split up into smaller components and taking those components to market. Part of that, I think we see indicated by the number of deals. So as you saw, we're over 200 deals there. And part of that is what is driving those continued increases in numbers. But that guarded optimism has taken the overall large deals and splitting it up.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Okay. So those change in nature a bit. Any early reads you can share on 2020 technology budgets broadly?</p><p>CLAY CALHOUN: I do not have anything right now, Bryan. I can get back to you on that. I mean I know we're looking at some things, but I don't have a distilled set of information that I can talk to today.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Steve, anything you could share as far as behavior there?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Yes. No, I think what you're going to continue to see, Bryan, is this focus on the transformation piece and new dollars coming in to spend. And the metric that I keep going back to is, again, sort of we've added $3 billion of new technology spend per quarter. And it's -- that's a significant number as you think about it. So again if we look at just IT budgets, I would expect those, especially if we see any kind of downturn, for those to be relatively flat, and you'll see some cost takeout and some different things there. But I think because we look at such a broader portfolio and even as I mentioned, almost 45% of the spend for the traditional managed services guys is now digital. I think the overall market is growing and that's going to increase sort of the technology spend coming to the market pretty significantly. I think that trend is going to continue. It just gets harder and harder for all of us to say, what's that IT spend versus sort of what's this broader technology spend. And it's the broader technology spend that I'm pretty optimistic about.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Okay. Makes sense. Then just on the incumbent's dilemma, the displacers, are these generally more next-gen disruptive service providers? Or are you actually -- are you seeing large traditional players that just happen to be trading deals, so to speak?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: It's a great question and it's a really good mix. What I would say in general over the last 3 years, everybody has upped their game. So what used to be competitive but arguably commoditized, whether it was infrastructure or AMS or test deals, has truly become competitive both from a vertical standpoint, a geographical standpoint and a capability standpoint. And so what you seen now is if somebody got into a Gen 1 or a Gen 2 deal, and let's say it was banking with the example I use, but they weren't necessarily deep with banking experience or expertise but they happened to be really good at infrastructure management. As we go into the Gen 3 deals and more things open up, it allows those service providers with really strong vertical and industry expertise to be able to provide different offerings. So interesting enough, we're seeing some swapping of deals. I wouldn't say it was like we saw in early days where it was just swapping for costs, it's certainly swapping for capabilities. So I think it's the breakup that we're seeing more and more with different organizations having capabilities to expand there. So I would suspect to see sort of continued movement in our Breakthrough 15 as we go through that as more of those deals are awarded to different providers and capabilities.</p><p>And I think on that same side, I think you have to really watch the M&amp;A activity closely here because that's really going to be very telling on what's happening in the market. So if I just look at Capgemini for example, Cap necessarily wouldn't have been able to compete in an engineering services deal or a breakup of those deals. But now with their acquisition of Altran and Ericsson's expertise, all of a sudden they rise to sort of the top of class on being able to do those engineering type deals and those types of things are changing the market. Even if you look at some of the acquisitions that VMware and Pivotal and Broadcom-Symantec, there's all these massive changes that are sort of changing how clients and how the service providers interact with each other. So I'm watching that space as much as anything to see how that influences the capabilities of the service providers.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Okay. Makes sense. Last one for you just on the -- as far as the price downs, I think you mentioned the incoming providers are -- they're not in fear of revenue cannibalization. What level of price downs are you seeing in those deals?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: The price has held pretty steady. I think as I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, I think there's still some margin pressure on the service providers. But the margin pressure continues to have to do with the investments that they've had to make to be, lack of a better word, I'll say digital ready. But what I really mean by that is their ability to implement -- create and implement automation solutions, continue to invest in the AI, the machine learning that they need for a lot of their next-gen app structures, the partnerships and relationships and retooling that they've had to do to create new solutions with Azure and AWS. And those solutions, though we're seeing a really big uptick and we're seeing better value with those, we're still seeing a bit of margin compression on those because of all the investments. The price has been holding pretty steady. I think we're all sort of waiting a little bit to see the uptick or the value pricing on some of the digital transformation. And that hasn't come to the degree that we would expect this sort of across the industry yet. But I suspect we'll continue to keep an eye on that and see that as automation starts to continue -- and AI continue to take a broader piece of the market.</p><p>Bob, do you have anything -- are you seeing anything, Bob, on especially in healthcare on pricing for service providers?</p><p>ROBERT KROHN: Yes. I think it's consistent with exactly what you said, Steve. We've seen moderate price pressure on the larger deals, especially. We do see some hunger from new service providers trying to enter the space with niche applications and niche offerings. But I would say it's consistent with the overall industry.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Okay, good. And Clay, anything unique from an Americas perspective?</p><p>CLAY CALHOUN: Well, I think what you talked about in the whole incumbent's dilemma where providers are coming in, we see some very material price differences, much lower from the new providers coming in, in order to get that business, and part of the reason for the delta is the incumbents are trying to maintain a level of margin, maintain a level of team and delivery style that they've built up over the years of being in those clients. And we've mentioned the cannibalization of it. But those new providers that are coming in, we're taking a different look at the solution, and the team and the approach and there's a pretty material price reduction that we're seeing going to those new providers.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Yes. And I think, Bryan, that's actually a key point that Clay brings up because what we do see in general, and it's not necessarily just price reduction, but the creativity of some of the solutions is really having a dramatic increase or decrease in the price of the client. So it's not at all unheard of now to see 25% to 40% cost reduction because of the impact of cloud, or the impact of AI, or moving to a DevOps full stack environment, some of the technologies that we talk about have an absolute material impact on the cost of delivery. And that, we see with so many of these that oftentimes, as Clay says, you can't necessarily realize from an incumbent's standpoint for a host of reasons that we discussed.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Okay. Operator, can we open it back up?</p><p>OPERATOR: Yes. We will now take our next question from Edward Caso from Wells Fargo.</p><p>EDWARD STEPHEN CASO, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'm curious as clients deal with the digital transformation, are they bringing any of the prior outsourced work in-house while they work to sort of rethink their business into a digital format?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Ed, that is an absolutely spot-on question. And the reason it's so intriguing is we've been talking a lot about the repatriation of services for sort of the last year, 1.5 years. So one of the interesting things in the market right now is this whole notion of IT getting closer to the business. And this whole idea of being product-oriented and co-creating things with the business. And so when you do this, a lot of the peers will say that you need to go to an agile enterprise, you need to co-locate people, you need to help build that. And that's difficult to do on a global model. So you'll see organizations say, \"Okay, I want to repatriate these services. It's more critical to my business function and it's more critical to how I organize.\"</p><p>I think the challenge and let me say, we've seen some really good success with that. We have examples in the energy and utilities sector where organizations have repatriated services, restructured how they do work and has reduced their cost structure by 40%. And those are real base cases to do it and it's really interesting. In many cases, though, what we see is this sort of disconnect of reality between increasing your products and getting more tightly aligned with the business, driving out new solutions in doing that, but doing this in a cost-effective manner. And so what we really see, some repatriation of services, but more this sense, how do I try to do agile and DevOps and product-aligned organizations, sort of all these new buzzwords in this global delivery model. And this recognition that there is still a continuous race for talent, no single country, no single company, no single area has a lock on that talent. So how do you get the best across? And how do you create operating models to be able to do that? So I'm not seeing the big broad repatriation that we were -- sort of thought would be there a little bit, certainly with the GM news from 2016 and some others, but we're seeing pockets of it and it usually has to do with market differentiators now.</p><p>Clay, what do you see from the Americas perspective? Any difference there?</p><p>CLAY CALHOUN: Yes, so a little bit. When we were looking at repatriation, right, we see some services coming back as clients start to advance their capabilities and become more comfortable within a multi supplier model, they can bring in some of that back. Where we're seeing most of the work is when human labor is being replaced by digital labor. And then there is compression in the remaining human labor and those components of that labor gets then repatriated back into the company. So again, we're seeing the human labor being replaced by software. And then partial FTEs, partial components being brought back into the organization to be managed or as they move into more comfort within a multi supplier model, being able to deal with more of those services back.</p><p>EDWARD STEPHEN CASO: Just around RPA, which I don't think I heard today. Is anyone really able to scale RPA? Is it part of this in-house -- partial in-house shift? And are the service providers sort of figuring out how to do it such that they're doing it as opposed to the client doing it?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Yes. Thanks, Ed, for that question as well. I think we're still in early innings for RPA, quite frankly. I think we've got a set of really strong solutions, we got some use cases and we're really just starting to scale. I think at the enterprise level, there's clearly challenges around identifying the right processes, which we're seeing some different solutions in the market come to bear. We're seeing challenges with the orchestration, as Clay mentioned, between human and robotics and what are the whole workflow there. So we're seeing some solutions there. And at the service provider standpoint, I think there's -- I don't want to call it leapfrog because I think they are integrating the RPA solutions, but I think what you're seeing is this integration of artificial intelligence and APIs and software at scale to rethink maybe some of those business processes, which is also impacting. And in many cases, I mean we're seeing lots and lots of RRP implementation that are -- there are starting to scale, but they're still not what we would consider broad scale where we're seeing thousands of licenses being sold, et cetera. But we are starting to see more and more of where the centers of excellence or the internal organizations are trying to implement that and using different service providers or integrators that help teach them how to do it and they'll take off on their own to do it. So I would say in general, it's still really early innings. I think we're going to continue to see an explosion of RPA. I think it will continue to be a really hot market for the next several years. And certainly, AI, AML and some of the things that we discuss with it are going to reshape it as we go forward.</p><p>Bryan, you probably have a great perspective on that as well given your perspective on the RPA market as well. Any comments from you?</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Yes. Steve, no, I think that's -- what you said was fair. The change management seems to be the biggest stall point that we find when we have to look at use cases, and certainly a lot of good solutions out there. It's just thinking about it holistically and at enterprise level and then being able to drive the change from the top, those seem to be where successful engagements are -- why they are working.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Yes. Exactly, well said.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We will now take our next question from Andrew Bauch from Wolfe Research.</p><p>ANDREW THOMAS BAUCH, ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: This is Andrew on for Darrin Peller. So one thing we've heard from clients over the last year or so was that some industries are less capable of shifting to hybrid and public cloud environments primarily due to regulatory concerns around data and things of the like. My question is are you seeing similar barriers in the market from this shift? And do you have any insights on whether these types of regulations are easing and kind of open the gateway to more cloud adoption?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: The easy answer right off the top, Andrew, is yes. I'm going to answer this one from a couple different perspectives, then I'm going to ask Bob to give a perspective from healthcare where there's certainly a very strict regulatory environment there.</p><p>So in general, absolutely, yes. We do hear that oftentimes and it's probably one of the biggest reasons that's kind of slowing down both SaaS adoption and movement to hyperscalers or to the public cloud providers. In general, though, I think the cloud providers are responding with on-prem capabilities. So both AWS, Google and Microsoft, all have solutions where they can bring in their cloud solution into the on-prem or into the data center. So you're seeing this real advent of hybrid cloud solutions that can give you sort of the best of the cloud with all the tooling, with the DevOps, with the things that we all talk about as being so great on-prem to get over some of the regulatory pieces. I think the hyperscalers are also working extremely well with the regulators to make sure that they get certified environments in place to be able to do that. And that seems to be going well.</p><p>I wish I could say that I see movement on the regulator side to do that. But I've been in Europe for the last almost 2 years now, and quite frankly, I sort of see just the opposite. I see a tightening up of the regulatory environment. I think data privacy, data sovereignty, some of the cybersecurity risks, et cetera continue to impact those decisions. And I'm not seeing that let up. And quite frankly, I think that's what impacting some of the slowness that we see, and not slowness because it's growing at a great rate, but the slower rate of growth that we see in Europe compared to the U.S. markets or even the Asia-Pac markets. That being said, there are some real concerns. And so those have to be addressed, and I think the hyperscalers and others are addressing those and will continue to address those.</p><p>Bob, any thoughts on you from a healthcare perspective?</p><p>ROBERT KROHN: I'm sorry, Steve, could you repeat the question? I lost connectivity for a minute.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Yes. No worries. We're just interested in what's happening on the healthcare side with regard to the regulatory environment on moving workloads or broader adoption of the public cloud. There's a lot of noise in the system about it and what's sort of your perspective from a healthcare perspective?</p><p>ROBERT KROHN: So I think unilaterally our clients are migrating toward a hybrid cloud. I think a complete adoption of the public cloud is not something that we're seeing, nor do I expect we'll see so -- see it in the near future. That being said, the adoption of the hybrid cloud is rampant, especially in the larger players and also in the provider space. So public, no; hybrid, yes.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Yes. And Andrew, I think the one other thing, and this goes back to why we look at the acquisition strategy so much in the M&amp;A. If you looked at VMware, for example, and their announcement with AWS and their acquisition of Pivotal and their acquisition of Carbon Black, you could really say that VMware is sort of becoming part of that core solution for the hybrid cloud. And I think there's a number of players and announcements between Microsoft and AWS, and Google that are all focused on saying this hybrid cloud is a path forward. How long that will be there, I think is contested amongst some really smart people in the industry. But I think it does give a path forward for everybody to sort of get the benefits that the cloud is certainly providing.</p><p>ANDREW THOMAS BAUCH: Got it. Appreciate the insight. And then my follow-up is, last quarter, you said one of the themes was uncertainty is the new norm from a macro perspective. So my question is, should we be taking this comment as business leaders are becoming more confident in making technology investments and spend decisions amidst a more challenging macro backdrop? And has that changed from quarter-to-quarter?</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: I think we -- no, I think that's fair. I mean as I was starting the call, I talked about some of the macroeconomic issues and some of the global uncertainty. And I think that's just grown, right. I mean I think from the last call, we've had the October 31 Halloween date for Brexit, we've had Hong Kong issues, the trade tariff discussions continue. We've had Turkey today, and Syria, we've got impeachment discussions with Trump in the U.S. so there's tremendous amount of uncertainty in the markets right now. But again, when I look at the core of businesses, what the core of businesses are saying, the most underlying thing that's impacting me is this need to connect and get closer to my clients and my consumers, right. So and that's really the core of what's driving, again this whole digital transformation.</p><p>That drive is not going away. And as we've seen, if you're not investing in those areas and not driving whether it's IoT or autonomous driving our electrification, the big megatrends that are really impacting our industry. Then your Board is going to force some decisions to be able to do that. So I think honestly from a tech standpoint, those drivers are still incredibly strong in the market. And despite some of the uncertainty, I think boards and senior technology leaders are just sort of getting on with it. I know certainly from a local perspective here in London, though there's lots of concerns, I think there's this sense, it's just time to get on with it. I've got a business to run and let's go do that. And that's what I'm getting from most of the business leaders and what I'm seeing generally across the business segment. There are some markets where that's probably a little bit different. So that helps.</p><p>ANDREW THOMAS BAUCH: Yes. It just seems that playing defense is maybe more of a risky strategy than playing offense these days, but appreciate the color.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Yes. No, I think you're right and I think what you're seeing is that you've got a lot more offensive players making the technology calls right now.</p><p>OPERATOR: There appears to be no further questions over the telephone. (Operator Instructions) There appears to be no further questions over the telephone.</p><p>STEVEN E. HALL: Great. Well, thank you so much, operator. And I just want to thank everybody again for today's call. As always, really good insights from everybody on the call on what's happening. We appreciate providing the insights back to the market.</p><p>Our next call will be January 14. So please register and sign up for the first quarter index -- or the fourth quarter, being the first quarter of 2020, where we'll have broader insights on the year. And as we said, we'll really highlight what it takes for some of the startups and the competitors to really start winning more business. So that will be the special insights for that one.</p><p>And with that, Bryan, I again want to thank you and your team for sponsoring it. And I hope everybody has a wonderful day. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen.

ATKINSON </p><p>BLOOM STRATEGIC COUNSEL FOUNDER SETH BLOOM </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY COUNCIL CEO JASON OXMAN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR LAW AND ECONOMICS RESEARCH FELLOW ALEC STAPP </p><p>BERKMAN CENTER FACULTY AFFILIATE THIBAULT SCHREPEL </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION PRESIDENT ROB ATKINSON </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY COUNCIL PRESIDENT JASON OXMAN </p><p>[*]ATKINSON: Alright, well, good morning, everyone. I'm Rob Atkinson, President of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, and I wanna welcome you to an event on how we should we be thinking about this increasing furor about breaking up big tech. So we have a great panel this morning. Before I introduce them, I do wanna make a few opening and framing remarks, and then we'll just jump into this great panel. And we should have at least 20 or 30 minutes for questions and conversation, from you all. Also wanna mention, I--I can't resist, since we're talking about tech, we have a great event next week, on Wednesday?  </p><p>UNKNOWN: Tuesday.  </p><p>ATKINSON: Tuesday, up on Capitol Hill, on the role of robotics in technology innovation. And speaking of robots, there will be a robot there that will actually introduce me, so that's kind of cool, if you've ever seen Pepper the robot. So they'll actually be Pepper, there will be another robot there, so it's a fun event, it's on our website. So, there's been an increasing debate really in the last couple of years.  </p><p>You see it now, with some of the presidential candidates on the Democratic side, but certainly others who are concerned about the purported power, market power of large technology firms. And there are in--in any trust circles, there's sort of two ways to think about market power. One is structural remedies, and one is conduct remedies. And historically, the focus has been on conduct remedies. If you think about the Microsoft case, back in the late '90s and 2000, the Microsoft case was a conduct remedy.  </p><p>There was an assertion that Microsoft was using its power over--over Windows and Office, to hurt competitors. And so the remedy was that they had to fix that, which they did. There were people at the time pushing a structural remedy, which would be to break up Microsoft somehow. And structural remedies are largely seen as kind of a--a last resort. We did it with AT&amp;T, we did it with Standard Oil. But by and large, antitrust authorities have not embraced that. Now what we're seeing though is an increasing focus on, perhaps we need structural remedies, which ITIF would disagree with.  </p><p>There are lots and lots of reasons why \"Market power,\" in these industries is actually pro-innovation and pro-consumer. Let me read two quotes from you that I think put this in perspective, both from the Obama Administration Council of Economic Advisors, in a report they talked about market power and--and innovation. The first quote says \"Allowing firms to exercise the market power they have acquired legitimately can maintain incentives for research and development, new product introduction, productivity gains, and entry into new markets, all of which promote long-term economic growth.\"  </p><p>And we certainly see that today. If you look at the top 15 firms in the world, in terms of R&amp;D investment, six of them are American tech companies: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft--I'm sorry, five, Apple and Facebook. These five companies invest more in R&amp;D--invest seven times more in R&amp;D than the National Science Foundation. And they're able to do that, because they have scale economies.  </p><p>The second quote from the Obama Administration is--it says \"Some newer technology markets are characterized by network effects, with large positive spillovers from having many consumers use the same product. Markets in which network effects are important, such as social media sites may become dominated by one firm.\" How many people here use Facebook? How many people would like the government to make you use Facebook, and Headbook (PH)? In other words, you now have to post twice on a social media site, because having one only is a--is a monopoly. The answer is obviously, you don't wanna do that.  </p><p>How many people buy on Amazon? Yeah, I would be surprised if there's--how many people don't buy on Amazon? (INAUDIBLE) zero. Did I see a hand go--oh, good, alright. And--and--and how many people would like to when you go on Amazon--I--I just bought batteries the other day, would like to be able to go on Amazon and have the Amazon site only for Amazon batteries, and then have the Amazon reseller site only for other batteries?  </p><p>Nobody would want that, and yet, there are calls for breaking up Amazon into two separate sites, one for resellers or marketplace, and the other Amazon products only. I just wanna leave you with one last thought on this, which is, Nick--I think Nick Clegg I guess, who now works for Facebook, he had been Head of, I think the Liberal Party in the U.K. And he raised this point last week I believe, which is a point we've raised for many, many years: if you break up big tech, essentially what you're doing is you're opening up the field for China big tech.  </p><p>Because I can guarantee you that China is not breaking up their big tech. If anything, what China is going is asking for and encouraging more consolidation in Chinese tech companies. We've been down this road before with utterly disastrous consequences. As my colleague Mike Lind  and I wrote in our MIT Press book from last year, Big is Beautiful: Debunking the Myth of Small Business, in the '50s and '60s, the U. S. Government aggressively forced American technology leaders to give away or sell at--at--at--at rock bottom fire sale prices their intellectual property.  </p><p>They did this with RCA, anybody old enough to remember, RCA was the leading television producer and innovator in the world. The RCA monopoly increased prices 1.4 percent, and so they forced them to give away their technology and guess who got it? Sony. When the Justice Department forced AT&amp;T to give away their--essentially their license at a very, very low rate, their--their--their transistor technology, it really led to a lot of important things, like Texas Instruments being able to get it.  </p><p>But the government forced them to license it at such a low price that the Japanese were able to get it. And that's how Sony and some of the other Japanese electronics companies really took off, because they now had this technology licensed for virtually no money. And we saw that in many, many other industries: Xerox, when the FTC decided they were gonna force Xerox to essentially give away for free all of their patents, all of their design drawings, every piece of intellectual property that Xerox had, the goal was according to the FTC, to reduce the market share of Xerox copiers in half, in five years.  </p><p>And they were successful, because Japanese copiers took the market share, and they got all this technology for free. So we have to think about this question of technology and competition and--and breaking up big tech.  </p><p>We have to think about it, I would argue, in this context of international competition. So, with that long framing, let me now introduce you to our--our real speakers. And I wanna start on--on my--I'm gonna start in the order--I'm gonna go in the order that we're gonna hear from: Thibault Schrepel is a faculty affiliate at the Berkman Center at Harvard, he's also an Assistant Professor in European Economic Law at the Utrecht University School of Law, in the Netherlands and he's joining us through the magic of--of the Beam telepresence, so thank you.  </p><p>His writing focuses on innovation and digital markets relating to competition law and his work has led to the introduction of several legislative proposals across Europe. He recently wrote an excellent paper which I would encourage you all to read, it's on SSRN, in fact it was one of the most top 10 downloaded articles, including his other work, a--a piece called Antitrust Without Romance, and Thibault can talk a little bit about that. A really fascinating analysis of how European and American antitrust officials named them--naming them by name, think about antitrust from a more conservative--sorry from a more objective, rational perspective, or more from a kind of populous romantic perspective. He received his PhD from the University of Paris-Saclay.  </p><p>Seth Bloom, Seth is a long-time colleague, he's President and Founder of Bloom Strategic Council. He was--spent 14 years prior to that working in the U. S Senate on the Democratic side, on the Judiciaries Committee Antitrust Subcommittee, so he really was the go-to person on the Senate on the Democratic side for antitrust policy questions.  </p><p>He also spent time as a trial attorney at the DOJ's Antitrust Division, and has a law degree from University of Pennsylvania Law School. Alec Stapp is a--a research fellow at the International Center for Law and Economics. His research interests include tech policy and antitrust law. Prior to that he was a tech fellow at the Niskanen Center. He has a master's degree from George Mason University.  </p><p>And finally, Jason Oxman, who's the president, I would say the new--newish President and CEO of ITI, the Information Technology Industry Council. He has 20 years--over 20 years' experience in--in technology advocacy. Prior to joining ITI, Jason was the Head of--the CEO of ETA which is International Trade Association on Payments Industry--Payments Technology. He was also Senior Vice-President at the Consumer Technology Association. And I believe you were at the FCC at--back in the early days in his career, and began his legal career as a law clerk for the Maine Supreme Court. Has a JD and an MS from Boston University. So with that, Thibault, I'll look forward to hearing your comments, thank you.  </p><p>SCHREPEL: Yes, hi, everyone. I hope you can hear me well. Usually I say things so, having for me today I guess I have to say thanks a lot for having my robot with you, and--and I'm actually in Utrecht, I just left the teaching building. And actually on my way, where I was teaching about Blockchain, I just realized well maybe all I should say is, just--just--should I--should we break up tech companies? Well, let's just wait for Blockchain to take care of it.  </p><p>But so today, I--I won't discuss Blockchain unless you have questions, in that case, I will be very pleased to answer those questions. What I want--what I wanna do in those short 10 minutes, is to actually start with the end of the spectrum, I guess. Because today's conference is entitled: Breaking up Tech--Big Tech, Making Sense of the Debate. And I thought that instead--instead of focusing on the first part, which is breaking up big tech, I will focus on the making sense of the debate.  </p><p>Not that I expect to make sense of the debate necessarily, but at least I will--I'm--I'm gonna try to bring a different perspective on why breaking up big tech is being discussed. So let me start here. Last year, and in--in the following weeks I will be publishing, and I've published already a series of conversations with a Nobel Laureate in economics. And for that, I've talked to more than 10 of them. So it's a small sample, but still, quite representative of all of the--you know, Nobel Laureates still being alive. Because usually you get Noble so--so old, but anyway. So that's a different story.  </p><p>So, I've discussed big tech and antitrust with all of them. And although obviously they have different perspective, some of them you may know, Angus Deaton who has different perspective than Michael Spence for instance. But here's the common pattern between all of them. All of them told me \"I do not know what--what will be the economic effects, the overall effects of breaking up big tech, I have no idea.\" And in fact, I realize that I never met any economists showing me empirical evidence that breaking up big tech will overall be great for consumers, nor any political scientists proving by taking everything into account, that breaking up big tech would be good for political reasons, protecting democracies, and all that we hear nowadays.  </p><p>And so this refers me to a previous Nobel Laureate, Friedrich Hayek, who in his Nobel acceptance speech dispels the pretense of knowledge. You may be familiar with his speech, it's a short one. I really recommend you to read it, if you haven't already. And so Friedrich Hayek argued that some issues will always remain too complex of the human brain. That's--that's--there is too many things to take into account, and we can't do it. It--it's super frustrating probably, but that's his opinion, and I very much agree with that.  </p><p>And so, here, I would argue that breaking up big tech there are too many micro economic issues to be taken into account, and we will actually discuss how the people arguing for breaking up big tech go--they go around that and--and find another solution. But so, in the absence of clear-cut conclusions, here's why I think that some people are still arguing for breaking up big tech because you will--you will think \"Well, if we don't know then why--why can we--you know, violate property rights?\"  </p><p>Well some people do it and here, I will bring a--a last--a Nobel Laureate in economics, and that person is James Buchanan. So, indeed-and thank you for mentioning his paper, I recently published a paper entitled Politic--Antitrust Without Romance, which is actually based on the lecture that gave James Buchanan in '78, so unfortunately, we--we are still stuck with the same problems. And this lecture was entitled Politics Without Romance, and later on, came a up paper that he published on Public Choice. And so here's the idea: James Buchanan was arguing that yes, markets fail.  </p><p>They--they're not always perfect and there are failure of the market, but so do governments. And accordingly, we should get rid of the presumption that correction from our failures accomplish the desired objectives. And (INAUDIBLE) we hear a lot about--you know, \"Oh there is a market failure.\" First, I'm not always convinced, but lets say there is a market familiar, we hear a lot about, \"Then, we should do something,\" without discussing if we can actually reach the role of what we want to achieve.  </p><p>And so, that was the idea of James Buchanan, and that's the idea on which I wrote this paper called Antitrust Without Romance. And so, the idea was to say that we should actually in case of market failures, that's the first step, the second step will be to prove that what we want to do will actually help correcting the market failure, and that the situation won't be actually worse or equal that the situation before we do anything.  </p><p>And so here, what is interesting is that James Buchanan argued that the reason why governments fail first, is because they can't get to understand everything, and secondly, it's because some top officials sometimes may have a--a personal interest of doing something. Although it's not (INAUDIBLE) that your result will be great. And so now, here's the question: do you think that for some politicians arguing for breaking up big tech is a good political strategy?  </p><p>And I think the answer is yes, some politicians want to argue for that, and it's actually a very good political strategy. Because--and that's what they portray, tech giants represents the elite against the people. And so if indeed tech giants is the elite and is doing bad things to the people, then if one politician can come in, and do something, then he's suddenly a savior and it's great.  </p><p>And after all, who doesn't like David and Goliath, right? So on this basis, in--in this paper I analyzed all of the speeches of the five actual FTC Commissioners, and I've done the same with the actual EU Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, and the three previous ones, Monti, Kroes, and Almunia. And what I've found is that they tend more and more unfortunately, to demonize companies and to portray those companies like being--as being evil, and on that basis, they ask for--and they argue for breaking up big tech companies.  </p><p>So here are some numbers: Margrethe Vestager is opposing us, meaning the people versus companies and she uses the pronoun, \"Them,\" in more than 80 percent of all of her speeches. So in five speeches out of--in four speeches out of five, she will actually say \"Well, those companies, them, they do things to us the people, and we suffer from that.\" And if you compare with previous EU Commissioners they were doing that in less than 10 percent of their speeches.  </p><p>So you see, there is a--a dramatic change in the--in the discourse that she's--she's using. And on this basis, she mentions the possibility of breaking up tech companies, in some official speeches.  </p><p>And of course that is new, none of the previous EU Commissioners have ever even mentioned the idea. In the U. S., I've done the same with the speeches of Makan Delrahim, and he's opposing tech companies and the people in less than 10 percent of his speeches. So he's not doing it like we used to do in Europe, not--not doing it.  </p><p>And the same goes more or less for FTC Commissioners, although what I did find is that there is a tendency to do it more and more. And in fact, there is already one commissioner and I will give name once again, Rohit Chopra, who is opposing big tech companies versus the people in more than 30 percent of all of his speeches. So this is less than--than we do in Europe, but still you see the trend that is growing, and you also see if you--and I've done the analysis of some academic papers, including those of Lina Khan and the Open Markets Institute, and they do oppose big tech companies and the people all the time, 100 percent of everything they write.  </p><p>And--and so on this basis, what you--what you see is that they do say that companies not only they are opposed to the people, but what they do and here I quote \"They are a threat to democracy, a threat to civil rights, nothing less. And actually, if you are--and here I quote 'A reasonable people or reasonable mind, then you have to reach the same conclusion that tech companies are bad. And if you don't--do not reach the same conclusion, you are not someone reasonable.'\" And so again, they build on the rhetoric for breaking up tech companies based on all that.  </p><p>And so--and I'm almost done, so here I think it's important to remember that we do have no idea whether breaking up big tech will be good or bad, and I'm sure we will hear today some arguments (INAUDIBLE) but so we--we in short, we have no idea and yet, those FTC Commissioners and EU Commissioners they go for it, because they may shine using this strategy. And so, they portray the companies as being a demon, evil, death threats, and what you see more and more also, is that there are more and more moralists, sentimental in a way. So this is the good versus bad, the wrong versus right.  </p><p>So you see more and more reference to--you know, the good people versus the bad people. And obviously, why would you--would you do nothing against the bad people, right? And so what you see also is that they use that, and of course, it's super good for them to be reelected or reappointed. And we have a very good example of the actual EU Public Commissioner for Competition who almost got the Head of the European Commission, so this is working. So to--to conclude, what I would like to--to stress is that, what you see very clearly if you analyze all of the--I mean, most of the academic papers on antitrust if that over the last 30 years, somehow, I don't know how exactly, we were safe and secure on political strategies taking over antitrust.  </p><p>And--you know, whether or not we're progressive or conservative, there was an agreement that this is the direction we should take. And it wasn't any--you know, purely political strategy. I think now this is over, and for some time, several of--of us thought, \"Well this is too political, this is not legal, therefore let's not engage.\" And I think that's a mistake because actually we do need to engage because again, if you poll the Open Markets Institute for instance on Twitter, they will display their political goal. So they say it, they say \"We do have a political goal, and we use antitrust as a Trojan horse for that.\"  </p><p>So it's not even a secret that--you know, \"Let's not care about empirical evidence, we do have a political strategy that we need to reach.\" And the last points I would like to make is that--and that refers to what I've described, which is we have no empirical study showing that it would be good or bad to break up big tech. What they do and--and they do that all the time is that they discuss one micro practice. So they discuss one thing that eventually might be in tight (PH) competitive and maybe that--that is in tight competitive, those practices. And based on those tiny practices, they argue for micro measures, such as breaking up big (INAUDIBLE). I think is totally disproportionate.  </p><p>If there is something micro illegal, then we should do something at the micro level to be sure to correct that. But once again, the overall strategy now is political, and I've seen--I think that is why they argue for breaking up big tech, although we do have idea if it's a good thing.  </p><p>ATKINSON: Great, okay well thank you Thibault, that was great. Again, I encourage everybody in the audience if--really a fun paper to read. It's on the SSRN website. It's a free download, and it's--it's definitively worth the read. It's enjoyable, and lots of good data points in there as well. So, Seth?  </p><p>BLOOM: Thank you very much--thank you very much Rob, and thank you very much for the invitation to speak today. So let me just start by saying I have clients in the technology space, however all my comments today are my own, they're not on behalf of any client. So with that introduction, I think when we--when we look at this issue, we have to think about the political and legal dimension, as in--as Thibault was talking about, the political dimension.  </p><p>It's very important when we talk about antitrust to think about the political dimension. And--you know, I worked on Capitol Hill in the Antitrust Subcommittee, in the center for almost 14 years, from '99 to early 2013. And there was an attitude then that antitrust is a highly specialized doctrine, and--and--and that--you know, politics really should play no role in it. And it's--really should be the province of--of practitioners, academics. I think that-- </p><p>ATKINSON: It was very bipartisan.  </p><p>BLOOM: And was bipartisan, and there was a bipartisan consensus on these issues. But I think as to the point of antitrust being a--sort of a theoretical academic doctrine, that's really incorrect. And the reason for that is that the antitrust laws themselves are very vague. It is--Section 1 of the Sherman Act forbids combination of conspiracy and restraint of trade. What do you mean by restraint of trade? Section 2 of the Sherman Act which is most implicated by this, prohibits monopolization, and what does that mean? And these--these are all in the eye of the beholder.  </p><p>And so the political dimension of antitrust becomes important particularly now and--and antitrust enforcement I contend really does follow political winds. And so, it's important to pay attention to what the leading politicians are saying. And we see that right now, antitrust is going through a moment like hasn't been seen in decades, maybe since the--the administration of Teddy Roosevelt, more than 100 years ago.  </p><p>And it--and in the first presidential debate, if any of you saw it, I think it was the second question that was asked--you know, \"What should we do with the big--big tech companies, should they be broken up?\" And that's--I can't remember, I've been watching presidential debates, maybe since 1980, which--which dates me, but I can't ever remember a presidential debate dealing with an issue of antitrust policy, no less in the second question.  </p><p>So that shows you that there's a tremendous amount of political interest and ferment in this issue, right now. And it comes across the political spectrum, so it's both right and left. And, of course on the left we have people like Senator Warren, and David Cicilline, Representative Cicilline who--who's the Chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee. And they definitely call for the breakup of big tech companies. And but, we have people on the right as well, and Ted Cruz of Texas, Senator Hawley of Missouri, Senator Blackburn of Tennessee, all are highly critical of big tech companies.  </p><p>And--and so, and with--and even no less of an antitrust authority than President Trump was quoted just a couple of week ago in the Washington Post, saying \"The U. S. Government should be suing Google and Facebook and all that.\" That's a quote.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And then wagered that perhaps, \"We will.\" So, what's motivating this? Why are--why are the--across the political spectrum there are these voices? Well I think on the left side--you know, there's always--there has been for a long time a suspicion of bigness. And we had a doctrine in antitrust that \"Big is not bad.\" But folks on the--on the left never sort of bought into that. And I think it's simply coming from that side. But on the--on the right side of the political spectrum, which maybe for this moment is the more important one, because the administration is in the hands of the Republicans and--and the antitrust authorities, there's a sense that the big companies, tech companies, particularly Google, Twitter, Facebook are somehow discriminating against conservative voices, they have anti-conservative bias.  </p><p>And that allegation, which is hotly denied by these companies, let me make clear, I think has given rise to a lot of hostility towards big tech, and talk about breaking up the companies. And so we see next week a--a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Constitution Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Cruz, is gonna hold a hearing on Tuesday, called--titled \"Google and Censorship Through Search Engines.\" And that's gonna delve into that question.  </p><p>But the House--the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee obviously under the control of the Democrats has announced several weeks ago a--an--a major investigation, and a series of hearings on big tech and whether there should be--you know, should it broken it up or should there be antitrust remedies? And next week, the same day as this hearing in the Senate I mentioned is gonna be a hearing on--in--online platforms and market power, on focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. Interesting things about those two hearings, they're both next Tuesday afternoon. Google's testifying at both of those, and I can't remember a time when--when they've testified at two hearings at the same time.  </p><p>So obviously, different people. But so there's a tremendous amount of interest and ferment with respect to this topic at the political level. But--you know, having described that, I think we have to ask our self, \"What does it mean from a legal standpoint?\" Now, clearly you have enforcers like Makan Delrahim, who have said that they're interested in exploring these issues. And so--so--you know, it's--those are the people empowered under the antitrust laws to bring cases.  </p><p>But having said that, still the burden to bring an antitrust case in a monopolization case as we have here, is very high. And the courts have been rather conservation, so--in determining what makes up the legal monopolization. And--and--you know the basic doctrine here is that monopoly is not illegal and--and in fact, it's to be encouraged, that's why we want companies to strive to be monopolies, to improve their product.  </p><p>But exclusionary conduct, not based on business acumen or better product conduct, is illegal. And the line between what is a legal monopoly and what's exclusionary conduct, illegally designed to maintain monopoly is a very hazy line, it's difficult. But it's--but it's a high illegal burden. And so anybody thinking about bringing a case against these companies is gonna have to survive that illegal burden. And it won't be easy. And--you know, and--and the topic of today's event is breaking up big tech. But I think it goes a lot beyond breaking up big tech. we should think about whether or not monopolization cases are gonna be brought.  </p><p>And there could be a lot of remedies beyond a breakup. And as we saw with the Microsoft decision 20 years ago--you know, Microsoft was put under a number of conduct remedies for a period of time. And that's much more typical than a breakup. So a breakup, the last major breakup, and I don't wanna say the major breakup, I think the last breakup of a company under Section 2 of the Sherman Act for Monopolization was in 1982, ordered in 1982 the AT&amp;T case. So that's over 37 years ago, it went into effect in 1984.  </p><p>It's a very unusual remedy. And I don't think, should there be antirust cases brought against any of these companies, I don't think a breakup would be the most likely result, I think that would rather be unlikely. And we saw in Microsoft, the district court originally ordered a breakup, that went up to the court of--DC Circuit Court of Appeals and the DC Circuit said \"Yes, there's liability. Microsoft has attempted to illegally maintain its monopoly. But you, district court, haven't shown in any way why a breakup would advance--would be a remedy that would take care of the--the competition issues.\" And I think--and just rejected the breakup and ordered the case remanded. Ultimately, the case was settled without a breakup.  </p><p>And I think that's a sort of a--a roadmap that we can think about, is how the court of appeals looked at a breakup remedy, in that case. And so I think a breakup, even if there's antitrust action brought against these companies, is unlikely. So I guess, and I--I just I'd also like to make another point. I know my time is limited, but-- </p><p>ATKINSON: No you've got a couple minutes.  </p><p>BLOOM: Okay, so Elizabeth Warren is--is--is one of the main proponents of this on the--on the left side, on the Democratic side. And she wrote an article which was published in Medium in March, saying \"It's time to breakup Amazon, Google and Facebook.\" Well, there are a couple of interesting things about this. She just--it's--it's basically an article that talks about things that she claims are problematic, but mainly, it's sort of a, big is bad kind of piece. And--and these are big companies, they're dangerous, we should break them up. Well to look at it that way, is really not the way antitrust looks at these things.  </p><p>You have to look at--you can't just lump these companies together. It's not a one-size-fits-all approach. Each of these companies and other companies, like Facebook and Twitter and the--all these other companies, they have completely different business models. You have to look at the markets affected by these companies, what their business models are. You just can't say \"These are large tech companies,\" and break them up. You can say that, a politician cay say that, but a court is not going to--to adopt that approach.  </p><p>They're gonna wanna look at, \"What is the alleged anti-competitive harm from each of these companies?\" So I think--you know, that kind of argument is--is really not a successful one for--from an antitrust point-of-view. The other point I wanna make, talking about Elizabeth Warren is that she begins this piece by saying \"25 years ago, Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn't exist.\" Well that's interesting. That's their first sentence in that story. Is that making a case that we should--these are durable monopolies that we need to breakup, today?  </p><p>I would think if--if 25 years ago these major companies didn't exist, shows us the--the ferment in this industry and the--the--the fact that these--there's not durable monopolies here, new--new--new companies emerge and--and fall away continuously. And I think that's another--I was surprised to read that as a first--as her opening statement in this article. That's--that's another weakness.  </p><p>Now having said everything that I said, it's important--and--and--and it's important to follow the--the political winds. You know, another point is--you know if--if there are investigations, which we don't even know, it's--it's meandered about in the press, but if investigations have started, monopolizations, civil non-emergency (PH) investigations, they usually take a year or more to complete. And who's gonna be the decision maker at the time when these investigations are completed?  </p><p>It's not clear that (INAUDIBLE) he'd still be there. Will it--will it go beyond the Trump Administration if--if the--if the president loses reelection? You know if Elizabeth Warren's elected president, you can be sure she's gonna put people in place that--that are gonna follow these views. But so I think when we think about what's likely to happen, you gotta return to the political dimension as well. And it's--it's--there's a--really a lot of uncertainty.  </p><p>But I guess, the message I wanna leave is that the legal--the legal doctrine is--it's very difficult to--to bring these kinds of cases, and it's not at all an easy case to say, \"These companies are gonna be broken up.\" </p><p>ATKINSON: Great, well thank you, Seth.  </p><p>BLOOM: Sure.  </p><p>ATKINSON: So there actually was a logic to the order we went and I started with--with Thibault, like to--to give a kind of economics perspective, and Seth to give somewhat a political but--but really kind of an antitrust law perspective which is really where your background has been so deep. And then Alec, I wanna--I wanna turn a little bit, it may be a little bit more of a technology perspective, 'cause a lot as--as Seth said, these are really different companies. A lot of times they're different industries, and--and a lot of these questions boil down to, sort of how the technology works, and what the technology's about in competition. So I'm gonna turn it over to you.  </p><p>STAPP: Yeah, I'm definitely going to touch on that.  I think it's important to think--keep in mind how different these companies are.  We'll go on to go into the tech part of that in the latter part of my comments.  But I first want to follow up on Seth's point about how extreme a remedy would be to break up big tech companies.  I think it's really important to keep in mind.  And the most important point I want to make in my comments today, is that we should keep our eye on the ball.  And so, when we have anti-trust problem, it's normally we think of that as prices are too high, outputs too low, quality is too poor. </p><p>The reason this debate can be confusing sometimes is because we don't witness those problems with big tech, right?  Their products and services are either free or very low cost.  Output is essentially unlimited for software services.  So, we have to--you hear in the debate a lot of other problems that are bandied about, but they're actually not anti-trust problems.  And so using anti-trust most extreme remedy to solve a non anti-trust problem, doesn't make sense to me.  And this is really following up on Thibault's point as well about the public choice problem. </p><p>Can we achieve a stated goal with a particular intervention?  And today we're talking with particular intervention of breaking up big tech companies.  So, I just want to run through a few of the most commonly cited problems and discuss why they're not actually anti-trust issues, or not primarily anti-trust issues.   </p><p>Privacy, should we break up big tech to improve privacy?  That's misguided to me because we have privacy regulations in this country and private sector privacy laws.  And the FTC also regulates unfair and incepted practices, which often are covered in privacy issues.  So, we have remedies, they're outside the domain of anti-trust for solving those privacy issues.  For interference in election is a big issue in the news, with Russia interfering in the 2016 election.  But, there's good data from political scientists that this often overstated.  I saw one report that a number of ads purchased by the Russia government was less than what a political consultant would buy for an attorney general race in Nevada.  The number of people who saw these ads is very small, but it's a real issue and I think we should address it. </p><p>And so, instead of breaking up big tech companies to stop Russia from buying ads on tech platforms, you could do things like pass the HONEST ADS Act in the Senate or something similar in a very targeted remedy to that particular problem.  You also hear, especially from Senator Hawley on the right that social media as addictive and even harmful for mental health.  He seems to suggest that you shouldn't even be using it.  Even though he, himself does, which is ironic.  I think again, the science here is very debatable.  I see evidence on both sides for the benefits and harms of using social media, but I think we should be very cautious about taking that away from people.  As well as, how does breaking up the large platforms and make small platforms should do less.  I don't see how that works.  </p><p>Hate speech and violent content, especially with the New Zealand mass shooting.  There were big outcries that big tech companies didn't take down that, those videos quickly enough as they were spreading throughout the internet.  But, my intuition,  and I think there's a lot of good evidence for this, is that the economies of scale with content moderation mean that the big tech companies are even better placed in small platforms to take down this kind of content.  It is in their interest to do so.  I assure you that they're doing everything they can, because it's not good business sense for them to leave violent content out that goes against their explicit terms of service.  So, I think the issue would actually get worse if you broke up the big tech companies.  </p><p>Too much control over the public debate, so there is a lot of political speech and discussion that happens on these big tech platforms.  But this is a particularly confusing problem to be raised for me because we live in the most abundant information society ever.  So, having too much control for the public debate is interesting today, because you know, just a few decades ago there were three evening news channels where everyone got their evening news from.  You had maybe your local newspaper had a monopoly in the local market.  So, in today's age the idea that you can't access of diversity of political speech or opinions, both online and in the analog world, is amusing to me.   </p><p>Censoring conservatives, I think Seth brought this up.  As far as we have the evidence for today, that's just a myth.  Evidence shows that Fox News is actually the most dominant news publisher based on engagement on Facebook.  So, again, the conservatives often cry about being censored--news platforms are often doing so on online platforms.   </p><p>And then finally, in terms of particular issues we care about, the one that's most likely to be construed as an anti-trust issue is these tech companies dominance in their various local markets.  But, often breaking them up based online of business, and this gets to Rob's point about how these tech companies are very different, is if you break up Google along business lines, Google would still be dominant in search.  There's not a real rationale way to break Google search, so that doesn't solve your problem in the search market if you think there's a problem.  Amazon would still be dominant in e-commerce if you broke up Amazon web services or their logistics center.  And I don't really know how you'd break off the Amazon logistics from the online marketplace, it doesn't really make sense.  So, that's my biggest point today is, that, again if we want to use an anti-trust most extreme remedy like breaking up companies, we should make sure that we have an anti-trust problem that could potentially be solved by that. </p><p>And to talk more about why these tech companies, why breaking up particular tech companies from a technology perspective wouldn't be easy.  I'm glad to see we have Will Rinehart(SP) here from the American Action Forum.  I highly recommend reading a report he wrote recently on the back-end technologies that these platforms use.  So, often times, from the outside looking in you think, oh this is a conglomerate, so I can identify different apps.  Look at Facebook for example, it'd be pretty easy to break off What's App, Instagram, maybe Facebook Messenger, from the main Facebook platform, because they have different apps in the App Store.  But these platforms actually share a ton of back end technology.  So, in Facebook's case for example, they use an internal technology called bagpipe to load pages faster, they use internal technology called haystacks, stores photos efficiently, and unicorn to search social data.  Those are applicable across all their platforms. </p><p>And you actually see this in your present experience of these platforms.  If anyone was using Instagram, Facebook Messenger, or What's App last week, when there was a problem loading images.  And that problem occurred across all their platforms, because they're using the same technology.  And so, if you were going to break up Facebook, it's not a simple question of just spinning off the apps, you have to ask how they share the technology that they were using internally across teams.  And how would they break up employees who were working across multiple projects, there'd be licensing issues.  We're not saying it's impossible, but I'm just saying its much more complex issue than who say, breaking up big tech would be easy might lead  you think.  And in my Facebook example, this is true across all of big tech platforms. </p><p>And I think there are definitely incremental remedies that get us a lot of--at least some knowledge about this sector that we aren't doing yet.  So, you see--I think bipartisan support for merger retrospectives.  Instead of saying ahead of time that we need to just to undo these mergers that were anti-competitive, let's study the issue first.  We have Commissioner Slaughter(SP) who said, we should direct merger retrospectives to unwind these mergers.  I would disagree with that.  But, Commissioner Wilson(SP) said at the FTC, that we should at least study them to increase economic learning on a go forward basis. </p><p>And then, my final point I want to make is, that let's not forget that big tech is extremely popular.  So, this is in part, a political debate.  And so, when people are asking to break up big tech, they're asking the government to do so.  But in numerous surveys and polls, big tech in terms of reputation, in terms of institutional trust, in terms of popularity, polls much higher than the government entities that would be tasked with breaking them up.  And so, I think it's interesting to see that yes, in some in quarters it's popular to talk about breaking up big tech.  But, in general, for the median American, for the average American, big tech remains extremely popular.  And I'd just refer you to polls based at the Baker Center at Georgetown.  Gallup has polling on this, and Axios(SP), as well.   </p><p>ATKINSON: Great.  Thank you, Alec.   </p><p>You had mentioned earlier in a talk I saw you at about the issue of bundling and using a great example of flashlight.  Could you give--maybe do a minute on that? </p><p>STAPP: Yeah, yeah definitely. </p><p>So, I think, in my opinion a platform is just another word for a bundle of features.  And so, all features on all the platforms that you use on a day to day basis are either made first party, meaning by Facebook if we're on Facebook's platform, or Google, or Apple.  Or a third party, these are the apps you download that aren't a part of the main platform that come in.  So, in the iPhone case, and this is where--Elizabeth Warren part of her big break up big tech proposal, she loves to use the baseball analogy.  You can't be both the umpire, you know, calling balls and strikes, and have a team in the game.  That's unprincipled, unfair.  And it makes some intuitive sense until you think more about how the MLB works.  So, in the MLB the umpires are hired and fired by the team owners.  The team owners in the off season set the rules of the game.  And so, they also own teams that participate in these games.  And lastly, its interesting because the MLB is exempt from anti-trust law, because it's been determined that it's pro-competitive, they need restraints of trade to run the league in an efficient pro consumer way.   </p><p>And so, I think you see the same kind of rationale and reasoning for why it makes sense on your Apple iPhone if there are some apps that can bundle with the iPhone, and some apps like things you can download from third parties.  And Rob's flashlight example is how an app that didn't ship with the first iPhone was a flashlight app, very simple, easy to use, and you could download it from third parties for free.  But, over time, Apple said, you know what, like super easy for us to bundle this into the platform, it's pro consumer because we're going to give them the Apple version.  You know, it has no ads, it doesn't you know do sketchy things with your data.  And then those app developers, there's good research on this, once things like flashlights get bundled into the main platform, they go off and build more innovative apps that are harder to be replicated by the main platform. So, its pro innovation, pro-consumer, and bundling happens everywhere.  And it's not necessarily anti-competitive. </p><p>ATKINSON: Thank you. </p><p>I was struck by your example that in a Fox News on Facebook.  My favorite example of that was, I like to look at a lot of different sites.  I was Breitbart, Breitbart had a whole thing decrying Facebook and they were doing then a sort of like, town hall decrying Facebook on Facebook. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>STAPP: Right.  Right. </p><p>ATKINSON: So, ok.  Get rid of Facebook, but while we still have it, we're going to use it.  So, alright.   </p><p>Jason? </p><p>OXMAN: Alright.  Thanks, Rob.  And thanks for the opportunity to be here with you, in a long series of turbid events.   </p><p>ITI is the trade association of the technology industry.  So, I will begin by stipulating that some technology companies are big.  Having made that stipulation, I will issue a second stipulation, which is that the government has a role in ensuring markets are competitive.  From there, however, as my fellow panelists have noted extensively, we seem to have departed from a question of specific policy issues or specific markets.  And we've grown that into a broad-brush indictment of big technology companies.  And the policy dialogue has therefore shifted from one of addressing those specific issues to one of rather dramatic remedies like anti-trust.   </p><p>And in the same way that Seth suggested that we look to the political marketplace to see where some of these ideas are coming from, I also think it's important to revert back to that famous line from Brown Shoe, the anti-trust case, that reminds us all that anti-trust law exists to protect competition, not competitors.  And thus, it behooves us to look at who is in the competitor marketplace is spending a lot of time suggesting that anti-trust remedies for technology companies are worth imposing.  And, fortunately there's no shortage of public messaging by some competitors who may feel challenged by the technology industry. </p><p>So, I think when we analyze what's happening and why it's happening, its important that we look to some of the voices.  And this has been true over the history of anti-trust as well.  So, the retail community, for example, having expressed concerns about e-commerce, in particular e-commerce companies.  I'll quote here from RILA, the trade association of big retail, never heard that term used before.  \"Its pretty clear to us that the FTC and different relevant regulators should be taking a much closer look at technology companies and we are here to help.\".  That's a nice sentiment there. </p><p>The newspaper industry, which has expressed concern about the online ad marketplace.  The trade association, the newspaper industry testified before House Judiciary just last week and said, that tech companies represent a new potentially existential threat to the news industry.  Cable television, which has long complained about broadband services delivering content.  The head of the NCTA, a former anti-trust lawyer himself, here's a quote from him, \"For years big tech companies have been extinguishing competitive threats by buying or crushing promising new technologies just as they are emerging.  Competition policy must scrutinize more rigorously the deals that allow dominate platforms to kill competitive technologies in the cradle.\".  And here's a last one, \"For the life of me, I'm puzzled to know why the powerful corporations controlling these playing and talking machines are totally blind to the moral and ethical questions involved.\".  Alright, that's not a--that's a quote from 1906. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>That's from John Phillips Sousa(SP), who was a composer.  Who you may know took a break from composing music to become a lobbyist?  He lobbied Congress to outlaw the technology of the day that he considered a threat to his business, the player piano.  He made his money selling sheet music.  He thought the player piano was going to kill it.  So, he lobbied Congress to adopt legislation to outlaw the player piano. </p><p>So, this happened-- </p><p>ATKINSON: --changed his tune a little bit later. </p><p>OXMAN: That's a--I can't-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I can't believe it.  You should be ashamed of yourself.   </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>ATKINSON: But he did, because once he saw that he sold music-- </p><p>OXMAN: --that's true then-- </p><p>ATKINSON: --changed-- </p><p>OXMAN: --he did, he did.  That is true.  That is true.  I should have given him credit for that.  No one from the Sousa(SP) estate hopefully is here to have raised that. </p><p>Now, you probably know the statistics about how the technology industry has actually been beneficial to these to same industries that are calling for anti-trust review of these technology industry companies.  The cable industry, for example, look at Comcast last quarter numbers.  They lost 121,000 video cable customers, but the gained a net of 375,000 broadband customers.  Digital subscriptions are saving the news industry, as is digital advertising.  Look at the New York Times last quarterly results.  Print advertising fell 12 percent to $69 million, online advertising rose 19 percent to $55 million.   </p><p>And of course, 24 years now after the commercial use restriction was lifted on the internet, still 90 percent of all retail in the US takes place at brick and mortar stores.  So, I would suggest that we--it's often important to kind of look behind the current when you hear these calls from competitive industries to analyze technology under anti-trust.  And this is true, this dates to the beginning of anti-trust.  Senator John Sherman(SP), for whom the SHERMAN Act is named, there's a great article that I can send anybody that's interested in it, about his motivations in introducing the SHERMAN Act.  He was actually upset at the former Governor of Michigan who was an anti-trust purveyor himself according to Sherman.  He was associated with the Diamond Match company.  Sherman was mad at him and actually gave remarks on the Senate in the introduction of the SHERMAN Act saying, we need to pass anti-trust law to go after the Diamond Match company, a former political rival happened to be associated with it. </p><p>So, this is nothing new.  And it goes back, you can go back over time and look at anti-trust law and there's always somebody calling for it.  That's not always a bad thing.  I'll mention an example where I think was actually a good thing in a minute.  But, if you look at cases historically, it's always important to look at the competitors that are trying to make it happen.  Rob mentioned the RCA case, there were a lot of TV manufacturers in the US that were concerned about RCA that lobbied the government to look into RCA.  And as Rob goes into great detail in Big is Beautiful, which I originally thought was Rob's autobiography, but-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--is actually a terrific treat on the importance of looking at these issues with an eye towards why things are happening, not just what's happening.  You know, RCA did what did in technology and has a great role in the history of television technology.  When they were required to license their technology for nothing, what did that lead to?  How many people have purchased a US manufactured TV in the last 30 years?  Well, there aren't anymore.  So, that's where that ends up. </p><p>You know, the IBM suit is another good example.  At the same that the government spent 13 years in its eventually aborted anti-trust investigation of IBM, 24 of IBM's competitors filed private anti-trust lawsuits against IBM.  Now every single one of those cases that went court, IBM won.  And as we all know, 13 years after opening the investigation, the anti-trust division dropped it.  There was a great quote in a 1982 article in the New York Times from William Baxter(SP) who was the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the anti-trust division.  He said, dropping the suit was the only sensible thing to do.  It was based on what he called flimsy evidence.  And he labeled the IBM case an example of anti-trust enforcers quote, \"Trying to push the boundaries of anti-trust protection beyond what the law provides.\".  And again, there's great stories about those IBM competitors going to the Justice Department and saying, you got to investigate them at the same time, they were filing their private suits.   </p><p>This happens in the modern day as well.  You know, the Philadelphia taxi industry went and filed an anti-trust suit against Uber when they came into the market.  Fortunately, the third circuit saw through that as an effort to block competition when it entered the market and tossed the suit.  And they noted that although appellants may have been better off financially if Uber had not entered the Philadelphia taxi market, they have no right to exclude competitors from the market. </p><p>I mentioned before that it's always important to look at who's behind things, and that's not always a bad thing.  I will cite one anti-trust suit that probably was a good thing, and that was AT&amp;T.  Now AT&amp;T had been under investigation from the Justice Department in some form since 1913, back from the Kingsbury(SP) commitments, to the time in 1982, as Seth noted that they were consent decree was entered into that went into effect in 1984.  There's a great book that I commend to all of you called, The Deal of the Century by Steve Call(SP), written back in 1986.  It traces the history of MCI's engagement in this case.  If MCI had not gone to Justice and lobbied on Capital Hill and tried to make this happen, that investigation never would have reached fruition.  Again, not that AT&amp;T's break up was a bad thing, the consent decree was probably beneficial.  But it was really MCI that played a very powerful role there.  I think that's important to remember. </p><p>So, you know, today no--unlike AT&amp;T, which owed its success to a government grant of monopoly, no technology industry company player, regardless of size today, owes it success to a government grant of monopolies were a very different innovation driven marketplace today.  So, as you ask questions here inside the beltway, because this is an inside beltway issue.  We know the surveys, we know the research, we've done it ourselves at ITI that show that consumers love technology products, they love innovation, they're not complaining the products and services they carry around.  Nor are they are complaining their ability to get whatever they want delivered to their doorstep in two hours.  But, using anti-trust law to target the nations technology leaders is not only over broad, as we've heard there are plenty of policy pathways to dealing with specific issues, like privacy, that we need to address.  But we want to make sure we don't listen to the wrong voices, that we don't listen to competitors that are looking to use anti-trust law to hobble their competitors, because they're concerned about adapting their business plans accordingly.   </p><p>And as was mentioned, you know, these are our crown jewel companies here in the US.  Anybody that's had a chance to look at Mary Meekers(SP) latest slide presentation, which is a great annual read, knows that you know, her latest stats from two weeks ago, China now has 21 percent of the world's internet users.  India has 12 percent of the world's internet users, the US is in third place now with that.  China now has eight of the top 30 technology companies in the world.  Look, companies are going to continue to innovate.  We're going to continue to have innovative products and services launched in the marketplace.  But, let's make sure that we address specific policy issues with the right policy tools.   </p><p>If you're concerned about privacy, lets adopt federal privacy legislation.  If you're concerned about you know, retailers having their own house brands, let's look at whether Kirkland should be allowed to sell gin at Costco, which is terrific by the way.  I commend it to you, makes a great martini.  Or you know, Target should have Cat and Jack clothes, which I dressed my kids in for years.  Or, hey look, I wear, I'm not wearing them today, but Bonobos pants, which are great, I love they're clothing, they're owned by Wal-Mart, should Wal-Mart have its own house brands.  You know, I don't know.  But if that's a concern lets look at that specific issue. </p><p>But, lets not allow incumbent industries to send us all down the wrong path and use anti-trust law to hobble successful market entrance and competitors.  Or to say that big is bad just because big companies happen to have truly innovative beneficial products that people like to buy. </p><p>ATKINSON: Great.  Ok.  Thank you.   </p><p>So, I know this has been a one sided shall we say.  We certainly have attempted in the past to do debates on this.  I debated Tim Woo(SP).  If you haven't read Tim's book, I encourage you to read that, Columbia professor on anti-trust.  And I would certainly be happy, anytime, any day, any place to debate Barry Lynn(SP) at Open Mark(SP).  In general, I think having these debates would be quite useful.  I'll reach out to Barry again and see if he wants to do it. </p><p>But, having said that, I do think one of the interesting things here, when Mike--Mike Lind(SP) and I wrote our book, we read a lot of the literature about the what we call the neo Brandeisan(SP)  movement which kind of resurrecting Justice Brandeis' views that big is just inherently bad.  As Brandeis said, it was the mark of Cain.  Any firm that gets large has the mark of Cain, in other words, the only way to get large is through sinning.  And it was very interesting, one person on this side who's involved in the movement, said to--basically kind of internal article of the group--we're really, really going to be hard pressed to win this argument on the basis on consumer welfare.  Because these companies are so unalloyed, good for consumers, that we have to come up with some other argument. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And so, I want to actually ask Seth here, because you know one of the bedrocks of anti-trust doctrine theory for the last 50 years, has been the consumer welfare doctrine standard--Joe Kennedy wrote.  Talk a little bit about that, what does that mean, why is that important? </p><p>BLOOM: And it's become somewhat controversial in recent years in this debate.  So, the idea is that what anti-trust should be about is serving consumers and enhancing consumer welfare.  And it shouldn't be about, as Jason said, protecting any one competitor.  And that was sort of bedrock of antitrust law for the last 30 or 40 years.  It was sort of an outgrowth of the Chicago thinking.  But, because of that, because it comes from the Chicago school, and because it doesn't take into account other issues, it's come under a lot of criticism, particularly from the left.  </p><p>Now, you initially think about consumer welfare standard is that the criticism is that all the consumer welfare standard cares about the price that consumers pay.  And if consumers are paying a low price, then their practice can't be anti-competitive or be against the anti-trust laws.  While it might lead to income inequality or some other thing that is bad.  But, in fact, as Megan Donahe(SP) recently said in Israel a few weeks ago, consumer welfare standard can account to a lot more than just price.  It can take into account quality and the effects on innovation.  It's really a flexible doctrine.  It's not just focused on price, but it's looking at to see where the practice or merger.  But we're talking about privacy here--having an effect of limiting consumer welfare or enhancing consumer welfare. In my mind, that is a proper standard as applied, and it does mean more than just price.  It could incorporate privacy if a practice or a merger leads to a decline privacy protection.  Well, that would against the (INAUDIBLE) welfare standard, as I understand it and as Megan Donahe talked about it. </p><p>But I think we have--if we think that anti-trust is going to more issue than just consumer welfare and I sort of broadly (INAUDIBLE) welfare, but income inequality, the effect on labor markets, the effect on political speech.  All these sorts of hazy concepts, well that's a dangerous road to go down, because--I talked about the discretionary nature of anti-trust.  It just makes it more discretionary.  And it leads to an end of a consensus about what anti-trust is about.  So , what you're going to see, if that's the approach we go, different Administrations are going to take different approaches to anti-trust, including in the big tech sector.  And its going to go back and forth between Republican and Democrat. </p><p>Elizabeth Warren is the president, she's going to a very different view than even if Joe Biden were, or a mainstream Republican would take.  So, I think you got to be very careful of about thinking about (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ATKINSON: Great.   </p><p>Any other thoughts on that part? </p><p>SCHREPEL: May I jump in on that? </p><p>ATKINSON: Yeah, Thibault go ahead. </p><p>SCHREPEL: I think I've heard the word fairness, and it may be just my brain with playing tricks on me.  But, if you did, the word was mentioned, I would like to as you know, fairness is being mentioned more and more in Europe.  And I think the neo Brandiesan's are chasing that something that is good that we do it in Europe.  I mean, that we do mention fairness as being something more than consumer welfare and are pushing for that in the US. </p><p>So, here, I would like to say very briefly is that, to Margaret Vestigar(SP) mentioned the word fairness in 31 of her speeches.  None of them date from '14.  On the one from 2015, five from '16, five from '17, nine from '18, and already five from this year.  So, more and more she's using the concept.  So, I think there are two ways to look at that.  Either market decaying and fair three years ago, and there were not prior to you know, 2016.  Or fairness is a political concept.  And I think what it really in a sense carries, is that if you read her speeches, she actually opposes fairness and prosperity.  She says that although prosperity is important, but maybe sometimes you should get less prosperity and more fairness. And I think this is where you know you see that consumer welfare as being wholly taken out of the picture.  Indeed, if we don't reach any type of welfare, we just reach able to reach something else.  Hers is not a world I want to live in, but I think it's definitely the direction where European competition is going.   </p><p>And some, again, some in the US are taking that as an example.  So, I think, and I'm actually not sure they're could actually you know, make a combination between the two.  Prosperity and fairness, they go actually together in my mind, but not in the mind of top EU official. </p><p>ATKINSON: Yeah, the stat I really liked from our book is that there are more dentists in America in the top 1 percent than there are people who are software engineers.  So, if we're going after unfairness, I'm going after my dentist.  I love my dentist. But-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>STAPP: One small point to follow up on Seth's about discretionary enforcement.  I think there is a danger of moving towards more discretion.  Seth, earlier mentioned Trump making public comments about particular companies being investigated or even sued.  I think in Elizabeth Warren's proposal, and the medium blog post, a problem with that is that under-discussed, is that she specifically calls for unwinding mergers, between Amazon and Whole Foods, Amazon and Zappos, Facebook and What's App, Facebook and Instagram, Google and Ways, Google and Next, and Google and Double Click.  And I think if we're concerned about rule of law issues that occur in Administration where people are calling for specific actions prior to analysis and investigation by practitioners, by experts, I think we should be concerned on both of sides of the aisle. </p><p>OXMAN: And remember, Rob, that the press conference or the remarks where Senator Warren rolled out this plan, she mentioned the companies that Seth mentioned and then she got a question from a reporter who said, what about Apple?  And her response was, yeah break them up, too. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Kind of like, oh yeah, they're also a big technology company, so we should also break them up.  And it just shows you, and I think it's been pretty clear of everybody's presentation that this is--this is politics, this is, you know, this is driven by some outside interests, not by an actual market analysis that you would expect to see in an anti-trust case. </p><p>ATKINSON: Well, I'm going to open up for questions or comments.  If you have one, feel free to raise your hand and then wait. </p><p>Over here, Rachel(SP), and then please say who you are and-- </p><p>QUESTION: Chase Blasick(SP) from the US Asean Business Council.  First of all, I really appreciate it.  I have a background in tech, so I agree with 95 percent of the points you're making.  It's fantastic, especially the addressing specific problems with specific policy issues breaking up big tech.   </p><p>But I did want to ask, because it does it seem like some of the big tech companies, especially Facebook are having more of a say on free speech.  Even if its not affecting free speech, Mark Zuckerberg for example, they are saying, you know we want to have, we do want to regulate speech a little bit more into more of a friendly environment on Facebook.  It doesn't seem like there's any sort of critical mass happening there.  People should be worried about free speech. But, even recently he said Facebook should push for a living room environment with a small community of people speaking to each other, rather than just you speaking to your closest 500 friends, in quotes. </p><p>The only other social media app I know that is We Chat.  And they do it so they can control dissent.  Obviously, I don't think Facebook is trying to control dissent, but there are calls by big tech companies and big tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg to--if  not regulate free speech, to have a say in it. </p><p>One, do you think there's anything that needs to be done about this, will it settle itself if Facebook does a private living room model?  Will they just implode, and it'll fix itself?  Does anything need to be done or do you think is all will blow over? </p><p>STAPP: I'll go ahead and take that.   </p><p>I think that--I'm always skeptical when large companies, and we talk a lot about how we like Facebook, Google, Amazon, all these companies.  But, I'm skeptical even when they ask for more regulation or more mandates, because they have the--a huge team of compliance attorneys and engineers to implement any new compliance policies.  And so, that's going to be a heightened barrier to entry for new start ups that want to create their own social networks.  And I think as of now, in the current regulatory environment, that we've had since the '90's, is that it is relatively hands off and light touch with the tech sector.  In today's day and age, you can start your own social media platforms if you want to implement alternative terms of use and terms of service.  I know Jordan Peterson(SP), the Canadian Psychology professor is currently trying to launch a new platform online for right wing people that can say whatever they want, that would currently violate Facebook standards, best of luck to him.  If it works, then that means there's demand for his product and people want that kind of speech environment.   But I don't think that there are currently barriers.  And adding barriers, I think might even make the problem worse. </p><p>ATKINSON: Let me just add that, you know one of the complaints that Alec that you raised, that people are asserting is the hate speech in the New Zealand case.  So, a lot of these companies are between a rock and a hard place.  There's criticized for not controlling speech, and then they're criticized for trying to find ways to modulate it.  It's a really tough place to be in.  And in that sense, I think it's a societal question, society has to be the ones that gives guidance here.  And that's going happen eventually, but it will be a rocky road, I would argue.   </p><p>So, I think--right here </p><p>Yeah.  And then we'll go here. </p><p>QUESTION: Good morning.  It's Preston Knowles(SP) and I'm working with the Mar com agency, outcast agency, and we're rooted out of Silicon Valley in San Francisco.  We represent three of the five of those big tech companies.  So, naturally I have an interest in this.  But we also have other retailers and e-commerce companies and brands that we're working with.   </p><p>Do any of you all of an opinion on what the economic affect is going to be on these small businesses and these businesses who are trying to advertise in this companies, if we were to break these companies up?  And what affect does that trickle to the consumer who's going to have to pay more? </p><p>OXMAN: I think the short answer is that the technology industry has created enormous opportunities for legacy businesses to take advantage to new revenue opportunities.  This is not what the buggy whip industry did when the car was invented.  It was hard to see how to pivot, and you got to go make saddles, and when that didn't work, you make something else. </p><p>You know, I would go back to the stats I cited about the New York Times.  Their digital ad revenue is growing at 20 percent, the print ad revenue is dropping at 12 percent  a quarter.  It doesn't mean that their not still going to have an ad driven model, it's just that they need help in figuring out to derive those digital ads.  And a lot of the companies that we've been talking about do that business, are in the business, and are creating the revenue opportunity for them. </p><p>So, for companies that are legacy, whether they're retailers or otherwise, technology creates new opportunities, it creates new markets, but you got to be willing to change your business plan.  You have to do that, have that Clayton Christensen(SP) moment where you decide its ok to pivot, and take advantage of new opportunities.  That's what they should be doing. </p><p>ATKINSON: We can go right over here.   </p><p>I think, by the way, just to respond, I think the bigger issue there really is privacy.  We filed something with the European Commission a couple of weeks ago and had some data that showed that the GDPR really did hurt small advertisers.  Led to more concentration, and so we have to be careful.  And also, in some of these other spaces that we don't have inadvertent anti-competitive outcomes. </p><p>QUESTION: My name is Zanibar Kana(SP), I've been spending the last 10 years in the tech industry.  But, in the last few, between India and here.  I'm actually looking tech policy both in Europe and in America.  But to view towards advising governments in developing country. </p><p>What I'm--having said that, and I've been--I've been accused, especially in India of being too, you know, to be a tech booster on the one side and too favorably inclined towards the big companies.  So, I'm a little--I would like to go back to I think, Rob acknowledged that over the last couple of years, even within the US, I've found this panel very loaded to one side.  And the part that I'm missing, and I think was missing is the economic perspective.  And that's the many different of long loads on it.  Maybe it's the way I communicate. </p><p>One is this last point.  I think that current wisdom in economics, and I can't say--the hardcore sort of even, liberal, that we miss political economy and economics at our own peril, the relationship.  And specifically this particular issue, which is that issue of fairness and inequality are not soft issues.  They're very critical, going back to the work of 30 or 40 years from Atkinson.  Inequality aversion has a lot of, you know, it's an economic concern.  So, I don't think you can just deny it.  I don't believe people's presentation or really anything to do with economics.  Its really, it was the sociology of political behavior. </p><p>So, let me just mention two or three things.  There's-- </p><p>--ok.  Yeah, the question of consumer welfare.  I personally believe it's a very good one.  But there are dimensions which I'm missing, especially when you put in practice.  Especially, when you put it in the context of an economic, you know, judicial system, which is much more competitive.  You don't have so much type of policies and interventions here.  You argue between them, and there when you have inequality and resources, it's,  you know, fairness becomes an issue.  The reason fairness has become an issue recently is because economists have realized that they have, you know, a parade to optimality is not acceptable to society.  All institutions are created by humans. </p><p>ATKINSON: Ok.  Good.  Thank you-- </p><p>QUESTION: --so I think you are missing those-- </p><p>BLOOM: --if could just try to a crack at that? </p><p>ATKINSON: Yeah. </p><p>BLOOM: You know, I think you're absolutely right to talk about income inequality and it's a major issue for this country and for other countries.  The question is that is it an anti-trust issue.  And that's you know the focus of this discussion today.  And if we're concerned about income inequality, we should take steps to resolve it.  But, you can't--anti trust may not be well equipped to deal with it.  Now, hopefully a result of the proper anti-trust enforcement will be reduced income inequality.  But, that's a biproduct.  You know, anti-trust is not, it doesn't capture all of economic policy, and I think we have to keep that in mind.  As I said, it's already such a vague doctrine.  And just to make, to add these major concepts as part of anti-trust, I don't think is really realistic. </p><p>ATKINSON: I'll just add also, we reviewed that, the scholarly literature.  I agree with Seth by the way.  I think income inequality is a big problem.  We reviewed that literature in our book and there's a number of very good studies from academics that actually show that as firm size increases, inequality goes down.  Countries with bigger firms have less inequality than countries with small countries.  So, it's both longitudinally and across countries. </p><p>Secondly, the fact that I love the best on this, is there a very good study that showed the top 15 hedge funds or managers, or financial types, earn more than the top 500 CEO's combined.  Those CEO's include people like Tim Cook.  So, you know, the idea that somehow inequality is growing, which is true and it's a problem that's true.  But, somehow why focus only on this sector, why focus on big.  The evidence really, I don't think is very compelling, but-- Actually just-- </p><p>Since you raised that it, its important to raise, to go to the facts.  So, I published something on that recently, report looking at tax robots.  And we looked at that data.  When you look at that, it's just simply not true.  When you review the--at least in the US, when you review the bureau of economic analysis on income shares, what you find is that the labor share of income has gone down.   </p><p>Now, why is that?   Everybody down on the left or their Brandiesian, well labor share of income has gone down because capital share has gone up.  It's actually not true.  What went up are two things, rent--rent here, income went up.  Landowners, building owner income went up.  That's not tech companies.  And secondly, proprietor income went up.  More people are self-employed, or there's more self-employment income.  So the notion that labor income went down because capital income went up, it's really just not true.   </p><p>Other questions? </p><p>Right here and then here. </p><p>So, why don't we do two questions at a time?  We'll try to get through everybody and keep our responses really short. </p><p>QUESTION: Ok.  Cool.  Tom Strubel from R Street Institute.  Question about the politicization of anti-trust.  So, anti-trust laws are being enforced by private plaintiffs, state AG's.  But, at the federal level, we have the FTC and DOJ, who both have terminus jurisdiction because criminal trust enforcement won't be done by DOJ.  But, broadly, we have two anti-trust enforcers at the federal level, and they don't always have the same ideas about certain anti-trust issues.  And at least one of them is an Executive Branch agency that technically could be directed by the president.  There's been a long, you know, practice of the president not interfering in the DOJ's anti-trust work.  But, there's suspicion about the AT&amp;T, Time Warner merger. </p><p>And we've talked about the future of presidential candidates directing anti-trust enforcement.  Some people have proposed moving all federal anti-trust enforcement to the FTC independent agency to remove that possible political interference, or at least reduce it.  I'd be curious to hear the panel's thoughts on that proposal. </p><p>ATKINSON: Why don't we just do the second question?   </p><p>Right here. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi, my name's Avery James(SP), I'm an intern at Niskanen(SP) Center, and a rising senior at American University.  My quick question is that--there we go--I want to know specifically; Seth Bloom gave some great examples about a lot of problems that aren't anti-trust problems.  And I just was wondering if you could elaborate about what anti-competitive things are concern?  The recent story, I just want to bring to mind is there's some worries about for example, Google using a third-party vendor with Lyrics(SP) genius, I believe that puts special water marks of sorts.  Lyrics had found they made their way into Google's automatic result.  I'm curious like how you analyze that as like bad for consumers or good. </p><p>Thanks. </p><p>ATKINSON: Seth, why don't you also take the first one.   </p><p>BLOOM: Let me address--let me address the first one first. </p><p>And I completely agree with the notion that it's a crazy system we have.  That we have two agencies enforcing the same law.  One of them, part of the Executive Branch, one of them is an independent agency.  I would favor having the FTC as the sole anti-trust agency.  And actually, in the year 2000 when I first started working in the Senate, I rode into an oversight hearing speech of Senator Paul(SP), my boss saying, why are there two anti-trust agencies? </p><p>So, I'm glad to see now that people are talking about this.  But I think it's a--this is a historical accident.  The SHERMAN Act and CLAYTON Act were passed, the DOJ had the authority to do this.  The FTC Act, to enforce that law, the FTC Act was passed in 1914, actually the same time as the CLAYTON Act.  And then the FTC also had the authority to enforce the anti-trust laws. They didn't really think at the time that the inconsistencies, at least bureaucratic fights, (INAUDIBLE).  It's a crazy system, however, to change it would take an act of Congress, which I don't think is very likely, unfortunately.  Although, Senator Lee(SP) has talked about this recently, because the institutional prerogatives of members of Congress, the Judiciary Committee, the oversight of the Justice Department, Commerce Committee with oversight over the FTC, neither want to see their powers revoked.   </p><p>So, that's how I'd respond to that.  I don't think there's a good answer for you, that's just the system. </p><p>As to your point, by the way, so hate to be a descending voice, because we've all been totally in agreement.  But I don't mean to say that I don't think there's a role for anti-trust investigations of some of these companies.  And one of them that I think is really warrants anti-trust scrutiny, and perhaps anti-trust action, not break up, but anti-trust action, is Google.  And I've been very personally very vocal in that.  In fact, when I was on the anti-trust subcommittee, we had the first hearing in 2011 on this issue.  And there are expert testimony that led to the FTC investigation.  I think there's a lot of cause for concern about Google.  And I think these sanctions, I generally agree with.  </p><p>And particularly, and I think Google of all these companies is the one company that has to worry.  And particularly, you mentioned that issue is an issue that I think is worthy of an investigation.  But, the issue of the android operating system, and that Google telling phone manufacturers you have to put Google apps and not install competitors apps.  Well, in 1998, the Justice Department brought a pretty similar case that was against Microsoft.  And it was because Microsoft was telling OEM's, original equipment manufacturers, computer manufacturers, that they had to preinstall software that was Microsoft software and not substitute Internet Explorer, and not install competitor software, such as Netscape Navigator, which essentially destroyed Netscape Navigator.  But they contended that was an effort from Microsoft to maintain its monopoly. </p><p>As I said earlier, that didn't result in a breakup, but it resulted in a court of appeals decision, the DC circuit saying, yes that was anti-competitive conduct.  And I think for that reason, we have that DC circuit precedent.  That puts Google in a lot of, a lot of concerns here.  And the DOJ didn't take that investigation to do nothing. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>ATKINSON: I want to turn over to Alec but thank you. </p><p>By the way, if you're interested in that, there's a great podcast called Business Wars.  And it's just competition between businesses.  And one of them is on Netscape versus Microsoft, a really deep dive, it's like five-part series, a lot of fun. </p><p>Alec? </p><p>STAPP: Just quickly--I'm glad you brought up the Google Genius case.  I think a lot of the facts are still in dispute.  But from what we know today I think this is a great example of how some people might call an anti-trust issue, but its really a copyright intellectual copyright issue.  And from what we do know right now is, that Google also licensing the underlying lyrics itself.  And it works with a service called Lyric find to get those lyrics.  And so, maybe there is some way that Genius content got caught up in Google's algorithm and maybe there's a problem to be fixed there.  But, under current law they have not violated copyright law because they licensed underlying lyrics themselves.  And so far, if there is a problem there, it can be handled in a copyright domain, not an anti-trust domain. </p><p>OXMAN: And I think Google came out and said that they were addressing that specific problem with an algorithm fix. </p><p>SCHREPEL: May I add something on the first question?  Can you hear me? </p><p>ATKINSON: Yeah. </p><p>SCHREPEL: Yeah, very briefly.  Looking from you know your system from the outside, it does look weird to have two agencies and take a lot of time to understand why.  But what I've done is that I also I'd look at the actual projects of those agencies.  And what you see is that its prickly correlated to the amount of fines they impose.  And actually send the budget request to the Congress, it's the first and almost the only thing that mention is that, oh last year we done so well, give us more money, basically. </p><p>And I think while it will be interesting to think instead of maybe, you know, indeed thinking of another act to combine those two agencies, to find probably a new way to assess whether or not they draw as they should, instead of just focusing on the amount of sanctions.  And there are different ways to do that, but I guess it's a different topic, so.  But, that's the most interesting issue, I think. </p><p>ATKINSON: Ok.   </p><p>There's a question here.   </p><p>QUESTION: Hi.  Max Filling and I work with M Lex.  This question is directed at Thibault.  Although, Alec, I believe you'll probably have some input on this.  But you said that there is, we don't really have any way of understanding whether breaking up big tech would be good or better consumers in the current state of play.  But we do have sort of precedent in breaking up the big tech sector, like the big tech sector of the time.  I believe it was Jason that mentioned the AT&amp;T case.  And so, I'm wondering what the difference is now between, you know, these brand-new social media companies and the big tech of yester year? </p><p>SCHREPEL: Yes.  Do you have two hours to answer that? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>No, I think--well, first I think two different things.  The first is that its interesting to get to know why the companies in a dominant position.  Let's say they are.  I'm not even discussing whether or not they are.  Let's say big tech are in a dominant position.  Do they get dominant position from what they've done in the market or because at some point they were helped by the government?  I would say one difference.  And the other one is the network effect.  And you know, actually a good paper was published, an article in the Wall Street Journal explaining if you were to break up tech companies because of network effects, you will have ten different pieces and one of them will become as big as the previous one.  So, not only it's something that is not desirable, but it also ineffective, probably.  So, I would say that's probably the main difference.   </p><p>But, once again, two hours will be  </p><p>STAPP: And one small point there.  I think it shows the analogy that AT&amp;T was broken up into--as part of the breakup, in addition to many other remedies.  When they broke up into seven regional monopolies, and then over time because it makes sense to have national telephone network, they merged back together.  We saw multiple phone networks today.  But I think you see the same thing if you had a northwest Facebook, a southwest Facebook, they would merge together, or one of them would dominate the other. </p><p>ATKINSON: I think also to add to that question though, it is an important which I was going to ask the panel, we haven't talked about it.  And that's market definition.  Market of AT&amp;T was really calling to the customer.  I would argue that market for Google and Facebook is the ad market, that's the relevant market to look at with regard to concentration.  And do these companies have market power that's distorted in that?  And you could argue they don't.  I think they're account for 25 percent of the total ads.  It's a lot, but, it's not-- </p><p>Any comments on sort of how we should think about market definition going forward? </p><p>BLOOM: Well, market definition is absolutely a crucial issue.  I might disagree with you on that comment because of the effect on Google.  Yes, the ad market is harder there, if you're a company trying to market your wares, where you are on Google search engine ranking is crucial.  If you're on page 12, no one is going to see you. </p><p>ATKINSON: Well, that's a conduct issue, Seth. </p><p>BLOOM: Right.  But-- </p><p>ATKINSON: --structure-- </p><p>BLOOM: --but I think what I'm saying is that its more than just the ad market.  I'm not sure what the market is there, I'd have to think more about that.  But, that sort of goes beyond the ad market.  I think the ad market's very important.  I guess that's my only point. </p><p>STAPP: I would almost phrase that as what's the job to be done here.  I'm a business, the job to be done by advertising, marketing or the organic reach, is the job you done is to reach my customers.  I think that almost asks for a broader market definition.  And as we know, a broader market definition leads to results showing less market power, possibility to raise prices and lower output.   </p><p>SCHREPEL: If I may on that, because we just the Google cases.  It was quite surprising to say the least to see the European Commission decision in the (INAUDIBLE) case, the second one saying that Android is not competing with Google, with Apple iOS, because Apple iOS, the iPhone is more expensive than what Android phones usually are.  Therefore, its not the same market.  I mean, in the end, if you were to divide up something, you'd totally (INAUDIBLE) that application for, both right?  Because you want to reach the maximum consumers.  It's not super convincing and I'm actually super interested in seeing in the future, now that we know that iOS and Android is not in the same market, they were having to have the merger case at some point, how the European Commission will actually deal with the issue. </p><p>Now, that I've said that-- </p><p>ATKINSON: And we'll also Will, let you have the last question, but you know, we shouldn't forget supertarian(PH) dynamics.  I think several of the speakers, Seth, you raised that.  We shouldn't forget that Cymbian(SP) was the largest operating system, probably nobody what knows what Cymbian is.  But it was the Nokia operating system, and there was actually--right before Nokia jumped off the pool headfirst with no water, they was a lot of concern about monopoly with them.  And oh, we should bring a monopoly case.  And probably not a good idea. </p><p>QUESTION: Will Rinehart, Center for American Action Forum.  Everyone here has kind of talked about this Warren Medium post.  And the one thing that I actually find that (INAUDIBLE) people have talked about is their second effective policy remedy that exists within it, which is effectively a neutrality mandate.  And that kind of reminds me, at least, you know, conjures up in my mind the fact that a lot of the conversation has also tended towards some sort neutrality mandate or inoperability mandate.  And more specifically, an inoperability mandate for some of these larger platforms.  I think, personally, that's the much more likely scenario.  But I'm just wondering if you think that, that's something that actually probably pass, like a Congressional muster.   </p><p>Because, I mean we talk about telecom, we're talking about unbundling.  And obviously, there's a whole bunch of varieties of this.  But, basically, mandating that a certain kind of neutrality or service is--occurs between these competitors, seems to be much more of a likely outcome and a likely policy.  And I'm just wondering if you have thoughts on that. </p><p>OXMAN: Yeah.  I think there--that was an interesting part of her proposal.  And I'm glad you drew the telecom analogy, because what you're talking about is common carriage.  And that was the--that was the bargain that AT&amp;T struck with the government, right?   </p><p>Exactly.  We'll give you--the government will you give a grant of monopoly, we'll give you access to polls and ducts, and conduits.  You can string your wires, we'll insulate you from competition, from any other facility, we'll guarantee you 100 percent market share.  But, in exchange for that you have to agree to serve everyone at regulated prices.  And AT&amp;T said, well sounds good.  And that lasted for 125 years. </p><p>Frankly, I don't think that's a particularly good model.  And the reason that model is not applicable to the technology companies that we're talking about today is because, they actually arrived at their positions by innovating, not by the government putting a thumb on the scale to their benefit.  So, the idea that the government would regulate, whether it's content or interoperability, or portability of data, or whatever it is that the government seeks to do, I think the question you have to ask is why would anyone want to strike that bargain.  Why would they want the government to step in and regulate? </p><p>In the case of AT&amp;T, it was because in the absence of that, the government made a policy decision that rural America would never had access to the telecom service in the absence of common carriage.  Because AT&amp;T wouldn't have an incentive to invest in rural areas unless they were guaranteed 100 percent market share, and that worked out well for as long as it did.  I think in the technology industry; those incentives are not necessary.  The tech industry isn't asking for government to insulate them against competition, quite the opposite, in fact.  And therefore, that kind of bargain I don't think makes sense here. </p><p>ATKINSON: Great.   </p><p>Unless there's a burning desire to make a last comment.   </p><p>No? </p><p>Well ,I want to thank a great panel here.  Really, really insightful.  And Thibault, thank you for joining us from afar, and your insights into European anti-trust policy, in particular.  Thank you all for coming.  So please join me in thanking a great panel. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK6-9F91-JDPT-T01R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

My name is Daniel Gastro and I'm vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. For those of you who do not know ITIF, we're a Washington, D.C.-based think tank focused on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy. So today we're going to be talking about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law simply states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. </p><p>So, in short, this just means that online services are not legally responsible for all the things that others might say or do on their services. The law also says that online services should not be held liable for any actions taken in good faith to restrict access to objectionable material. </p><p>So, you know, these provisions have enabled U.S. Internet companies to thrive and it allows online services like social media platforms to moderate user content. Some critics say the law is too broad or the courts have interpreted the law too broadly. Most recently on May 28, a few days after Twitter fact checked some of President Trump's tweets, the president signed an Executive order pushing for various changes to online intermediary liability. Along these--the Executive order specifically tasked NTIA with petitioning the FCC to propose regulations to clarify when Section 230 may not apply because of sites editorial decisions and how to interpret the good faith requirement of law. </p><p>So, here to discuss the FCC's response today is Commissioner Geoffrey Starks. Commissioner Starks was confirmed to the commission last year. Prior to this he helped lead the FCC's Enforcement Bureau. He's also served as a senior advisor to the deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice. And, you know, throughout his term at the FCC he's been a lead voice on a variety of issues including the national security policy of U.S. communications networks, the need to address security in small and rural networks and the importance of protecting personal privacy as the nation advances and deploys advanced networks and other emerging technologies. </p><p>So, Commissioner Starks, a huge thanks for joining us today. I just want to turn it over to you for some--your initial thoughts and comments on this topic. </p><p>STARKS: Well, thank you so much for the introduction, Daniel. Thank you to ITIF certainly for organizing this event. Earlier this year, pre-COVID, seems like a lifetime ago, ITIF hosted me for a conversation in Puerto Rico where we had the chance to talk about, amongst those many interesting topics, communications resiliency. </p><p>And in preparing our communication networks to withstand all kinds of emergencies, a critical topic certainly for Puerto Rico, has been on my mind lately, of course, again with the hurricane season approaching and COVID-19 continuing to create unprecedented demand and so now, more than ever, the FCC, I think, must stay focused on closing the digital divide as its top priority and it's really not even close. You know, our longstanding digital divide has morphed into a monstrous COVID-19 divide. Internet inequality has magnified and deepened other inequities in our society. The pandemic has made the lack of access to online work, school, healthcare even more unacceptable. </p><p>And so with such a big challenge in front of the FCC you might ask why we're talking today about content moderation in social media a very good question. And so in my conversation here and--and--and following, going to talk about some of the issues that I think have developed obviously around 230, how it's arrived at the FCC's doorstep, what we should do about it. Debates in the liability shield embodied in Section 230 have been hotly contested for a number of years now. Section 230, of course, as you previewed, as Congress' deliberate balancing of free speech, privacy, innovation and security concerns and so it's no surprise that different folks, different stakeholders, would strike that balance differently. The direct presidential intervention in that debate is new. And as you mentioned on May 28, President Trump signed an Executive order that, we'll generously call it, takes a novel approach. </p><p>And for those who haven't read it in detail, here's the CliffsNotes version, the short version, the Executive order does really three things; first, you know, it directs the executive agencies to report to OMB within 30 days what funds they spent on marketing on online platforms presumably, so the president can direct them to stop spending money on--on those platforms that he deems to be, you know, \"problematic vehicles\" for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception and other \"bad practices.\" </p><p>Second, it directs the White House to forward complaints about online platforms censoring political viewpoints to the FTC and Department of Justice for enforcement and reporting and directs the attorney general to work with the state attorney generals on potential enforcement against unfair and deceptive practices and then third, and most relevant obviously for our conversation here today, is that the EO directs NTIA to file a petition within 60 days asking the FCC to make rules clarifying the relationship between Section 230 broad liability shield, in C1 and its protections for good faith in C2, blocking and removal of user content and defining conditions when an ICS providers moderation is not taken in good faith. </p><p>So, a--at the outset here, it is worth noting that the Executive order definitely gets one thing right and that is that the president cannot instruct the SEC to do this or anything else. None of the commission's rules require that we start a rulemaking, we're an independent agency, preceding simply because NTIA asked us to do so. The decision is ours alone and there are good reasons for the FCC to stay out of this debate. </p><p>So, today I wanted to talk about process first and why the SEC needs to really kind of keep from dragging this Section 230 issue coming to us; keep it from dragging out. Second, I want to move on to the question of the SEC's rulemaking authority here and then finally I want to raise some key questions around the substance of the Executive order itself. And so first, you know, without delay, I want to address the SEC's process and the timeline for handling rulemaking that the Executive order envisions. And given the role Section 230 has played in shaping American life online, we have to get this right. We need to act quickly. </p><p>And so for better or for worse, social media companies targeted in the Executive order play a vital role in our elections. R. Kelly Garrett, a professor at Ohio State found that in 2016, \"More Americans named Facebook as the site they most often use for political information in the month leading up to Election Day in 2016 than named any other site including those high profile news organizations such as Fox, CNN and major national newsp--newspapers.\" That describes, obviously, a sea change in how Americans learn about the world. </p><p>And so in 2012, only 40 percent of Americans reported using social media for political purpose. And so whatever you think of the merits of the Executive order, it represents the president's clear intention to influence how social media companies operate at a time when their decisions are heavily impacted in his own electoral future. </p><p>And so many commentators have noted that if the FCC is not unusually expeditious in its work, NTIA's petition will likely hang around through Election Day. The president gave NTIA until basically the end of July to send the petition to the FCC and so if we take the usual few weeks to process it, see comment in mid-August, we could easily end up with comment deadlines that are into October and from there the schedule is exclusively at the chairman's discretion. And so he may deem it best that the commission continue to wait before taking any additional steps in the rulemaking process. </p><p>But the timeline initiated solely subject with such discretion it seems inevitable that a dark cloud over online free speech the Executive order represents will cast a lingering shadow over our election--elections. So what should the FCC do to avert this looming burden on our democratic process? I believe we should make a decision and move on as quickly as possible. At its core, the Executive order is an attempt to work the rest as many have said, and more than that, I think, get them to swallow the whistle. And so clearly delay itself in resolving a pending rulemaking in this politically fraught conte--context, risks producing a chilling effect construed to make social media companies less willing to flag this information. </p><p>And so to help ensure that the EO doesn't interfere with our elections in the fall, I think we should press, and I'm calling to press, NTIA to send the petition as quickly as possible. I see no reason that they should need more than the 30 days from the Executive orders issuance itself so that we can get on with it, have the FCC review it and vote. And if it--if, as I suspect it ultimately will, the petition falls at a legal question of authority, I think we should say so loud and clear, close the book on this unfortunate detour and get back to the important work of closing the digital divide. The worst case scenario, one that burdens the proper functioning of our democracy, would be to allow, you know, the laxity here to bestow some type of credibility on the Executive order, one that threatens certainly a new regulatory regime upon Internet service providers with no credible legal support. And if this is as important as the highest office of the land suggests, then we need to prioritize it, reach a decision expeditiously as possible for our democracy. </p><p>And so while the chairman and I may disagree, untimely, on the legal merits here, I would hope that he does agree that the American public deserves our answer this summer and that we should not let this linger during the height of our 2020 elections. </p><p>On the second front here, while I do remain, obviously, open-minded about any forthcoming petition that the Department of Comm--Commerce may send my way as an FCC commissioner, based upon my review, I am skeptical that there's any role for the commission to act here as a creature of Congress, the FCC only has the authority given to it by staff statute. </p><p>And so we get the power to act when Congress expressly tells us to do something when it leaves an interpretive gap for the FCC to fill and I don't think either has happened here. On its face the statute does not give or direct the FCC, or anyone really, to make rules. Given that historical context, I think that makes a lot of sense. Section 230 was adopted in response to court cases that considered whether early interactive computer services, in those days obviously mainly CompuServe, Prodigy, whether they could ultimately be held liable for content posted by their users. Some of those cases made liability continent on the platforms decision to moderate content instead of acting merely as a passive platform. And as the statute itself explains, Section 230's authors wanted platforms to remove offensive content, create a family-friendly corner of the Internet and they worry that these early cases, the early law incentivized platforms not to. </p><p>NTIA, others might argue that Congress has left a gap for the FCC to fill by not defining good faith. That would be their hook. And that phrase might be vague in some context; here, however, you know, I really think there are strong arguments that no gap filling was intended. Section 230 provides a self-enforcing rule for courts to apply and private litigation. It does not really give the FCC an enforcement or administrative role and that's instructive, that's relevant here because good faith, or the lack thereof, is such a commonly litigated issue as well in contact cases. It seems entirely ordinary that Congress would have intended a court to undertake that analysis when evaluating Section 230 defense, and moreover, as I read the subsection, good faith here plays a sem--similar role to its use in contracts limiting what would otherwise be an entirely subjective assessment of whether an ICS provider considers something to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or the catch all here, otherwise objectionable. </p><p>So, third here, my--my third point, if the commission does proceed with a rulemaking, we will have to confront challenging substantive questions; perhaps most importantly the Executive orders approach raises serious First Amendment concerns and focusing on Section 230 we shouldn't lose site of the fact that the Constitution, not just merely a statute, protects private actors right to label, moderate, otherwise control speech on their platforms. </p><p>The First Amendment allows social media companies to sensor content, freely, in ways that the government never could and it prohibits the government from retaliating against them for that speech. So much, so much of what the president proposes here seems inconsistent with those core principles in making an FCC rulemaking even less desirable. </p><p>And so we'll also need to address how Section 230's rules would fit into the commissions larger regulatory framework; particularly in a world without open Internet rules. There are plenty of things about that status quo that I would change and I want to be clear that I think content discrimination by ISP raises questions that are wholly inapplicable to social media companies, but for those supporters out there of the restoring Internet freedom order, there will be difficult questions ahead about how to square their previous reliance on Section 230(b), the policy statements as a justification for divesting the commission of authority with the president's approach. </p><p>They'll also need to consider that ISP's are interactive computer services subject to Section 230 and the president's proposed rules. Those pieces really don't fit together neatly. You can't pretend to have a light touch regulatory framework when you're regulating content with a heavy hand. And so finally we have to be mindful of how broad the consequences of FCC action could be; consider, of course, the ten most popular websites in the United States as of 2018, Professor Jeff Kosseff noted in his book, that six of those primarily rely on videos, social media posts and other user content; that's YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Wikipedia, Twitter and eBay. And if the liability shield under Section 230 were pierced, these platforms and business models would have to fundamentally change. Congress created Section 230 because it wanted those places to offer something less than a user generated free for all. A world where interactive computer services risk liability for removing offensive content would radically alter those sites. The FCC would need to be extraordinary, extraordinarily careful about upsetting the balance Congress created. And so that's not to say that there's no room for debate here, the broader debate about Section 230 long predates President Trump's conflict with Twitter in particular, and there are so many smart people who believe the law here should be updated. </p><p>I share the concern that Section 230 has, at times, been used to immunize criminal behavior; left victims of stalking, harassment and--and much worse without an effective remedy, moreover, particularly as a parent of young children. </p><p>I do share the desire to maintain strong incentives for companies to keep some places online safe for kids and these are very valid concerns and they do deserve a robust examination and debate but ultimately that debate belongs to Congress. Congress laid out the original scope of Section 230, the liability shield. I think Congress should decide whether to change it and that the president might find it more expedient to influence a five-member commission than a 538-member Congress is not a sufficient reasons, much less a good one, to circumvent the constitutional function of our democratically elected representatives. </p><p>And so let me close by saying, unlike many of the spectrum issues that NTIA in particular handles, I don't think this is a complicated technical issue. And so I call on NTIA, the chairman, to bring this issue before us as quickly as possible and right now. Let us be clear with the American public about what, if any, real world impact this Executive order has, let us avoid an upcoming election season in which the government can use a pending proceeding to, in my estimation, intimidate private parties. Thank you. </p><p>CASTRO: Thanks so much for those--those remarks, commissioner. And one of the things I just wanted to start with, you know, you mentioned the kind of--you--you called this a novel request. Has the FCC faced a request like this in the past? Is there anything that you're aware of that even comes close? </p><p>STARKS: Certainly nothing that comes close and--and--and especially, you know, a lot of this gets into--and I know we're going to have professors coming up here that I'm interested to hear from myself, a lot of this gets into constitutional issues as well of what is the impact of an Executive order? And what is its authority within the constructs of the law? Can it go beyond the constructs of the law and what is the impact thereof. You know, this is an issue that, you know, as an independent agency is--is coming through a (INAUDIBLE) from NTIA which is fine but I can't recall anything like this, and in particular, where it is wrapped up with so many First Amendment issues, constitutional issues. An--and again, the really--the fact that it pen--it--it so much looms over our upcoming election, I think all our signals that this is imperative that we handle this as immediately as possible; especially if there's no real legal footing, in my estimation. </p><p>CASTRO: And I wanted to ask also, you know, so there's obviously the Executive order that has gotten so much attention the last couple of weeks, but it--in addition to that, you know, you had Senator Rubio, Hawley, Loeffler and Cramer send a letter to the FCC asking the FCC to clarify, or clearly define, the framework under which technology firms, including social media companies receive protections under Section 230. </p><p>So, how would the FCC traditionally handle those types of requests while maintaining, again, its kind of independence--it's independence as a commission? </p><p>STARKS: Yeah, you know, we do get a significant amount of letters from folks on the Hill that are asking us to look into issues that they care about, to focus on issues that matter to them and so, you know, it certainly is--is nothing out of left field for senators to highlight an issue to us. </p><p>Obviously the statute is the statute. The law is the law. Section 230 has already been enacted. And so for senators to--senators or for folks on the Hill in particular to weigh in with us on what they would like to see certainly as a policy matter, as a resource matter, is understandable but really, you know, our obligation here, especially is to focus on the law already. And, you know, one person in particular who I think does have significant equities here, certainly with me, is Senator Wyden. He, of course, was one of the two original authors of Section 230 and so i--if he in particular indicated that the FCC was supposed to have a regulatory rulemaking authority here, that would be something that I would find weighty and would cause me to kind of do a deeper look in here but I really doubt that's going to happen. </p><p>CASTRO: So, one of the key points of the debate here that you--that you outlined in your remarks is this question of how to interpret the good faith provision of removing content. You know, how would you--you know, just stepping back even maybe from your direct role, how--how do you think that provision should be interpreted? In particular, I think the question goes to, what would be a bad faith takedown? </p><p>STARKS: Yeah, you know, it--having looked into the law here, serving the law here, you know, the good faith provision in, you know, Section 230(c)(2) has really decided relatively few cases. Most cases, because the liability shield in C1 is so broad, that is where most of these cases are disposed of and so good faith, in particular, is kind of rarely looked at. </p><p>You know a--as I kind of said, good faith is--is a common term of art that is involved in contract disputes and so it doesn't see strange to me that Congress would use those words and--and--and in particular in a fact specific way here but Congress knows very clearly how to give us rulemaking authority. The fact that 230 does not do any other work is not an engine for the FCC otherwise here. Again, as I said, I think is--is very much kind of instructive. It's very much relevant here and that's not to say that the statute doesn't--doesn't guide the--the courts are the ones who really have focused on this here. There hasn't been anything from a rulemaking regulatory standpoint that the FCC has operated here and so, you know, focusing on, you know, whether the otherwise objectionable seems to be the other part of--of good faith that seems like it is the tiny sliver, the tiny read upon which folks are going to say that maybe there is some ambiguity that needs to be interpreted by a rulemaking, by a rulemaking, authority here. And--and to get to your question of what bad faith would look like, you know, I think it probably would be something that the courts could get at through a fact-intensive, you know, probing look at--at what the terms and conditions were for any given social media company; whether they were being followed, whether there were other prior precedence in which they had followed it and that this was a deviation from that. </p><p>I think all those would be wrapped up but it does seem to be a fact-intensive inquiry and something that we don't, in particular, have extensive experience on here and then obviously a lot of this gets down into what the chevron doctrine would say here on something where we clearly don't have experience, expertise. The courts have otherwise taken the lead in interpreting Section 230; all of those, I think, are--are playing a--a significant rule in--in--in my mind. </p><p>CASTRO: Yeah. And so--so I know you said in you remarks that, you know, the statute does not give FCC authority to interpret 230 and that's your position. You know, setting aside the--the merits of some of the other views on that, you know, obviously, you know, the president thought there--there was room for that, the president's lawyers thought there was room for that. What would you envision is the potential, as the kind of range of potential, responses that the FCC could take in this space from, you know, some of the commissioners who might hold other views on this? </p><p>I think we have a-- a lock screen right here so we'll give you a minute to see if you unfreeze. If not we'll be joining our panel. Let me just give one minute to see if we can get Commissioner Starks back here. We're going to hope he's able to rejoin us. In the interim, let me go ahead and invite our two panelists to recon--to connect and join us. We have Eric Goldman and Kate Klonick joining us and I think we have the commissioner coming back in but I'm going to ask Kate and Eric to stay on anyway. </p><p>Here we go. Our audio is coming back up. We are not going to blame this one on T-Mobile. </p><p>STARKS: Yeah. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I--I--I think I'm back, Dan. Yeah, I don't know--I don't know what the fritz out there was. </p><p>CASTRO: No problem, we have you back, we're delighted that we have you back. So, I--I think where we lost you is I was asking, you know, what--I--I know you've identified the--you know, your mind the statute does not give FCC authority to interpret or reinterpret 230. I wanted to ask you, you know, what you think the potential range or the potential responses could be from the FCC among commissioners might hold a divergent view? </p><p>STARKS: Yes, and--and obviously--you know, each of us is our own ind--it's a five member commission. Obviously the chairman is the first among equals, as they say. And so, you know, the--the range of options as it appears to me is, you know, first we could do nothing which, again, I think has a--a long dark cloud certainly over our elections given that the Executive order could come--could come at any moment certainly up through kind of those two days. </p><p>You know, the second--you know, the other end of the spectrum would be obviously a full blown rulemaking and--and everything that that takes in terms of getting public comments, getting feedback, reply comments and ultimately starting some type of rulemaking. You know, and then obviously somewhere in between would be us disposing of this quickly and--and--and that would be kind of my recommended course. </p><p>And so there are a lot of functional ways that we can do that, but obviously it would be disposing of this as quickly as practical. </p><p>CASTRO: So, you know, one of the reasons this is such a hot issue is because, you know, many people, you know, just truly believe that major online social media platforms have an (INAUDIBLE) conservative bias. I get emails from people regularly about this issue. Do you think social media platforms should be politically neutral and--and do you think they're politically biased today? </p><p>STARKS: And so that is--it--it certainly seems to me, and--and this of course falls along the lines of anecdotal, but it certainly seems that conservatives have done quite well by using and deploying social media. And so it is a little bit beguiling to me that--that folks that have done so well, extremely through a number of social media platforms, are saying that there is some type of biased. Obviously when you really start to get into--anytime you're looking, we're not talking about First Amendment kind of time, place and manner where we're talking about, hey, you want to hold a parade and you have to fall within, you know, your application or a license has to come in a certain way, here where you're starting to actually probe into content, actually look into what is the--the nature of somebody's comments, that starts to really talk about First Amendment issues as I kind of suggested. </p><p>And so on that, you know, I think we really have to look at the constitutional backdrop here and private parties that are regulating their platforms in a certain way. And so an anticonservative bias certainly in that framework is--is hard for me to--hard for me to swallow and--and certainly when you're talking about a lot of the applications on the edge of our networks, you have a--you people have bread-baking apps which has become obviously very popular here with the pandemic. And--and they're fully entitled to do so especially through, you know, through their experiences and through their applications and so, you know, viewing on whether this is a--a real issue is something that I'm having a lot of trouble with, the anticonservative bias. </p><p>CASTRO: Yeah. Yeah, I guess my closing question to you is, you know, kind of where do you see this conversation going? Not just with the FCC but with Section 230? How do you think, you know, 230 will evolve as it relates to Congress and, you know, to address kind of your--your concern about, you know, providing a safe space online, you know, how do we ensure that the Facebook's of the world don't become, you know, all fortunes? </p><p>STARKS: Yeah, and--and--and on that issue I'm really excited to hear from our panelists that are coming up who are--who are really the experts here. You--you know, I think if you--I'd--you know, just from a functional standpoint, I think that is something that is better assigned to Congress and--and making sure that those policy arguments are fully vetted. I think it's going to be really important in some of those tradeoffs that I kind of mentioned between the values of privacy and security and some of the sympathetic victims that have posts about them by third parties. </p><p>We saw even already this morning that the Department of Justice has started to set forth a legislative framework that they would like to see effectuated here. And so I--I think there is--that is the proper channel and avenue for this to be further discussed rather than an FCC rulemaking which I think, as I indicated already, is going to have so many deleterious placements here. </p><p>CASTRO: And can I just ask, I don't know if you've seen the bill that Senator Hawley put out this morning. Do you think that starts to address concerns? </p><p>STARKS: I--I haven't had a chance to look at it, no. </p><p>CASTRO: Okay. Well, great. Well, with that, thank you again so much for joining us today and--and you know, sharing your thoughts on this. This is, you know, one of the most important issues that's coming up. As you said, it's going to impact social media platforms, it's going to impact the election, it's something that a lot of people care deeply about and, you know, we're really privileged to have you, you know, share some very insightful remarks on that today. </p><p>STARKS: Well thank you for the time. Thank you for the event and I'll look forward to the ongoing dialogue. </p><p>CASTRO: Thanks so much. So now we're going to turn over to our--our panel. As I mentioned, you know, we have two really respected experts on this topic today. Eric Goldman who's a Professor at Santa Clara University School of Law and Kate Klonick at St. John's University School of Law. Both have done extensive and exceptional work on Section 230. I'm really grateful that they're able to join us today to share their perspectives. </p><p>Also just a quick note for our audience, you are welcome to ask questions of the panelists at any time. If you're watching on our Website, ITIF.org. You can use the Q&amp;A forum under the video. If you're watching on YouTube then there's a link in the event description that you can click to ask your questions. </p><p>Let me just start first with Kate. I--you know, you've heard--you heard the commissioners remarks and you've obviously seen the Executive order. I'd like to get your just initial reactions in terms of what did you think when you first saw this Executive order and how does your thinking align with what the commissioner laid out today? </p><p>KLONICK: Yeah, thank you for having me. The Executive order, I--I mean, I guess when I thought when I saw it is, I think--what Eric will say as well, I just kind of thought that it didn't make any sense. And it did--like there wasn't--I think I kind of had this moment of like, did I miss whole sections of this law that supposedly implied administrative action that I just like--like maybe, you know-- And, no I did not and that was, you know, I think that--you know, I think it says something really significant that when you have an agen--that--you know, one of the commissioners of an agency that is, you know, is going out of his way to say this--this is not an authority that you're giving us that basically issuing the power to do something about this and saying this is kind of off-base. </p><p>I think that that's--I think that that's pretty significant. You know, the--the phrase when you're a hammer everything's the nail kind of comes to mind and if you're--if you're--if you're actually going to like, oh no, this isn't a nail, and you're hearing that from the hammer, I think that that's pretty significant and so, yeah, and I think that that's--and I mean, as kind of we're figuring this out, I think that--I'd be interested to hear Eric, what Eri--haven't had the chance to talk to Eric about this yet and then we do a lot of the stuff together, I'm interested to hear kind of what Eric has to say about--about kind of what this is as--as a type of political distraction, honestly, from--from other types of movement in this area around Section 230 and whether or not that even having--even wasting time kind of having conversations about this is--and giving it bandwidth is like whether or not that's, you know, worth doing. </p><p>CASTRO: Yeah. Eric, same--basically the same question to you. We'd love to get your thoughts on your initial reactions and where you think the impact will be; whether legally or, you know, in terms of the--the debate around this law in general? </p><p>GOLDMAN: Yeah, thank you. Thank you for having me and let me just start by saying thank you to Commissioner Starks for sharing such cogent remarks. I thought they were terrific and I agreed with so much of them. So, it was a great foundation for this discussion and I was so grateful that Commissioner Starks has clearly done a lot of thinking about the issues and understands them so well. So, I--that gives me a lot of--it heartens me about how the issues going to be reviewed at the FCC. </p><p>When I read the Executive order, it was pretty clear to me that I was not in the target audience. That it was meant for other people and I'm not quite sure who. Most obviously it seemed to be meant for the people who are likely voters for President Trump in the future to tell them that he hears their concerns and that he continues to fight for them. And so much of the Executive order was really the kind of stuff you would expect to hear at a President Trump for reelection rally, campaign rally, than what you would expect to see in a legally binding document that has gone through full legal vetting by a well-functioning executive branch. </p><p>So, as Professor Klonick indicated, it's kind of like, what did I miss? But really, you know, that ask--I--I don't think that question is helpful because if we're not in the target audience then we didn't miss anything, we just--it's not speaking to us, it's--it's addressing another--another audience. </p><p>But I think we're starting to see where the rubber meets the road and already this morning, you know, the suns still coming up here in California. But boy, Section 230 is on fire in D.C. We've seen both a new bill from Senator Hawley as well as the--the preview of a report coming from the Department of Justice targeting Section 230. </p><p>And both of those were contemplated by the Executive order but, as usual, the Executive order is a way for President Trump to claim credit for things that he actually isn't able to do or wouldn't be willing to do the work to do. So, these are things that were not tied to the Executive order they're just organic developments of an environment that is looking for ways to tear Section 230 apart. </p><p>So the Executive order doesn't do that but it just continues to lay the foundation for these, what I consider to be horrible policy ideas to keep--to take root and keep growing. </p><p>CASTRO: Thanks for that. I--I just want to make sure, you know, you've--you've pretty much both addressed this but I want to be very explicit on this; what role, if any, do you think the FCC should play in interpreting Section 230 or just this general question, intermediary liability? Either now under the existing law or even in the future, I guess?</p><p>Eric, maybe we'll start with you and then go to Kate. </p><p>GOLDMAN: So, I'm not an expert in administrative law but I thought Commissioner Starks did a great job of explaining why the FCC doesn't really have jurisdiction over this issue and even if it did, anything it would do would run into First Amendment limits. </p><p>One thing I'll add to this is, I'm reminded of the seminal Supreme Court opinion about Internet law. It came out in 1997, Reno v. ACLU where the court said that the Internet isn't like broadcasting and could not be subject to broadcasting like regulations. And as I think about the things that the FCC is best at, and how it has built its administrative architecture, it really doesn't seem to be the right tool for the problems that we're addressing. We're addressing things that are not subject to incursions under the First Amendment like say broadcasting might be. The Supreme Court said very clearly, in--in--and unambiguous language, the Internet deserves the highest level of First Amendment protection. </p><p>So, anything the FCC does is going to run into a much stiffer First Amendment buzz saw than what it might do in other areas like broadcasting or telecom. So it just doesn't seem like the right place to have that battle given the Supreme Courts clear signals about the different media. </p><p>CASTRO: Kate? </p><p>KLONICK: Yeah, I--I very much agree with that. Oh, I apologize, I very much agree with that. I think that there's--I'm also not an expert in administrative law, but my--my very understanding of like kind of the push for net neutrality and other types of ideas were specifically to keep the FCC from making these types of decisions and so putting this higher up the stack doesn't really make much sense to me. And I--I do think that there is--I do think that there is--this has turned into kind of a way to go after platforms and big tech companies because they hold a lot of power and a lot of amplifying potential for politicians and--and the government; or people who want to be in government and so I think that that's kind of--I really just think that that's what's--what's going on here and it's not really--it doesn't strike me as something that would be resolved by any administrative agency necessarily. </p><p>CASTRO: And so how do you think that issue should be addressed in kind of going forward because, as I think as you just pointed out, you know, the law can be weaponized against these companies or at least used to, you know, encourage them to take a certain action and--and that will remain true as long as the law provides a benefit to these platforms. </p><p>How--you know, how do you think this might play out in terms of, you know, over the next maybe five years? Will this issue continue to be brought up? Will there be any kind of resolution to this type of debate. </p><p>KLONICK: Yeah, I mean, I--I think that, I mean like anything, like any law, like any type of like--any type of new technology, there's going to be changing social norms around everything and that those eventually will be reflected in--in the law and--and their interpretation of the law. </p><p>So, yeah, I think that this is going to continue to--to play out. As Eric says often when he talks about this, like the maybe Section 230 doesn't always have like, it doesn't--won't always be the future but there's also really good argument, there might be an evolution in how we think about the First Amendment rights of the platforms themselves. And that might really grow to--to be as robust, possibly, through the courts as Section 230. </p><p>A--it's really--it's--it's very unclear but we're just in--in a massive norm setting period. Even in the--in the 25 years that we've had Section 230, our thinking about it has evolved enormously and is now we're in a period of kind of, I think, a little bit regression in how we think about Section 230 and what--and--and platforms. But it's reflecting something else that users really--and people really have which is, I think, that they don't--that, you know, these are private governance structures that these platforms have set up to govern public rights and that there's no amount of kind of democratic or participatory power that users particularly wield in that--in that realm over what those rights and who's making these decisions and that that's something that--that--that maybe the platforms need to have in the--to have a role in in the future or to build into their--into their systems. </p><p>But it's just not clear to me how any of that necessarily--the agitation around 230 seems to be a reflection around that but it's not actually a very sophisticated understanding of what the law actually does. </p><p>CASTRO: And Eric, if I can go to you on this, you know, how do you think policymakers should respond to concerns that the social media companies are censoring certain political views just as there's pressure on companies to act from the elected officials, there's also pressure on elected officials to act in response to constituent concerns. </p><p>GOLDMAN: So I--I personally try and avoid using the terms censorship to describe private companies making decisions about what speech they are willing to publish or not. To me, that terms is editorial discretion and that editorial discretion is its own independent right that's protected under the First Amendments freedom of speech and freedom of press. </p><p>So, whenever we see the debate shift towards how the Internet companies are censoring their users, I feel like we've taken an important shift at the--I'm not--I'm not willing to see to. Once we've re--reframed the discussion as what can Internet companies do to exercise their editorial discretion and do they have the freedom to exercise their editorial discretion in a politically biased way then I think the answers pretty clear. They do. I don't know that we want them to do that and, more importantly, it always strikes me as a largely academic and hypothetical question that we don't really have evidence. It's support that there's political bias in the way in which Internet companies exercise their editorial discretion, we have lots of examples where Internet companies make decisions that--that somebody doesn't like. In fact, every single content moderation decision that they make is going to create a winner, someone who got the outcome they wanted, and a loser, someone who did it. And those losers, over time, feel like they can look around, find other people who have the same outcomes and say, how come they're all picking on us? They're not picking on that particular category, they're just making these string of people who didn't get the outcomes that they want and the fact that then that gets converted into these accusation and political bias makes the entire discussion seem like it's real but it strikes me as deeply hypothetical. </p><p>The other thing I'll mention is that when we talk about political bias, I think a lot of times people assume that we're really talking about partisan bias; that there's Democrats and Republicans (INAUDIBLE) things. When we talk about political bias we open up the Pandora's box for a much larger range of questions about what is even a political issue or not. What--you know, thin--questions related to COVID. Should you be taking the following drug? Is that a political decision or is that a public safety decision or yet is it some third thing? Because we don't know how to answer that, it looks like everything is a political bias question because that sco--the--the--the scope of what can be politicized is unlimited. </p><p>So, to me, I think the moment we start talking about censorship and political bias. We actually swallow the fact that Internet companies are always going to make winners and losers. The lowers are always going to be unhappy with the outcomes that they got and they're always going to claim that that was the result of bias against them. </p><p>CASTRO: Thanks. And I want to-- </p><p>KLONICK: Can I just follow-up on that really quickly? </p><p>CASTRO: Sure, absolutely. </p><p>KLONICK: Yeah, I--I completely--completely agree with Eric here. I think that this is exactly right. I think that if you look at the history of content moderation and you really look back that there is just--there are two things that I would like--I think that the history of--of--of Section 230 be implemented into speech policies by the--by the companies really shows us. And one is that there was, at base, a real need to take down a lot of kind of what you would--so, \"bad content\" or content that people really did not want to see and a lot of that included things can--you know, like, Nazi--like Nazi propaganda or--or, I'm trying to--like glorification of Hitler or things like that and that was--those--some of those rules that went into effect in 2004 and 2008 on these platforms on Twitter and Facebook respectively, they are--the interesting thing here is not that there is--that those rules have changed very much over the last 15 or 10 years, in fact those rules are largely the same as they were when they were drafted by these companies. </p><p>Why we're hearing about it now is really a story of kind of almost like a coming to the (INAUDIBLE) of there has just been a rise in people who suddenly are using this type of extremist speech and this type of--this type of kind of--a lot of these really basic things that have--you know, people have wanted to come down for years and now there's just an uptick in the number of people saying them. </p><p>And--and so it's really kind of--it's really kind of an interesting thing because the other part of bias is that there is the--and the other part of how people are using the term bias in this--in this context of political bias or conservative bias is an almost mens rea of like a targeting--it builds in a mens rea of like targeting conservatives to take down this type of information. </p><p>And that's just not what's happened. The rules have always been this way. They might have been, like so that--so that people who wanted to glorify Nazism or white supremacy or whatever else were--were--were--had their speech removed but that doesn't--but the fact that there are now more people that want to do that is not that, you know, is not a reflection that there is more enforcement or that there's--the rules have suddenly changed. </p><p>And I think that that just kind of very--it just kind of gets the causality a little bit wrong to imply the--the--the opposite. </p><p>CASTRO: So we have a lot of audience questions coming in. I want to turn to those in a moment. I just want to make sure before we do that we address the other parts of the Executive order briefly. In particularly, you know, we focused on the FCC component of this but the Executive or--order also prohibits federal spending on advertising on platforms that would violate the Executive orders interpretation of appropriate editorial conduct as well as directing the FTC and state attorney generals to look at unfair and deceptive practices. </p><p>I just wanted to invite Kate or Eric, either of you if you had any comments on those sections? </p><p>GOLDMAN: I'm going to pipe up here. Just to clarify, the Executive order doesn't actually ban the sp--federal government agencies from spending ad dollars on online services, it--it basically orders a report. Now, the likely consequence of that report will be some future restriction on online advertising but we haven't gotten there yet. So, that's another example of how the EO said a lot but didn't actually do a lot. </p><p>In terms of the FTC's role, the FTC has the power to bring enforcement actions based on their statutory authority and they already had brought actions that have, in a sense, worked around or gotten around Section 230's protection including the leading 2016 case that basically said if the FTC pleads that the prima facie elements of an FTC act violation, Section 230 doesn't apply. So the Executive order, I think, is designed to take credit for anything that the FTC might do in the future but it doesn't actually change what the FTC is going to do. They can't just like, with the FCC, order the FTC to do anything and most importantly, I think the existing legal structure already gives the FTC all the authority it--it needs if it wants to invest it that way. </p><p>CASTRO: Thanks. Kate, did you want to add anything on that? Okay. Then I wanted to turn to the Hawley bill. We've got a couple of questions on that coming in. One question is the Hawley bill seems to raise serious First Amendment problems and making the FCC and abettor of political bias. Do you have views on this? </p><p>KLONICK: Was that qu--I'm so sorry. Can you say that one more time the-- </p><p>CASTRO: Sure, the question that came in is, the Hawley bill seems to raise serious First Amendment problems in making the FCC an abettor of political bias. Do you have any views on that? </p><p>KLONICK: That I--I generally agree with it. I looked at it--I looked at it before--before we started and, yeah, I mean, Eric, I'm interested in Eri--because I have ano--again, haven't had a chance to talk about this with Eric, so Eric, I don't know, do you want to take this question? </p><p>GOLDMAN: I--I'm sorry. I do think that that question might be (INAUDIBLE) to the--to last summer's Hawley bill which did (INAUDIBLE) FTC to develop certification for political neutrality. The--the new Hawley bill, the one that released this morning, you know, before the sun was up here in California, actually doesn't involve the FTC whatsoever. So, I just want to be clear about that. </p><p>It does two main things: It tries to scale back the scope of Section 230(c)(2)(A), which says the provision that provides protection for filtering decisions and in addition, it creates what I think is a new cause of action to allow individuals to bring lawsuits alleging that they weren't treated in good faith. And so the scale back of the Safe Harbor, I think is--is interesting but the--the addition of a new cause of action to Section 230 basically flips the entire statute on the head. It basically says, we're done with thinking about how we can protect Internet companies from liability, let's go and start baking in new ways of adding to their liability. </p><p>We--I need to read it more carefully and work through all the different mechanisms but I do hope that everyone recognizes that the payload of the bill is really a new cause of action buried into a safe harbor, not just the scale back of the safe harbor itself. </p><p>CASTRO: There's another question here, is the jurisdictional or legal authority, and I think they're talking about the FCC's here, subject to judicial review? If so, what does that look like? </p><p>GOLDMAN: I'm going to take a pass on that question. That's more a (INAUDIBLE) expertise than I have. </p><p>KLONICK: Yeah, I'm--I'm the same. I just think that there's--I--I will say that what I was--when I was saying before speaking to kind of the bill, I think that there's going to be--I will say this in terms of the judicial review, which is that I think that when you have cases, that get bill--that get, as Eric said, about--that get brought, like tort cases that like are brought against these companies, that you will have a judicial review of a lot of these principles and I think that that's going to be--I don't know how that's going to play out with the FCC but I do think that there's going to be--and I'm--and I personally don't think that the--I think that when you look at--you look at something like this you're going to find that some very robust claims were First Amendment rights from the--come from the platforms in rebuttal to any type of claims that people bring against them. </p><p>CASTRO: Another question that came in, is there--I'm sorry, if there is a pattern of political bias by a platform, what redress does the aggrieved party have? </p><p>GOLDMAN: I think we would ask the same question if there was a pattern of political bias by any other type of content publisher, what redress would the reader or the victim of that bias have? The answer is, none. That's just straightforward unambiguous First Amendment protected activity. And so the only reason that question becomes even slightly cogent, but I don't think it is even clears that bar, is because we want to ignore the First Amendment rights of the Internet services or what (INAUDIBLE) platforms. </p><p>The only way we get to that question is by ignoring their rights and I'm not prepared to do that. In fact, I think that really is a gross misunderstanding of what the Internet companies do. </p><p>CASTRO: Another question that came in, the Executive order was seemingly a reaction to Twitter fact checking the president's tweets. How should a social media platform handle official political speech that violates their standards? </p><p>KLONICK: I will take this one. So there's a lot of--there's a number of--the answer to that is different for different platforms. And you know, I've written about this in Facebook v. Sullivan which is a paper that I wrote a couple of years ago that addressed how the public figure doctrine and newsworthiness doctrine were developed within companies and how they administered those types of--their rules in reaction to various types of people that broke those rules and how--how--how strongly as a pas--as a pu--pub--public figure. Interestingly, a lot of those rules ends up depending on kind of perpetuating ideas of influence and power that I think already exists in the real world. But the--the definitions of how they've defin--of how they've like fleshed out this doctrine is typically that if you are--it is like--it is similar to how courts have done it in the First Amendment doctrine which is like, if you are public figure in some capacity, and that grew out of the original finding in New York Times v. Sullivan of defining the importance of a--of a political figure. If you are a public figure that what you say can be an exception basically to any rule that the platform has because it makes it inherently new--what you're saying is inherently newsworthy. And at least recently that has been--been in place and we've seen that with a number of things. But the platform placed fast--platforms play fast and loose with this and there is a lot of changes that are happening right now because of false--because of false information that's being tweeted or posted about COVID. And so you'll see that like they took do--Facebook for example changed the policy to take down anyone, anyone, Trump, Bolsonaro, Boris Johnson, anyone, political figure or not, that's posted something that disagreed with The WHO or CDC guidelines about COVID-19. But then they have not extended that to misinformation about elections, for example. Or at least they haven't yet. </p><p>And so these--I just think that these are just constantly evolving standards at the platform and at platforms in general. </p><p>GOLDMAN: Can I add to that? I--I agree with everything Professor Klonick said, but I just--I--I have an idiosyncratic view here. I don't see how the Internet companies can ever win in fact checking politicians; for two reasons. One, the--the fact that politicians are lying constantly and that things that are--are coming as official government statements may be lies, puts the Internet companies in a really awkward box. They don't really want to tell the people about the regulatory power over them that they're wrong and yet they can't let those lies persist knowing that they're reaching potentially vast audiences and causing significant harm. </p><p>And so I think the only real outcome here that works is actually the Internet company should--should simply say, this is not the venue for anyone who's acting as an official government spokesperson. So, any politician, any government agency; they should be categorically excluded from social media. It's just not right--the right venue because the Internet companies can't properly fact check them, can't properly intervene and the marketplace mechanisms may not be strong enough to correct the misinformation coming from official government sources. </p><p>CASTRO: Can I ask you to expand on that because I know some people have--there's been a big debate on, you know, whether or not, you know, a politician should be deprovisioned and the counter argument is usually, well it doesn't matter if they don't say it directly on the platform if other people are posting what they said then the--they're effectively on the platforms. So could you elaborate a little bit on-- </p><p>GOLDMAN: Yeah, I think that's a fair point that they'll be proxies. For example, we saw some evidence of that in the Philippines where a number of private actors basically became mouthpieces for the Philippine government in a way that ultimately, I think, degraded the overall information ecosystem. </p><p>Having said that, the--the--the idea is that if the government speakers have to go through some set of intermediaries, that creates the possibility for those intermediaries to actually comment on what they're saying while they're saying it as opposed to simply relaying it verbatim without any modification. It's that straight direct conversation with constituents without any pushback that we've seen government actors treat as license to lie because they know that they can get away with it. </p><p>And so forcing that conversation into a set of proxies is certainly less than ideal. Maybe that will also need to be shut down but we do know that, right now at least, it's the government who's having a straight direct unfiltered access to the constituents, they're treating that as--as permission to misrepresent what they're doing. </p><p>KLONICK: Can I just add onto it what that--I--and I--I support actually Eric's idiosyncratic view. I also agree that fact checking is kind of a panacea of people do not fully--think is going--it's something that is so easy to put into place, so easy to administer. I think that people have no idea the type of slippery slope that that--that it creates in every capacity from what we define as kind of--as like how we define individuals, how we define the type of speech that is being talked about as you just said Daniel, like the idea that, you know, him just like--like a person saying something, they ampli--you know, like Trump amplifying--amp--naturally is just--is--because of who he is, is going to be amplified by the news and everything else and how do you start administering taking those types of things down? </p><p>I think that it's incredibly difficult. But I--I do think that there has to be what we're--what people are reacting to and why people want these fact checking kind of programs is because they are hungry for some type of--for some type of moderation system and for it to kind of--to have more information or to not just allow some of these things to be amplified without clarification or specification about what they are or who they're coming from. And so, I mean, I'll say it not to--you know, I--I think this is always kind of the answer is just I need--think that these platforms need to bit--build user participation more in--into their platforms more and to make them more--more reflective of what people want to see and to help. And also for users to be--educate themselves and become aware of how these processes happen. Almost like a basic civics type of understanding. </p><p>I think that this is--this is kind of--we have a new governance system that kind of rolls over us and a lot of people do not understand how it works yet and we need to get better at that. </p><p>CASTRO: Thank you. Well, we're just about at time. I just want to close with a quick question for you both. Maybe a hypothetical here. Let's say, you know, you're both law professors, you give an assignment to your law students to write an Executive order that changes the Section 230 in some way and this Executive order is what your student turned in. What grade would you give them? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>GOLDMAN: I'll be grading it at the ballot box on November 3. </p><p>CASTRO: Kate? </p><p>KLONICK: Oh wow, this is--this is terrible. Well, since my school now does everything credit/no credit-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I--I--I guess--I guess it would get--I guess it is--I guess it is a take, it is a take and so I guess I'd have to give it credit; let's put it that way. </p><p>CASTRO: An A for effort, okay. </p><p>KLONICK: I know-- </p><p>CASTRO: A pass for effort. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KLONICK: That is not what I said, but yeah. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CASTRO: Great, well thank you both. I know this is a conversation that there's much more nuance that we could get into. I want to thank you both for taking the time today to share some reactions on these issues and--and for all your work on this very important topic. I--I love reading your papers.

It concludes that while some of the concerns being raised have merit, the net effect of rising support for policies designed to rein in technology with bans, taxes, or stringent regulations would be to reduce individual and societal welfare.</p><p>\"Techlash has created a mob mentality, and the mob is coming for innovation,\" said ITIF President Robert D. Atkinson, the report's lead co-author. \"Giving into techlash passions would slow down economic and wage growth, reduce national competitiveness, and limit progress on a host of critical societal priorities. Rather than techlash, we need a pragmatic 'tech realism,' recognizing that today's technologies, like virtually all past technologies, are a fundamental force for human progress. To be sure, they can pose real challenges in some instances, and those deserve smart and effective responses.\"</p><p>Among the 22 discrete techlash-related issues that Atkinson and a team of ITIF analysts delved into, there were 16 societal issues--from fears that social media is harmful for children to claims that technology is leading to pervasive surveillance--plus six economic issues, including claims that technology is driving income inequality and that it is giving rise to monopolies. The report acknowledges that some of these issues are complex and deserve detailed and thorough policy responses.</p><p>\"The question is not whether technology has costs, but whether the costs can be managed sensibly and are outweighed by the benefits. The answer on both counts is, unquestionably, yes,\" said Atkinson. \"We should not go back to the naive, utopian era of worshipping IT as our savior. But swinging to the other extreme of techlash isn't warranted either. We should instead critically examine the impact of new technology so we can deterimine how to maximize its value and limit harms.\"</p><p>Read the report: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.itif.org/techlash\">www.itif.org/techlash</url>.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is an independent, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

Atkinson, author of the book Big Is Beautiful: Debunking the Myth of Small Business:</p><p>An objective analysis of big tech companies' past aquistions is likely to find that the lion's share have benefited consumers by offering more valuable products and services at lower cost through greater economies of scale. That criteria--the consumer welfare standard--should continue to be the North Star that guides antitrust regulation.</p><p>It would be one thing if the FTC truly were undertaking this examination to \"deepen its understanding\" of the competitive implications of tech acquisitions in order to better inform future merger reviews, but it is deeply concerning that the Commission has indicated this may be a fishing expedition that leads it to retroactively split up companies that have already merged. This risks chilling innovation in the entire technology sector by casting generalized suspicion on common entrepreneurial pathways and business practices that are critical for spurring it.</p><p>In the past, entrepreneurs have been able to conduct research, develop new products, and aspire to grow start-up companies to the stage where they could become attractive acquisitions for bigger companies that are in a position to offer more resources and scale. That formula has allowed countless innovators to bring world-changing ideas to full frution. Consider the little company Keyhole, which developed EarthViewer software that let you see virtually any part of the planet. Its founder imagined making the software into a street-level service, but thought it would take so long that the business model may as well be science fiction--and then Google aquired it and was able to deliver StreetView mapping software in less than five years. Stories like this are indicative of a benefitial feature of the tech economy, not a bug.</p><p>Populist ferver against \"Big Tech\" has been building for a long time. Today's action by the FTC may be an indication that we've reached peak panic. Regulators need to recognize that buying companies is not inherently anticompetitive. To the contrary, mergers and acquisitions often create tremendous value for consumers, particuarly in the technology sector. If the FTC determines in its examination that too many mergers have escaped appropriate regulatory scrutiny because reporting thresholds are too high under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, then the proper remedy is for Congress to revisit the law, not for the FTC to revisit mergers that have already taken place.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is an independent, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy. Recognized as the world's leading science and technology think tank, ITIF's mission is to formulate and promote policy solutions that accelerate innovation and boost productivity to spur growth, opportunity, and progress.</p><p>[Category: Computer Technology]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7016199 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7016199</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y68-03D1-DYG2-R0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><timeReceived>7:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

El<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> open banking </emphasis>permite compartir y proporcionar datos y procesos de entidades financieras a un nuevo ecosistema de terceros proveedores, explica un estudio de Funcas y Finnovating (plataforma de innovaci\u00f3n abierta de<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> fintech</emphasis>).  La banca abierta as\u00ed \u201cimpone considerables retos regulatorios y financieros. Entre otras cuestiones, gana relevancia el control y el uso de datos personales de los clientes\u201d, subraya el estudio. De esta forma, los datos de los clientes se convierten en un tesoro no solo para el sector financiero, que siempre los ha gestionado, sino para otros sectores que nada han tenido que ver hasta ahora con la banca, pero que desde que se inici\u00f3 el<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> open banking </emphasis>pueden tambi\u00e9n controlar los datos de los clientes, siempre que estos autoricen a su banco a ced\u00e9rselos. </p><p>El estudio asegura que lo que la banca pensaba inicialmente que iba a suponer una intromisi\u00f3n de nuevos actores no financieros en su negocio, que aumentar\u00eda la competencia, puede convertirse en una ventaja. \u201cLa banca abierta fomenta la creaci\u00f3n de nuevos productos, proporciona a las entidades la oportunidad de poder subcontratar a terceros diferentes sistemas de desarrollo y distribuci\u00f3n de estos productos y previene el fraude de manera m\u00e1s eficiente, adem\u00e1s de que se mejora la transparencia\u201d, recalca Funcas en su informe. Adem\u00e1s, los productos y los servicios podr\u00e1n personalizarse m\u00e1s, se reducir\u00e1n los costes gracias al uso de la tecnolog\u00eda y la eliminaci\u00f3n de intermediarios, se aumentar\u00e1 la supervisi\u00f3n y creaci\u00f3n de est\u00e1ndares de seguridad y permitir\u00e1 al cliente tener la opci\u00f3n de ceder o no sus datos a terceros. Es en este \u00faltimo punto en el que m\u00e1s incide Carb\u00f3. \u201cLa banca debe aprovechar la ventaja del uso respetuoso que siempre ha hecho de los datos de sus clientes\u201d, afirma, para a\u00f1adir: \u201cLas grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas quieren ahora estos datos. Conocen su valor y est\u00e1n al acecho, pero nadie garantiza que sean tan respetuosos con ellos como lo es el sector financiero. Creo que las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech </emphasis>quieren los datos del consumidor, pero no creo que pretendan hacer banca en solitario. Si la hacen ser\u00e1 con bancos como aliados\u201d. La seguridad es, precisamente, uno de los principales retos del nuevo entorno. \u201cA qui\u00e9n compete la custodia de la informaci\u00f3n y qui\u00e9n debe garantizar la protecci\u00f3n de la misma\u201d, se pregunta Funcas. \u201cLa apertura de los datos y procesos de los bancos mediante interfaces a un ecosistema de terceros puede llegar a comprometer la seguridad de usuarios y entidades\u201d, a\u00f1ade el informe.

Brand recall for companies like ours is improving every year, we are slowly getting there,\" he said.</p><p>US talent pool much smaller</p><p>\"There is no big cost difference because we have to pay American salaries even to our Indian employees going there,\" he added.</p><p>However, unlike India, which produces nearly 600,000 engineering graduates every year, the US pool is much smaller, ensuring a much more intense fight for whatever talent is available.</p><p>\"Though IT is a popular choice, compared to Indian colleges, the pool of students looking out for a career in IT is smaller and all tech firms are tapping into this pool; so definitely, the war for talent is there,\" said Priti Rajora, global head, talent acquisition, Wipro Technologies.</p><p>On their part, India's top outsourcing companies TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL have already started setting up development centres in locations such as Atlanta and Michigan. While TCS aims to double its foreign workforce from 10,000 currently to 20,000 over the next five years, Infosys and Wipro could see non-Indians account for 10-15% of their total employee base in next 3-5 years, from around 5% currently.</p><p>Wipro, for instance, wants US locals to account for more than half of its workforce in the country, and hiring from local campuses is a strategic shift to achieve that goal.</p><p>These companies have kicked off several initiatives to build a brand on campuses and attract the best talent. Wipro, for instance, has hired a senior campus relationship manager responsible for keeping the company visible in campuses throughout the year. The company says it has managed to create a buzz in these campuses by showcasing alumni, being a part of campus fairs and being present on multiple other forums.</p><p>\"It is true that Wipro is not as big a brand name in the US as it is in India but we have been able to generate significant interest. IT is a buzzword there too and India and China are being seen as the places to be. We have been doing a lot of work in campuses to showcase ourselves,\" Rajora of Wipro said.</p><p>IT firms pay at least 20-25% more to tech graduates in the US compared to Indian colleges. But they do not see this leading to a big increase in employee costs as they are able to charge higher for onsite employees. At the same time, Indian employees sent on H1B visas also prove to be as expensive as they draw salaries on a par with local US talent.</p><p>\"The view of Indian companies in these campuses has changed a lot over the past few years. In the US, campus connect programmes are much deeper and more developed than in Indian colleges and it would be difficult to enter a good college if you were not known. Indian IT companies are now finding a place in these colleges; they are now slowly being seen as alternatives to the big tech firms there like IBM and Accenture,\" said Thiruvengadam P, leader, human capital advisory services, Deloitte.</p><p>Cognizant has a team of 60 full-time recruiters in the US who are solely responsible for hiring candidates locally, both from campuses and the lateral market. The company views this is a sign of a maturing industry.</p><p>\"Just like the manufacturing supply chain went atomically global, we are seeing the early signs of the services value chain go atomically global. While we have done undergraduate recruiting from campuses for specific needs of practices earlier, this is the first time we are aggressively focusing on key universities for our pan organisation needs and we are trying to build deep, long-term relationships,\" Shankar Srinivasan, chief people officer, Cognizant said.</p><p>Local experts such as Morley J Nair, who is based in Philadelphia and advises on immigration, say the rate of visa denials by US consulates is among the reasons for increased campus hiring.</p><p>\"Actually, the trend of hiring graduates from US campuses seems to have picked up momentum last year itself, with increased enforcement of H-1B-related regulations by US consulates abroad, and even by the immigration inspectors at US entry points. If you recall, the deportation of Indian H-1B workers from Newark, New Jersey airport, in January 2010 was big news, which sent shockwaves through the H-1B community, both employers and employees,\" says Nair.</p><p>\"So the logical conclusion is that if employers are able to hire candidates from US campuses, the 'hazards' of US consulate interviews and overbearing questioning at US entry points can be avoided, at least in the short term, i.e., until they have to travel overseas again and obtain visas to re-enter the US,\" adds Nair.</p><p>Most of these companies are going to the tier-I tech colleges in universities like Carnegie Mellon, Emory, Stanford, Massachusetts, Connecticut and North Maryland, among others.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-7518791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:526N-9TC1-DXJR-H001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1033\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

But in the U.S., regarding public-private partnerships so far, the sense is that we like to make mistakes and not learn from them, he told attendees of Infraday West, a one-day symposium held Dec. 5 in Los Angeles.</p><p>Panelists discussing the state of the western U.S. infrastructure market agreed that the federal government is a less reliable partner these days. The administration promised a $1-trillion bill, but we havent seen fruition, said Todd McIntyre, chief of staff for the District of Columbias Dept. of Transportation. DDOT has $1 billion in capital improvement projects coming, but there is skittishness from the private side, he added, holding out hopes for a bipartisan bill after the midterm elections.</p><p>Lawrence Pierce, San Diego representative for the American Society of Civil Engineers, said there is a $2-trillion investment need for infrastructure over the next decade. We have to have all the players playing, he said.</p><p>Cherian George, head of infrastructure for the Americas with Fitch Ratings, said infrastructure goals are better met by a long-term approach. If we had all the money now, it would drive prices up, he said. We need time to ramp up.</p><p>He added that Fitchs 2019 credit outlook for transportation was positive, mostly tracking national GDP. But beyond that, there are concerns, fear of dark clouds. We may be close to the end of a good period.</p><p>Colin Peppard, senior director with the Office of Extraordinary Innovation at Los Angeles Metro, noted some positives regarding the feds. For example, the Federal Transit Administration has an expedited pilot program for New Starts transit projects, where increased private investment and lower federal contributions could lead to fewer restrictions and regulations. He also noted that his agency received a $1.2-million grant to pursue a performance-based mobility-as-a-service contract.</p><p>Making the Case</p><p>Dan Richards, chair of the California High Speed Rail Authority, made a business case to investors in the room regarding the controversial $77-billion plan to build a high-speed network traversing California.</p><p>He noted that other existing high-speed rail systems generate positive cash flows. He said that the Central Valley, where $3 billion in high-speed rail work is underway, would be the 24th-largest state and the poorest. That, coupled with frothy Silicon Valley housing prices, could be addressed if the young workforce could live in the Central Valley and commute via high-speed rail. Connections to a planned Google campus would be only 42 minutes from Madera and 50 minutes from Fresno, he said.</p><p>Another example of how big tech can contribute to infrastructure is the Dumbarton Transportation Corridor. Winsome Bowen, head of regional transportation strategy with Facebook, says the company negotiated with the public agency that owns the moribund East Bay crossing. The tech firm wants to conduct its own feasibility study regarding the possibility of redeveloping the route.</p><p>You give us the right of way, and we will design-build, operate and maintain it for 35 to 50 years, added Sia Kusha, project development and partnering group leader with the Plenary Group.</p><p>Bowen said that the company selected feasibility consultants within four monthsas opposed to the 18 to 24 months the public agency would requirewhile being transparent and inclusive of the public. Facebook is not averse to taking risks, she said.

We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain.  At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear.  Here was the challenge:  To make an insolvent nation solvent again.  To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in.  To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror.  To mend a broken society.  Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this:  Britain is on the right track.  As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths.  All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have thought we can pay our way. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That we can earn our living as a major industrial country...</p><p>...and we will always remain one.  It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer. </p><p>Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.</p><p>Because the truth is this. </p><p>We are in a global race today.</p><p>And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. </p><p>Sink or swim. Do or decline.   To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour...</p><p>...and we will rise to the challenge. </p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that.</p><p>How we compete and thrive in this world...</p><p>...how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.</p><p>Nothing matters more. </p><p>Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end...</p><p>...Britain on the rise.</p><p>BRITAIN CAN DELIVER</p><p>Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. </p><p>Why?</p><p>Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>We saw it this summer. </p><p>The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics...</p><p>...the best country in the world...</p><p>...and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.</p><p>I was trying to think of my favourite moment. </p><p>Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?</p><p>No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years... </p><p>...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.</p><p>My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.  </p><p>And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did. </p><p>When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.</p><p>Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer.</p><p>And the Olympics showed us something else. </p><p>Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland...</p><p>....they draped themselves in one flag. </p><p>Now, there's one person who didn't like that...</p><p>...and he's called Alex Salmond. </p><p>I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. </p><p>There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom...</p><p>...let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got. </p><p>There are so many people to thank for this summer.</p><p>Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games...</p><p>...and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces...</p><p>...the zinger on the zip-wire...</p><p>...the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson. </p><p>And those Games-Makers.</p><p>You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society...</p><p>...they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>. </p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.</p><p>Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.</p><p>433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:</p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. </p><p>By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. </p><p>Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done...</p><p>...and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER</p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.</p><p>We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.</p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. </p><p>I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. </p><p>He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive...</p><p>...please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting.</p><p>There was a reason we could do that. </p><p>It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. </p><p>No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives.</p><p>To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down...</p><p>...I say...</p><p>...well, yes, you've got a point.</p><p>I'll tell you what is down.</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.</p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. </p><p>I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. </p><p>But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. </p><p>See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine...</p><p>...the difference between living and dying... </p><p>...how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.</p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.  </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. </p><p>Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. </p><p>It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests...</p><p>...and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.</p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before...</p><p>...I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.</p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.</p><p>Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer...</p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already.</p><p>Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.</p><p>Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.</p><p>BRITAIN ON THE RISE</p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.</p><p>We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.</p><p>But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.</p><p>All around the world, countries are on the rise.</p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years...</p><p>...but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.</p><p>What do the countries on the rise have in common?</p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.</p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common?</p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.</p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece...</p><p>...while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.  </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.</p><p>My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.</p><p>And we here know how that is done.</p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration...</p><p>... the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.</p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress.</p><p>Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.</p><p>In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living...</p><p>...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers...</p><p>...not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses...</p><p>...but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.</p><p>It's not just about growth and GDP...</p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer...</p><p>...by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way.</p><p>We don't preach about one nation but practise class war...</p><p>...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.</p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.</p><p>They call us the party of the better-off...</p><p>...no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.</p><p>THE RIGHT IDEAS</p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.</p><p>Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. </p><p>But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. </p><p>My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.</p><p>Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.</p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.</p><p>Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it Tory cuts, slashing the state'.</p><p>No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.</p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.</p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.</p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich...</p><p>...it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.</p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. </p><p>These three things are essential to helping our people rise.</p><p>They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. </p><p>So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future...</p><p>...they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.</p><p>We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.</p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that.</p><p>Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.</p><p>And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>Getting the deficit down is essential for both.</p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.</p><p>It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.</p><p>And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.</p><p>When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. </p><p>That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p><p>Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. </p><p>25 per cent.  </p><p>That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels...</p><p>...keeping mortgages low.  Leaving more money in your pockets.  Giving businesses more confidence to invest.</p><p>Creating more jobs.</p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.</p><p>Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.</p><p>That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>LABOUR </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.</p><p>They call it Plan B and it goes like this: </p><p>We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. </p><p>Let me tell you why it's not.</p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.</p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.</p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.</p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.</p><p>Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.</p><p>And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.</p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.</p><p>How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?</p><p>I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Now they're out of office it's:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.</p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.</p><p>I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.</p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?</p><p>He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.</p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.</p><p>When people earn money, it's their money.   </p><p>Not the government's money: their money.</p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.</p><p>So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.  OK?</p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? </p><p>Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here...</p><p>...it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.</p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.</p><p>Under Labour.</p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. </p><p>We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold...</p><p>...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...</p><p>... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy...</p><p>...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future...</p><p>...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>ASPIRATION ECONOMY</p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy...</p><p>...more enterprising, more aspirational...</p><p>...and it's taking shape already.</p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. </p><p>We're making things again.</p><p>We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.</p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. </p><p>We're number one in the world for offshore wind.</p><p>Number one in the world for tidal power.</p><p>The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise.  We're showing we can do it.</p><p>Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. </p><p>And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got...</p><p>...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.</p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.</p><p>And look what's happening.</p><p>In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent...</p><p>...to China - 40 per cent...</p><p>...to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. </p><p>I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. </p><p>It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. </p><p>They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm...</p><p>...helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.</p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. </p><p>Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. </p><p>So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China...</p><p>...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ...</p><p>...I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts...</p><p>...and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. </p><p>Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. </p><p>The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand...</p><p>...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>For a business to expand, it needs places to build.</p><p>If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.</p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. </p><p>But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. </p><p>And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"...</p><p>...but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.</p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.</p><p>But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? </p><p>33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.</p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house...</p><p>...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage...</p><p>...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.</p><p>They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.</p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>WELFARE</p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.</p><p>Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one.  We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.</p><p>Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two.  More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.</p><p>Let me put it simply.  Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.</p><p>He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.  And Disease.</p><p>Here are mine.</p><p>First, unfairness.  </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?</p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice.</p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.</p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.</p><p>We must be crazy.</p><p>So this is what we've done.</p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.</p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.</p><p>And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?</p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.</p><p>What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>For people like him we're doing something new. </p><p>The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole...</p><p>...and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.</p><p>We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.</p><p>So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless...</p><p>...and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone. </p><p>And just one more thing on welfare.</p><p>You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?</p><p>Here's what one union official said about it. </p><p>I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. </p><p>We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. </p><p>What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery...</p><p>...and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>EDUCATION </p><p>To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do. </p><p>Educate all our children.</p><p>And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. </p><p>In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind...</p><p>...not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too. </p><p>This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. </p><p>You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for </p><p>their kids? </p><p>Well - this is a pushy government. </p><p>My approach is very simple. </p><p>I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. </p><p>To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.</p><p>I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area...</p><p>...I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood.</p><p>And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.</p><p>We've heard from some of them this week...</p><p>...not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come...</p><p>...but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.</p><p>Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools...</p><p>...independent schools, in the state sector.</p><p>That's the genuine revolution that's now underway.</p><p>The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now. </p><p>The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative.</p><p>Smart uniforms, teachers in suits.</p><p>Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options.</p><p>Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.</p><p>When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question:</p><p>Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances?</p><p>It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed. </p><p>It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way.</p><p>When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no. </p><p>When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.</p><p>When we proposed: More pay for good teachers... Getting rid of bad teachers...</p><p>...Longer school days to help children learn... Flexible school hours to help parents work...</p><p>...More stretching exams for those who're really able... Less nonsense about health and safety...</p><p>...the left-wing establishment have said just one thing: No.</p><p>When you ask them: why is a school failing? Why aren't the children succeeding? </p><p>You hear the same thing over and over again.</p><p>What can you expect with children like these?' they say.  These children are disadvantaged.'</p><p>Of course we want to tackle every disadvantage. </p><p>But isn't the greatest disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it's like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background, to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?</p><p>It's that toxic culture of low expectations - that lack of ambition for every child - which has held this country back.</p><p>Well, Michael Gove and I are not waiting for an outbreak of sanity in the headquarters of the NUT or an embrace of aspiration in the higher reaches of Labour before we act.</p><p>Because our children can't wait.</p><p>So when people say we should slow down our education reforms - so adults can adjust to them, I say:</p><p>I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.</p><p>And to all those people who say: he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school... </p><p>...I say: yes - you're absolutely right. </p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education.</p><p>I'm not here to defend privilege, I'm here to spread it.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>I don't have a hard luck story.</p><p>My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire.</p><p>It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them.  </p><p>My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.</p><p>He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be.  But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child.  Probably a lonely child.   </p><p>But Dad was the eternal optimist.  To him the glass was always half full.  Usually with something alcoholic in it.</p><p>When I was a boy I remember once going on a long walk with him in the village where we lived, passing the church he supported and the village hall where he took part in interminable parish council meetings.  </p><p>He told me what he was most proud of.  </p><p>It was simple - working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family.  </p><p>Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off.</p><p>Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story.  </p><p>Work hard.  Family comes first.  But put back in to the community too.</p><p>There is nothing complicated about me.</p><p>I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country.</p><p>And there is nothing complicated about what we need today.</p><p>This is still the greatest country on earth.  We showed that again this summer.  22nd in world population.  3rd in the medals table.  </p><p>But it's tough.  These are difficult times.  We're being tested.  </p><p>How will we come through it?  Again, it's not complicated.</p><p>Hard work.  Strong families.  Taking responsibility.  Serving others.</p><p>As I said on the steps of No10 Downing Street before walking through that door:  Those who can should, those who can't we will always help.</p><p>The job of this party ... of this government ... is to help to bring out the best in this country.  Because at our best we're unbeatable.</p><p>We know Britain can deliver because we've seen it time and again. </p><p>This is the country that ... invented the computer, defeated the Nazis, started the web, saw off the slave trade, unravelled DNA and fought off every invader for a thousand years.</p><p>We even persuaded the Queen to jump out of a helicopter to make the rest of the world smile .... there is absolutely nothing we cannot do.</p><p>Can we make Britain the best place in the world to start a business, grow a business and help that business take on the world and win?  Yes.</p><p>Can we - the people who invented the welfare state in the first place - turn it into something that rewards effort, helps keep families together and really helps the poorest with a new start in life.  Yes.  </p><p>Can we take our schools and turn out students that will take on the brightest in the world?  Yes. Of course we can.</p><p>Let us here in this hall, here in this government, together in this country make this pledge - let's build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...let's get Britain on the rise.</p><p>Deficit, paid down.

'Habr alianzas con entidades financieras o entrarn por su cuenta, pero est por ver cundo', ha explicado Gonzlez-Bueno, que ha destacado que el 'peligro' es que 'no tendrn problemas de capital'. Por otro lado, el consejero delegado de ING[2] en Espa\u00f1a y Portugal ha valorado las 'fintechs' como 'una va de exploraci\u00f3n', por lo que se trata 'ms de colaboraci\u00f3n que de amenaza' para el sector. No obstante, ha hecho hincapi en las 'barreras de entrada' de los nuevos bancos digitales, tanto por el mercado regulatorio por los bancos centrales como por el oligopolio del sector. </p><p>'El crecimiento requiere mucha financiaci\u00f3n y capital en paralelo, por eso es complicado', ha a\u00f1adido. 'El sector financiero es distinto, ms moderno, ms competitivo y ms transparente que como hubiese sido si no hubiramos ayudado', ha valorado Gonzlez-Bueno en el veinte aniversario del banco en el mercado espa\u00f1ol. Preguntado por el cierre de los cajeros de Banco Popular[3], que los clientes de ING usaban para sacar efectivo. el consejero delegado ha zanjado: 'El efectivo tiene ms pasado que futuro y nosotros somos una entidad de futuro'. Asimismo, el directivo ha afirmado que la cada en las retiradas de efectivo es 'buena para el blanqueo, la eficiencia y para todo'. 'Por eso estamos apostando en esa direcci\u00f3n', ha concluido Gonzlez-Bueno. 'En el futuro, seguiremos manteniendo nuestra estrategia \u00fanica de situar al cliente en el centro y de evolucionar nuestros productos y canales seg\u00fan sus necesidades', ha destacado, que ha asegurado que la entidad seguir 'fiel a su ADN y la mxima de cumplir lo que prometemos'. 'Los xitos se han logrado junto con el desarrollo de un modelo bancario sostenible con una ROE del 13,1% al cierre de 2018, seis puntos porcentuales por encima de la media del sector', ha destacado el socio de PriceWaterhouseCoopers Jordi Estvez en la presentaci\u00f3n del estudio 'ING, dos dcadas de contribuci\u00f3n a la sociedad espa\u00f1ola'. Estvez ha valorado el 'modelo de comisiones 0', desde el inicio del banco en Espa\u00f1a, de forma que un cliente medio que haya estado en la entidad desde 1999 'ha podido ahorrar un total de 3.000 euros en comisiones, respecto a otras entidades'. Seg\u00fan el anlisis de PwC[4], ING ha abonado a sus clientes un total de 4.383 millones de euros en remuneraci\u00f3n de sus cuentas, dep\u00f3sitos y promociones desde 1999. En este periodo, ING[5] ha financiado la compra de 185.000 viviendas y 900.00 proyectos personales en Espa\u00f1a a travs de sus 'hipotecas naranjas' y 'prstamos naranja', respectivamente. En cuanto al empleo, el banco cuenta en Espa\u00f1a con 1.400 empleados, de unas 30 nacionalidades. Casi la mitad de la plantilla son mujeres, con un 42% de puestos directivos ocupados por mujeres, lo que 'no es casualidad'. Asimismo, por cada mill\u00f3n de euros de financiaci\u00f3n concedida se generaron 13 empleos.

The sheer size and influence those platforms have over consumers, that has to be regulated one way or the other,\" the CEO said. \"We are happy with any competition, but that should be on a level playing field,\" he said.</p><p>This becomes even more relevant in a time where the popularity of digital services is booming. Trends in ING customer behavior show an increasing preference for interaction via digital channels, especially mobile devices, according to Hamers. Out of 3 billion annual interactions with customers at ING, more than 99% are through mobile, and 20% of the 38 million ING customers worldwide have never interacted with the bank in any other way than through a smartphone or a tablet, he said.</p><p>\"All of these people are expecting from a bank a service level they are used to receive at the big techs,\" Hamers said, characterizing this type of service as \"personal, instant, relevant and seamless.\" However, the challenge gets harder for banks who have to handle the extra rules coming from PSD 2 and open banking, he said.</p><p>In a repeat of his criticism of the payment rules from January, when he warned against the growing threat of big tech in the payment services space, Hamers said corporations such as Amazon and Facebook Inc. are already catering to bank customers in other areas and can easily expand their services to include banking.</p><p>For now, politicians have not responded to the bank's appeals. There is \"an increasing awareness\" about the issue but there is \"nothing in the works\" to counterbalance the existing regulations at this point, Hamers said Nov. 1. ING and the rest of the sector will have to accept and adjust to the existing rules.</p><p>The PSD 2 and open banking rules that came into effect in January were dubbed a \"game changer\" in the retail and commercial banking space by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Compared to financial technology firms or big tech groups, banks have old-fashioned data and payment processing systems and \"slow change management processes, highly manual customer support and fragmented reference data which can make it difficult to respond to evolving customer needs with speed and effectiveness,\" PwC said in a PSD 2 overview.</p><p>\"[T]he banking landscape will change fundamentally in the future. The market will become increasingly diverse and modularized, with new companies specializing to offer very specific components of banking services or products,\" PwC said in a report on open banking.

The sheer size and influence those platforms have over consumers, that has to be regulated one way or the other,\" the CEO said. \"We are happy with any competition, but that should be on a level playing field,\" he said.</p><p>This becomes even more relevant in a time where the popularity of digital services is booming. Trends in ING customer behavior show an increasing preference for interaction via digital channels, especially mobile devices, according to Hamers. Out of 3 billion annual interactions with customers at ING, more than 99% are through mobile, and 20% of the 38 million ING customers worldwide have never interacted with the bank in any other way than through a smartphone or a tablet, he said.</p><p>\"All of these people are expecting from a bank a service level they are used to receive at the big techs,\" Hamers said, characterizing this type of service as \"personal, instant, relevant and seamless.\" However, the challenge gets harder for banks who have to handle the extra rules coming from PSD 2 and open banking, he said.</p><p>In a repeat of his criticism of the payment rules from January, when he warned against the growing threat of big tech in the payment services space, Hamers said corporations such as Amazon and Facebook Inc. are already catering to bank customers in other areas and can easily expand their services to include banking.</p><p>For now, politicians have not responded to the bank's appeals. There is \"an increasing awareness\" about the issue but there is \"nothing in the works\" to counterbalance the existing regulations at this point, Hamers said Nov. 1. ING and the rest of the sector will have to accept and adjust to the existing rules.</p><p>The PSD 2 and open banking rules that came into effect in January were dubbed a \"game changer\" in the retail and commercial banking space by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Compared to financial technology firms or big tech groups, banks have old-fashioned data and payment processing systems and \"slow change management processes, highly manual customer support and fragmented reference data which can make it difficult to respond to evolving customer needs with speed and effectiveness,\" PwC said in a PSD 2 overview.</p><p>\"[T]he banking landscape will change fundamentally in the future. The market will become increasingly diverse and modularized, with new companies specializing to offer very specific components of banking services or products,\" PwC said in a report on open banking. The firm estimated that about 39% of banking clients in the U.K. would share their financial data with rival lenders and third-party platforms such as Amazon or Apple Inc. if this enables them to see all their activity in one application or to compare tailored product offers from third parties.</p><p>ING has been focused on its fundamental transformation as a digital bank for the past three years and continues to invest heavily in IT and digital initiatives.

The sheer size and influence those platforms have over consumers, that has to be regulated one way or the other,\" the CEO said. \"We are happy with any competition, but that should be on a level playing field,\" he said.</p><p>This becomes even more relevant in a time where the popularity of digital services is booming. Trends in ING customer behavior show an increasing preference for interaction via digital channels, especially mobile devices, according to Hamers. Out of 3 billion annual interactions with customers at ING, more than 99% are through mobile, and 20% of the 38 million ING customers worldwide have never interacted with the bank in any other way than through a smartphone or a tablet, he said.</p><p>\"All of these people are expecting from a bank a service level they are used to receive at the big techs,\" Hamers said, characterizing this type of service as \"personal, instant, relevant and seamless.\" However, the challenge gets harder for banks who have to handle the extra rules coming from PSD 2 and open banking, he said.</p><p>In a repeat of his criticism of the payment rules from January, when he warned against the growing threat of big tech in the payment services space, Hamers said corporations such as Amazon and Facebook Inc. are already catering to bank customers in other areas and can easily expand their services to include banking.</p><p>For now, politicians have not responded to the bank's appeals. There is \"an increasing awareness\" about the issue but there is \"nothing in the works\" to counterbalance the existing regulations at this point, Hamers said Nov. 1. ING and the rest of the sector will have to accept and adjust to the existing rules.</p><p>The PSD 2 and open banking rules that came into effect in January were dubbed a \"game changer\" in the retail and commercial banking space by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Compared to financial technology firms or big tech groups, banks have old-fashioned data and payment processing systems and \"slow change management processes, highly manual customer support and fragmented reference data which can make it difficult to respond to evolving customer needs with speed and effectiveness,\" PwC said in a PSD 2 overview.</p><p>\"[T]he banking landscape will change fundamentally in the future. The market will become increasingly diverse and modularized, with new companies specializing to offer very specific components of banking services or products,\" PwC said in a report on open banking. The firm estimated that about 39% of banking clients in the U.K. would share their financial data with rival lenders and third-party platforms such as Amazon or Apple Inc. if this enables them to see all their activity in one application or to compare tailored product offers from third parties.</p><p>ING has been focused on its fundamental transformation as a digital bank for the past three years and continues to invest heavily in IT and digital initiatives. The bank was happy to provide instant payments in the Netherlands and will continue to drive digitization forward, Hamers told analysts. Over the third quarter, ING invested in TransferMate, an Irish provider of cross-border payments, and plans to integrate TransferMate payments into the group's own services for small-business clients and other corporate customers, the bank said.</p><p>ING also built a common contact center platform for retail customers across its key markets in that space \"to give them a simple and smooth experience across multiple channels of their choice.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLBTD-47422563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLBTD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNP-P7D1-JDVW-N013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360226</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"683\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Bank and Thrift Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0001SF9</classCode><className>ING GROEP NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00028V0</classCode><className>PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS525910 OPEN-END INVESTMENT FUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS524113 DIRECT LIFE INSURANCE CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6311 LIFE INSURANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6081 BRANCHES &amp;

Please welcome your moderator and Head of ING Investor Relations, Mark Milders.</p><p>MARK MILDERS, HEAD OF IR, ING GROEP N.V.: Good morning. Welcome to Investor Day 2019. First of all, let me say how pleased I am to see many familiar faces here in the audience tonight -- or this morning, I'm sorry, and looking for some more to arrive. We had some flight problems at Frankfurt Airport, but I've been informed they're on their way. Also, a very good morning and warm welcome to our audience joining us digitally via webcast. Welcome here in Offenbach.</p><p>Now someone told me just before we started that when they got into the taxi and told him -- asked where to go, he asked, \"Are you sure?\" And if you look at this location, it's something that many, many people have been working on to transform, a work you will be hearing more today, this old factory into what you see here today. And normally, at the end for me, to thank all of the people that have been working hard the last couple of weeks and our events team and the technicians who made it all possible that we could see each other here today.</p><p>Now it's going to be a full day, and allow me to briefly take you through our agenda for today. Our CEO, Ralph Hamers, will take you through an update of our Think Forward strategy; followed by Tanate Phutrakul, our new CFO, telling you -- or taking you through the numbers and what lies ahead; and also, Roel Louwhoff will join and will tell you and will show you what it means to be digital. We know that many banks and many other institutions speak about being digital. Everybody's got a platform. Everybody is sustainable. Everybody's got an app. But what it truly means is something different, which we are looking to show you today. Then we'll break for lunch. And after lunch, Steven van Rijswijk and Isabel Fernandez, our CRO and our Head of Wholesale Banking, will take you through risk management and the nice things and good things we're doing to unlock value in our Wholesale Bank. We'll have a short break, and then we will have our part on our Retail, our digital sites and our countries presented by Ignacio Vilar and Roland Boekhout and Aris Bogdaneris, who will take you through the various elements of what it means to interact with a customer that you never see, that interacts with us via mobile and all the things that we're doing in the specific countries of ING. Every block I just mentioned will be followed for a -- by a Q&amp;A.</p><p>Now there's one thing that we changed in -- given recent news events, and that's to take you along and to show you what is our #1 priority, it's keeping our bank safe and the measures that we are taking, and KYC and AML. And for -- to that effect, that's where we want to start, Steven and Roel. But first, Ralph Hamers will take you through that, and we'll have a Q&amp;A specifically on this topic because me and the team have received many calls from you on this topic and we thought it would be sensible; also, given that it's our priority to really take that block in a condensed form and start today with that and then take you through, as I said, our update on our Think Forward strategy and the deep dives.</p><p>So thank you very much, and may I please invite Ralph Hamers to join me.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS, CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, CEO &amp; MEMBER MANAGEMENT BOARD BANKING, ING GROEP N.V.: Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. As said, we will spend a large part of the day taking you through the Think Forward strategy, the update. What have we delivered? Where are we? And what do we see going forward?</p><p>But we wanted to take one subject early on today and take you through what we're doing around KYC and AML. Given the most recent media attention that has come to this subject, and specifically, also to ING, I think it is -- it warrants a separate session. And me and Steven will take you through, and then Roel will join us on stage for Q&amp;A there as well.</p><p>From the moment the prosecutor in the Netherlands visited us in 2016, we -- from that moment, we actually already started our own assessment. And in that -- in our own assessment, we also came to the conclusions that we had shortcomings in our processes, our procedures, to prevent financial economic crime from happening. And we didn't wait for the prosecutor to finish their investigation. Actually, on the back of that, we developed a program with those learnings to get the whole organization up to bench if it comes to making sure that you have the right policies, procedures in place.</p><p>But that's a program -- it's a heavy program, and we are rolling it out across 40 countries and 38 million customers. So that will take some time. Having said that, the program is very thorough. The program basically has 2 elements: on one side, it is all about KYC file enhancement, just going through all the clients that you have, the files that you have with these clients, making sure that you know that client very well, and then from thereon, you keep that up to date; and the other side, it is very much on the structural improvements that we need to make in ING in the way we work, in the way we take these issues forward. And that structural improvement program has 5 elements: it has the element of policy elements; the tooling around it; and the monitoring of client activities; the governance, how do you put governance together, what kind of committees do you put together; and mindset, behavioral issues as well. And Steven will take you through that program, that 5-pillar program there, and gives you a little bit more insight there in order to lead into the Q&amp;A.</p><p>But there's one thing I want to make absolutely sure. And it is that we should all understand that going forward, whether you're a digital bank or whether you're a platform, that the elements that build trust, given the fact that clients are interacting with you more and more through a digital channel only and not through physical channels, that the element of trust is so important. And for that reason, embracing and mastering nonfinancial risk in the way you run a bank or a platform is as important as mastering financial risk that banks are known for. So in the end, the program is the program, and the enhancements are the enhancements. But from thereon, we have to make sure whatever we do that, that skill is part of our DNA in order to ensure, going forward, that we manage this very effectively.</p><p>Now for a further update on this program, I'm inviting Steven on stage to take you through. I'll be back for Q&amp;A.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK, CHIEF RISK OFFICER, MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD BANKING, ING GROEP N.V.: Good morning, everybody. My name is Steven van Rijswijk. I'm the CRO of this bank. I am determined, together with the board and with the rest of the organization, to get sustainably better in our know your client policies and execution of these policies and processes.</p><p>When a Dutch prosecutor came in, in 2016 to investigate shortcomings in our execution of know your client policies, which led to the fine which was announced in September 2018, we already started with our root cause analysis. And that root cause analysis led to a couple of things. First of all, the number of people that we wanted to work on this should increase dramatically. And at this point in time, there are over 2,500 full FTE working on know your clients in ING. The second thing is that we started with an enhancement program, and that enhancement program consists of 2 parts. One, a file enhancement program that basically is focused on document due diligence, client identification, client verification and client data. That's the first part, enhance your files. The second part are a number of strategic pillars to get sustainably better in know your client, KYC. There are 5 pillars.</p><p>First pillar is about policies. We, of course, had global policies, but we updated our policies in line with the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive in Europe, including risk appetite statements: which sectors do we not want to deal with, which products are more risky than others and require enhanced due diligence; but also, a SIRA, a systematic integral risk assessment (sic) [systematic integrity risk analysis] , because it's not only the file due diligence that you do with your clients or name screening but also adverse media screening and then a transaction that you need to include to come to a holistic picture of who your client is and what they do. And that, in turn, could lead to enhanced due diligence or a higher frequency of due diligence.</p><p>The second pillar is the global KYC digital service. That is a workflow tool. When do we need to ask? What information do we need to have? When do we need to have that information by? Who is responsible to get that information? We've rolled out 3 proof of concepts, which were successful, and now we're going to roll out this tool across the globe.</p><p>Then on governance. We set up a central KYC organization, and that central KYC organization guards the processes, the rules and responsibilities and the workflow in the company, the work instructions, what do we need to do exactly. Also, there are 2 committees which we set up. First of all, a KYC committee. And that KYC committee, we set up in every country, led by the CEO or the COO of that particular country, focused to track and trace progress on the KYC program. The second committee is a client integrity risk committee. Again, we rolled out those committees in every country, chaired in this case by the CRO or the head of compliance of that particular country or business line. And that committee focuses on dilemmas that we have with onboarding of clients or potential off-boarding of clients. This committee only focuses on compliance elements, as in attribute of decision that we need to take with regards to onboarding or off-boarding.</p><p>If you look at the Netherlands, in 2017, for compliance reasons, we exited 1,700 clients. In 2018, it was over 2,700 clients, which shows the increased focus that we have on this topic.</p><p>The fourth pillar deals with monitoring and screening, because next to your information of your clients, you also transact with your clients. And we are rolling out a tool globally on our post-transaction monitoring. Now it's not only this tool that is important because you need to develop risk scenarios. What kind of risk scenarios do we develop for a particular sets of clients or sectors to make sure you create the right alerts, on which you start to investigate? This topic is so important for us in KYC that we also are working together with public authorities and other banks to become much more effective. Because if we do a transaction with a client, we only see one leg of it: what does the client -- where does the client move money to or where did the client get money from? But further legs or elements of those transactions, to get a more holistic picture, are hard for us to see. That's why it's so important for us to work with other banks and other public authorities to get sustainably better and much more effective. And we're very happy that a number of these parties are very open to collaborate. Clearly, it's in an infant stage and we need to make sure that we do this in line with our privacy legislation, but it's a good first step. And we are really focused also on that element of due diligence and of that element of collaboration.</p><p>Then last but not least, the mindset. You can have any tool you like. You can have any process or any policy, but if the people do not work alongside those policies and do not feel they need to do this much better, it will all go to waste. The mindset is a key element. And that's why we start -- we have -- we are doing trainings. We're doing a lot of communication but have also hired a team of people with a psychology degree to do behavioral risk assessments. And in these assessments, people are being interviewed. All the interviews are written down and analyzed, but then also fed into a tool that we, with data analysis again, can analyze key patterns of high-risk behaviors in groups to see where collaboration is imperfect; to see where people may not feel completely safe to speak up; to see where people are aware and they want to make it work, but they lack certain abilities, i.e. skill sets or conditions, the right environment to do this in. And that, we can then take back into interventions.</p><p>So you see, it's not only about the program. The program will last until end 2020, and we are reporting back to the DNB, the Dutch Central Bank, on a regular basis. But that is a means to an end. It's not the end in itself, and that is continuous learning what we need to do to get continuously better in KYC.</p><p>And this is where we want to go to. If you look at the left-hand side, we start with customer onboarding with new information screening, so adverse media screening and name screening. And those are tools that are running in the back continuously. Adverse media screening, we have already rolled out in most of the countries. But then you go to the right-hand side of the screen, which is continuous monitoring, because then you get these transactions in, which can generate alerts, which can generate hits or significant suspicious activity reports that you need to provide to the authorities; which then filters back into the left-hand side, on your either event-driven or periodic-driven KYC process. So it will become a customer life cycle.</p><p>We are doing over 8 billion transactions per year, and that basically means that we need a lot of data. And that fits well into our data strategy because data is in the heart of what we're doing, in the heart of our transformation and what we want to be as a company: a data-driven company.</p><p>I'm sure you've heard of machine learning and of artificial intelligence. Here is how we apply it to KYC. I'll give you 2 examples. When you do transaction monitoring, which you see on the right-hand side, of 8 billion transactions per annum, that means you get a lot of alerts, which you also get a lot of false alerts -- actually, alerts that shouldn't have been there in the first place. But they need to be investigated. We use machine learning to take out these false alerts, set the alert, then we can focus on the real alerts and spend time to really focus on people that would want to perform anti-money laundering -- or money laundering.</p><p>Second example is on smurfing. Smurfing is a technique that is used by criminals to cut payments into little pieces to make sure that they are under the radar screens, so that they are not being picked up by systems, that people do not see them. There, we are rolling out in a couple of countries a tool, again based on machine learning, to pick up smurfing to make sure that we spot smurfing early on. So also, machine learning and AI are important.</p><p>I've told you about the tremendous determination and focus the entire organization has to bring KYC to a sustainably higher level. I've told you about the progress that we're making. I've told you about the program that we are having. I've told you about where we're going with the customer life cycle, and I've told you about machine learning and artificial intelligence that we use as techniques to get better. I am determined, together with the board and the entire organization, to bring KYC to a sustainably higher level. That is our primary goal.</p><p>Mark, can I give it back to you?</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Is this working? Okay. Roel and Ralph, please join us for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MARK MILDERS: So I'll go to the mic. I promise not to sing. So thank you, Ralph and Steven. Roel, welcome as well. We're now going to Q&amp;A, but let me start off with the #1 question that the team and I have been receiving from analysts and investors from all over the globe. And that is the question -- we've been in the news often. We had the report on Russia and Belgium. Last week, we had the news on Bank of Italy. And what is there to say -- or what can we say to give people more comfort on whether there's more to expect? Are there more interactions ongoing with regulators in our businesses and countries? And what is it that you can say there to at least give some guidance on whether there's more to be expected?</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Thank you. We've always had -- and we do have from various regulators on-sites and inspections on various part of our organization, where these are on-sites on potential risks or on our strategy, or in this case, on AML and KYC. But clearly, after the fine came in September 2018, there was a heightened scrutiny and a heightened way, of different regulators, to go into on-sites and deep dives into our organization. And a number of them have started. A number of them were finished. And in this case, Italy came forward. But yes, it's in the regular process that we get on-sites on AML and KYC, and it will to continue. That's maybe point one. Point two is, we are on a multiyear program that is bringing significant improvement, like I just explained to the entire organization. So we have already made improvements, but there are still a number of improvements to come, and that will take time.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, the question -- I would like to open the floor now for questions. There are microphones. And I will try and keep track of your hands. I think, Benoit, you were first, so...</p><p>BENOIT PETRARQUE, HEAD OF BENELUX EQUITY RESEARCH, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Benoit Petrarque from Kepler Cheuvreux.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Sorry. Can you please stand up?</p><p>BENOIT PETRARQUE: Yes. So a couple of questions on my side. The first one was on the -- how much time do you need to basically complete the review of the file stuff in KYC? It takes time, basically, to be implemented. So at -- in which point in time can you tell us, we are comfortable with the control in place and also all the files we have in house. So one or two to get a data point, if you want, in time for that? Second question was on Russia. This is a country which is screening weak on -- well, money laundering, basically. So are you committed to this subsidiary in Russia? It's a EUR 5.5 billion book, pretty small, mainly important for you in the Industry Lending. So can we expect decisions there in terms of keeping, closing or restructuring this branch in order to decrease the risk on a sustainable basis? And then around ALM (sic) [AML]. Basically, what will be the cost to do -- the incremental cost potentially? And you were saying that you have 2,000 people working full time on that. Do you expect more? Or do -- you're happy with the current cost base basically on this project -- program? Yes.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Okay.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Thank you.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Steven, you go first.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Yes, I'll go first. So I mean, I think with regards to the file enhancements, look, we have a number of higher-risk files that we are looking at in our program to improve. And we will do that, as I said, in a program in 2019 and 2020. But enhancing files or getting your files in order or getting those files better is an ongoing element. I mean, that's why I said that program lasts until 2020. But currently, we have the 4 directives, the AML, the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. In 2020, there will come the fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive from Europe. So enhancing files will be something that we'll be -- that we will be doing continuously. And only in the program, we are enhancing a number of files, but we use those learnings to continuously enhance the files. Again, that's only part of doing due diligence on our clients because it's only the file due diligence. But then you have name screening, adverse media screening and transaction monitoring that I've put on the stage a bit earlier. I think that's the answer on question one.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: And maybe to add to that one. Clearly, after the initial enhancement, thereafter it's business as usual. That's -- the cycle that Steven explained is that you will have to continue to update your files. And with new directives coming in, you may even have to go beyond the level where you current -- where you, at that moment, have them, right? So -- but the project aspect of it will fade away after 2020. Go ahead.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Then with regards to Russia, look, I mean, there have been news articles appearing in the paper. We do not comment on individual clients. What we saw 2 weeks ago wasn't -- where articles amongst others are about Belgium. There, we had a couple of correspondent banking relationships, which we did, by the way, exit in 2009 and 2010. And there are a number of -- a couple of clients in Russia on which we did file SARs and which we exit as well. We've also filed SARs in the past and then still do on the Netherlands. For example, we filed over 4,000 SARs on Dutch clients alone in this country. And so there are -- if you look at French economic crime, that is happening everywhere. We will continue to keep an eye on, of course, our Russian activities and make sure that we deal only with those companies that we want to deal with. The number of clients that we currently have in Russia is relatively limited. Typically, these are large blue-chip clients with international activities. At the same point in time, when it comes back to one of the earlier elements with regards to Belgium, we have been reviewing in the past already our correspondent banking. And since the last 5 years, we have decreased the number of clients in correspondent banking with about 20%. And we will continue to review that.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: On the cost side, maybe -- maybe you can add to that as well. As Steven had indicated, we currently have some 2,500 FTEs working on this. These are not people who are just working on KYC or on the program. This is people across the board, so also IT people who are working on it or services people who are working on it. And we have reprioritized quite some part of our change budget, as we call it, the investment budget, in order to develop new tools, as Steven was saying -- indicating in his presentation. the development or the introduction or the rollout of new tools, that's what you need to do; the digitization of the whole process, making sure that you have all the documents in the central place, check from all the different perspectives. So there's quite some investments going in that. So it's a couple of hundreds of millions that is going into that -- into it. At the same time, this is what it takes, right? I mean, this is -- if you want to be in banking, this is part of what you need to do. And I actually think that if you can get this done really well, it can be a differentiator as well. So you have to really dig deeper to know your client and make a thorough analysis and make sure that you store that data and learn from it in the continuous learning cycles, as indicated. Maybe, Roel?</p><p>ROEL M. M. LOUWHOFF, COO, CHIEF TRANSFORMATION OFFICER &amp; MEMBER OF MGMT. BOARD BANKING, ING GROEP N.V.: Yes. The only thing to add is what you actually alluded to before, which is the fact that -- there are 2 components. One is to get our files enhanced and get it up to a certain level. And that's -- a lot of that is project activity. That is getting those -- getting ourselves in that status, on file enhancement on one hand; and then the other hand, getting all the projects in and get the structural solutions in place. That should fade out in the end of 2020 because that's the moment that we have agreed with the Dutch Central Bank that, that will move away. And then it becomes business as usual. Like, every bank will have to comply with these laws and regulations.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Thank you. Please?</p><p>PAWEL DZIEDZIC, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Pawel from Goldman. So maybe a more specific question on Italy. You were banned from onboarding new clients. Can you give us a sense how long it can last so we can gauge the disruption that regulators can impose on a business? And the second question is, do you believe that this on-sites visit and the decision by Bank of Italy create a precedent for others to go into that direction, which will then possibly shorten the time you have to address the shortcomings?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: So the first one, we can't really comment on the matter itself. We were surprised by it, let me put it that way. And it's for us to show to that we have our act in order to make sure that, that ban gets lifted. We're working on this every day now in order to come up with a plan as to how we think we can work on this, not just fix it, but really structurally improve it. That plan will go to the Banca d'Italia, and then we'll have the conversation as to how to take it further. And the team is, as we speak, working on this day and night in order to do that. As to the precedence, I don't think you need this per se as a precedence. I think what Steven already indicated is that we get visits by regulators on a regular basis anyway. They do inspections across different activities. Clearly, there's a heightened attention around this subject with us, but also many other banks, and we'll just have to deal with it. What we do is that with every finding that we have ourselves, whether it's coming from our own audit area or in discussions with regulators in different countries, we do circle around that learning as soon as possible and see how we can pick it up and make it part of the enhancement program. In the end, what we're seeing from the Banca d'Italia and some of the elements in that report, it's all covered by our enhancement program. So it's very much around processes and procedures in order to ensure that you have a good standard of KYC to prevent financial economic crime from happening.</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK, BANCA DI CREDITO FINANZIARIO S.P.A., RESEARCH DIVISION - RESEARCH ANALYST, MEDIOBANCA: It's Robin van Broek from Mediobanca. I think you're indicating basically that you have had some lesson learned that you're also rolling out to other countries. Can you talk a little bit about how happy the regulator is with those enhancement that are coming through already versus trying to punish you, basically, for what you could have also done better in the past? That's the first question. And the second question is on exiting clients. I think your comment following the Belgium and Russia affair was quite helpful that you exited those clients in 2009. But can you talk about a little bit how it comes that these accounts were open for years longer, basically, or whether that's true? And then you -- I think in the answer to Benoit's question, you already said that in Russia, you also exited certain clients. But is it fair to assume that the declines that used to Troika Laundromat basically were also identified with the ING Belgium case towards the regulator back then?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: So maybe on the way we deal with our regulators, and then you take the more specific cases. So we're basically in touch with the Dutch Central Bank continuously on this. We have this program that we agreed with them that we are reporting on progress, and we enrich our initiatives with the learnings that come from different areas to the extent we feel that it's not covered by the program itself already. And there's a complete open communication around that as to how we take these things on. And it's -- so that's -- and this is on a continuous basis.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: With regards to the client in Belgium, where you stop them as a correspondent bank, it does not prevent clients as such to make use of such bank themselves. So there are many banks that we do not per se work with, maybe not for compliance reasons or not for other reasons, but it does not mean that those clients do not transact with other banks. So that is -- in that sense, it's a different thing. As soon as you pick up signals on correspondent banks, which vaguely is a bit more distant, if you will, because correspondent banks have their clients and they just ask you as a bank to transact these transactions for their clients with clients of other banks. That is one element. A second element is then -- is that you then look into, okay, are there particular companies that have particular links with these banks that I should take into account as well? And so have to look at these clients in a different element, correspondent banking, on one hand, what are these banks doing which are more using your systems because they do not have access to payment systems themselves, for example, in Europe, but they do transact through your systems with other banks and other clients; and two, what are clients of yours doing? So in that sense, it's a separate bucket.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Thank you. Please, [microphone].</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE LAMBERT, SVP AND UNITED KINGDOM ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jean-Pierre Lambert from KBW. Three questions. First of all, do you feel you need to increase your provision for litigation on the back of the events which may be simmering? Second question, can you express the costs -- additional costs, incremental cost, as a percentage of the target EUR 900 million cost saving? Is it impacted at all? And thirdly, do you expect some kind of slowdown of client acquisitions as a result of more intense KYC, or do you keep expecting the same kind of growth? I think you reiterated your target of EUR 14 million and increased it to EUR 16.5 million. So I suspect not.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Okay. Maybe if you take the first one.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Thank you, Jean-Pierre. So on the provision, basically, you can only take a provision in the IFRS if 3 elements happen. First of all, you need to be able to make a reasonable estimate of a potential fine -- [usage] fine in order for that be the case. Two, then there would be a shortened likelihood that, that fine would take place. And three, it would actually lead to a potential cash-out. And those are IFRS elements that are conditioned to take -- or for provision. Now if you cannot just take provisions on potential views that someone may have or what in the future may happen, if you talk about Italy specifically, we have not been charged with a fine. We basically now have received an instruction to stop onboarding new clients and to enhance a number of our KYC processes and provide them with a plan before we can reopen. They are an administrative process that needs to be concluded, and that conclusion could lead to an administrative fine. But again, we don't know what it is, if at all. The second element is -- at least I'm now reacting to press reports, is press reports appearing on an Italian prosecutor. But we have not received any message from the Italian prosecutor. We tried to get in touch with them, but they have not contacted us. And until now, we have not heard from them if there will be an allegation, if any. So you can only take a fair provision if you know the substance, approximately the amount, and the likelihood of the outflow. And none of those things have happened in any of the countries in which we're active. So we cannot do that.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: All right. Now your question in terms of, how can you kind of translate these into savings? It's really -- I think that's really -- that's not the way we look at it. This is what we need to do, and this is what -- it is about banking. And as a bank, you have to be a gatekeeper to the financial system. And we have to beef up our efforts on that one, and that's what we're doing. And the estimates are a couple of hundred millions that we're doing, but quite some of that is reshifted capacity of things we would otherwise do because there is only so much you can do at the same time. It's a 2,500 FTE estimate across the organization. So in terms of cost estimates, these are the ones. But it's not to be said that, that is an incremental cost on top of everything because, as I said, there's only so much you can do and you reprioritize part of some of these programs where you have to do this. Then on the growth aspect. Clearly, onboarding and putting more scrutiny to onboarding is one that is absolutely crucial in order to ensure that you are a good gatekeeper to the financial system. I think, in many cases, we have the right processes already. Having said that, the ambition that we indicated is around primary customers. And if you look at the number of customers that we have currently, which is more than 38 million, and then the number of primary customers that we have, we feel that working with these customers that we already have provides some opportunity. So that's what we're looking at.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Thank you. Alicia? Sorry, could you bring a microphone over there to the lady?</p><p>ALICIA MARIANNE CHUNG, ANALYST ON THE PAN-EUROPEAN BANKS SECTOR, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'm sorry. So just 3 questions from me. Firstly, on the cost front related to the KYC program. Obviously, you started this back in 2016. It's now 2, 2.5 years later. You expect to finish it by 2020. Is there not a case to be made to try and expedite this, and so add more resources, increase your costs in the short term, just to get this through at -- either in this half-year or by the end of 2019? Because it does sound like it's quite an urgent matter. Secondly, just on the terms of processes that you're putting in place. I mean, obviously, you've talked a lot about being able to screen and identify client files that may look dubious, but there are other issues related to actually escalating problems either at a divisional level or also at a group level, so client files that might affect ING Belgium that have also affected ING Russia, for example. What is being done to make sure that there is a coordinated effort across the different countries and also to monitor at a management or a board level? And then one third question. Just looking again at ING Italy. What -- are the processes that you had in place there different from other countries? And why wouldn't we necessarily see the same issues elsewhere? Or what are the big differences between them?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Maybe on ramping up FTEs and capacity?</p><p>ROEL M. M. LOUWHOFF: Yes. Well, the first question is around how do you really make sure -- and how can you basically make sure that you deliver and that you -- can't you speed up? Well, again, 2 components. The first one is the file enhancements. We have committed to the Dutch Central Bank to have all of our file enhancements done by the end of 2020. Internally we've got a different target, which is around -- at the end of 2019. And currently, we're on track to get there. Then you get to the structural solution. And since it's a structural solution, it means it's not like putting something just in place. It's literally building something up that enables us to stay compliant going forward, as we are today. And that means that with all of the elements in there, and Steven alluded to the workflow system that we have in there but also some of the systems around transaction monitoring, we need to make sure that they are actually up to the standard and are able to be embedded in all of the local systems that we have. And that takes a little bit longer. And that's why we get to the end of 2020.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: On, basically, how do you make sure that whatever you find in some cases with clients, that you make sure that other parts know that as well? I mean, a lot of the discussion -- a lot of the enhancements that Steven was talking about, whether it is the governance enhancements -- if it comes to KYC committees, which each one of us, the business leaders, cheer themselves in order to go through client relationships. And what has come out and what needs to improve and how do we deal with that, they take ownership around this.</p><p>And then there was quite some tooling that has to go into that learning as well in order to ensure that, that knowledge goes across as soon as possible as well. So there is quite some of these structural enhancements geared towards that. And maybe you can add?</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Yes. I mean, so basically, it means that we need continuous learning in the organization, also to share what we've done in one country, how we can do that in the next. So if there are things that we learn from what we see in the Netherlands, we actually apply that to the program. But also, you see that now with things that we learn from Italy. In terms of sharing, for example, SARS how we start with sharing these, where we can -- because we cannot always, from a legal point of view, share suspicious activity reports. You're not allowed, certainly in all countries, to share these suspicious reports. But where we can, we do share so that we become better at recognizing when things go wrong with a subsidiary of one company in one area, what are the effects of the total company, but also maybe companies that deal with that company. And then you come back to, let's say, trade-based money laundering, which is relatively complicated because it's not limited to one subsidiary or even one company, but it's many companies and many entities across the globe. Now as soon as we see these things also happening from the past -- because I mean if you look about the Troika Laundromat, you talk about 2009, 2010, that's 10 years ago. But even there, where we do [loot bags], we take learnings from that and apply that over the entire organization to become better at this. With regards to Italy. Yes, a number of the shortcomings that we have seen -- actually, all the shortcomings that we have seen, were known by us and were taken on board in the program. But the number of these elements that we need to pick up, for example, the rolling out of our workflow tool systems, our tools are sequentially -- and that basically means that they are on the calendar to get this on board, but we have not done it yet and that needs to happen to make sure they become sustainably better.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Okay. Thank you very much. I would like to conclude this Q&amp;A right now. And thank you, Roel and Steven. And give the floor to you, Ralph, to start the deep dive into our Think Forward strategy.</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Thank you. Good. Okay. I think this was important, and we will have more time today during the lunch and during the meetings and each and every presentation, we'll tackle this subject as well in order to discuss this. And we found it important that we could address this with you, that we took you along into -- along in what we're doing about that and what we can do about it and what we know at this moment in time. And so that's absolutely crucial.</p><p>I think it shows that whether it's nonfinancial risk management or compliance with laws or regulations in general, they are nonnegotiable for us. Nonnegotiable for us.</p><p>Now, if you look at the Think Forward strategy as to when we launched it and how we're currently doing and what we see, that's what I'll take you through right now. And as indicated, after me is Tanate, who will take you through the financials; Roel that will take you and give you an update on the transformation itself, and then we'll have the business lines commenting on what they're doing.</p><p>Wholesale Banking, Isabel, but Steven will be there as well in order to give you a peek into how we do credit risk management there. And clearly, his presentation will also still cover some of the nonfinancial risk as we discussed. And then Aris, Roland and Ignacio will tackle the different aspects of the retail bank and how we're progressing there.</p><p>So we have a whole program there for you. You should see my presentation as kind of the total overview of what we're doing and where we are currently.</p><p>Now when we started Think Forward in 2014, we actually picked up on many of the changes that we saw coming at the banking industry, whether it was increased regulation, whether it was a lower interest rate for longer, whether it was the upcoming power of technology. The new competition that was coming out, as in platforms, we've picked that one up. And on the back of that, we started a program called Think Forward -- a strategy called Think Forward to reinvent banking, literally reinvent banking. And as we've seen actually going into that, at a certain moment, we had to accelerate that.</p><p>To go back to Think Forward, that's a strategy that has at its core our purpose, and our purpose is to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. And there's 2 things I want to remind you of in our purpose. The first one is that it's about people. So it's not necessarily about clients or customers. It's about people in general, which basically means that we take our role in society a little bit beyond where we are as a company or a bank. So it's beyond supporting economic progress. It's beyond financial empowerment. It is also there to create a sustainable world for all of us going forward.</p><p>There's a second aspect of our purpose I want to remind you of, is that it doesn't have the word banking or financial services in it. Because banking or financial services are not a primary need of our customers. Our customers need to eat. They need a house. They need to travel. They need to communicate. They need to network. They need to invest in their companies. They need to grow their companies. Those are primary needs. Banking serves the necessary need to facilitate that primary need. That's why the purpose is not mentioning bank and financial services. But there is one thing more there. It is that already at that moment, we saw that if you believe in a digital world, and you believe in a digital interaction, then you come to a point where people are literally dealing with their primary needs in the same way that they are dealing with banking, digital interaction. And that's what you see happening right now because you see that in that interaction point, you see that industry lines are getting blurred. Same apps are used for many different things. That's what we saw at that moment in time. Now one of the things that we saw as well is that products in banking were increasingly commoditized. You couldn't make a difference by having a new mortgage or a new savings account with bells and whistles. Honestly, that led to other issues. So you had to do it on the back of creating a differentiating client experience. And clearly, the ones who were customer champion, not only in knowing the customer but also in serving the customer, were at the platforms already because they were able to deliver a service that was personal, instant, relevant and seamless and all at the same time.</p><p>So that's the bench that we were up against, and that's where we wanted to move. That's why the core of our strategy is to deliver a differentiating experience, not a differentiating product, the experience.</p><p>Another part of our one-slide strategy that's really important for you to notice is operational actions, and operational actions goes beyond operational efficiency. In a digital world, operational actions means operational resilience. I'll come back to that later. But it's a concept that in a digital world people expect you to be always on. Your system is always available. They trust in you as a digital icon, and you have to do everything to protect that trust. Data security, IT security, nonfinancial risk.</p><p>And when we were in this Think Forward strategy and delivering on it, just 2.5 years ago when we were together last, we announced that we wanted to accelerate some of this, that some of the advantages that these platforms had, we wanted to take on board as well. For example, they were able to deliver the same customer experience in different countries. Literally the same. No difference. Uber is everywhere the same. Facebook is everywhere the same. But banks are everywhere different, even if they're called the same ING. Makes no sense. It's not necessary. So we could save money there and create cross-border platforms.</p><p>And that's why we started the transformation. That's what you see in the wheel. And we started to do that from the inside out, all the way from our support functions, IT, everything that supports the business and then the platforms that we're creating around the Unite countries, Belgium and Netherlands, and Model Bank on the other side.</p><p>But that is only in order to create scalability, but there's an opportunity there as well. And that opportunity is that it can actually get you to become a platform. Because if you believe in a platform world, both from the Wholesale Bank side as well as from the Retail Bank side, by the way, you have to make a decision. You could be a bank and connect to the platforms that are there and get your traffic or you could create your own platform. That's the ING on top.</p><p>Can your brand be so successful and so powerful that client take you as a starting point for all of the services? That's what we're working on. The go-to place for financial services.</p><p>But in addition to that, we're developing independent platform opportunities. And what you're trying to do with these platforms is that you basically try to shift a little bit forward in the value chain, where basically you deal with customers when they are looking for brokerage services, buying a house, rather than that you're confronted with a request for mortgage because they've already decided to buy a house. And then you have 3 days to react, and the only thing you can do is pricing to win the deal.</p><p>So if you know early on that they're actually looking for a house and you're active in a digital broker world, then actually you can expect what they want. That's the forward integration in the value chain. That's the platform world.</p><p>Now we have been working really hard over the last 5 years on many of these aspects creating a different channel experience. And just over the last year, we have improved our Net Promoter Score on the Wholesale Bank by 14%. And over the last 4 years, we have been increasing our primary relationships by 50%. We have taken on a lot of innovation, done ourselves through boot camps, but also partnered up with other bright ideas. And we took initiatives in the activities beyond banking, which are the platform initiatives. That's what you see right here.</p><p>Just coming back to our purpose and the fact that I made a specific reference to sustainability as part of our purpose. Our sustainability strategy basically stands on 2 legs: one is very much on how do we create a self-reliant society; and the other one is very much around how do we create a low-carbon society. Both are completely aligned with UN sustainable development goals completely. And on the back of that, we are improving our reputation and actually doing quite some business. But one thing that we're particularly proud of is the Terra approach. Now the Terra approach is a scientific approach as to how you can calculate the indirect footprint of your asset base. And on the back of that approach, we have pledged to decrease or to develop our assets in line with the Paris report. And what's really good to see is that many other banks have actually adopted this approach and say, \"Well, we will go along.\" And they've pledged to decrease their asset base as well -- at least the indirect footprint of their asset base as well, in line with the Paris report. That is the way we can fundamentally change how things are done on the globe.</p><p>If you look at all of this, and if you pick up the stories of today, you can see 6 different value creators for ING. Or value accelerators, if I may say. The first one is the growth of primary customers. And primary customer is a customer that is more loyal, that does more business with us and creates more profit. It's what we will see today.</p><p>But on the back of knowing your clients so well, because they are a primary customer, you can improve your cross-buy. And that cross-buy in a platform world should not be limited to the product that you produce yourself. It should be open to third-party products. It should even be open to peer products because if a peer can deliver the right product for our clients' needs, we should be able to deliver it. That's the opportunity there. Then clearly, with the transformation to cross-border platforms, we are creating cross-border efficiency, cross-border scalability. But the additional value accelerator on top of that is the time-to-volume. And what do we mean by time-to-volume? Just the example of Model Bank. Once you have Model Bank, clearly, you have already operating leverage. But beyond that, if you then introduce a new product, rather than in the past having to introduce that product in 4 different ways in 4 different countries to reach 7 million, now I have 1 product, and I can reach 7 million customers in once. That's time-to-volume, another value accelerator.</p><p>And Tanate will take you through the opportunity that we have on the value acceleration side if it comes to the fact that we are in that credit spread receiver. By virtue of our funding base being retail. And by virtue of our rating, we stand to benefit from a credit spread change and therefore pick up on that because we are a net credit spread receiver. And then last but not least, given what we are doing on the sustainability side, we actually really think -- and Isabel will show you in her presentation that there's quite some commercial opportunities on the back of that.</p><p>So that's where we are in a nutshell, and this is what we delivered for you. So if you look at the NII over the last couple of years, it has increased despite low-rate environment, by being able to grow, by being able to interact with your customers, by being able to offer them the right services, doing more business. But at the same time, we have been able to manage our NIM on a stable basis. So we have been able to offset the pressure on the savings side because of the decrease of savings -- of interest rates, in order to support the NII. On top of that, we have delivered on our promise to grow our fee income by between 5% to 10% over the years.</p><p>We have delivered on operating leverage, a very powerful measure, as you can see. Over these years, our cost, excluding regulatory cost, and these are the cash-out costs, not the costs of regulatory programs in order to make sure that you comply with all laws and regulation, has only increased by 5%, so 1.1% per annum, whereas the volumes that we picked up have increased by 15%. So this is operating leverage. This is where you see digitalization happening. This is where you can see also in the future cross-border scalability happening. This is a really important input factor to measure whether digitalization is really generating value. This is the one. And on the back of that, despite increasing capital requirements, we have been able to improve the return on equity. Now this didn't go -- this just didn't just happen, right?</p><p>So on the Retail Banking side, we've really, really successfully engaged our customers digitally. So we've grown the number of primary customers, but what is more important is that you see that most of these customers are increasingly digital and that what we already predicted, that the use of digital channels would increase very rapidly, that is exactly happening.</p><p>And within the digital channels, you see that the use of mobile is growing even faster. That provides us with a massive opportunity in terms of how you deal with customers because we know how to work this.</p><p>On the back of that, you were able to engage with your customers, get more interaction with them, get more payment traffic through them --with them, know them better. And you could become the predominant app in their daily lives. And you can already see here and in the Netherlands, we're the #10 app for daily usage. What does it mean the #10? Only the #10? The #1 through 9 are all Facebook and Google-owned. We're the first nonplatform app in the daily lives of the Dutch people.</p><p>With that, we have improved the return on equity on our primary customers, and we made it to the best banks in the world on the Forbes [place] in 2019.</p><p>On the Wholesale Banking side, you actually see the same thing. Already from the beginning, way back, we decided not to want to be everything to everyone in the Wholesale Banking world. We gave up on that ambition that many banks still struggle with. And we went for something that we knew very well, which is the sector approach, the sector knowledge. And that's how we've grown our business, that's how we've grown our relationships. And we are increasing the number of primary relationships in the Wholesale Bank as well, and they tend to be more profitable as well. And then on the back of that knowledge, we have aligned our whole network. So whole network, 40 countries -- more than 40 countries are doing exactly what we want them to do, focusing on these clients and making sure that the products they offer in terms of lending, transaction services and financial markets, that they are all aligned to these sector clients.</p><p>That's how we've become one of the most efficient wholesale banks around.</p><p>And there's one other particular aspect to the strength of our Wholesale Bank, which is that we have a very specific, a very tightly managed risk appetite. And you know it's my background, and I've talked to many of you before, that in a world of competition, from the beginning, we've always said, \"We'll be there, we know these sectors, but we'll never compromise on structure.\" We'll never compromise on our risk appetite because you know you're going to regret it, and we will just wait, and clients would always come back after a while. These are the strengths.</p><p>And also on the Wholesale Banking side, we are really deploying a lot of innovation in order to stay ahead of our competition. And Isabel will talk you through that. We see particular opportunities in the blockchain world. We're one of the leaders at this moment.</p><p>None of this could have happened if we wouldn't have started the transformation program and change from within, standardize from within in order to make sure that you can offer your customers in a standardized way across 40 countries, for example, in the Wholesale Bank.</p><p>And Roel will take you through many of this and give you an update on many of this, but I'd like to just give you a couple of highlights.</p><p>If you just look at the Unite program, 2.5 years into it, we delivered a full cross-border organization. We migrated 600,000 clients from Record Bank to ING Bank in Belgium. We closed 600 branches. We decreased the number of FTEs by 2,000. We took 16% of cost out, literally over a period of 4 years, in the Unite countries, and we kept commercial momentum.</p><p>On the Model Bank side, we actually had a bit of a rough start. You're trying to align the value proposition to your client and amongst 4 different countries, it tends to lead to some discussion. It tends to lead to some discussion. But we finished that, and we agreed on the value proposition going forward. And on the back of that, we built the Model Bank out of Madrid. So we have the whole team working there in Madrid. And we have migrated already 400,000 Czech customers on to the Model Bank platform.</p><p>In Welcome, right here in Germany, the team took that, that challenge to digitize as much as possible in as short time frame as possible, and they both delivered on the savings even more, 12% decrease in the number of FTEs on the operations and services side and improved the customer experience and improved it. And they basically closed that program. So this is closed now. It's done.</p><p>On the Wholesale Banking side, we made further efforts. And basically, we have now all of our loan products on one and the same IT, Transaction Services on one and the same IT. So we're getting closer and closer and closer and delivering on the savings there as well.</p><p>But none of this could have happened if on the IT side we wouldn't have made that part of everything we do. And if you look at that 45% of our IT workforce currently is deployed on cross-border projects already, 45%, nonlocalized, fully cross-border, 45%, you can see that we are building that platform. And at the same time, investing a lot in the IT, saving a lot in the IT, so being able to keep the IT costs flattish, only 1.1% per annum increase. It can be done. Investing in IT to simplify will save you money in IT and at the same time may give you a better client experience. That's what we've done.</p><p>Now, if you believe in that platform world, and whether you're a digital bank or a platform, you should realize that there is a future where customers only see this, or a tablet, or a desktop and they see your logo. And there is almost no alternative to interact with us because there is no branches in many of the countries in which we're active or no relationship managers. And if they call the call center, it's a chat bot.</p><p>So what they see is our logo, our app. And if you have that logo, that's the only thing that builds trust, that orange line, then you better make sure that they can trust it. And the first thing to do then is make sure that you're operationally resilient.</p><p>People expect from us to be always on. And therefore, your systems have to be always up and running. If during the day we're out for 10 minutes, social media is full of it. That's how people are used to being -- to wanting the availability of your app.</p><p>On the Wholesale Bank, it's even higher, the threshold that you need to adhere to. But the same goes for data security, data privacy in order to protect your reputation. IT security, and basically, we test ourselves against the highest IT standards and security standards that tech firms do. That's what we test ourselves against. We [hack] ourselves against these requirements. We measure and we continuously improve on that. That's what's needed.</p><p>And of course, if you want to protect your reputation, you will have to always comply with each and every law and regulation. And therefore, KYC, therefore AML, is of crucial importance, a nonfinancial risk as a whole with IT, with data and everything that comes there and availability, has to become part of our DNA just like financial risk management.</p><p>Now what are the opportunities ahead for us? Let's first go back and take a look at what we see currently. Now, on the economic side, low for longer, we see indicators that show that economic growth may not be as good as expected. And we see confidence decreasing on the back of trade discussions, trade negotiations, trade wars, if you will. We see geopolitical discussions dampening confidence in the world, and we see a Brexit that has a very erratic impact on economic development.</p><p>On the customer behavioral side, we actually see the same change continuing. I mean clients in the Wholesale Bank, customers, they are used to digital interaction, and they want more of it, more and more. And we see the competition coming in from all different sides. The big techs that were maybe hesitant going into banking, there is no hesitation anymore. They are there already. But the good thing is that we know how to deal with technology as well. That digitalization, artificial intelligence, robotization can help us to take on that competition. So we're pretty convinced that we can deal with this also going forward.</p><p>And in the end, we will develop more and more to what we call a dynamic digital player. A dynamic digital player that has at its heart the customer and the customer experience. And the trust that, that customer has in you because of what you offer and how you offer it to deal with their needs, not necessarily limited to your own products, they will expect you to deliver products that fit their needs better whether or not they are your own products. That's the dynamic digital player future.</p><p>And clearly, we may offer products that don't come from our balance sheet, but we will continue to underwrite risk on our balance sheet because that's something we know how to do very well. You could expect the velocity of our balance sheet to increase though, as to how we deal with it and repackage parts of it. That's what you could expect. But this is the world the way we see it.</p><p>And in that side, we do see the opportunity that if you take this on, that you can develop yourself more and more as a screen where banking is prominent, but there will be no mistake we are a bank. With that there's ancillary services around because they trust you and they trust how your objectivity as to how you deal with their needs, they trust the way you compare energy usage for them. That's where a lot of the future will be. And we're already making steps there. We're already making steps in becoming that go-to platform as ING with Payvision, with FinCompare and funding options in the SMEs here. And that actually delivers the opportunity for us to do cater for clients that maybe we would not be able to service from our own risk perspective, but others do have that appetite. You can help those and make fees. And I think that could really improve the quality of our earnings and the fee income going forward. But also on those initiatives in the platform world, where we have more independent initiatives, like Cobase and Yolt, we do see that there's opportunity to grow those businesses and also increase your fees on the back of that.</p><p>Now what does this do to our ambitions? And I know that you always want group ambitions. It's like, what is your Core Tier 1? What is your return on equity from a group perspective? How does your cost/income develop? And my answer is always, that I can't answer that from a group per se because you will have to understand what the underlying businesses are and what the recipe is for underlying business. And this is a slide that I also used the first Investor Day that I was on, presenting you the Think Forward strategy. And there's basically 3 different roles that we manage within ING, that act that can't do without each other and for which a lot of the things that we're doing apply but in a different way. So in the markets leaders area, we do expect, given the low for longer, that even with the commercial momentum there will be some pressure on income. So whatever we do there from a cross-border scalability perspective, it will have to have an impact over time on your cost base and with that improve your operating leverage. In the C&amp;G countries, the same effort of improving cross-border scalability will lead to a better time-to-volume. And that will further increase our income opportunity, and we can allow some cost growth in order to support that, but overall, improve your operating leverage.</p><p>And in the Wholesale Banking side, we're looking at how we can manage our income side, on the commission income side, but also on the repricing of increased capital requirements, thinking that the income line will be a little bit supported, manage our cost base by our Wholesale Banking TOM, our continuous efforts to create cross-border scalability, keep costs flattish and through that improve the operating leverage.</p><p>Now you heard me talk about operating leverage a couple of times. It was already in the beginning in a slide where I showed you that from an operating leverage perspective, over the last 4 years, our costs only increased 5%, whereas the volume have increased 15%. And the reason why we use that one is because that one determines whether what you're doing is really leading to efficiency. Because if you just look at cost/income and you get a lot of regulatory costs on top of it, outflow regulatory costs, I can't cope with that within the same year. Or if you only look at income, I don't want to be lured into doing business that is outside of my risk appetite. So therefore, yes, cost/income is an important input factor for us. But over the years, in order to see where digitalization helps you and cross-border scalability helps you, we're looking more and more at operating leverage.</p><p>Now we do expect cost/income to go down. That's not the point. And we've shown it. Since 2013, we got an additional EUR 500 billion of regulatory costs. We absorbed it. In the Unite case, as you saw, we actually took 16% of our cost out over a 4-year period of time. If you correct for regulatory cost, our cost/income ratio is already below 50%, already in the top quartile of banks.</p><p>So that leads to the overall group ambitions. Now given where Basel IV sits and how it impacts our capital needs, we haven't changed our ambition around that. So 13.5% is our CET1 ambition, to manage around 13.5%. The leverage ambition hasn't changed either, it's the 4% minimum that we want to comply with.</p><p>From a profitability perspective, we will predominantly look at return on equity. This is what we really look at for you. And cost/income as an underlying input factor is certainly something that we will continue to track, but we will not be preoccupied by it. We will be preoccupied by the return on equity and by operating leverage, but we do know that cost/income is the way some of you look at this. And we will continue to [work broad] on it. We'll manage it because it's an input factor in your return on equity, but it's return on equity that we really look at, and there's more things to work on return on equity. And from a dividend policy perspective, we will continue with our progressive dividend policy.</p><p>This is the summary of all the stories you're going to hear today. This is how it all fits together. And with this, I'd like to give the floor to Tanate.</p><p>TANATE PHUTRAKUL, CFO, ING GROEP N.V.: Hi. Good afternoon. My name is Tanate Phutrakul, and I'm the CFO for ING. I think I've taken on the job now for approximately a month or so. So I'm relatively new in my role. But I have been with ING for quite some time. And for the last 10 or 11 years, I've been in different jobs as divisional CFOs for various parts of ING. So I'd just like to introduce myself a little bit.</p><p>I think back, in 2008, I was the CFO for what we called the Ops and IT division. So it really gives me quite a good insight into the -- our technology operations within that world. And I was here in -- I was there in the Netherlands during the time when Postbank and ING Bank merged together as part of Project TANGO, which you may have heard of. And after that rotation, I was then the CFO for what we called the challenger and growth countries, where I think, during my time there, there was quite a transformation ongoing with divestments of many parts of ING Direct in the U.S., in Canada, in the U.K. and a refocusing of our resources into other markets like in Germany, in Eastern Europe and in Asia and is what is C&amp;G today.</p><p>And for the past 4 years, I've been CFO for ING Belgium, where, as you know, we're going through not only a domestic transformation of that franchise, but for the past 2 year, an operational merger with ING, the Netherlands. So that says a little bit about myself and perhaps my background before taking on this role as the Group CFO. Okay?</p><p>Before I go through the presentation financially for ING, I'd like to maybe reiterate perhaps our company's belief about the environment going forward. And perhaps, there's 3 or 4 things which I'd like to highlight for you. Number one is, if we were sitting here 6 months ago to where we are today, I believe and the company believes that we're in an interest rate environment which will be much lower for longer than we would expect 6 months ago. That's the first point.</p><p>The second point, which I think I wanted to make, is despite this low interest rate environment that we see, we believe that the credit spread being paid by financial companies in Europe will go up, and we believe that the credit spread that needs to be transferred to our customer, which is repricing, needs to go up as well. So as part of our financial management, repricing of our loan book is a critical part -- a critical process that we will go through in the coming years. Okay?</p><p>The third point that I wanted to make in terms of our environment is that, well, for the past 3 to 4 years, balance sheet expansion or growing your balance sheet came with limited cost. But under the new regulatory regime, whether it is Basel IV, whether it's MREL, whether it's TLAC, leverage ratio, your balance sheet growth comes with a significantly higher cost than it used to in the past, which means we need to optimize our balance sheet growth and make sure that whatever asset mix, whatever lending product mix that we have, we make it count much more than perhaps companies in Europe or financial companies in Europe were able to do in the past few years.</p><p>And lastly, as we mentioned at the beginning, regulatory compliance and the programs around regulatory compliance will be something that we need to work through over the next few years as well. Okay?</p><p>This picture, I think, just gives you a bit of a highlight about the evolution of the company over the past few years, but I'd just like to highlight 2 points.</p><p>The first one is the box in the middle top, right? In terms of the rigor at which we manage our costs. And over the past 4 years, you can see that our underlying expenses have grown by approximately 1.1% per annum, right? So below the inflation rate in our medium blended markets.</p><p>The second thing, which is a reality for us, is the fact that our regulatory expenses, these are DGS, SRF fees. And in terms of bank taxes, these have grown by over 23% per annum. So these are cost increases which are, to a degree, a little bit outside of our control, but it's something that we need to manage as well. So this is one thing that we will talk a little bit more in my presentation on how to manage our expense base.</p><p>And then the second point which I wanted to make is that -- to reiterate the point that on the bottom right-hand side, that despite all of this, despite the challenges that we have, we have, in essence, increased our return on equity from 7.2% to over 11% during this period despite the fact that we have gone from 10.5% Core Tier 1 to 14.5% Core Tier 1 over this period as well, okay?</p><p>Now the question that you may have is, how have we done this, right? How have we been able to sustain the financial performance of the company over this period of time? And I think one of the big driver is really the net interest margin of the company during this period, and that is shown on the left-hand bottom part of the slide, right? That not only from 2015 have we been able to sustain our NIM. In fact, our net interest margin has actually gone up, right? It's gone from 146 basis points to sit now at around 153, 154 basis points, right? This in light of fairly low interest rate having prevailed for us for quite some period already, okay?</p><p>But if you look forward, the challenges are a little bit more, shall we say, pronounced given the fact that these low interest rates are here for much longer period of time and the fact that our ability to lower deposit rates in some of our home markets, is actually getting much more narrow as we speak, right? If you look at some of our home markets in Belgium, we're already at a statutory flow of 11 basis points. In the Netherlands, we had 3 basis points. And in Germany, we already had 1 basis point. So in fact, the ability to continue to lower deposit rates to counteract the compression in your liability margin is coming somewhat to an end.</p><p>So what can we do to try to mitigate some of this impact on our NIM? What can we do to basically try to slow down the impact on our net interest margin going forward? I'd like to take you through some of the actions that we're taking as a company, okay?</p><p>The first thing which I'd like to highlight is the fact that if you look at the balance sheet of ING in the past, we actually had quite a lot of liability on our balance sheet which we could not deploy in terms of loans, right? You can see back in 2014 we have 38% of our assets, right, which are sitting as investments assets or liquidity investments which carry no interest spread.</p><p>So what we have done over time is to rebalance our loan-to-deposit ratio by lowering the amount of liquidity investment that we have. And you can see that over time, we have reduced it to 33% of the overall balance sheet, and we will continue to do this over time to basically optimize this a little bit further, right?</p><p>Not only that, we have also changed our lending mix, right? Within the lending portfolio itself, we have also been changing basically the mix within that composition. And on the right-hand side, you can see there that the actual concentration in mortgages is coming down, being replaced by an increasing share of Industry Lending and now General Lending &amp; Transaction Services as well. So we're trying to make sure that we're changing the mix to optimize the NIM and the return on equity for the portfolio in itself.</p><p>Apart from the optimization that you see in terms of balance sheet and in terms of our product mix, we have also been looking at optimizing our balance sheet in terms of geographical diversification, right? You'll hear a little bit more from Aris this afternoon about our Challengers &amp; Growth division, but you can see here that the share of Challengers &amp; Growth assets have gone from 34% to 41% of the share of the balance sheet. And you can see that from a revenue perspective, we've gone from 32% of revenue to now 37% of revenue coming from the Challengers &amp; Growth Markets overall. And we expect this trend to continue given the interest rate and economic environment within the Challengers &amp; Growth Markets where we see significant room for continued growth in terms of assets as well as in terms of revenue base, okay?</p><p>Now if you look at this page, and I think I'd like to spend some minutes on this page because it's quite an important one for us going forward, is 2 things, right? As Ralph mentioned in his speech, deposits -- or retail deposits is a major part of our funding base for ING, right? And you can see here on the right bar that over EUR 550 billion of our deposits come from there. This is how we fund ourselves as a company. And if you look in more detail, over 67% of that is stable retail deposits, okay? More than that, 22%, are in current accounts, right? So this is very significant, over EUR 100 billion sitting in our current account, which, on a blended basis, is probably carrying 0% interest today, right? So this is quite a major, I think, key strength for ING in terms of how we fund ourselves, okay?</p><p>The second point I would like to make on this page is that we have a certain asymmetry in our balance sheet, right, as a credit spread receiver and as a credit spread payer, right? And if you look on the left-hand side, you see there that approximately EUR 600 billion of our balance sheet we are actually a credit spread receiver. And this is what we're working on in terms of counteracting the compression of our NIM, to basically reprice the loan book to make sure that we widen the credit spread from a asset perspective. And it is true, of course, that we also pay credit spread, right, as a company as we raise capital market transaction. But you can see there at the bottom that it's a significantly less portion compared to other European peers in terms of how we fund our balance sheet over time, okay?</p><p>Now if you look on fee income, you can see there that we have been able to successfully grow our fee income by approximately 5.2% over time and that, if you think about the future, we're giving some guidance that we think we can sustain this pace of fee income growth into the future. And why we're optimistic about that is probably 2 points I'd like to make on this particular part. Number one is the fact that if you look at the fee income for ING, it represents roughly 15% of our total income, right? So we're not as fee intense as perhaps some of our peers. If you look at the Benelux banks, they're sitting at 19%. And if you look at overall European banks, they're substantially higher. So I think we have quite a substantial room to basically improve in terms of fee income, right?</p><p>And the point I would like to reiterate is that it does not mean that we're actually going to increase fees automatically to our customer. One of the big strategy that we have is that if we are able to get more primary customers, actually the engagement with those primary customers are better than what we have for the general population of customers that we have. And with that better engagement, we also believe that we will drive more transaction with these primary customer, leading to higher fee intensity that we have as well, okay?</p><p>So if you look a little bit on expenses, I think I'd reiterate a little bit about the underlying expenses that we have of approximately 1.1%. But on the right-hand side, you can see that one thing which has really grown over the past 4 years is regulatory expenses, right? It has grown by over EUR 500 million in the past 4 years. To give you a sense of the pressure on cost/income ratio of these regulatory expenses, they're now approximately EUR 1 billion out of a EUR 10 billion cost base. So it's 10% of our costs which are sitting in regulatory expenses. We do expect, however, that some of these regulatory expenses will start plateauing, right? We're all contributing, as European financials, to the DGS fund, into the Single Resolution Fund, and we expect that these contributions should plateau sometime between the end of 2023 and 2024. That's what we expect to happen.</p><p>Now what I'd like to do now is to take you one step below the overall cost number for ING into the divisional cost breakdown within the company, okay?</p><p>So these are our 3 key divisions: Retail Benelux, our market leaders; Challengers &amp; Growth countries; and Wholesale Banking, right? You can see there that year-on-year within market leaders or within the Benelux, we have invested a lot in terms of our transformation, and we're also seeing the fruit of that transformation as well. You can see there that over the past 4 years, the costs has declined within market leaders by 4.2% over time, okay? We have chosen to basically make investments in Challengers &amp; Growth Markets where we see positive jaws, and you'll hear about that this afternoon, whereby we have increased costs by 66.3% but has resulted in a much better top line growth than the cost growth that you see here.</p><p>And in Wholesale Banking, the costs has grown by roughly 2.8% over time. And as you'll hear from Isabel, our guidance is that our lending growth within Wholesale Banking, we are guiding for a slower lending growth in Wholesale Banking, and we do expect the cost base in Wholesale Banking to start flattening over time. So that gives you a little bit of guidance with respect to expenses, okay?</p><p>Now this page is also an important one. It gives you a bit of a summary about the transformation program, right? That all the numbers that you see there, it only happens because of the investment that we make over time, over EUR 774 million, but it also means that we have to make savings to basically keep our P&amp;L or our cost base relatively neutral. And you can see there that we have made savings cumulatively of about EUR 615 million over the programs, either started before or after 2016. And I think Roel Louwhoff in his presentation will go into more details about where those savings and perhaps some of the reductions in FTEs are coming from, okay?</p><p>Now to summarize, and I think Ralph has already mentioned that we are looking at making sure that whatever we do from an expense perspective, we're getting operational leverage, right, which is the point that we'd like to reiterate again, that if our strategy was to work well, and it is working well, that the cost increase should be less than basically the client balances growth that you see within the company. And on the right-hand side, you can clearly see there that if you exclude some of the regulatory expenses that we have, the company on an underlying basis is already operating below 50% cost/income ratio today, okay?</p><p>Now I'd like to spend some minutes about capital, and I think this slide gives you a sense of how we have evolved from a capital perspective from 2015 and to where we are today, okay?</p><p>We started 2015 with a Core Tier 1 ratio of 12.7%, and you can see there that the profitability of the company has allowed us to cumulate additional capital, pay a reasonable dividend to our shareholders, absorb model changes and allow for growth, right? And one of the benefits that we have or the tailwind that we have had is through -- from the last few years is also, we're getting positive risk migration that has helped build our capital base to the fully loaded basis at the end of 2018 of approximately 14.5%, right?</p><p>And the question that we get a lot is, is 14.5% enough to basically sustain or absorb the impact of Basel IV and TRIM and all the other impacts in terms of model changes? And I'd like to spend some minutes about our thoughts on that, right?</p><p>We have done an analysis, and we have given market guidance about what we expect to be the impact of Basel IV on our risk-weighted assets and, consequently, on our capital base, right? And on the left-hand side, you can see there that we expect and it is reconfirming our guidance that we expect the impact to be somewhere around 15% to 18%, right? And the other point that I think we wanted to make is that the impact of Basel IV is much more front-loaded for us compared to maybe some of our Dutch peers. It's because I think ING is much more affected by input flows than output flows, right? So we expect that 80% of the impact of Basel IV will be visible in our numbers by the beginning of 2022, okay?</p><p>Having said that, if you translate these risk-weighted asset ratio into capital, you can see there that the possible risk-weighted inflation calculated in terms of capital would be approximately a 2% reduction on 14.5%. That is what is our expectation. But we now have a program running to see how much of that we can mitigate. And our estimation today is that we can mitigate roughly 30% of that 2% inflation in terms of risk-weighted assets, which gives you that number of 0.7%. And I'll give you a little bit of detail about some of the programs that we're running today to try to make sure that, that mitigation stays within our guidance. But if we are able to achieve these plans, you end up essentially at 13.2%, which is not so far away from our target of 13.5%, right? So we have approximately 3 years to basically accumulate additional capital to get to our target of around 13.5% Core Tier 1 ratio.</p><p>So if I take you through a little bit some of the actions that we have. We have really from the left things that we are saying no regret moves, things that we're working on, moving to the right where we need to look a little bit at how the market evolves and how Basel IV regulations evolve. And I would like to give perhaps 2 tangible things that we're working on.</p><p>The first thing that we're busy working on is to make sure that in terms of the collateral that we have with our Wholesale Banking customers, that we link them very well into the data files and the loan files that we have for our wholesale customers, right? This will give, under the Basel IV regime, quite a significant capital relief by doing that, right?</p><p>We're also looking at possibly whereby we have nonrated customers, that if we are able to persuade the customer or if we take the initiative to get these customer rated, it also give fairly significant risk-weighted asset release, okay?</p><p>A second example that we would like to give is really about disintermediation and capital relief transactions, right? Two examples I'd like to give on this one is, number one, in Q4, you may have seen in our press release that we did a synthetic securitization of our German mortgages, right? They're basically allowing us to lower the amount of risk-weighted assets that we have in Germany.</p><p>A second transaction that we announced also in the fourth quarter of this -- 2018 is the fact that we have also decided to sell a legacy lease portfolio from our Italian business, which is quite risk-weighted asset intense. So we are closing that transaction during the course of 2019, which will also give capital relief. So you can expect from us more such transaction. We're in the early stages of actually developing this activity, but you can see already that in 2018, that we're taking some actions already in that space, okay?</p><p>Now to summarize, I think we'd just like to reiterate again our points in terms of our financial ambition.</p><p>As Ralph mentioned, roughly we have remained the same in terms of our ambition, whether it's 13.5% Core Tier 1 ratio, the leverage ratio being above 4%, in terms of our principal steering mechanism being at 10% to 12% return on equity and that we do keep the 50% to 52% target for our cost/income ratio but that we expect to take longer than 2020 to get there, and that we maintain our progressive dividend over time, okay?</p><p>So with that, I'd like to end my presentation. And I would like to invite Roel Louwhoff to come on stage to give you a bit more details with respect to our transformation program. Thank you. Thanks, Roel.</p><p>ROEL M. M. LOUWHOFF: Thanks, Tanate, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm here to talk to you about our transformation.</p><p>Now why a transformation? Transformation is a means to an end. We have as a purpose empowering people. And with that, we obviously mean predominantly our customers. But actually, it's around people as well.</p><p>If you look over time, ING has been quite successful in actually transforming itself, renewing itself, putting itself on the space at any moment in time when it was needed.</p><p>1997, we started the first direct banks. Observers in the industry often call us the first world fintech.</p><p>2014, we started to look at how do we optimize local-for-local activities based on the learnings we had from the direct banks. And then basically, in 2014, transformation was giving to us the platform strategy. Think Forward was a strategy, and we put a program in place called Accelerating Think Forward.</p><p>And a platform strategy is all about going across those boundaries, going across the local-for-local optimization, moving into standardization and using all the opportunities that technology is giving you nowadays. That's what a transformation is about, that's where our DNA is.</p><p>Now I can imagine, being an analyst, every day you're getting stories about how transformations are going, what digital really means, how successful the programs are, how much has been invested in them. And therefore, it must get you results at some moment in time.</p><p>What I'll try to do is to give you -- with 5 points, explain to you how we look at digital transformations, what we think is important, where we think the value really sits.</p><p>And let me start with the first one. It's all around customers. In the end, it's all around customers. So how do you deliver that customer experience at point of need? How do you make sure that whenever customers need specific information or want to transact, you actually are able to deliver them it?</p><p>The second one is all about adapting fast. Adapting fast. Making sure you keep up to standards to new regulations that are coming in, which are ever-increasing in the industry nowadays, but actually also new requirements that are coming in from your customers based on the fact that some of the big tech players sets new standards that you'll have to comply with. And you better do it on the spot because otherwise, there might be fintechs or other banks out there that go first.</p><p>The third one is digital, is end-to-end. Digital is not this newest mobile shiny app that you can show and see how great it is. That's like lipstick on a pig. It doesn't make the pig pretty. End-to-end literally means that digital needs to flow through from a customer perspective in order to deliver the value to you end-to-end. That means that a customer, yes, they need to have that shiny app, but they will see as well whether it still takes you long in order for them to get delivered what they need to have, or for you where it still needs to take people to get things done, i.e., it needs to be effective, it needs to be efficient. And above all, taking you and interaction out of the steps that you need to do drives not only value, it gives you security because humans still make mistakes.</p><p>The fourth one is around data driven. How to become a data-driven company. And why is that? Well, obviously, again, it's around the customer. How do you deliver at point of need towards your customer that information that he or she needs? Maybe not knows but needs. But actually, even more with all these regulations coming in, data helps you to understand what you need to do in where you are. And the more data driven you are, the more digital capable you are to absorb that information and move it into something that actually helps you to change as an organization, the better you're prepared for the future and for the next steps.</p><p>And then the fifth one is around how do you organize yourselves on a platform. What's the architecture that you need to have in place, which, on some level, starts with a cloud infrastructure in our case but actually also around what we call modularity, our TouchPoint platform, which is all around building modules that you actually can use but reuse as well, making yourselves more effective and efficient? And I think that's the key point.</p><p>All of these elements together make you successful.</p><p>The amount of money you're investing in IT is not a proxy of whether you're successful or not. It's actually how efficient and effective you're able to put that money to work in order for you to deliver towards your customers. And I have a short video for you to basically see how we think this works, how we think we're going to make this work. And actually, at this moment in time, that's how it is going on. So let's have a short video first.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ROEL M. M. LOUWHOFF: So basically, the TouchPoint platform and the focus that we have of having these components built into modular elements that we can use and reuse is at the core of what we do on a day-to-day basis. And that's how we can serve the business throughout, whatever unit it is.</p><p>It also means that you get a flywheel effect. And what I mean by that is that when you build these components and you can use and reuse somewhere else, it means you gain speed and basically amplifies every activity that you do. And if you then continue to build these components, it amplifies it even more, and that's how you get a flywheel. It also means that a lot of the things are interdependent. It really means that if you deliver a component to one of the activities, you actually benefit somewhere else as well. That also makes it very hard to judge what an individual program is because it might be waiting for something that suddenly gets lifted up quite a bit. And that's for -- wherefore, going forward, we will not report any more on the individual programs, we need to look at where we are across the board with the ING transformation.</p><p>Now there are also 3 things on this slide which talk about platform, 3 individual distinct strategies. The first one is ING itself as a platform. Now we offer our products and services, and we deliver them. But we also feel we have a responsibility that if we have a product or service which is not up to the standard as someone else has, to actually make sure we get that on our platform to deliver to our customers. It might also be new things like insurances, for instance.</p><p>The second thing is around needs, independent initiatives, as we call it. Think of retail. Every customer comes to us and wants a mortgage within 4 days. Actually, we're too late because most probably, that customer has gone out to 3 or 4 other banks as well. So how do you make sure you engage at the beginning of the journey. Because ultimately, that customer doesn't want the mortgage, that customer wants to buy a house. And in order to get that house, they need the mortgage. So the earlier we are on the life cycle, the more we can make sure that we deliver towards our customers. And the same is true at the business side. (inaudible) aggregator, all financial products that we can see, we should be knowing more quickly than the company itself where are the financing needs. And if so, then we step in and we basically deliver to the customer.</p><p>What I next want to do is basically discuss with you where we are in the transformation.</p><p>October 2016, we launched our transformation. When you start a big program, there are a lot of things you do know and there are things you don't know. Did we anticipate all the costs coming in from new regulations, specifically around GDPR, PSD2, MiFID, KYC? Probably not. At the same time, we needed to make sure we continue to deliver. And I think that's what we did. That's what you see on the right-hand side.</p><p>So the way we manage the business is in 90-day cycles, in an agile way. We literally look at what we need to deliver in the next 90 days. We look back what we haven't delivered that we set from the previous 90 days and get that into a new bucket. That's how we manage the company. It's very agile. And in that way, we're able to basically deliver on all of those components that we need to deliver to.</p><p>And I think that shows what we have done on the right-hand side, set of good results. It's not just the EUR 615 million that we have delivered, structural annual savings, as of the end of 2018. Regretfully, it also meant that 5,200 people had to leave the company. But it also shows that we have the ability to deliver continuously towards the momentum that we have from a commercial perspective as well as the efficiencies that are out there.</p><p>What I next want to do is take you in some big steps towards the bigger propositions and units that we have and see where we are. And in the afternoon, Isabel and Roland and Aris will take you through some more details.</p><p>Let's start with Unite. Just think about this, right? The #1 in the Netherlands. The #3 in Belgium, Bring them together on one platform. So what did we do? Well, first of all, we harmonized the operations and IT activities. We literally have one operations and IT organization across the 2 countries working as one. Then we integrated Record Bank in Belgium. And actually, from a technical perspective, there was not a flaw in it. It really went well. In the same time in the Netherlands, we're preparing the platform where both banks will go to, as well as we developed what we call the One mobile app together with Germany. The One mobile app is something that is going to be used as well in Belgium at the end of this year. That means at that moment in time, we have 20 million customers on One mobile app. And just think about it, right? Instead of having 3 countries all developing their activities, we have one, all built with a modular approach, TouchPoint Architecture.</p><p>Going forward, by 2020, sooner than we expected, we will have retail harmonization for the digital platform. The SME, the midcorps and the corporate aspects will happen a bit later. That will cost us a little bit more time in terms of delivering and, therefore, having a project organization, which continues to run a little bit longer. But at the same time, looking at what needs to be delivered and making sure we deliver it in the right way, we think it's the right thing to do.</p><p>Then Model Bank. Model Bank is there. It's working. It's working on a private cloud, and it has all of the digital infrastructure there that needs to happen. And on the back of it, the results, we drove efficiencies out, and we delivered to our customers. The next step is going to be having digital proposition for 4 countries by the end of 2020.</p><p>Welcome. Actually, Welcome, I think, is a great example where you see how all of those proof points that I talked about, about digital transformation come together. It is about end-to-end. It is about having that digital proposition at the front end and having your mobile app available, and that helps you to drive efficiencies delivered towards your customers.</p><p>So for instance, in '16, we had 6 million customer calls towards the contact centers. Today, we have 5.2 million. That's not just a reduction. Think about it. We've grown the business in the meantime as well. So the reduction is even more. So quite some opportunities as well going forward on this while we make sure that Germany is going to be integrated in all of the other aspects that we continue to deliver.</p><p>Wholesale Target Operating Model. Wholesale Target Operating Model has been around for quite some time and has delivered. It's all about focusing on the customer at the front end, and at the same time making sure we drive efficiencies by harmonizing our platforms, harmonizing the product platforms and the overall platforms that are underneath.</p><p>If you look at it from a customer perspective, in 2016, we had 450 customers on our digital interaction platform. Today, we have over 18,000. So going forward, we see an opportunity to take another EUR 120 million by the end of 2020 out of the cost base of wholesale, making sure that we basically drive down the costs by an additional 5% to keep it flat overall, as Ralph alluded to already earlier.</p><p>The core of all of this is our foundation. And our foundation is key in everything we do. I talked about the modular approach that we're having. I talked earlier about how important data is and you harmonize data at the front end to really make sure that you benefit as much as possible for what you only can do afterwards with artificial intelligence and machine learning. We put 4 service centers in place. And actually, it's now 5. Because as Ralph said earlier, Model Bank in Madrid is one of the shared service centers that we have as well.</p><p>Now doing this requires a lot of effort from the IT organization. Actually, a lot of the things that you saw are IT-related, technology related, I'd rather say. And at the same time as making sure that we deliver on all of those individual components for the programs, we also transformed fully the IT organization itself. And I think there are 3 ways to look at this. The first thing is around consolidation and simplification. And if you look at the number of data centers that we have reduced, the applications we have removed, the platforms that we have closed in order to harmonize and get to this end state that we want to get to, I think that's the first sort of proof point we have. And then it's around modernizing and standardizing. And ultimately, the only reason you do that is again for your customer. And yes, you drive efficiency on the back of it.</p><p>Ralph talked already about availability, availability to transact, which is key in a platform world, which is key with any digital player that's out there. Just look at today, right? 35 flights got canceled this morning. Why? Because there was a software issue at the tower. You can't transact.</p><p>From a retail perspective, we currently have 99.7% availability of our systems and, therefore, the availability for our customers to transact. At the wholesale, it's 99.9%. Our target is 99.88% for this year. But even better, our future as ING private cloud, that has been running at 100% availability since 2018.</p><p>And on the right-hand side, it was already alluded to, our cost base has remained flat with all of these IT investments and with renewing the IT organization and the way we move forward. But underneath, a lot of changes happened. Just look at the retail organization. It used to be 52% of our IT cost base. It's now only 39%, enabling us to invest in Challengers &amp; Growth and wholesale.</p><p>So overall, we absolutely see the momentum from a commercial perspective. But even better, we also see the opportunity to continuously drive efficiency.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Ralph, Tanate, may I please invite you to join us for Q&amp;A, please?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MARK MILDERS: So thank you all 3. And I would immediately like to open up the floor for questions. Ben, Benjamin Goy here in front, please.</p><p>BENJAMIN GOY, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank. Two questions, please. First, on net interest income. So you highlighted you're a net credit spread receiver. I'm just wondering how this balances with the replicating portfolio and whether you can give any margin guidance in that sense. And maybe also, the repricing on the credit spreads, whether you can talk about some portfolios where you already have seen some repricing. And the second one is then on fee income. So the 5% to 10% growth CAGR you have, just wondering, what is kind of cyclical element of it to get to the low end or the upper end? Or is it mainly your own ambition to convert customers into primary customers, which tend to have higher products in?</p><p>TANATE PHUTRAKUL: I think in terms of the overall context, as I mentioned, is that we see not only for ING but all financial companies, right, that the compression on your liability is there. It is our belief that every bank needs to try to compensate for that by increasing the pricing on its front book, right? And that's what we track today. I give you a couple of examples of actions ING has taken, right? We have what we call the fund transfer price, the price at which we basically sell money, for want of a better word, to the front office. And from that perspective, I think consistently, in the last few months, we've been increasing that price over time, right? So basically, the front office has a certain rigor in terms of making sure that the new origination business is coming at a better or the same ROE despite this increasing pricing. And we haven't seen -- it's still early days, but we have seen better pricing discipline coming out of it, and that's why you see that our guidance for loan growth is getting somewhat less because we are much more ROE-focused than we had in the past, okay? So -- but it is really driven much more by the liability compression than on the asset side.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Yes. Now on the fee income side, I think it's the combination of the 2. That's why I call them both value accelerators. So it's the growth of primary customers themselves which will buy more products because they're a primary customer. But on top of that, it's actually the value accelerator of the cross-buy, of having customers buy products that may not necessarily be ours. And I think some of the examples that we've shown already there is, for example, with Payvision, where basically we offer a payment service provider services there for our customers on the merchant side. The TransferMate, that was indicated on the Wholesale Banking side. But for example, on the Retail Banking side, we have TransferWise which we actually offer as well as a product in your app, where if you have -- or if you want to do an FX transaction, that basically it shows you both opportunities: the one that you did with us or the one that you did with the other party, which is a third-party doing exactly the same but on the back of which we can earn fees. And I think there is -- we haven't really kind of started to see the opportunity that we have. I think we are recognized by many players as the principal player in a digital world if it comes to the financial services industry because we have so many customers that only deal with us through digital channels. And so we have the trust of many of these players that we can actually more and more interact with them. That's why AXA came to us. That's why we have this deal with AXA and are looking as to how can we make insurance so simple because insurance is generally not simple and I know because I used to manage insurance. How can you make it so simple that people actually know what they buy and that there is -- it's a very transparent product? That's one of the opportunities right there as well. So the fee income side is a combination of just growth in customers -- in primary customers but also the further improvement of the cross-buy with our own products but even more so with third-party products.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: There was a question way there at the back. Thank you. Stefan?</p><p>STEFAN ROSENOV NEDIALKOV, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, it's Stefan from Citigroup. So a lot of talk about platforms, but we still have a 10% to 12% ROE target. We understand that ING is probably more of a platform than most banks but not as much as of a platform as nonbank platforms. So how do you think about, I guess, the strategic opportunities and risks? Because Amazon, for example, is very much unlikely to have KYC, MREL risks. Amazon doesn't have to pay 1 billion of regulatory taxes. It's a very different setup. How do you guys think about, say, earnings right now? What are platform earnings for you as a percentage of the total today? How much do you think they can get to in the next 2 to 3 years and then longer term? Are we talking about 20% today or 10% today versus 50% in the future or something very different from that?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Well, that's a good question. Just we are a bank, and there's nothing wrong with being a bank. Let's start with that. And we know how to manage a bank. And clearly, there's many more regulations coming at us as a bank that we'll have to deal with. But at the core, we are a bank. But the way we deal with our customers provides us with the opportunity that they have so much trust in us also for our services and maybe financial services that are not produced by ourselves but beyond that, services that aren't even financial services. And Roland will basically touch upon that in his presentation as well as to -- a couple of examples as to where we are going there.</p><p>For the moment, the only way to translate this in the way we give guidance is that we do expect our fee income to continue to increase between 5% and 10% per annum up to a percentage of 20% of total. That's where we -- so is that all caused by becoming a platform and, therefore, selling third-party services or peer products? Not necessarily the case because there's also banking fees in that. There's also transaction fees in that on the back of our own banking activity. But I do think, and as Tanate already alluded to, you can't as a bank charge fees for something that doesn't add value. And many of our peers have charged fees for those products, in my view. That's why we're low on the fee side to begin with, because we are one of those banks that basically feel that you can't do that. And therefore, the way we want to grow our fees is not just by increasing the fees on the products that we already offer. Clearly, they'll have to increase in order to go along with the costs that we have to make in order to provide those services. But I think the days are over where we can just charge fees, and we've never done that. So honestly, the fee income growth is really on the back of value-added services. And a large part of that, in my view, will be through third-party or peers. And if you want to call that platform income, it is platform income.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Sorry, there in the back.</p><p>NICK DAVEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, REDBURN (EUROPE) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Nick Davey from Redburn. Three questions, please. The first one on costs. I think in a few different slides, you hint at running ING at about a stable cost base from here. Particularly, the change from the Wholesale Bank having grown at 3% compound to flat is quite meaningful. But my question is really, why don't you actively state that ING will be running roughly with a flat cost base? The second question is on dividend. I know it's a board decision, but you stick with the progressive language. At the same time, you're talking about 10% to 12% ROE and bringing the wholesale loan growth down. So was there any discussion before today about changing the language about dividend? And if we just ran a spreadsheet exercise of what you're telling us will happen, we're all going to end up with very high levels of capital, 2 or 3 years forward. So can you just talk to that? And then the third question, on the Wholesale Bank. I know the presentation is still to come, but just from an executive perspective, the target is for basically a stable return on allocated capital with some RWA inflation. Is that sufficient in your eyes? And was there any discussion, for example, of allocating the full 13.5% capital down to the division? Because on that kind of analysis, it's questionable whether the Wholesale Bank is delivering a sensible economic profit for the group. So any perspective there would be helpful.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Okay. You go first, Tanate.</p><p>TANATE PHUTRAKUL: Maybe I take your last question first, which is we used to report up until the end of Q4 2018 on a 12% risk-weighted asset. Then starting in Q1 2019, you'll see in our Q1 disclosure they've been running on 13.5% risk-weighted asset. So that you will see reflected there, which is much more aligned with the capital base that we have. The second question on your costs is, we really don't want to give absolute cost guidance, but I think we wanted to stick with what Ralph has stated in his opening speech, which is the focus on delivering the right return on equity of -- in the range of 10% to 12% and making sure that consistently over time, we deliver on operating leverage in terms of our costs, okay? So that's the second. The third point, I didn't quite get actually. Did you...</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: That's the dividend policy.</p><p>TANATE PHUTRAKUL: Oh. But...</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Okay. So let me pick up on cost.</p><p>TANATE PHUTRAKUL: Yes.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Honestly, you should not want us to run a flat cost per se. Clearly, if we can do it, we will do it, and we have done it. But if you really believe in the value accelerators that we have, we need to have a bit of freedom there. And that's why we have gone over this slide where I show you 3 different recipes for 3 different parts for our bank. Because in the case of C&amp;G, there is -- if the opportunity presents itself to grow faster because we can really accelerate the value creation, we will work like a digital dynamic player, not like a bank. We will look more like one of those platform companies, and we will have costs, and we will allow cost to grow if we feel that the growth that we can produce is profitable and value creating. That's why we don't want to go there. What we do always look at and will continue to look at is operating leverage because that is the way, in our view, you get a financial confirmation of being scalable. And if one thing these platform guys are good at is the scalability, the cross-border scalability. That makes them grow at almost 0 marginal cost. We're not there yet. But at a certain moment we'll end up there, and that's what we're kind of looking at. Then on the dividend policy, we've looked at that, and clearly we make our own calculations. For us, we want to kind of see how TRIM and Basel IV kind of comes at us. We want to really manage this, this aspect of capital and with the 3 kind of levers that we have: profit, this allocation to capital, allocation for profitable growth and dividend. And if down the line we feel to be in a situation of surplus capital, we might consider a one-off that will not then influence the progressiveness of the dividend. But we're not there. But -- so we really want to make sure that we take on TRIM, that we take on Basel. But clearly, you run the spreadsheets, we see things happening. We will take a look at that [today], yes?</p><p>MARK MILDERS: One more question before we break for lunch where you can, of course, continue your questions. Please.</p><p>BRUCE ALLAN HAMILTON, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley. Just a couple of questions, please, from me. Firstly, you mentioned briefly sort of PSD2. Where are you in terms of thinking through that as an opportunity or a threat? I mean, it sounds as though the application may be inconsistent, getting data might get -- extracting data may not be that easy. But your bank in theory looks like it's quite well positioned. So I'll be interested in your latest on that.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Who wants to have lunch today?</p><p>BRUCE ALLAN HAMILTON: And then the second question, maybe a slightly quicker one. On the payments business, Payvision, do you think that's sufficiently scaled and has the capability set to keep you competitive long term versus the likes of [add-in] and so forth? Or do you think you'll have to do more transactions perhaps to build further scale in that space?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: PSD2, by the way, maybe you can give them an update us to where we are?</p><p>ROEL M. M. LOUWHOFF: Yes. So thank you for the question, by the way, because PSD2 for us is one of those programs where actually you see that our platform strategy is delivering. And why is that? We have built a compliant PSD2 engine, which was one of the sort of 40%, 50% of banks that we're able to deliver last week to the first milestone you needed to deliver to across the board. So instead of delivering 19 engine in different countries, we just build 1. So that's the modular approach that we talked to, and it's working in practice. And you're absolutely right. For us, PSD2 is not just about being able to deliver towards what the law and regulation is asking us. We see it as a major opportunity, which you maybe saw as well in the movie that we had before where you saw information going outside of the bank and coming back inside the bank that will help our data strategy and to really make sure that we're going to deliver our customers going forward. So it's both aspects, and we're in the -- well on track and delivering exactly where we want to be.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Now I have particular views on PSD2, and I'm sure most of you know them. I support PSD2. We support PSD2. Because we do think it is good that you create that openness and that you create those options for your clients and your customers. Nevertheless, the way the PSD2 regulation has been enacted -- approved and enacted, is one that doesn't create a level playing field with some of the parties that want to play in the same league. And that is the point. So we were supportive because we think it will make people and, well, banks -- will make banks innovate more. Competition will increase from our challenger attitude. It really helps us, but it doesn't create a level playing field. Now what we are looking at and how we are discussing with, for example, Brussels, is that we feel that going forward, if it comes to the legal environment that makes you have to exchange data, that you should organize that around the type of data. What do I mean with that? Financial data have a specific value, so -- whereas behavioral data on a platform may have a different value. So if the deal in the PSD2 with regards to reciprocity is that if a platform player says, okay, I'll give you 6 months of behavioral data in exchange for 6 months of financial data, I may still not be happy because the behavioral data may be very unstructured data, may be not as valuable as the financial data. Having said that, it's -- in the end, it's the customer that is in charge. But from a player's perspective, I do think that you have to organize around the reciprocity around the different types of data. But the customer in charge, always a concentrate on a different approach to this.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: I will remember the fourth question and come back to you, but we don't want to keep people from lunch. So thank you very much for that. It was the Payvision one. I'll make sure we come back to that, yes?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Exactly. Okay, good.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: So thank you, everyone. Also for the audience in the webcast, we'll be back here, please, around 2. Thank you very much and enjoy lunch. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Welcome back, everyone. I hope you enjoyed that lunch and getting in touch with each other and talking. And nice to have had the time to engage with you as well. Welcome back also to our webcast audience.</p><p>Now for the second part of today's Investor Day, let me please invite to the stage our Chief Risk Officer, Steven.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Good. Well, good afternoon. I hope you had a fantastic lunch. And since you -- we need to energize you this afternoon, we're now going to talk about risk management. That should enliven you.</p><p>I, as a Chief Risk Officer, are here to protect the value and the reputation of the bank. It also means that financial risk and nonfinancial risk are equally important. In ING, the vast majority of our interactions is digital, and that basically means that people are looking at the screen and are looking at the logo. And they should be able to trust that logo. They should be able to trust that screen, and therefore they should also be able to trust our digital channels. In our day-to-day business, we are continuously focusing on nonfinancial risk, and that is supported -- oh, thank you. That is supported by our policy frameworks, our testing, and by innovation.</p><p>Now let me give you an example because here you see that screen, and here you see all the elements that we focus on when we focus on nonfinancial risk. One of the examples is how we manage IT risk. How do we now do that? If we provide an experience to the clients online and digital, it needs to be seamless, always on, 24/7, safely. And in that regards, we have 3 focus areas in IT risk to make sure that we can be always on.</p><p>The first one is operational resilience. In operational resilience, we need to make sure that, when something happens to one of our assets, other assets can take it over. And we do that by testing. So for example, we do a tests which we call the hole in the ground, and it basically means we shut down one data center to see if other data centers can take it over.</p><p>The second element is cybersecurity resilience, cybercrime resilience. You've all heard of cybercrime, DDoS attacks. And also there we perform tests. We have wise, hooded hackers who hack our premises. We measure and monitor the traffic. We blacklist traffic. We have red and blue teams who play, let's say, cybersecurity war games against each other, one defender, one attacker.</p><p>And the third one is our data privacy, like you will all have on your computers where you have children filters, spend filters. Or for example, we also use spend filters and security filters. And we also look at strange patterns of traffic to then see why that traffic is there so we have to analyze and we can prevent the attacks and respond to strange traffic that we see in our network. That's how we manage IT risk because the target is to be always on.</p><p>Moving on to credit risk. If you look at our risk-weighted assets, the vast majority is for credit risk, almost 90%. A bit over 10% is nonfinancial risk, and 2% is trading risk. And what you need to remember from all the presentation that I'm going to give you right now is 3 things. We have clear policies and discipline. That's number one. Number two is that we compartmentalize and we diversify. And the third one is that we do credit management proactively and with personal accountability. Those elements, you will hear continuously when I go through the slides.</p><p>Let's first move to credit risk. In 2016, in the Investor Day, we promised you a diversification of our credit risk. And that's what we've done. We've grown the credit risk book. But we've grown it away from mortgages, albeit that we grew in mortgages, but we also grew in consumer lending and SME and with corporate lending. Consumer lending, albeit still small, grew with 50% over the past 4 years.</p><p>We also diversified in terms of geography. So where, in 2014, over 40% came from retail lending in the Netherlands, that has gone down to a bit over 30% to have a better balance between geographies when we lend.</p><p>I see a number of familiar faces. And I've spoken to a few of you also during the lunch break, but when I go on road show, many of you ask questions about wholesale credit risk. Hence, that's what we're going to spend a bit of time on right now.</p><p>In Wholesale Banking credit risk, we work with clear advertise statements. And those advertise statements make sure, and here we go again, compartmentalize and diversify. We compartmentalize on clients. So we set maximum limits on particular clients. We set limits on sectors. We set limits on countries. That's the first thing that we do. The second thing that we do is that we are nimble. We are making sure that we introduce caps on books at that point in time that we think we should do so. And you can argue about whether we are on top of the cycle or not, but at this point in time, not many of you will argue with me that at least we are at an up in the cycle. And it basically means that we are introducing caps on our cyclical books, and therefore we've introduced caps on real estate finance and leveraged finance.</p><p>The third element is that we closed down or exited activities that are not fit for purpose within our risk appetite. So we've exited real estate development. We've exited real estate investment management for the simple reason that a lot of the risk had to do with construction risk, and construction risk is very hard to manage. It's not typically that the bank understands.</p><p>We also exited our lease portfolio in Italy. So here you see a few examples of how we proactively manage a couple of the books that are not fit within the risk appetite that we have.</p><p>And then last but not least, personal accountability. For each and every deal in Wholesale Banking, they're a sign-off by someone in risk management, and they're a sign-off of someone in the front office. If that deal does not perform, we will look at the responsibility of the persons involved in the deal, most notably the front office. And we can apply measures also in variable remuneration also a number of years back to keep ourselves honest.</p><p>Then looking at Wholesale Banking as a whole. If you can't convince them, confuse them: 4 pie charts and many colors. But basically this picture shows how we diversify, diversification in different businesses but also within the different geographies. Now in Europe it is quite well balanced between the different products, with a larger share in General Lending. It is lending unsecured for corporates. In the United States or in the Americas, it's largely focused on project finance because that is a very big and mature market in secured lending and project finance. And on Asia we focus on shorter-term loans, and you see that at your right-hand side of the screen, whereby in the middle section of the pie chart you see a lighter-color gray which basically shows you that many of our loans, more than half of our loans, have maturity dates shorter than 1 year. And that has to do with the fact that many of these loans are trade loans, LCs, guarantees, self-liquidating transportation loans.</p><p>If you then look at the structures of our deals. We like our senior structures. We like senior loans. Therefore, over 99% of our loans is senior. Over 99% is senior. We also like security. Hence, 2/3 of our loans are secured either partially or fully, and what does that lead to? That leads, at least through the cycle, to relatively moderate risk costs. And you see that in the business that I just spoke about, amongst others, General Lending, but also real estate finance. And although IFRS 9, which started from early 2018, will cause a bit of additional fluctuation and a bit of front-running of risk costs in times when economic circumstances deteriorate, at the same point in time, we are focused on keeping those risk costs moderate through the cycle. And my role is yet to shave off those peaks, to keep those peaks limited; and again we do that by compartmentalization and diversification.</p><p>It does not always go right. Sometimes, a loan is deteriorating in profile. That means that you need to act swiftly. Because we are senior and because we have long-standing relationships with our clients, we can act very swiftly. So we act already upon early warning signals, whether these are digital early warning signals or off-line early warning signals when talking to our clients. We act when they go in watch lists, which is a portfolio that doesn't perform as we thought they would do. So there is a risk of nonrepayment. We act when clients go into forbearance, which is a time that we need to extend the loans, for example, because we see they are unable to repay the cash flows within the time limits that is originally set. And of course, we act when they go into credit restructuring. And a proof point is that in 75% of the cases of clients that went into restructuring, there was 0 loss, not for the clients, not for ING. A second proof point is, and I'm pointing to the prudence that we apply in our provisioning, that our provisioning is outweighing the write-offs over the past 10 years that we needed to do, which is a good sign.</p><p>Now I've basically told you how we manage our framework, how we deal with individual exposures, how we compartmentalize, how we diversify, how we are proactive in case a loan is deteriorating, but always the proof is in the pudding. So what do you then do on particular portfolios?</p><p>So I've highlighted here 4 portfolios, and I would like to ask you at least because I'm going to discuss one portfolio with you. The other ones, you can also see in the presentation that you have been receiving as of this morning, but I would like to discuss with you at least one portfolio. So by a show of hands -- this is we are very digital, but now we're not. By a show of hands, who would like to talk about the leveraged loan portfolio?</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Oh, wow. I don't need to go any further. So it's done. So that's good. You think you don't have any other portfolios. Yes, I do, but -- and so I will do leveraged finance portfolio. So</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>sponsors, largely [in developed] markets who also have a track record of being able to restore value from their -- for themselves but also for the bank in case there is an issue with one other assets. So we do sponsor selection. Secondly, we are making sure that we build up a granular book. So if you look, of the average size on exposure in leveraged loans, that is typically private equity owning a company whereby we then issue a loan to them, on average our final takes are EUR 25 million; and in all kinds of industries, as you see on the bottom right-hand side of the page, so there is limited correlation risk. What we have done and what I just talked about, but let me reiterate that point, we have kept the leveraged finance book because in the end these are cyclical assets because the leverage is relatively big.</p><p>So we've kept the book at EUR 9.6 billion aggregate, of which EUR 8.4 billion is outstanding. We've also kept the final take that people can -- that clients can take, which is EUR 25 million, no more than EUR 25 million. We have kept the leverage to 6.5x total average, and we basically do not do single underwritings. So if we underwrite a loan because that's where the risk initiates before it is sold to the market, before you get to your final take, you want to make sure that you're not out there alone. That's how we manage the leveraged finance book.</p><p>Again, let me reiterate, we focus on strong policies, frameworks and discipline. We focus on compartmentalization and diversification. We focus on proactive steering, with huge knowledge of our businesses, and we apply personal accountability and responsibility.</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p><p>Mark?</p><p>MARK MILDERS: I would like now to invite Isabel Fernandez to the stage.</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN, HEAD OF WHOLESALE BANKING &amp; MEMBER OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD BANKING, ING GROEP N.V.: Does the mic work? I think so. A very good afternoon to all of you.</p><p>My name is Isabel Fernandez, and I have the immense pleasure of leading ING's wholesale bank. I'll give you a bit of personal background. I haven't met many of you. So I'm half Dutch, half Spanish. I guess that explains the accent. I grew up, in my childhood, all over the world, North America, Latin America and Europe. And by the time I was a teenager, I'd been to 8 different schools in different continents. And in my career I've worked across Continental Europe, the U.K. and the United States. A large part of my career, I spent working for GE Capital, where I was -- had the privilege of being at the forefront of a lot of change.</p><p>So what I picked up during those professional and personal experiences is that change is not just about what you do but also about how you think, so I want to take you to what we've been up to in the Wholesale Bank since my arrival; trying to prepare ourselves for the world of tomorrow, one of inevitable change.</p><p>So the Wholesale Bank was built on a couple of core strengths, first and foremost, the conservative risk profile that Steven talked about and Ralph talked about. And what's unique about us is that we have sector expertise in both the first and second lines of defense. And we have indeed risk awareness in the first line.</p><p>The second thing we do well, we do across 40 countries helping our clients and serving them wherever they need us.</p><p>And finally, we have a comparatively lean cost structure that really puts us among the world's best class Wholesale Banks.</p><p>So what did it get us? It got us solid underlying profit and growing ROE and particularly, that last one, the ROE, continues to be of core focus in the years to come. But what got us here doesn't necessarily get us there, and that's -- as Ralph explained, there's continuous change, whether it's customer demand, whether it's technology, whether it's regulation.</p><p>So what have we done since I arrived? In early 2018, we made a number of changes in our strategic review, and the first thing we looked at was our clients. And we learned from our Net Promoter Score, the satisfaction that our clients give us and tell us about, when we learned that they only focus on a few key things that they really, really appreciate about us, and the first one is our consistency; the second one is ease of doing business, they love a proactive approach; and finally, they appreciate our ability to tailor and customize solutions.</p><p>So I'm really proud of the fact that we're seen as very client focused, but we need to do more. And we need to focus on our primary clients, not being everything to everyone but really looking at where there's mutual benefit.</p><p>The second thing we need to do is build on our foundation, and our foundation starts with truly and deeply knowing our customer. We are a first line of defense. We [better] make that an essential part of protecting our bank. We need to increase our service, and we need to be able to push and continue the efficiencies to ensure that we have that cost structure that we are so well known for.</p><p>Now our sector knowledge runs deep. You heard it a couple of times today. And our sector knowledge runs very deep, but we don't always use it to maximize the value to our clients. So by integrating and institutionalizing the knowledge that we have, we believe we're much better able to serve them.</p><p>The network needs to be simple. Access needs to be easy. It doesn't matter whether you're a CFO or a Treasurer, you want to make sure that it's instant and seamless across the world, and that's what we need to push for big time.</p><p>And finally, we believe in open banking, radically improve and making banking easier. So let me get into a couple of these.</p><p>First of all, the primary client. So how do you increase the value to your clients? Well, it starts by focus. You need to develop and nurture these primary relationships. And you know these primary relationships are, in all respects, much more attractive than a lot of our active clients. And our definition of a primary client is one that has and does business with us on more than one product and in more than one market. And you could look at this page and say, \"God, 16%, Isabel, isn't that really low?\" And I'm looking at it and thinking, \"Gosh, imagine the opportunity of the 84% and turning those into primary clients.\"</p><p>But then also on the active clients, there are many of them that just buy one product from us, and those clients are still very valuable. They're very valuable to the extent they're very profitable, and we will continue to serve there on their product or on their deal. But to the extent our active clients show us that they're not profitable, there's not a lot of potential and we do not have a lot of mutual benefit, we will reallocate the capital to other parts of the business.</p><p>So here, you see in numbers what I just pointed out. On pretty much every metric, a primary client is much more attractive than an active client, and so we keep pushing for that. But one of the most interesting things is when you look at the bottom right of this chart. In a year of unprecedented change where we changed our organization and our approach to clients, not only did we grow our Net Promoter Score by 14% across the Wholesale Bank, but you can see here, we grew it by 24% in our primary clients. And so the trick is not just to grow the number of primary clients but also to ensure that, that NPS keeps going up.</p><p>Now client satisfaction starts with service and service delivery, and you'll see here our transformation program. That's all about doubling down on the service we give to our clients, ensuring that the delivery is standardized across the globe and simplified and that we speed up our way of working. And a lot of people think that standardization and simplification means that the clients don't like it. Well, guess what, in a lot of the industries that we work with, our clients start doing exactly the same. They are standardizing and they're simplifying and they'd much rather have us offer a similar -- a solution across the globe than to try to do complex things in any one market.</p><p>Agile, you can see here at the bottom, we've introduced across 4,500 employees. That, to our knowledge, is unprecedented, and we do this globally. And why do we do this? Because we believe that in a world of tomorrow, you have to be light on your feet, fast to respond to what's happening around you. And if there's one thing I want you to take away from this page is that our Wholesale TOM program supported us big time in reducing our cost-to-income ratio, excluding regulatory cost, from 47.2 in 2014 to 44.4 in 2018, and we will continue to push to be best-in-class here.</p><p>So turning to sectors. A lot of traditional banks push products to clients, and it's been quite effective for a long time. But you know what? In a world of commoditization of products, it doesn't work anymore. You can't differentiate on that basis. So what are we doing? We're looking at the client and finding that they deeply care about working with a partner who understands their business and the challenges and opportunities of their sectors? And so what we've done is we narrowed our entire organization so that it mirrors the client sectors, the main ones that we play in, and uses that knowledge that we have in their support.</p><p>So the core of our strategy is to build a client-centric, product-agnostic, sector-specific organization. Now if we're brutally honest, there's an issue. We built enormous sector expertise over decades and decades. But if we're really honest to ourselves, we've primarily developed this sector expertise to assess and take credit risk. And we're really good at it, and we continue to want to be good at it.</p><p>However, if you want to maximize the value delivered to your clients, you'd better build on that expertise and use it also to support your clients and their ambitions. And that's exactly what we're doing. Ultimately, this will grow more primary clients, empower their decision-making and ensure that we do more cross-buy and increase our fees.</p><p>So I told you that our network -- our clients, really like our network, and here's how we operate it. We have virtual client teams across the globe comprised of all the skills needed to service a client, yet you will never ever see us try to maximize market share in any individual business or in any individual country. We don't care about league tables. We care about servicing our client across a number of markets, allowing us to find the places where we deliver the value that they need and having an honest conversation with the client that I certainly could do this for you in this market but you're better off taking my neighbor in another market.</p><p>Here is what that diversification strategy has resulted in. Our clients like it. This is essential to our business. So I'd like to take you briefly through the process with a little video to show how you will -- we operate and practice.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN: So I see about 300 clients a year, and they always talk about how this works, but it's particularly for us, a very consistent approach and one that keeps us have real good control, both over the profitability as well as over the risk side of that.</p><p>So where does it leave us for the world of tomorrow? Clearly, the Wholesale Bank is entirely in line with the strategy of the overall company. But there's a bunch of inputs on this page and there's really one output. If there's one metric we deeply care about, it's ROE. And as we reduce the growth of our assets, we'll have to be much more frugal about resources and capital allocation, and we need to make sure that every euro counts. And the elephant in the room is obvious. It's Basel IV and TRIM, and we want to ensure that whatever we do, we deliver for you, our shareholders, the return you're looking [from us].</p><p>So I'll dive deeply -- briefly into 2 areas: regulatory headwinds and financial markets. RWA will go up. It's my job and our job in the business to do everything we can to reduce some of that by taking smart actions, and RWA will go up through TRIM and likely Basel IV. But I want to say something on Basel IV.</p><p>Given the fact that, that directive is still being worked on and being changed, we've got to be a little bit careful of taking action on businesses that might look unprofitable or unattractive under Basel IV because you don't want to regret that you've done that right now and then find that later on, there's changes to the directive.</p><p>But TRIM will come first, so there's no regret moves now, and we gradually get better at the other things. And I also want to point out here that our institution hasn't been at the management of the balance sheet as much as some other companies, so there's real upside there. But let me start with some real sort of no-regret moves.</p><p>Tanate talked briefly about clients and ratings. If I just take the top 10 clients that we have in our Wholesale Bank that are not rated and support them with getting an external rating, it saves me EUR 2 billion in RWA. That sounds like a pretty much a no-regret move.</p><p>If I look at the collateral that we have, there's different types of collateral, and some receive much more fair and much more favorable treatment. So why not use our structuring and work with our clients to ensure that our positions are such that I'm in a better position at a lower RWA?</p><p>We have also some data points where you want to make sure that you're really accurate by putting into your systems every point that comes from the treatment of RWA. And then we started the disintermediation game. I think Tanate talked a little bit about that. There's more and more to be done there. We have opportunities to look for significant risk transfers and to do a number of things that really make the use of our capital less.</p><p>Ultimately, half of our book reprice is before Basel IV and really, that is what we're having the teams focus on. So the hurdle rates have been upped, 13.5% Core Equity Tier 1 is in there, through the cycle risk costs are in there. So the teams need to go out and bring us good business.</p><p>Now as to financial markets, on the top left of this page here, you can see how we have really used the RWAs in financial market and reduced the RWA density. And this is a real testament to the team and financial markets by really dropping the amount of capital that they consume.</p><p>They've also reduced the front office cost and the front office head count, and we're working very hard together to try to find a way to look at operating expenses. And let me be very clear about one thing. Financial Markets is an essential part of our business. It helps us to manage market risk. It helps our clients both in the Wholesale Bank as well as beyond, to be able to manage their risks. And they stood us in good stead when markets were bad and when bad times were tough. So the question not is, are you in Financial Markets? The question is, how can we be most efficiently in Financial Markets?\" And that's really what we're working on.</p><p>So turning to the last 2 points here is one on innovation. We build, partner and acquire. We're totally open towards what it is that it takes to change our company and to change our Wholesale Bank and to build a better, smarter, faster, cheaper wholesale company. Bank Mendes Gans and Katana are 2 examples inside our company where we show that we can deliver fees and we can innovate for our own sake as well as for that of our clients.</p><p>In the trade space, Ralph talked about or distributed ledger technology or blockchain team. It is considered world class among the 5 corporates in the world, with the likes of IBM and Alibaba and others, really in terms of blockchain technology. And we use it, particularly in our trade and commodity business, to find ways to reduce the operating expenses that our clients have in our value chain. And we believe that a mature blockchain, plus a core infrastructure, can take up to 30% of operating cost out of the value chain in trade. And that's the kind of stuff our clients expect from us.</p><p>The acquisition on Payvision. Payvision is a PSP that really is forward thinking and helps our clients connect the online and the off-line part of their companies and we learned a ton from them. And what's beautiful about this PSP is really linked to our client base and they can add value there.</p><p>Ralph talked about sustainability, really the last piece of what I wanted to tell you. It starts with our own accountability. Terra is what we launched and I -- back in September in San Francisco. I announced it at the Global Climate Action Summit, and it talks about how we hold ourselves accountable, measuring in a smart and scientific way, through each of our sectors, what technological change needs to happen in order for us to align ourselves with the Paris Climate Agreement.</p><p>And what it does is it engages a conversation with a client, and out of that comes a lot of business because they tell us, \"Why don't you help us finding ways to become more sustainable? And let's figure out what investments we need to make.\" But the market itself, which we were on much earlier than many, is growing like weeds. $220 billion according to Bloomberg just in 2018. The majority of this is still green bonds and green loans, but it is a growing market. And sustainability for us is not a nice-to-have, it's a must-have.</p><p>So I've given you a lot of information and it's all there online. But in summary, I just want to let you know, our core strategy is client-centric, product-agnostic, sector-specific, double-down on the client experience and innovate for the world of tomorrow. Thank you.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Steven, will you please join us?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MARK MILDERS: So thank you very much, Isabel. And Steven is coming on stage right now for a Q&amp;A on the topic of risk management and Wholesale Banking. So any questions from the audience, please? Gentleman there in the middle, please.</p><p>BART JOORIS, ANALYST, BANQUE DEGROOF PETERCAM S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: Bart Jooris, Degroof Petercam. Question for the both of you actually. Have you checked whether or not your mostly Benelux clients are Brexit ready or have you helped them to become more Brexit ready? Could you give us some of your findings there?</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Yes. Well, I mean, first of all, but this was already a while ago, we've done some stress tests. First of all, we looked at how much exposure do our clients have on the U.K., and that is mainly in the SME and mid-corps spheres in the Netherlands and Belgium but also Wholesale Banking clients as well as U.K. clients that are largely dependent on our support for them in the U.K. And then we've stress-tested that. What you clearly see is as the dependency that our clients in general have on the U.K. is fairly limited, but that's from a firm point of view. Other than that, we have been in discussions with many of our clients already for many months to see what they can do to protect our risks. So I think we have it relatively well under control.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Thank you, Steven. Gentleman in the back, please.</p><p>ANDREAS THOMAE: It's Andreas Thomae from Deka Investment. A question to you, Isabel. The risk-weighted asset efficiency, we saw a slide how you want to produce results. But how do you deal with originate-to-distribute model? So could you enhance the efficiency by distributing out deals because other players are much more successful in it? First question. The second is Financial Markets. It's an unprofitable business at ING, even though it seems to be necessary for clients. So you have shown a slide, revenue's up, costs are down, so what are the ROE targets on a 13.5% Core Tier 1?</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN: Okay. Well, first of all, you're absolutely spot-on in terms of OTD, right? The idea is that if there's portions of the balance sheet that are less attractive for you to hold, you should find a partner who you work with to hold that for you or with you. And I will say one thing, we're not a bank who brings business in and then sells everything off. Our clients expect a certain alignment of us with them. But the amounts you hold clearly are different. And in terms of origination, we started back in -- about a year ago or so, we started our balance sheet management team who looks at 3 individual things. One is, how can you take an individual transaction where your client is up against a certain limit and how do you help them and the company protect against more exposure on the individual one. Number two, how do you look at an entire asset class and look at what you can do to find ways to come up with a proposition that's better. And then finally, which is the piece that I said other banks have been more focused on, is how can you look at your entire balance sheet and see which portion of what I'm holding today is not as attractive. And so either you accelerate off-boarding of clients, where we've agreed that there is [none with] mutual interest or you look at parts of your balance sheet that are more attractive to somebody else. As to Financial Markets, if I commit to an ROE of 10% to 12%, I do that on behalf of the Wholesale Bank, and each and every one of these parts needs to contribute to that. That doesn't mean that every individual part of the business needs to be at exactly the same return. And SM is going through a tough time, partially because of low interest rate environment. So what I'm trying to do is to make sure that the mix of the 3 gets an outcome that is really attractive to you as our shareholders. I'd say one thing, I didn't touch enough on the revenue side of the Financial Markets business. We have figured out that if you just look at our fair share, I don't even need to compete with anybody large out there, if I just look at my fair share of the business, so I have a small portion of a loan, can I get a small portion of the fees that are correlated with Financial Markets that I have a 20% higher revenue by 2021. So you just look at -- we need to integrate this business more so that Financial Markets works in tandem with wherever we put our loans out.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Yes. And perhaps, if I may add, another measure that was introduced already 2 years ago is that everything that we did and was presumed to be beyond to Basel IV implementation, we've already been pricing that off the 13.5%. And a large part of Isabel's business in the Wholesale Bank is a professional market player where we have proven to be able to reprice. So that's part of the other income effect I would like to highlight. Next question, please.</p><p>RAUL SINHA, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. Isabel, can I ask you to talk a little bit about the funding strategy of the Wholesale Bank? Do you look at it from a sort of singular Wholesale Bank funding perspective? Because if I look at the deposit base of the Wholesale Bank, it actually hasn't grown at all since 2016. I think you mentioned cash management over there. Could you talk a little bit about the initiatives? And how do you position yourself for a cycle where wholesale funding costs are going up as we can see from the market spreads? So what are the mitigating actions you can take as a management team to not get that effect on ROE?</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN: Okay, okay. I think Steven is very eager to go first. I'll go after you.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: That is a great question, and so I'll take the first question. No, so we do not look at our funding strategy from a single or business point of view. We look at the entire business, which is then comprised of our deposit gathering that we have in many countries in our retail side, our deposit gathering that we have on the wholesale side and then our longer-term Wholesale Banking or shorter-term Wholesale Banking loans that we get from the market and also from our counterparties. Typically, what you see in Wholesale Banking in terms of corporate deposits, they are relatively seen as not being sticky. So yes, we use Wholesale Banking as a funding mechanism. But if you then look at longer-term loans and you want to, let's say, match asset and liabilities, those parts of the balance sheet are less useful from a funding perspective, but they are being used.</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN: We do have -- we're -- Steven and I and all the board members are in the ALCO as well, and which is where we, on a monthly basis, look, of course, at what are the costs of funding, what are we bringing in, et cetera, et cetera. The second one was around costs. And remind me again, Mark, you heard the second part of the question around costs?</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Second one was on cash management.</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN: Yes. I mean, [pains] in cash management. I talked briefly about BMG, right, for our clients, right? They are in net -- cash pooling and netting. That's what they do. We have -- let's say, our transaction services business that does a lot of payments in cash management, for quite some time was not operating at the level we wanted to and it started charging fees, and that's been a very attractive strategy. So they've been performing and they will continue to perform. They bought Payvision on the payment side as well. I think just -- I'm quite optimistic about our business on the cash management and the payment side. I think we will have a lot more opportunity to grow there compared to the others. Anything you want to add there, Mark?</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Did that answer your question?</p><p>RAUL SINHA: Maybe to follow up. How do you allocate the funding cost to the Wholesale Bank when the deposits have being generated in the Retail Bank? I guess, the heart of the question is, funds transfer pricing. And are you taking the market spreads and applying that? And if that is the case, then you could argue that through the cycle, the Wholesale Bank probably needs to cover a higher cost of funding. And that's essentially the part of the question I was trying to get at is, how sensitive are you to the market?</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN: The FTP is one area. I will tell you what I'm doing at my end most importantly, right? So we have a global business, and you can allocate to different sectors. So that green light committee that you saw there, that is where we look. And we have a hurdle, which we use on the base of what we call internally [sanity] checks, but they ensure that each individual transaction and the client relationship that we have, hurdles across above the 10% ROE, taking into account our 13.5% Core Equity Tier 1 and the -- through the cycle risk cost as well as an allocation of cost. So we very much, on a transaction-by-transaction, client-by-client basis, allocate and ensure that we have the right spreads. Now the typical conversation to be had with the front office is, well, if I have to do this transaction, what else is there? If it's a little below hurdle, how much time is it going to take you? And in that, we take into account what other commitments there are. Then when we have leaders, individual transactions where we say, this is not going anywhere, we then look at balance sheet management to see are there ways to end this relationship and generally speaking, on the average life that we have with our clients, you're able to do that. That's kind of very much -- we have global FTPs and then transaction-by-transaction, client-by-client profitability measures and hurdles.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Maybe I need to come back to your -- the first part of your question, the FTP also applies for the bank all across. So basically, it's an internal transfer mechanism whereby on the one hand we look at, what are the cost of funds that we need to pay for our liabilities, we passed those on as a revenue to our liability generators. And then we look at, what are the costs of those liabilities plus the cost for our wholesale funding and that we manage to come to an internal transfer pricing mechanism for all of the bank, not for only Wholesale Banking.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Sorry. Here, the gentleman in the front.</p><p>ADRIAN CIGHI, EQUITY ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Adrian Cighi from RBC. Just one follow-up question on the leveraged loans presentation you had. What indicators would you look at to potentially lower that cap, the $9.6 billion or the 6.5% leverage since we're, as you said, probably coming to the end of this cycle?</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Yes. So what we look at all the time is, what are the leverage levels in the market? Are they going further beyond the 6.5%? What is the tenor that the loans are going for? So are they going much beyond 6 or 7 years? And what does the pricing do? But we look at these books and at -- come again back to the compartmentalization, is that when you then look at, okay, if you come to a downside, what would be the maximum loss that I could sustain from an overall P&amp;L or balance sheet point of view. That's the way we sell our cash for these books. But if -- and what you -- what we probably typically do is that if these leverage levels go even further or -- and if the pricing does not start to creep up, then we will further curtail.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Alicia?</p><p>ALICIA MARIANNE CHUNG: So a couple of themes that seem to keep coming up is, first of all, that we are now moving into a slower growth environment for ING and moving past the peak of the cycle in a sense. And secondly, that we are also now moving into a phase where capital requirements are going up and you're trying to mitigate that with various actions. With that in mind, the cost of risk as a percentage of RWA's guidance seems a little bit outdated. Are you able to give that now as a percentage of loans instead because that might be a bit of a cleaner view of -- cleaner way of looking at it? And even more helpfully, could you give us a view of what that might look like over the next couple of years?</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: I will answer part of your question, and then I will defer to Mark. So when it comes to the guidance for our cost of risk through the cycle, we've always said that our risk costs on average risk cycle are 40 to 45 basis points. Now that is an average. And it's basically an average based on what we've seen over the past couple of cycles. That is not how we directly see our balance sheet because those we see are on the risk appetite statements and the measures that I've shown you on the compartmentalization and the drivers of risk that I presented half an hour ago. So that's how we do that. Like I've said before and we have been over the cycle, on average, we have risks of 40 to 45 basis points. We've seen now couple of years of lower risk costs than the average in the cycle. If you see the risk costs -- sorry, if you see Basel IV working with higher risk rates, indeed, then that can have an impact on the average. And that's what we're -- that's why we're currently looking at, how we can best represent the risk costs overall. Mark?</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Yes. We have discussed that with many of you in the past. And I think the moment of -- or the period of rapid balance sheet change that we went through as a company has basically come to a slow. So the need to have it on RWA in a dynamic balance sheet is less urgent, and we do agree that a guidance more on a basis points over loan book or client outstandings is more relevant and also makes it easier comparable as it is an industry standard. We felt it was a right one where we were transforming. But as of the first quarter of 2019, so in 2 weeks' time, we'll start preparation for that one. We'll also show you the guidance also across the cycle based on the basis points of the loan book. The gentleman in the back had a question.</p><p>JASON KALAMBOUSSIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RESEARCH, KBC SECURITIES NV, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jason Kalamboussis, KBC. The first question is on real estate finance. On Page 13, the first thing, it is -- what would -- how do you see -- I mean, do you see -- what would make you start thinking about reducing the exposure there? And the other thing more specifically on what do you think about the Belgian market because it seems that one of your peers and not us has mentioned that the market is about EUR 60 billion and that you have quite a big market share in there, so I would be interested in your comment. The second thing is on Germany. In Germany, we have had a very good growth that has come also because you repatriated businesses from different areas to Germany as you concentrated your project finance on the sectors. So if we -- has that finished? And how can we relate the pure growth in Germany aside of this repatriation, if you want? And also, what about -- is that the main and the core element of your growth in Wholesale Banking or is there another element just so that they...</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN: I'll talk about Germany, do you want to go first.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Okay. Thank you. So on real estate finance, we have already put a cap on that book, which is a bit over EUR 35 billion. What would change -- I mean, and we look at different elements. We look at tenors, we look at loan to values, we look at pricing, we look at covers that we have. We look at DSCR as -- or how much cash flow do we get over the particular loan. Now if that further starts to move in a negative direction with, for example, slower GDP growth or higher unemployment, which are 2 elements that have an impact on the real estate book, that may then lead to further measures. At this point in time, we said, we want to cap it. If we want to do more, we need to sell tranches through the vintages because typically, vintages, earlier in the cycle, are better priced and therefore, for the same, actually, maybe a better type of risk, you get paid better. So if we want to do more, it basically means you have to sell through the vintage or through vintages with different years to sell assets to be able to complement. If these elements will start to change, I would have to look at it again. With regards to Belgium, yes, we have a reasonable market share as opposed to other parts of Europe that has not been a large correction in the Belgian market. That's why we do not only steer on loan to value here because loan to value also goes up in times of economic progress, and it could be mistaken because then suddenly, if there's a big calibration, then that loan-to-value would turn out to be much worse than you initially thought. But we also look at cash flow capabilities of the tenants at hands, distribution of rents and the weighted average life expectancy of the rents to make sure that we have more legs to stand on.</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN: As to Germany, Germany is a really important market to us. You're absolutely right, some businesses we've run out of Germany and to be honest, we are quite agnostic. I'm particularly from my perspective, quite agnostic where I book specific business in the world, right? We have, for instance, our structured export finance book that is based in Germany. And yes, because we were gathering a lot of deposits here in the local market, we had a great opportunity to book assets on this balance sheet. But there's also an interesting point when you look at our position in Germany itself. We're not a huge player in Germany on the wholesale side like we are on the retail side. So there certainly is growth. And whether it is having businesses here that operate out of here and book on our German balance sheet or whether it's just working for the local German market, both are really growth areas. So within EMEA, I would think that Germany is clearly one of the growth areas. But what I try to point out a couple of times is that I try not to look at any individual domestic markets to capture market share locally. I see these opportunities, but our whole point is to try to look at -- have a global business with a global sector strategy approach and find in the markets the transactions and the opportunities with your clients that are attractive. That's kind of how we think about it. I'm not -- I don't think that's how Nick thinks about it, but we do.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: By the way, we haven't stopped the centralization of these loans in Germany. We still have that vehicle. So whenever we need to book assets there from other areas, we will do so.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Nick, one final question before we go to the break.</p><p>NICK DAVEY: It's Nick Davey from Redburn. I'll try 2 actually, quick ones. The first one is, you've talked a bit about funding already, but I didn't hear any mention about the dollar funding of the Wholesale Banks. So are you near or at saturation for long-term dollar funding needs? And the second question would be how much risk-weighted asset inflation are you expecting in the Wholesale Bank for everything that you've talked about, more allocated capital, TRIM and Basel, because the idea of doing stable return on allocated capital if RWA is going up 25% seems quite ambitious? So just to try to scale that impact.</p><p>M. ISABEL FERNANDEZ NIEMANN: Yes. Let me start with that second one and you can -- we can talk both about -- or all 3 of us about the funding. So in terms of RWA, I think we've given guidance, what, 15% to 18% company-wide for RWA, and it will go up. What I'm trying to explain is that there are really a number of areas where it's coming down. So we've got about, what, [EUR 151 billion] or so, of RWAs, give or take, and I think that will go up in line with what we look at in the company. But what -- my job to do is, is to look at the areas within our RWA that really, we made the decision on a while ago and you're actually thinking that is somewhat wasteful. There are other areas. I'll give you another example. We have our Italian lease portfolio that we have announced that we will -- that we're about to sell. That in itself releases EUR 800 million of RWA this year. So it's a question of just working on all these individual pieces and then figure out how much you can afford. One thing ultimately in the end is repricing and making sure that your profit's there. And starting January, we have started to ensure that our origination takes into account a higher cost. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about it, the 15%. We have TRIM towards the end of next year and next year. Basel IV is really much further away. And I'm looking at taking as much of that RWA growth and find other ways to compensate for that, and I think there is. Anything you want to add?</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Yes, I think especially with pricing of -- Nick and I know each other, so Nick has asked this question before. So we've also answered it before but -- so the first answer is, yes, there will be impact on some portfolios more than in others. And we've said on some parts of structured finance and some parts of FI, there can be -- we can expect potentially more impacts. And then [in detail], what Isabel says, the question is, can we reprice? And that's what we currently are doing, to say, okay, we need to reprice. If we cannot reprice to meet our returns, we will diminish the business. If we can reprise, we will continue, but that goes for parts. With regards to funding on the U.S. dollar, I think also we've mentioned that before, yes, there are limitations about what we currently can do. We have, on the one side, we have the wholesale markets with which we get funding. We have our core deposits that we get funding with and we have our euro-dollar swaps. And if you now look at a number of these elements, we're nearing the levels that we can do this with -- at least sustainably can do this with. So we've also put caps on that, so that will impact the growth in the U.S. dollar business.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Okay. Isabel, Steven, thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got half an hour break to reconvene here at quarter to, please. Thank you very much.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK: Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Welcome back, everyone. For this last part of today, we have 3 presenters. We've got Ignacio Vilar, we have Roland Boekhout and Aris Bogdaneris to tell you and show you what it actually means in this new world, what it means when you're digital, but even more important, where we're going when it's mobile. Because on a mobile, to interact with a client, to build a relationship and actually have a commercial relationship is something that few do better than we do. To show you how that is done, may I please invite Ignacio Vilar to the stage. Thank you.</p><p>IGNACIO JULI\u00c3\u00a1 VILAR, HEAD OF RETAIL, ING GROEP N.V.: Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you had a great break, and you still have some energy for what is left. My name is Ignacio, Ignacio Vilar, and I've been responsible for the retail segment for the last 3 years. Before that, I was Chief Innovation Officer of the group, and I was also running the retail business in Poland and in Spain.</p><p>In this section, I want to answer one of the questions that you have been asking us over the last 4 years since we started the Think Forward strategy, that is how customer focus really drives value through this organization and why are we so obsessed with bringing [broadband] customers to this organization. And this is the area that I want to focus today.</p><p>We talked about becoming the go-to place for financial needs and beyond for our customers. And when we are focused, actually we do a pretty good job. So at the end of last year, we reached 12.5 million customers that were using ING for most of their financial needs. This is, give or take, 50% growth vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis 4 years before because we have been adding 1 million customers every year through this journey, really using ING every time they think of their need in their financial industries.</p><p>Where does value come? And this is the formula we have used already today, stressed by Ralph, also by Isabel. At the end, value comes from how many customers we have; how engaged, digitally engaged they are with the bank, so this is a primary bank relationship; and how many products they have per customer; and at the end, what is the value of the products and the services that we sell.</p><p>But of course, there's something that has changed because this was also true 5 years ago or 10 years ago when we were talking about banking. And this is, the way the customers interact with the banks have drastically changed. So the key question here is what do we need to do to have this digital engagement with our customers, to have a personal relationship with our customers in a digital world. If we think about ING, and these are the numbers that we have at the end of the last quarter, already 26% of the customers, they only use this device when they interact with the bank. How many of you only use the mobile to interact with a bank? Please raise your hand.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>IGNACIO JULI\u00c3\u00a1 VILAR: It's more or less the same numbers that we have. It would be 1/4. This is actually asking -- we need to ask ourselves a lot of questions. Are we able to have a mobile-only relationship with our customers? Do we have all the products? Do we have all the services? Do we do it in a super-easy way so that the customers can serve themselves? Do we have the call center? Do we have the branches adapted, having all the information, all the knowledge about the customers to be able to share them when they really have a moment of truth? So these are the questions and the [home works] that we do have as an organization if we want to be successful.</p><p>But there's one element because that's thinking from the bank, when we think from the customer is, can we fulfill their expectations? Because their expectations, let's be honest, they are not driven by us. Their expectations are driven by the big techs that have been working already much longer than us on moving first to digital and then to mobile. And this has been stressed already today: all their experience are personal, are instant, are relevant, are seamless. And this is what the customers expect also from a banking relationship. And there's a lot that has to be done if we want to be successful. We truly need to transform the way we are running our organization.</p><p>And for that, what we need, in an essence, is to reinforce what we call the virtuous circle of engagement. Because we will know if we are successful at the end if 3 things happen. If customers come more to ING. So if the traffic goes up, so that every time they have a need, they come to us first. First one is the traffic. The second one is, what do we do with this traffic? So are we able to truly engage the customers every time they come to us? Do we have a better experience every time they come to us? Do we have a personal experience? Are we able to fulfill their needs? That's the second thing that we have to work on. And the third one is, are we able to translate this into the sales of products and services. And this is the virtuous circle that we have been working on over these years. Because at the end, if we do a good job there, this will translate into the monetization, [not] into the value that this is what you're expecting.</p><p>So for today, I want to talk about 3 things. I want to show some proof points, so how are we doing in the journey, what are the numbers behind. I want to talk about why the primary bank relationship, it's an acceleration of this funnel, so that's the second thing that I want to talk about. And the third thing is, this is a journey because, at the end of the day, we are transforming the way we are running our organization. And many pieces have to be changed, and this has been stressed today -- during the day by Roel, by Ralph. This is about data, this is about culture, this is about many things. So what I want also to show is, where do we stand in this transformation? How are we doing across the different business models we have in the different geographies in ING? And then where do we see the future going as to untap basically the potential that we have with our 38 million clients that we have?</p><p>So now let me go for the first one that is the proof points on this transformation journey. In 2018, we had 3.7 billion interactions with our customers. That's a big number. This is 700 million more than the year before, 500 million more than the year before. And these are a big number, and we -- this is, as you see, mainly driven by the mobile that is growing very fast. And why are we having so many interactions? Because we have been working hard on making the transactions easy and to have all the products and the services there. But also, we have been working hard in personalizing these transactions, so to truly give the message to the customers that we believe are relevant for them. And in already close to 45% of the cases of these 3.7 billion, we take a conscious decision of what we show to the customer to be relevant for them. And this can be about a product, but this can also be about talking how the financial markets are doing because the customers were looking at the brokerage. It can be about a message because you have made a transaction and to give you confidence that the card was used and this gives you comfort. There are many things that you have to be there.</p><p>There's a lot of question -- many times that I also speak with you, tell me about, \"What is the true value? No, I'm just looking at the app and I'm looking at my balance. So is there any value there?\" And for me there, the proof is a bit on the pudding, as we say. Are we able to translate this into sales? And de facto, what you see here, and this is the graph that you have over there, is that over the last couple of years, we doubled the sales that we have across the digital channels. Double. And this is how many sales you have for every thousand customers. So we are learning basically to move the sales, to move the relationship to a digital world.</p><p>And we have also started this journey in the mobile. And there, the rate is exponential, so it's a 6x, but because we started very low. But as you see there, the potential is magnificent. Because now, let me go to this part of the graph. Today, 90% of our customers are already digital. And what you see is that the mobile is picking up. It's picking up as a mobile-only, but it's picking up also as a mobile and in combination with the rest of the channels. And therefore, we truly need to practice now to bring this relationship with the customers in a digital world if we want to be successful.</p><p>And there, we also see the assisted channels, as we call them. So this is the call center, these are the branches, something that we call now remote advice. We're also transforming the way we are operating with our customers to get ready for a digital interaction. Because now, every time that the customer goes to any of these points it's because it's a moment of truth where he really needs helping -- help with something. And this is where we are also drastically changing the way we are operating our assisted channels to support this journey.</p><p>The next question because this is all fine, so more traffic, better engagement, more sales, so that's working, that's good, but is this bringing value? Because, at the end, that's the essence of the key question. And there, the answer is yes. And in this graph, in this PowerPoint, what you see are 2 things: first, the revenue; and then the profitability and the return. So let me start with the revenue. And by the way, I forgot to mention this. All the numbers in this presentations is about the individuals only. So this has not SMEs, or mid-corps, that normally, we always show this information when we talk about the retail because we wanted to talk specifically about the individuals' part today.</p><p>We live in an environment in which the competition is growing drastically. We live in an environment in which we have new players that are setting the standards in terms of customer expectations but that have not figured out yet what is the revenue model. And this adds a challenge in the way we are doing things. And we live in an environment in which interest rates have been at 0 or close to 0 for a long period of time. So actually when we look backward, since 2014, we managed to increase our revenue from EUR 8.2 billion to EUR 9.0 billion. And this is by having a stable revenue in the savings and by basically leveraging on deepening the relationship with our customers in the rest of the products. And there, you have comparative growth rates of around 8%. And we are doing it in such a way, in a digital way, so that we have accelerated our profitability, reaching EUR 3.5 billion profit and a return above 23%. So this is what we are making by engaging more with our customers in a digital way and becoming the go-to place for them.</p><p>So now specifically on these type of customers, what we call the primary bank customers, but these are those that have already decided that we are their main bank, that they want to bank, that they want to serve all their needs via us.</p><p>Why is it helpful as an acceleration of this journey? And in very simple terms, it's because they interact more times with us, 4x more. They buy more products and services with us, twice more. And they are also more sticky, so they stay longer with us. So basically, they accelerate this virtuous circle that I was referring to. And by doing this, they help us getting more resilient and getting more balanced in the way we are creating value because they are 3x -- 4 -- 3.5x more profitable than the nonprimary bank customers.</p><p>And we are actually very happy with the different segments that we have across our customer base, but what we see here is that those that are engaged with ING for most of their needs, they do have a better return on equity, close to 40%. These are big numbers. And also a cost-to-income that is also close to 40%. So actually, they accelerate the value. We have a customer base of 38 million customers. So the more we engage with our customers to basically use ING as their main bank, the stronger we will be untapping the value that we have in ING. And this is -- in very simple terms, we are accelerating the revenue without increasing the cost. And this is a concept that, today, we have been talking a lot, that is growing the business without growing the expenses at the same time and not necessarily looking at the cost-to-income but at the operational leverage. And this is something that this helps.</p><p>This is very easy to say. And now to show the results, we can feel proud. So we are getting an acceleration of the funnel. So that's good. This is translating into value, that's also good. Getting the deeper relationship with our customers on a digital way, this is happening, this is helping, that's also very good. But the key question is, how to make this happen? And this is what is actually very difficult. And all the banks, we talk about this, but I think it's really good to see that in ING, we have been working on this for years. And you see the proof points that this is possible and that we are in the journey because it takes time.</p><p>This is about redesigning the way you're offering your products, redesigning the processes, the end-to-end that Roel was referring to. This is about redesigning the way you communicate with your customers so that things are very simple, understandable; to translate data into insights; to become truly relevant for your customers. This is truly about culture, and you need to have your 50,000 employees really obsessed about creating a differentiated customer experience in everything we do and in every single day of the organization because everything needs to be easy, everything needs to be personal, that's what we expect as customers and everything needs to be relevant for these customers.</p><p>And in this journey, what I want is to stress that we have been doing this both on the businesses in which were coming from the digital world, the old ING Direct as we call that; and on the businesses that were more a brick-and-mortar bank, a traditional bank. And I want to show 2 examples because I also know them very well because of my past of where do we stand in this transformation. And you see a lot of colors, a lot of graphs, but please stay with me. What I want here is to show on the facts.</p><p>So where are the sales coming from in 2 business that historically were very different, Spain that was a digital business and Poland that was a [full] bank? And at the end of last year, when we look at the sales, 70% of the sales in both countries were coming from digital already and 30% were coming from assisted channels, so by the use of human beings. This is the transformation that we have been working on years that really proves that we have managed to engage with our customers in a digital way, to bring this relationship towards the digital world.</p><p>And you also see -- and these are the sales that we have per type of products. And you see we don't show savings because FTDs, we believe, is relatively easy to do on the mobile because it's just a renewal. But we show the rest of the products. And there, what you see is that in the most difficult ones like mortgages, the digitalization is still not that strong, although it's starting because customers are basically using their device for everything, and therefore, they start their journey there. But in products like consumer lending, most of the sales today, 70-plus, 80% are happening via the mobile. And this is because we have drastically changed the full approach. So you need to have a preapproved loan for every single customer, so that in the moment of need, basically with a click, they have it. That is drastically changing every single piece of the bank in order to make this happen. But we are good at it, and we have been working very hard on this.</p><p>So now when we look at the different business models that we have in ING, we are aiming in all of them at this ambition, orange part, that is to have a deep digital relationship with our customers where we really untap this value that I've been referring to and to do it in a very digital way where the operational leverage that Ralph was referring to today, is very, very high. And this is where we are aiming at going. This is the journey in which we are present today.</p><p>But, of course, the journey is slightly different, depending if you're talking about the market leaders or if you're talking about the challengers or the growth countries. And this is what Roland Boekhout and Aris Bogdaneris will be talking about after I leave the stage.</p><p>So there are 2 things that I would like you to remember on the journey: Creating a differentiated customer experience is the name of the game for this, and leveraging on the 13 countries that -- where we have been present in the retail has helped us through the journey because we are able to copy and go much, much faster.</p><p>But that for the future is not good enough because in a mobile-only world where the expectations of the customers are going through the roof and they go very, very, very fast, the name of the game there is scalability. And with this, what I want is to invite my colleague, Roland. But before that, because I was based more on numbers today, I also want to share a video where you see a bit what are the things that we have been working on over these years. Thank you.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ROLAND B. BOEKHOUT, HEAD OF MARKET LEADERS &amp; MEMBER MANAGEMENT BOARD BANKING, ING GROEP N.V.: Thank you, Ignacio. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Since we haven't all met before, I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Roland Boekhout. I've been with ING since the Year of the Lord 1991. I dramatized it a little bit because it's a long time ago. Most of the time since then, I've been outside of the Netherlands actually with this beautiful company in U.S., in New York, in Poland, in Mexico and in Germany. When the crisis started, I was in charge of the Wholesale Bank in Central and Eastern Europe. And in 2010, I was invited to come to Germany and to build the universal bank that we have there until the summer of 2017 when I was allowed to join the management board banking. That's about me.</p><p>I'm going to talk to you about uniting Belgium and the Netherlands; give you a little bit of update; what's going on; what were the original thoughts behind it; where we're standing; and demonstrate to you that while we go through these major transformation, we continue to deliver strong financial and commercial results. But before I go there, I want to build on the slides that Steven has introduced with you, and that has -- that Ralph has spoken about, and that's about KYC and transaction monitoring.</p><p>I'm not going to go through the whole spectrum again that Steven has done about the policy, about the governance, the tooling, the monitoring and the mindset. I want to focus on one little part of it. It makes it closer to the heart of all our people because it's not a hygiene factor. This is what we're about every day everywhere: how do we drive it home with all of our people? I think it was mentioned, very important for this is data. In order to do this effectively, transaction monitoring, collecting data of our customers, we need data.</p><p>Data is an integral part of our strategy. Data we used to define market segments of [image one]. Data are also the ones that we use to know everything about our customers. So data, we can also use to track what our customers are doing and to make sure that they stay within the boundaries of what we are supposed to be doing, and that we notice when they're going outside of those boundaries so we can make sure that we can report them. So as a matter of fact, data are very close to us. Data are part of our strategy. Data are what we can use in order to fulfill our obligations in fighting financial and economic crime as well.</p><p>And that brings it very close also to the purpose of our staff or our employees everywhere. We want to be there for them. Our customers have the right to know that they're banking with a bank that is safe and compliant and fulfilling its obligations. And at the end of the day, we drive it home, and we want to be the A team in fighting financial and economic crime. So it's everywhere.</p><p>To the program. It flipped on further than it should have. There. You saw this slide just now with Ignacio. And it talks about the transformation towards where we want to be in the 3 blocks. I'm obviously talking about the block on the top left-hand corner, which is called Retail Benelux. We also call it market leaders. The relevance of it is that the way that we do it and what you want to accomplish, it is slightly different from the other 2 blocks. When you are a market leader, growth is not your primary instrument to grow into your potential or to grow out of a problem. Because you're already a market leader, so you have things at stake you need to be and maintain your market leadership position. And at the same time, you focus on unlocking cross-border capabilities or cross-border scalability to become a more efficient player in that market, and by doing that, maintain your leading economic position as well.</p><p>This is a slide of 2016 that was used as the reasons why we wanted to do it. And ladies and gentlemen, it's more true today than it was in 2016. Why do I say that? One of the reasons was, at that time, still a vision maybe, somebody -- not everybody took it as serious as it was pronounced at the time as it was launched by Ralph. The world is becoming digital, and it's becoming digital much, much faster than anybody ever thought possible. Well, today, we see that even our high expectation of the speed of digitalization was underestimating the reality. It's grown much, much faster than ever considered possible. People are moving to the digital world and are expecting digital customer journeys that are unbeatable and that are seamless much, much faster and much more intensive than we ever thought possible. So we need to focus on it, and we need to do it faster. One of the reasons why it was then called the Accelerating Think Forward strategy.</p><p>And the other part is what Tanate has been talking about, that we see an economic reality in a low-for-long interest rate environment. One of the ways to solve that riddle, to contribute to the solution of that riddle is, of course, enhanced efficiency in your model and lower your cost base. So there's 2 reasons we're already in there, but they're even more relevant today than they were in 2016.</p><p>To give you an update on what we've been doing with unite Belgium and the Netherlands. We triggered a bomb in Belgium, to be honest. Everything was up in arms. A massive transformation went down, particularly in Belgium, in 2018. We redeployed 5,000 people. We asked people to take another job in another context with another task, a phenomenal task to do that. We took Record Bank, and we migrated Record Bank down to ING Belgium. Roel mentioned it. It was a process that went very smoothly. Of course, it's never 100% smooth. There's friction, you ask a customer to go from one to the other. You need to manage that process, but it ran very well. We closed 600 branches in 1 year. Massive transformation going on affecting every part of the organization, not in the least our employees and not in the least our customers. But we pulled it off. And in that process, we reduced market leaders -- the number of FTEs by 2,000, living up to the expectation of increased efficiency in that market.</p><p>We also introduced the app that Roel referred to. It's the same app that we have in the Netherlands and in Germany. Where does it take us from here? What are we going to do next? We're going to make that OneApp in 2019 also available to our Belgium retail customers, which means that we have the 20 million customers that have access to our app, 20 million. The relevance of that, I'll come back in a little bit in a different slide. We will continue to drive the efficiency in our model by reducing another 1,500 FTEs by 2021.</p><p>But we also changed a few things compared to the original plan. We see the speed of the digitalization outperforming our expectations. We cannot afford to lose our leading position in this market. We need to be the first. We need to be the best. And therefore, we're refocusing our efforts to bringing digital solutions, digital customer journeys to our customers faster.</p><p>The second thing is that we see that we have been capable of diversifying our income sources, our composition of our P&amp;L away from market leaders a little bit by avoiding concentration risk. Aris is going to talk about that. It's working well, but it's still material. We want to derisk our migration approach by cutting it up in pieces. So we're doing these 2 things by focusing first on the digital transformation for our customers, clinging on to them, making sure that the alternatives that they have are limited; and at the same time, we move product by product, which means nothing more that is going to take a little bit longer.</p><p>But we're not going to stop enhancing the efficiency in our model as we have in the past 2 years and in the last 4 years, as Ralph pointed out, 16%, which we can see on this slide. It is possible under these circumstances and in this mature market to continue to become a more and more efficient business model. Over this period in time, we have been able to, notwithstanding the economic pressure, the economic reality that was there, to keep the top line more or less flat, to reduce costs continuously, the financial performance that I alluded to before. But we've been commercially successful as well, as you see in the top right-hand side, the growth of primary customers. The essence of our existence is the primary customer. And in the bottom right-hand corner, what has helped to maintain our top line was the growth of assets, retail assets on our balance sheet.</p><p>It's not clicking. There. No. This is going too fast. It's now catching up. I'm sorry about that. It's going faster than it was supposed to. There.</p><p>One of the essential parts of accomplishing all of this is the agile way of working. When we create a company with one culture, one platform, one way of working, it has a significance that goes way beyond this one product or this one country.</p><p>The Agile way of working has 2 elements to it. One of the things is that it's much, much more efficient than the old way of working. We put cross-functional teams together. These cross-functional teams deliver a functionality, for example, from the beginning until the end. And then, they do the aftercare as well. So the old days where the marketing colleague had a brilliant idea and went to a product colleague and then to a communications colleague, and they made a plan, first, having to find each other. And when they were done with the plan and they had the market research, went to IT and knocked on the door and said, \"We have a great plan.\" And the IT colleagues were then having to reprioritize and see if they could fit it in, considered whether they also thought it was important. All of those things are gone. We have -- don't have those handovers anymore because now we have these cross-functional teams that right from the very beginning, they are there, they're designing it, they're testing it and delivering it. And they're delivering it on very short time frames, much more efficient than anything else that we have ever done before.</p><p>And it's much quicker, which is also important in this digital time frame. We do not have the time to develop it in the way that the old times -- in the old times we did it. Why not? Because the bench that we're looking at are the companies -- the big techs that Ralph mentioned all before. They all have a way of working similar to this one, delivering at the speed of light their new facilities, new capabilities, new innovations into the customer journeys. We have to do it this way if we want to keep up.</p><p>Now is this very far away, very far removed from the way that we work, the way that we think? Well, I don't think so, to be honest. We are not a digital immigrant. We are a digital native. We are a digital native. You can see it on the left-hand side. Ralph showed you this chart also, 10 names. We are #10, but the 9 names above it are the digital natives of the first hour, the Googles and the Facebooks. And we wrestled our way right in there. So take your smartphone out and look at all the apps cluttering your phone and try to be the #10. That's where we are, competing with nice films where there are people look at, with a soccer app, with a dating app, with the newspaper, all of these things. And we end up at #10 as ING, which means that we are digital native. We know what we're talking about. We are part of this digital system.</p><p>And you see in the middle at the bottom, what they use. This era of digital consumers has started a while ago, but it's still picking up speed. In the last year, we have 1 million -- almost 1 million more people that are using the app, and it's still continuing. It's -- Ignacio also alluded to it. It's still happening. You are not there -- let me drive this point home with you. It's by no means a walk in the park to meet your net stable funding ratio. It's by no means a walk in the park to meet your MREL requirements, to build up your capital layers and your capital position. It's not easy. It's tough. You have to do all of that. But if on top of that, you do not get this one under control, you're going to start losing customers on a daily basis.</p><p>And you won't see it directly by them closing the account, but you'll see that the interactions that they have with you are going to come down, and they're going to go to the ones that offer the unbeatable customer journey. And if their transactions are going down with you, if the interactions are coming down with you, it means that they're no longer a primary customer. And this is the beginning of the end. You have got to do that to be in the game.</p><p>And it's working. If you look at the block in the middle, there's almost 5.5 million interactions with our customers today in the Netherlands. What does that mean? 5.5 million interactions almost there. Let me demonstrate to you for a moment what that means.</p><p>That's about 5 seconds, that's 300 interactions with the customer. That wasn't a long time frame, was it? And as a matter of fact, I just divided it by 24 and by 60 and by 60. Probably on a Monday afternoon at 4:30, it's probably more like 400, 400 interactions in such a short time frame. And each of these interactions allows us to become more personal with our customer, to get closer to them to understand them better. And this is what is necessary and this is why you have to have to be in that space and develop a quality product. In the right top-hand side, you see what it is to have 4.5 stars, around 4.5 stars both in the App Store and the Google Play Store.</p><p>The interactions lead to things that go beyond banking, to be with the customer on their journeys of what they want to accomplish. And we are experimenting with it. The traffic offers opportunities that we haven't had before. Let me take you through a couple of examples that we have here. On the left top-hand side is the ING Shop. Customers are coming to us. With the ING Shop, we use the traffic to make products available at attractive prices to customers and noncustomers that come to the ING platform.</p><p>These are A brand products that are offered in attractive prices. We're experimenting with it. This is not yet a revenue source for us. We're learning. We see how consumers behave, but we already have a turnover of EUR 30 million on this platform.</p><p>We're copying it in the Belgium context what's called ING Deals. It's a similar concept, but as you see, it just started in the fourth quarter of 2018, and we already have 50,000 users. Time to volume.</p><p>On the right-hand side, on the top, you see Makelaarsland. People want to buy a house. They don't want to have a mortgage. We're trying to facilitate this with Makelaarsland, which is a platform that brings buyers and sellers together at unbeatable prices, by the way, and they contribute themselves, too. For example, they show their own home to a buyer. The concept behind is that they know their home better than anybody else, and they are very good at selling that and reaching the hearts of a potential buyer. The platform takes care of everything else. And if it's an interesting transaction, ING can jump in and help source with the financing as well.</p><p>Similarly, at the right bottom side, Funding Options. This is about empowering entrepreneurs. This is a place where we bring entrepreneurs together and introduce them with different ways that they can finance their businesses to grow. It's empowering them. If it's a product that we have in our arsenal, if it's a bankable situation, it may or it may not end up with us. It's not the point. The point is to create a platform, to attract activity on it, to have people on there, to come to it, the go-to place.</p><p>I'm going to hand over to Aris in a moment. I'm just going to wrap it up for you. I hope you have been able -- I have been able to demonstrate to you that one, KYC is in everything that we do. It's not a second line, it's not a third line opportunity -- responsibility. It starts with the first line and everybody is involved with it. It's everywhere. It's not a hygiene factor.</p><p>Two, the transformation in Belgium Netherlands has reached major milestones in 2018 and continues to build on towards that platform that we want to have in the future, is delivering -- continues to deliver financial and commercial performance in the process, notwithstanding the fact that everything is upside down.</p><p>And ladies and gentlemen, ING is a digital native. We are in this game to win. We know what it takes, we know what it is to be in that app world, in that Internet world, and to be there where your customers wants to be and where your customers finds you and wants to go to.</p><p>Thank you for your attention. Aris?</p><p>ARIS BOGDANERIS, HEAD OF CHALLENGERS &amp; GROWTH MARKETS AND MEMBER MANAGEMENT BOARD OF BANKING, ING GROEP N.V.: Good afternoon, everybody. Three years ago, I stood in front of some of you in Amsterdam at the last investor meeting, and I told you about our pivot to be a primary bank. I also told you that we were going to diversify our business beyond mortgages and savings, and we were going to diversify our earnings outside of Germany. I also told you that mobile is going to be a powerful and the most powerful interaction channel of the future. And finally, we talked about cross-border platforms, and I told you that we were going to build one ourselves. Now I fast forward, 3 years later, I'm in front of you again and we're going to spend the next 10 minutes and do a progress check on how well we've done.</p><p>C&amp;G encompasses 27 million customers in 10 countries. This is roughly 70% of the total customers in ING. Over the last 4 years, we have added 4.7 million customers. More importantly, 70% of those customers that have been added are primary customers, and you've heard from Ignacio earlier today, primary customers are 3.5x more profitable than nonprimaries. On top of that, the growth in our primary customers has been broad-based. From Sydney to Madrid, Bucharest, Frankfurt, we're growing throughout our geographies, not just in Germany.</p><p>On top of that, customers like us. We're transparent, we enable them digitally, we solve their problems and other things. But it's not what I say that matters; it's what we measure. And our NPS, Net Promoter Score, you heard from Isabel, how customers rate us and recommend us to others, we're #1 in 6 of 10 markets. And in countries like Australia, Germany and Spain, compared to our closest competitor, we're #1 by a substantial margin.</p><p>Now, by the end of today, you've learned more primaries, more digitally enabled customers, you get more contacts. In the last 2 years, we have grown over digital contacts from 1.1 billion to 1.9 billion. That's 1.9 billion a year. This represents an incredible opportunity to engage our clients. And as I promised 3 years ago, the number of interactions coming through mobile has tripled. In fact, mobile now represents 71% of all contacts. When you have more contacts, you have more insights. When you have more insights, you have more opportunities to cross-buy. And you see the cross-buy figures have grown substantially.</p><p>But it's not just getting cross-buy, it's getting cross-buy in the products that matter. And when I told you 3 years ago that we were going to diversify, you see today we've now crossed EUR 100 billion in nonmortgage, and nonsavings volumes, that's consumer loans, current accounts and investment products. This has ramifications on your revenue stream, as you'll see now.</p><p>So as you drive this digital interactions, you see what's happening to revenues. Over the last 4 years, we've grown revenues 7% per annum, this despite the margin squeeze on savings. And you see that in mortgage income, in other income, we're growing double digit. In fact, nonsavings revenues are now 60% of our revenue base. And of course, it translates to the bottom line. We've added almost EUR 500 million in profits over the last 4 years, all this despite substantial investments in strategic initiatives like Model Bank, like further digitizing our business, but it also comes against heavy regulatory costs. And you heard it from Tanate, regulatory costs have grown 28% per annum since 2014, and we're absorbing it. So all in all, the financial's good.</p><p>You've seen this, and it's been shown throughout the day. I'm not going to go over it again, but there's 2 things to remember at least in C&amp;G. We remain focused on driving more primary customers and monetizing them increasingly and penetrating them, whether you're a challenger bank or a bank in our growth markets. For our challenger banks, it's about Model Bank, scaling and also new product introductions where we have gaps. And for our growth countries, it's to grow and to continue to digitize, to lower the cost to serve and improve operational efficiency over time.</p><p>Let me give you some examples. Here are 3 businesses: Poland, Romania and Australia, which together comprise today 40% of our profits in C&amp;G. This is a far cry from a few years ago. What's interesting to note here is for our traditional brick-and-mortar banks that Ignacio referred to, in Poland, in Romania, we've been cutting our physical footprint, but that cut in the physical footprint has not at all impacted our ability to drive more customers, more primary customers and more digital interactions. There isn't a trade off. In fact, it's enabled us to lower our cost base -- our fixed cost base and drive a better cost to income, and you see the impact on profits.</p><p>For Australia, different bank, one of the original direct banks, it never had branches to cut. However, it's been able to increase its primary customer base sixfold in the last 4 years. And not only increase sixfold, but you see what happens when you increase your primary base, the number of digital interactions has multiplied. And also it comes down to the bottom line. Just 3 examples of how the strategy is being executed across our global footprint.</p><p>You heard a lot about Model Bank, and I won't go through it all over again. I just want to highlight 2 things. It's 7 million customers across 4 countries on one customer-interactive platform. You've heard time to volume, you've heard innovation scale, you've heard all these things. But what it means for us is the following: we believe this platform, when we're going to have our 7 million customers on it, and you heard that the Czech, 400,000 already there, it's a means to engage our customers even further, and engagement for us in Model Bank means being easy, being personal and being smart when we interact with our customers. Easy means onboarding your customers irrespective of the product in a seamless way. It means mobile-first developments happening in one place and being spread to multiple countries. It also means personalization. You've heard that word today. Personalization is getting down to the level where every interaction is unique to that individual. And when you talk to an individual with a segmentation of one, the relationship deepens. And when the relationship deepens, cross-buy increases. And finally, it's about being able to manage people's money through the mobile, okay? That's financial management.</p><p>Now what you see there is those gray spots. Those gray balls are gaps. And when the countries go on Model Bank, on our platform, these gaps will turn orange. And not only will they turn orange for these countries, but if we decide to go to a new country or any new thing, the scaling, automatically all these capabilities will come with it. It also matters, and you heard it from Ralph, new product introductions, new services, new features automatically when you have a platform, are scaled out instantaneous to the other markets. This is really the benefit and the power of Model Bank, and it's the power of a platform.</p><p>You heard it earlier, 300 people in Madrid, [50] Nationalities represented. We have software developers, we have UNIX -- UX talent, data specialists, product specialists. We're building this capability in one place, which will be shared across many millions of our customers. We've already now developed a plan to migrate the remaining 6.5 million customers over the next 2 years, and it's going to be a bit different for us because we're moving from managing and optimizing individual units to managing a platform. That's a big cultural change, and these people are breaking new ground.</p><p>You've heard about our partnership with AXA, and our partnership with AXA is a signal that we aim to disrupt the protection business, like we disrupted savings 20 years ago in the original ING Direct. For us, it represents a big opportunity.</p><p>We have the 6 countries there that you see. There's 13 million customers. And today the amount of protection that we offer the customers in those 13 million is virtually nil. They need protection. They're getting protection. They're just not getting it from us, and that's a shame, and we're going to change it.</p><p>There's 2 components of our AXA partnership. One is the business of linking credit protection on lending. For a country like Germany with a EUR 70 billion mortgage book, the amount of insurance today we generate from there is nil. This will change.</p><p>There's the other aspect of this partnership. It's building on mobile insurance propositions that are seamless. So think about all the interactions we are getting today. Ignacio showed you billions. Imagine with these interactions on mobile, how we can use those insights to proactively cross-buy with our customers' stand-alone insurance.</p><p>It will be seamless, it will be mobile, it will be -- imagine underwriting and claims handling with fewer questions, fewer clicks and basically building this business like from scratch and being ahead of the curve.</p><p>This market will grow, mobile insurance will grow, and we want to be at the forefront with AXA. We have today 70 people sitting in Paris. We have the digital expertise of ING, the insurance expertise of AXA combined, and our first prototypes will come out later in the year. We're quite excited. It's a EUR 1 billion opportunity cumulative in commissions over the next 10 years.</p><p>I couldn't be in Germany today and not talk about the jewel in the C&amp;G crown, and that's ING in Germany. There's very few retail businesses in Germany who have the earnings power of ING in Germany. And not only the earnings power, but the loyal and dedicated customer base that they have, with NPS scores that are miles ahead of their competitors. In fact, Germany is a microcosm of our overall strategy. You remember what I said at the very beginning: our strategy is to increase the number of primary customers because long term they have tremendous value. Over the last 4 years, Germany has increased their primary customer base. They've doubled them.</p><p>But as you'll notice, there's still a small proportion of the total 8.7 million customers that are in Germany. There's still plenty of upside. And again, you know it now. When you get more primaries, you get more cross-buy, you get more fee income, you get more volume in nonsavings, nonmortgage. And you see it there in the top right. And it goes without saying, when you get this all together and you heard project Welcome from Roel, and you drive more efficiency and you get more digital, profits will also increase.</p><p>So we're very proud of the German story. And this story will continue because believe you me, in terms of penetration levels on their product set, there's still room to go when you see the benchmarks, what they can achieve on consumer lending, current accounts, IP and other things.</p><p>So in 3 years, if I'm standing in front of you again, what would I like to tell you and what would I like to show you? I would like to show you how we've continued to monetize our growing primary customer base. I want to show you also how we continue to diversify our business more from nonmortgage, nonsavings, more consumer lending, more IT more protection and more -- whatever. Sorry. Sorry.</p><p>I also want to show you that we're diversifying our business continually away from Germany, that Germany is an important component, but there's more earnings power in our other markets. I also want to show you that we have a platform. We have a platform that is engaging our clients, increasing cross-buy, is scaling fast, getting more volume. Not only has our products on this platform but now has third-party products on this platform. And this platform will not only help us set the tone of how we want to be a platform company, but will also allow us to continue growing as we've been doing up to now. Thank you very much.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Thank you, Aris. Can I please ask Roland and Ignacio to join us for the Q&amp;A of this last one? Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MARK MILDERS: So gentlemen, let me immediately open up the floor for questions, please. And right here, Benjamin, you were the quickest once again. Oh no, go ahead then, if you've got the mic first, so you're it.</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE LAMBERT: Jean-Pierre. Two questions, please. First, on the platforms. The more you standardize, how do you use your management team? Are they redundant locally? Are they necessary? If you look at Google, they have rep offices. They don't need management teams. Second question is about the expansion outside of your original countries. You could expand, I understand in Philippines. Any markets you're interested in? And how fast could you move? Or is there any plan for that?</p><p>ARIS BOGDANERIS: Of course, when you talk about building a platform, the whole idea is, as you centralize capability, you don't need that same capability in every individual country, of course. And you know it from IT, it's different elements, retail people, whatever. That's part of the process of Model Bank that we are going to optimize our footprint of the people. In Madrid, we're bringing capability together, and you don't need to be redundant in many countries. So there is an obvious optimization of your FTEs in terms of moving the capability around. In terms of building a platform, I think you heard it earlier today, that when you build a platform, just like you see Netflix or others, you can go to a new country and the marginal cost of entering a new country is relatively light compared to building a bank in a country de novo. That's clear. And so using the same components, the same infrastructure, you can easily imagine that you could extend your footprint, right? But right now, our focus on Model Bank is getting the next 2 years, getting these customers on the platform, right?</p><p>MARK MILDERS: I promised Ben to ask a question here in front.</p><p>BENJAMIN GOY: Two from my side, Benjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank. First on the market leaders. We heard a lot about the heavy lifting, so to say, about the restructuring, so maybe now a bit more on the benefit. You mentioned Record Bank has migrated. So when can you switch off the IT? And also on the product side when you say you now move bit by bit, when can we expect important IT immigrations to happen and then to switch off? Because I guess, the cost curve from here is pretty much in steps to some extent. And then the second question is on Model Bank. In the past you haven't spoken so much about France and Italy but which could potentially be big markets. Should we expect more on that front as you become much more, let's say, better positioned to compete here with Model Bank?</p><p>ROLAND B. BOEKHOUT: I'll start with the market leaders' question, Record Bank, we aim to decommission the IT of Record Bank towards the end of this year. In the Netherlands, it's more complicated there, where we built a target platform and we're going to make the customer journey -- the digital channels on there first, move customers there, also from Belgium, and then start migrating the products one by one. Now when that means that we will be able to start decommissioning things in Belgium, I can't tell you at this stage, and the reason why is that we then still have the segments of business as the mid-corporates and wholesale. And we're not going to speed it up beyond our capability to accommodate it on a shared platform, no. This is not going to be dramatic in the financials. As you see, we continue to drive for the efficiency and the efficiency in the whole venture doesn't only come from decommissioning IT systems, right? So it helps and it's going to be stretched out over time, but I can't tell you right now when this last point will be set.</p><p>ARIS BOGDANERIS: Your question on Model Bank in France and Italy, and I think it was embedded in when I was saying that when you build the capability in Model Bank, you bring that capability instantly that France and Italy lack. But more importantly, the difference between a platform and running a country is a customer, whether he comes from Czech, Italy, France, Spain or whatever, that's a margin going onto the platform. And you're more indifferent where the customers are coming from because now you're running a platform and you're not trying to optimize in every country. And that's the difference we see. But of course, when you increase capability on mobile in France and Italy, you're going to get more traction with your customers. That's a given.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Thank you very much. Please, Bart?</p><p>JASON KALAMBOUSSIS: Jason Kalamboussis, KBC. The first one is for Aris. Do you -- I mean, the deal with AXA is on protection. Why wasn't it done directly on many other products, especially the nonlife products? The second question for Roland is on -- we saw, I think it was on Slide 7, where you show, I mean, a great evolution of the Benelux. But if we were to split the Netherlands and Belgium, in the Netherlands, it's an excellent progress. But if we look at Belgium, costs have gone up since 2014 and revenues have come down. So if we look at 2018, what would be your comments and when are we going to start seeing progress? Is it in the first part of 2019? Or is it's so back ended that we'll see it in 2020? And the last question is, you have, I mean, the #10 app in the Netherlands is a very commendable position, but for example, you introduced it in Belgium. Do you think -- how quickly do you think you achieve the same kind of levels on a nonwhole market in a certain way?</p><p>ARIS BOGDANERIS: So on the first question, on AXA, I'm not sure we said life or nonlife. I didn't think we excluded nonlife. So that's the first thing. And again, I just want to reemphasize, this relationship is not the typical bancassurance relationship, where the provider gives you products from the shelf and you just sell them through your channels. That's not what we're doing. What we're doing, and I again underscore this, we're sitting together and cocreating products for our mobile customers, the customers that interact mobile. And that's a very different proposition than what you normally see now today in a normal bancassurance partnership. It's cocreation for disruption.</p><p>ROLAND B. BOEKHOUT: To your question on Belgium, as you know, Belgium has been suffering for a longer period of time already by the lower -- the level of liability cost that wasn't allowed to go down below the 11 basis points. You see this working quicker on the Belgian model, and therefore, you saw some pressure on the top line, besides some local competitive pressures that we have with players that have different ROE requirements, I guess, than we do. So that has been putting some pressure on the top line. The cost in 2018, and I described the phenomenal intense transformation that was going on in Belgium, we learned things. We see how customers react and we need to make sure that we keep on servicing them appropriately. So we have to take some measures that were, let's say, compensating for the fact that service levels are not meeting the ones that we had promised them. So this is settling in. Like I said, there's 5,000 people that got new jobs. Before they start being productive and to be able to do what you're expecting to do, it takes time. So we'll see these efficiency gains coming in through 2019 gradually. When it comes to the app, when we launch it there, it depends a little bit on the penetration and the degree that the customers are willing to accept the digitalization. So we'll see. It's going to be exciting. I think when we launch it, we will climb the range very, very quickly in Belgium, too. Holland is probably one of the more digitized countries that we're in. There's some that are close to it. Spain, for example. What it means digitized, that customers are willing to embrace the new ways of being serviced. They have Internet penetration, then you have the app penetration, the willingness for them to accept services on it. It's actually very different from country to country. The Netherlands is advanced in that. And Spain is advanced in it. Belgium is less advanced in it. Now does that create a level playing field because everybody is on that same lesser-advanced digital market, and therefore, you climb the range as you do anywhere else? I don't know. I don't know. I think it will, but I don't know. I'm not sure.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: And if I may add, Jason, to your question on the cost, I would recommend to stop looking at individual countries as we are converging our operations to the extent that we are. As you saw today, we're already migrating and having one channel for all our retail digital customers as of 2019. Holland is preparing a lot of their systems to receive processes, so we're coming at an inflection point where you see the cost is also one of the reasons why today we showed you the combination, and that is something perhaps, going forward, if you want to look at where the costs are landing, it's going to be more of a unite Belgium and Netherlands.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Next question. Stefan, please?</p><p>STEFAN ROSENOV NEDIALKOV: It's Stefan from Citigroup. I just thought back on the new market opportunity. How should we think about this? Are we looking at a return to the old days of ING Direct, where you're all over the world and you sometimes struggled to find venues for your liquidities, or you end up investing in specific areas? I mean, expanding within DDo is one thing. Expanding in the Philippines, that doesn't really give you liquidity synergies, for example. Do we think about this as a 1 to 2 countries per year type of expansion? How should we think about the IT systems? Okay, maybe you would use the Model Bank as a front end. But do you have to build an IT system for every specific country or can you use existing IT systems? Just some color around the setup, the pace of expansion and I guess, overall benefits will be very useful.</p><p>ARIS BOGDANERIS: So today our focus is, as I mentioned earlier, is on</p><p>getting Model Bank up and running, and you are correct that we have -- in the Philippines we have a bank. We have a presence in the Philippines for the last 30 years, and we've tested a mobile-only concept in the Philippines using components from the group, and this is what the TPA -- what Roel talked about earlier. And it's more to experiment with ways in which we interact on mobile in a market that we've been present for a long time. And in terms of more geographic expansion, that is not really in the cards for us now, although you've heard that we're in discussions in China with our joint venture partner already, Bank of Beijing. But beyond that, our focus is to continue to grow in our European, both in Eastern Europe and in Western Europe. That's where our focus is. Would you like to add anything?</p><p>ROLAND B. BOEKHOUT: No.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Sorry, please.</p><p>ADRIAN CIGHI: Adrian Cighi from RBC. You talked a lot about this digital journey, and part of this journey, of course, is where the industry and the customer behavior are going. And in the sense, it's sort of running fast at standstill. But of course, the second part is doing more to be better, faster, smarter than the competition. Can you maybe help us guide what financial KPIs you use to understand which part is the first and which part is the second? Is it market share gains? Is it sort of profitability per customer? Do you use any financial KPIs on this?</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Ignacio, maybe you showed me your KPIs the other day. And it's probably best to expand that and how the retail world is going.</p><p>IGNACIO JULI\u00c3\u00a1 VILAR: Absolutely. So actually, the KPIs that we use in the retail segment are very close to the story that I brought today. At the end, we are measuring how many permanent bank relationships we are growing in the different countries, and I'm not talking about the number of customers. I'm talking about the customers that use us as their primary bank. We also talk about diversification, and this is about getting a more balanced business. So this is by getting more customers but also how we're doing with the [asset] lending, how we're doing with the assets under management, how we're doing with all the fees-related products. We also talked about the digital transformation, and digital transformation, this is traffic, engagement and sales. So these are the things that we are focusing on, and specifically on the mobile. And there we have -- we are being very demanding with ourselves. And as a result, then we have the profitability and the revenue. But this is how we are leading the retail segment within ING, truly to go through this transformation. How do we compare with the peers? And that, we don't share. And this is the question that you ask all of us all the time: you all say the same, but you don't share the numbers. So it's very difficult, actually. We do a couple of things there. We do benchmarks to objectivize this. So actually, we use external companies, and one of them is Finalta, where we did a deep dive to see how we are doing in this digital transformation to see if in relative terms we can be happy with ourselves or we have to be more demanding. And that has helped us across the 13 units and really to see who is good at what to team up to go faster. And the second thing is to really compare ourselves with the best-in-class, so to dream high and to act up on it. So that would be the first one. And the last, there was a report, I think it was a couple of weeks ago by BCG. And there, they were saying that the best-in-class, they were at 30% more or less of sales digitally when you look at the different banks in Europe and in the U.S. In our highest countries, we had 70-plus. So actually, in relative terms, we are much more advanced in the journey, and we are moving to the mobile journey. So for sure we want to continue accelerating so...</p><p>MARK MILDERS: Then, if there are no further questions, gentlemen, thank you so much.</p><p>IGNACIO JULI\u00c3\u00a1 VILAR: Thank you.</p><p>ROLAND B. BOEKHOUT: Thank you.</p><p>ARIS BOGDANERIS: Thank you.</p><p>MARK MILDERS: And this has come to the point for me to say thank you and say goodbye but not before inviting our CEO, Ralph, to the floor for his wrap-up comments of the day. Thank you very much.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Let me first start by saying thank you, thank you for all of you being here today. Thank you for making it all the way over here even on your delayed flights. Thank you for staying with us the whole day because I know this has been very intensive. And just sitting in a room, listening to us and having a bit of a Q&amp;A and absorbing all the information that we're kind of giving to you, I know that's quite tiring. But you're still here and you keep asking the right questions, so we're very happy that you keep a sharp ear as well. And clearly, we'll have some more time later as well.</p><p>Another thank you. Another thank you for the trust that you have shown in us also over the last couple of months when we had a bit of difficulties there, very, very, very clearly, and you kept asking questions. You tried to understand what was going on. You kept reaching out before coming to opinions. And I really, really appreciate that. That's the way we need to work in order to fully understand what's going on, and a session like this and today also helps us to convey a couple of messages as to how we're doing, what we're doing and go a little bit deeper into some of these details.</p><p>I think today can be summarized in 2 slides. And these are 2 slides that you already saw. The first slide is basically our strategy, that hasn't changed. Ever since we developed it in late 2013, early 2014, when we launched it, I remember vividly with many of you in the room, that when we put up this slide with a purpose and a strategy that was solely focused on the differentiating experience, that many of you were thinking, what trends is this guy talking about? Is this really going to happen the way ING sees the world changing? Are customers really going to change their behavior as quickly as these guys want to transform?</p><p>And then 2 years into it, 2.5 years ago when we met again, we actually both came to conclusion that we had to accelerate, that the things that we basically predicted indeed happened from a regulatory perspective, from an economic perspective, from a technology perspective, from a competition perspective. But they happened to us even faster than imagined, and we had to speed up. And that's why we started the transformation.</p><p>So if you want to know what ING is doing, one part of the slide is the strategy, a purpose-driven strategy, empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. And the other side of the slide is a transformation program to become increasingly operationally efficient, to become a platform more and more from the inside out in terms of cross-border scaling, but also from the outside in, in terms of the way we interact with our customers and the opportunity that we have in order to also offer third-party products and peer products.</p><p>This is the summary. Everything is on this slide. Everything we do, you can bring back to this slide, including the most important thing that we're currently working on, the #1 priority, and I hope that it came across today as well, which is fixing a lot of stuff that has to do with KYC and AML. It's right there in the strategy slide, in our operational excellence. It contains operational resilience as a word and a term that we have used a couple of times today, which we feel is of increasing importance in the banking world, the digital banking world and as well as a platform world.</p><p>So thanks again for being here. We still have some time to catch up many questions that may not have been asked. I know there's a lot of information we handed to you today. There is many days also after today that our investor relationship team is there and available to talk to you.</p><p>We will be coming on road shows as well. I will be traveling a lot. We will be seeing each other, and we'll be seeing some more shareholders as well. So many -- a lot of time to catch up on that.</p><p>Just remember the following, and these are our accelerators. The summary of the story: primary customer growth, cross-buy increases; cross-border scalability, time to value, net credit spread receiver and the opportunity of sustainability.

He added modestly: \"I am sure he will have the same problem of placing me.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Eight years on, there is little chance that either my friend Mr Daniel, or anyone else in Singapore, would not have heard of the 58-year-old executive in charge of South-east Asia's No. 1 lender. Or for that matter, the always-alert Mr Gupta forgetting that first meeting with Mr Daniel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The former Citibanker has put his stamp on Asia's financial services industry and gained near-oracular status where banking is concerned. His LinkedIn postings are among Singapore's most followed, halls fill up when he is a featured speaker and, if performance were the ultimate proof of competence, he has results to show.</p><p> On Feb 8, DBS Group announced record full-year net profit of $4.39 billion for 2017, more than double 2009's $2.06 billion. Total income was just shy of $12 billion, from $6.6 billion in the year he took charge. BrandFinance says DBS has overtaken Singapore Airlines - a company it helped to take public - as Singapore's most valuable brand.</p><p> Most remarkably, DBS has climbed the ranks to be among the top five in Asia for private banking and the No. 1 private bank domiciled in the region. Two years ago, Euromoney declared DBS the \"World's Best Digital Bank\".</p><p> Best digital bank! Could this quick-stepper really be staid old DBS, once the Development Bank of Singapore'</p><p>  By any measure, it has been a remarkable journey and I was keen to hear from the man himself. As the bank enters its 51st year, how will it cope with the massive disruptions of the day? Where is banking heading'</p><p> At the moment, DBS is riding a tail wind. The economics of Asia are sound, a cyclical uptick in interest rates, the integration of ANZ Bank's retail and wealth management business in five markets are all set to feed into the earnings pipeline. The rush of collective sales in the core home market will also boost demand for housing and thus, mortgage lending.</p><p> But the wolves are baying and Mr Gupta is candid in saying that even looking 10 years out isn't easy, given the massive disruption from technology.</p><p>Fast factsTHE CEO</p><p> Mr Piyush Gupta has been chief executive officer of DBS Group since November 2009.</p><p> The 58-year-old, a naturalised Singaporean, has an economics degree from Delhi University's St Stephen's College and an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.</p><p> Prior to joining DBS, he was Citigroup's CEO for South-east Asia, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p> Mr Gupta is a member of the executive committee of the Institute of International Finance, Washington. He also serves as the deputy chairman of Spring Singapore and sits on the board of the Institute of Banking and Finance.</p><p> He is married to physiotherapist Ruchira Gupta. The couple have two children - daughter Tanvi, who works for Amazon in London, and son Ishan, who works for JP Morgan in New York.</p><p> Mr Gupta golfs to a handicap of 15.</p><p>THE COMPANY</p><p> DBS, celebrating its 50th year of operations, is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets - the largest in South-east Asia. The bank has been named \"Safest Bank in Asia\" by Global Finance for nine consecutive years from 2009 to 2017. It has a market capitalisation of about $73 billion. DBS issues 31 per cent of the mortgages and 25 per cent of the credit cards used on the island. It reported a record $4.39 billion in earnings for the 2017 full year.</p><p>  \"Banking increasingly will have to be a part of something people want to do (along) with their real life,\" he says. \"In the future, my mission and vision is to make DBS invisible. To hide DBS inside everything else you want to do with your life.\"</p><p> In his reckoning, the biggest disruptors are not so much the fintech companies but the 10 or so \"platform\" companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba and WeChat. Alibaba's Ant Financial Services Group is already the No. 2 payment services company and likely to overtake Visa this year. Without a single branch, it has a fast-growing loan book, a massive insurance book and a fund management company. While these platforms claim to not compete with banks, Mr Gupta thinks this is a red herring to avoid regulatory scrutiny.</p><p> \"If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it is a bank,\" he quips.</p><p> DBS itself is adjusting to the new technological landscape and Mr Gupta says the challenge of moving it from \"copper wire telephony to cellular era\", so to speak, was less hard than it seemed. After spending his first four years as CEO fixing the bank's technology platform to bring about standards and consistency, he is now \"re-architecting\" it.</p><p> Much of the work will be done by the end of 2018.</p><p> \"The answer is to keep learning and understand what Big Tech is doing and how they use new technology. What does cloud-ready mean? What does open source mean? How do you use a different technology stack? Different hardware? That's how Facebook does it, how Google does it. Why then can't we do it'\" he says.</p><p> I wonder aloud how he, an economics graduate, got to be so familiar with issues of hardware, software and IT architecture. Not surprisingly, his response went back to Citi, that fount of talent where Mr Gupta spent the first quarter century of his career.</p><p> Citi's secret sauce, he says, was to throw people in at the deep end. In 1985, when its India operations started automating its manual-based ledgers, he was asked to lead the transformation.</p><p> \"A colleague of mine and I wrote the first program to sort cheques, so you could automate clearing. It was a badly written program but it forces you to start appreciating how these things come around,\" says Mr Gupta.</p><p> A few years later, he was asked to run staff functions, and technology was one function. The bank was then centralising its data centre in Singapore and that offered him a chance to learn deeply about hardware. Indeed, in 2000, he briefly left Citi and banking to join friends who had started a dot.com with The Hindustan Times group of India.</p><p> Aside from technology, Mr Gupta's other challenge is to grow DBS outside Singapore, a territory which brings in 60 per cent of the business and is still growing strongly. What of DBS, even Singapore itself is getting too big for Singapore, he says, adding that DBS needs at least \"one meaningful market outside Singapore where we can acquire scale\".</p><p> The question is how to accomplish this. Hong Kong already brings in just less than a quarter of profits. An attempt to buy Indonesia's Bank Danamon was dropped in the face of regulatory hurdles some years back. So now DBS is exploring the digital route, capitalising on the falling cost of customer acquisition. In India, where it just passed two million customers, the cost of gaining one client has fallen from $66 to $18. In Indonesia, five months of \"digibanking\" has already brought in 80,000 customers.</p><p> \"The digital world allows you to run a bank very differently,\" he says. \"In India, we run this two million customer base with 60 or 70 people. We have no branches. No relationship staff. The offering we have is without cheque books, so not a dot of paper comes in. The only place we spend is technology.\"</p><p> Mr Gupta says he expects to make the India business profitable in four to five years and perhaps sooner in Indonesia, where the margins are richer. Likewise, he doesn't have a conventional approach to the Asean region.</p><p> \"Unlike some other Asian players, we figured we didn't want to be an Asean bank because the big flows in Asia are not going to be intra-Asean but North Asia, South-east Asia and South Asia,\" he says.</p><p> To be sure, despite the impressive results, there is much work to be done. DBS is still in a struggle to break into the teens when it comes to returns on equity (ROE), a key performance benchmark. Other lenders dominant in their territory, such as Malaysia's Maybank, are well into the teens, while India's HDFC Bank has an ROE of more than 18 per cent, twice that of DBS.</p><p>                       Mr Gupta says DBS will get to 13 to 14 per cent ROE in the next few years, on a combination of capital efficiency, cyclical uplift and better efficiency through regionalisation.</p><p> \"To compare Indonesia, Malaysia or India with a developed market is hard because the interest rate structure is very different there. When the interest structure is high, the margins are high.\"</p><p> Likewise, he is also confident of bringing his cost-to-income ratio to below 40 per cent from 43 per cent currently. A new bank, he says, can possibly target a cost-to-income ratio of 30 per cent. But legacy operations like DBS come with baggage.</p><p> \"Given what we are in Singapore with a branch footprint, needing to be in the HDB (estates) and the heartland, it would be foolhardy to try and scale it down faster than what society will be prepared to live with,\" he says.</p><p> Two years ago, when DBS shares had dropped to below $13, Mr Gupta made a public display of confidence in his bank by buying 200,000 shares. Today, the stock price is above $28.</p><p> What will he do with the money'</p><p> Mr Gupta says he sold that block of shares last year when the price climbed to $20.</p><p> \"Fifty per cent in a year is nothing to be scoffed at,\" he laughs. \"Of course, I kick myself that if I had waited, it could have been 100 per cent. I was buying some property for the kids, so I sold some. I have to admit that I am not the most astute investor in some ways.\"</p><p> As his stature has grown, Mr Gupta has become something of a brand himself within Singapore. An India-born naturalised Singaporean, he has perhaps done more to dent the \"anti-FT\" (foreign talent) sentiments once so prevalent on the island than anyone else I know.</p><p> Watching him over the years, I realise that sterling performance as a banker aside, this also is because, unlike many of his former expatriate peers, he has managed to not only sink roots in Singapore but stay solidly grounded in other ways.</p><p> He is known to drop into the offices of a major client to share a bottle of wine, cross the floor to greet an acquaintance however humble, and has been seen un-self-consciously leading his wife, Ruchira, to join the hoi polloi dancing in the aisles at Bollywood concerts.</p><p> What next? Surely, he has now outgrown his charge? There has even been talk in the past that he may get to run Temasek Holdings, which owns a large chunk of his bank. It is not the first time he has been asked this and Mr Gupta's response gives little away.</p><p> \"There has been a lot of talk that I have been offered many other jobs, including several top banking jobs, in the past couple of years,\" he says. \"I am a good banker, I think, and this is what I enjoy. For my money, this is what I will continue to be doing.\"</p><p>\u00b7 For the full text of the interview, go to str.sg/pgupta</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mr Piyush Gupta has put his stamp on Asia's financial services industry and gained near-oracular status where banking is concerned.

Just 28 days, Apple   the Cupertino maker of Mac computers and \"i\" devices (iPad, iPhone, iPod)   revealed. \"One million iPads in 28 days   that's less than half of the 74 days it took to achieve this milestone with iPhone,\" Apple CEO Steve Jobs noted. \"Demand continues to exceed supply, and we're working hard to get this magical product into the hands of even more customers.\" Jobs' announcement followed Apple's debut three days earlier of iPads equipped with 3G wireless connections. Despite the iPad milestone, it wasn't entirely a good day for Apple: According to a report in The New York Post that was confirmed by other news outlets, the company was facing scrutiny from federal antitrust regulators over its decision to ban the use of third-party technology   in particular, San Jose software maker Adobe Systems' Flash video platform   by developers of \"apps\" for the iPad and iPhone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tuesday</p><p>It was the first of four wild days on Wall Street. Many observers blamed the turmoil on fears that debt problems in Greece could trigger economic problems throughout Europe, or even globally. (Or perhaps investors were just growing worried after several months of stock-market gains.) The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average (home to Silicon Valley tech titans Cisco Systems, Intel and Hewlett-Packard) dropped 2 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index (closely watched here in tech-heavy Silicon Valley) fell 3 percent.</p><p>Wednesday</p><p>Mountain View Internet advertising juggernaut Googleunveiled a new look and feel for its flagship search engine. First, the Googlelogo itself (originally designed in 1999 by co-founder Sergey Brin) got a little nip and tuck here and some bold coloring there. \"We were trying to focus on a clean and simple and modern look,\" Google's Patrick Riley told a Merc reporter. \"That's what many of the changes on the results page were about.\" As for the search results, Googleadded a navigation panel on the left side of the page, complete with colorful icons. \"This new side panel highlights the most relevant search tools and refinements for your query,\" Marissa Mayer, Google's vice president of search products and user experience, explained on a blog post. For example, a search for \"wind power\" allows queries to be narrowed down to categories such as \"News,\" \"Blogs,\" \"Images,\" \"Books\"   or, at the top, \"Everything.\" \"The 'Everything' option remains our essential search experience with different types of results integrated into the main results, but now you can also easily switch to just the particular type of results you are looking for,\" Mayer wrote. Googlealso added a \"Something Different\" feature that offers related topics (such as, with our \"wind power\" search, \"solar power\"). \"These changes are slight, keeping our page minimalist and whimsical, but make our overall look more modern,\" Mayer noted.</p><p>Symantec, meanwhile, reported a $184 million profit for its most recent quarter, a turnaround from a $264 million loss a year earlier. Revenue jumped 4 percent to $1.53 billion. The results for the Cupertino maker of security and data storage software far exceeded Wall Street's expectations \"...</p><p>Thursday</p><p>\"... sending Symantec shares 1.7 percent higher on an otherwise jolting day for the Dow and Nasdaq. (In fact, Symantec was Thursday's only gainer among Silicon Valley's big tech stocks.)</p><p>In a plunge so brief you would have missed it if you took an early lunch break, stocks dropped sharply   intensified by a monster wave of computerized selling   before partly recovering. About 11:45 a.m. here on the West Coast, the Dow plunged as low as 9,869.92, down more than 9 percent. The Nasdaq dropped as low as 2,185.75, also about a 9 percent dive. \"I think the machines just took over,\" Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group, told our friends at The Associated Press. \"We've known that automated trading can run away from you, and I think that's what we saw happen today.\" (Needless to say, investigators were looking into the unusual trading.) After a roller-coaster ride of a day, the Dow closed down 3.2 percent, and the Nasdaq was 3.4 lower.</p><p>Friday</p><p>Silicon Valley tech stocks plunged yet again. By the end of the week, for example, Apple shares were down more than 13 percent from their peak. (Apple, though, dropped after the company was sued again by rival phone maker Nokia, which extended iPhone patent-infringement claims to the iPad.) Despite a Labor Department report showing U.S. employers added a stronger-than-expected 290,000 payroll jobs last month, the Dow dropped 1.3 percent, and the Nasdaq lost 2.3 percent. For the week, the Dow fell nearly 6 percent, and the Nasdaq plummeted nearly 8 percent.<br/></p><p>Good week: Activision Blizzard.It looks like \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" was a huge hit for the Santa Monica video game publisher. Combined with strong sales for \"World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King,\" Activision Blizzard pulled in a better-than-expected $1.3 billion in sales for its most recent quarter, up 33 percent from a year earlier. Profit more than doubled to $381 million.</p><p>Bad week: Nintendo.Nintendo, the Japanese maker of the Wii video game player, reported its first yearly drop in earnings in six years. Profit for the year that ended March 31 fell 18 percent to $2.5 billion, according to The Associated Press. Sales dropped 22 percent to $15.4 billion. Nintendo cut prices on the Wii to compete better with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3.<br/></p><p>Contact Frank Russell at<url normalizedValue=\"'mailto:frussell@mercurynews.com'\"> frussell@mercurynews.com </url>or 408-920-5876.

Google has also disclosed that it is the subject of a Justice Department investigation, while Facebook said this year that the Federal Trade Commission was looking at its practices. State attorneys general are investigating the two companies as well.</p><p>And elsewhere in the world, some competition regulators are looking at the way that online data collection gives platforms an undue competitive advantage. Germany\u2019s antitrust authority, for example, has told Facebook that it cannot automatically share data among its different services, like Instagram and WhatsApp. A court <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/technology/antitrust-hearing.html\">overturned the action</url> in August, though the regulator has said it will appeal the decision.</p><p>Now the antitrust questions being asked by lawmakers and regulators are increasingly becoming intertwined with the debate over how to regulate privacy online.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that the relationship between competition and privacy is not either-or,\u201d Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, said at Friday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThey\u2019re mutually reinforcing concepts that must be at the forefront as we consider proposals to restore the internet to its full promise.\u201d</p><p>Proponents of greater antitrust enforcement argue that cracking down on the platforms will make it harder for the companies to pursue a business model that relies on the aggressive monetization of consumer data.</p><p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s so few dominant players, that opens up more abuses of privacy,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>But policymakers and experts on the right have argued that efforts to protect consumer privacy and bolster competition may work at cross purposes. Roslyn Layton, a scholar who testified at the hearing, said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/technology/antitrust-hearing.html\">Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation,</url>which was created to let people request their online data, had simply entrenched the tech giants by burdening start-ups that could challenge them.</p><p>In August, Noah Phillips, a Republican member of the F.T.C., said in a statement that Google had cut off third parties\u2019 access to certain data last year, potentially hurting their ability to compete with the search giant while bolstering user privacy. He said that privacy \u201cis important\u201d but that consumers \u201cand policymakers alike must recognize, however, that it comes with trade-offs.\u201d</p><p>The House antitrust investigation is expected to continue into 2020. Last month, the committee asked tech companies for a tranche of documents, including emails from top executives like Larry Page of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Jeff Bezos of Amazon.

To that end, as  Bloomberg reported  on Thursday (Oct. 1), the founders of dozens of tech firms housed in India held a Zoom call aimed at setting the wheels in motion to form what\u2019s being billed as a \u201cstartup collective\u201d to battle Big Tech \u2013 Google and Facebook, among others \u2013 across a number of fronts.   The call took place on Tuesday (Sept. 29), according to reports, and involved more than 50 tech firm founders. Discussion topics ranged from establishing alternatives to Alphabet\u2019s Google Play Store to pushing for other digital policies promoted within India. The organization\u2019s roster may extend well beyond the Zoom call, and as noted by sites  such as TechCrunch , may number more than 150 firms.   \u201cWe, the country\u2019s digital startups, need to have a joint voice so that the government and the people will listen,\u201d Bloomberg reported Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of payments giant Paytm , as stating. \u201cWe can\u2019t let all of India\u2019s digital dreams get controlled by one or two global companies.\u201d   Names being considered for the collective include the India Internet Foundation, among others.   The movement comes on the heels of Google\u2019s announcement that it will charge 30 percent fees for payments through apps for online services that include dating and education.  Android has 95 percent market share in the country.   At a high level, the push to form a collective hearkens back to the Modi government\u2019s efforts to spur consumers to \u201c buy local \u201d and to be \u201cvocal about local.\u201d Global companies (not based in India) have held dominance across any number of markets, such as smartphones and televisions (90 percent share) and in cosmetics and other consumer staples.   The Indian group, according to reports this week, is mulling a lobbying effort that would ask the government to require Big Tech firms to go \u201clocal\u201d in a way that would spur them to incorporate Indian companies and be governed by Indian policies and regulations.   The Indian companies seem to be taking a cue from other collective efforts that put Big Tech in their crosshairs. Last week, a trade group known as the  Coalition for App Fairness took shape, eyeing a push for legal and regulatory changes that would have ripple effects for tech firms that have app stores, like Google and Apple.   The coalition \u2013 with Spotify and Epic Games among its members, who have taken to the courts to challenge app stores and fee structures \u2013 has argued that \u201cone company has near-total control over the mobile ecosystem and what apps consumers get to use. After nearly a decade with no oversight, regulation or fair competition, it\u2019s time for Apple to be held accountable.\u201d   The battle, it seems, is being joined on new fronts.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    PYMNTS TV LIVE OCTOBER SERIES: B2B PAYMENTS 2021 \u2013 WHAT WILL YOU CHANGE?

Onlookers stared at a temporary stage decked out with a banner that read, \"Celebrating 20 Years of Salesforce!\" Onstage, flanked by backup dancers, stood a man dressed in a full black suit singing a familiar tune:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They can't, they won't, they never will stop the party.\" </p><p>\"Is this Pitbull?\" I asked a middle-aged man in a corporate-branded Patagonia vest.</p><p>He just nodded as he stared ahead.</p><p>\"Y'all having a good time out there?\" Pitbull asked to silence. </p><p>A good time shouldn't be hard to come by in San Francisco, but don't blame us for being antsy. If $24 lunch salads, multiplying tent cities and two-hour commutes across the Bay Bridge aren't worrisome enough, the city at the heart of the global tech revolution is now at the breaking point - and bracing for another wave of wealth to hit. With Bay Area-based tech companies scheduled to hold initial public offerings this year, the city of instant millionaires is about to have thousands of even newer millionaires. And many residents of this city - secretly and not-so-secretly - fear that 2019 is the year San Francisco becomes a truly impossible place to live. </p><p>Initial public offerings should be causes for celebration, and not just for those ringing the bell at the stock exchange. These public and soon-to-be-public companies - the likes of which include Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest, Uber  and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. , a San Francisco stalwart founded during a different Gold Rush - will allow everyday investors across the country (finally!) to partake in the fruits of a decade of consumer Internet innovation. Similarly, universities, pension funds and nonprofits will see windfalls that will underwrite important work across the country.</p><p>But most of the initial employees and early investors in these unicorns live here in San Francisco, one of the most densely populated metropolitan areas in the United States. In the months after these companies go public, it will be fair to ask: How much wealth can one city take?</p><p>You could say this crisis isn't San Francisco's fault, at least not entirely. It didn't anticipate the smartphone, the app store or the consumer Internet revolution that made San Francisco a magnet for young people seeking burritos and taxis at 3 a.m. It wasn't prepared for global interest rates to hit record lows and remain there, making late-stage venture capital a lucrative asset class where companies could stay private longer, raising funds not from public markets but from individual and institutional investors. It didn't anticipate the worst recession since the Great Depression and the surge of excess labor to power the gig economy. Nor did it notice the emergence of cloud computing that made start-ups easier to launch from a studio apartment rather than a suburban garage. </p><p>But it did adopt - and then cling to - closed-minded housing policies for decades, stunting construction and stifling growth even as repeated waves of young people poured into the Bay Area over the past 20 years to build the next big thing. San Francisco, very literally, wasn't built (or zoned) for this many people or this much good fortune.</p><p>A family of four making nearly $120,000 in San Francisco is now considered low-income by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. According to a recent report from rental website Zumper, the median market monthly rent for a one-bedroom here has hit an all-time high of $3,690 - nearly $45,000 a year. There are multiple social-impact start-ups, such as Landed, helping the underpaid and underappreciated - like teachers and nurses - afford housing in the region.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you're looking to buy a single-family home, good luck: Although there are  about 100,000 vacant homes in San Francisco and neighboring communities, many aren't for sale; some have been bought, likely as an investment, and simply left empty. (It isn't uncommon to find apartment buildings here that are one-fourth to one-half empty, an experience that is a little eerie, not to mention inefficient.) Those with the means to buy a home in these parts will find it challenging to lock one down, and the most-discussed topic among young people is: Will I ever be able to afford the apartment I am renting?</p><p> The irony of this extreme concentration of wealth is that tech was supposed to solve this problem and allow people to innovate anywhere. Instead, this super-concentration of new wealth is likely to push talented people and their employers out of the area in search of more sustainable lifestyles - meaning the wealth is pushing people out of San Francisco, not the democratization of tech. It will also ensure that bashing tech companies is going to be the safest political sport for politicians in the months leading up to the 2020 election. Candidates on both the left and right will lift a page from the early-20th- century election playbook, when Standard Oil was depicted as an octopus, dexterous enough to parry Republicans and Democrats. </p><p>No one's weeping for big tech, but the war on Silicon Valley won't solve the region's housing crisis, either. And regulation won't stop a financial culture that will continue to mint more unicorns and, thus, more Bay Area millionaires. We can only hope that a crisis of wealth will lead to better housing policy in the United States' tech capital, and that some of tech's victors will make an exit from this lavish party and take their wealth, their angel investments, their networks and their knowledge to communities outside a fatigued city that simply wasn't prepared for this Big One to hit. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-3a59ad8e5b2111e9962501d48d50ef75</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVH-4SX1-JB4M-V0YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><timeReceived>11:43 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0001TXN</classCode><className>LEVI STRAUSS &amp;

They were a rebuke of Airbnb as it prepares to go public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you are hoping to book a cheap stay just a short train ride away from the bustle of Manhattan, good luck finding an Airbnb in Jersey City. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  On Tuesday, Jersey City residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of stricter regulations on short-term rentals that will almost certainly shrink the number of Airbnb listings in New Jersey's second-largest city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The new restrictions were a major defeat for Airbnb as it prepares to go public and the latest in a string of laws that cities around the world have passed to regulate the home-sharing industry's explosive growth.</p><p>  The Jersey City regulations gained steam following concerns that the platform's 3,000 listings, many run by large-scale investors, were pushing often-unruly tourists into residential areas, helping shoot up housing costs and accelerate gentrification.</p><p>  Airbnb contended that its platform is a crucial source of extra income for homeowners who list their properties on its website and that the new restrictions were influenced by the hotel lobby. </p><p>  The company collected enough signatures to trigger the referendum and devoted $4.2 million to fend off the new rules, betting it could outspend its opponents by hiring political consultants and pollsters, and investing heavily in mailers and TV spots.</p><p>  ''They thought their money would win and I'm proud that Jersey City said otherwise,'' Steven Fulop, Jersey City's mayor, said on Tuesday. ''If I was an investor in Airbnb I would certainly take note, as this message of regulation wasn't sent by politicians, but it was dictated directly from the people.''</p><p>  Airbnb's opponents -- the hotel industry and an influential hotel workers union -- spent about $1 million in what quickly became the most expensive local referendum in New Jersey history. </p><p>  Jersey City, with a population of 265,000 people, became an unlikely but valuable battleground for the $30 billion company as it grapples with an escalating crackdown on illegal Airbnbs in nearby New York City, its largest market in the country.</p><p>  What do the new regulations actually do?</p><p>  The new restrictions allow homeowners to rent out portions of their homes as long as they're present during a guest's stay.</p><p>  But they prohibit renters from listing their apartment and bar owners from renting a property on a short-term basis most of the year if they don't live on-site, effectively banning large-scale Airbnb operators who had converted hundreds of condos and townhouses into makeshift hotels.</p><p>  It would, however, hurt residents who were making extra cash by renting out a second home for days at a time through Airbnb.</p><p>  What does this mean for Airbnb?</p><p>  The new ordinance won handily with about 70 percent of the vote, a sharp rebuke for a company that mounted a robust multimillion dollar campaign and placed its fate in the hands of voters after failing to forge effective political alliances in Jersey City.</p><p>  The restrictions were a sharp about-face in Jersey City, which had legalized Airbnb just a few years ago but sought to rein in the home-sharing industry as the number of listings ballooned. Other cities with Airbnb-friendly laws that are dealing with growing listings could follow suit.</p><p>  While more than 96,100 Jersey City residents use Airbnb when traveling, the defeat underscored the difficulty that sharing economy companies increasingly face in mobilizing users as a constituency.</p><p>  In New York City, for example, Uber successfully rallied its riders in 2015 to help defeat a proposed cap on ride-hailing vehicles, but it failed to replicate that success in 2018 when the city passed a yearlong cap.</p><p>  Airbnb did galvanize its hosts, but, in the end, they were outnumbered by a broad coalition of concerned neighbors and community groups backed by the hotel industry and local elected officials, including Mr. Fulop, a Democrat.</p><p>  It was an off-year election, and both sides privately speculated that a higher turnout could have tipped the scales in Airbnb's favor. If anything, the vote settled any regulatory uncertainties in Jersey City ahead of the company's initial public offering, or I.P.O. </p><p>  It could be inconsequential for the company's bottom line: Airbnb once heavily relied on business in its 10 largest cities, but those cities now account for less than 10 percent of its bookings as the company continues to expand in emerging destinations worldwide.</p><p>  ''From the start of this campaign, we knew this was going to be one of the toughest fights we've faced, with the big New York hotel industry determined to fight home sharing, but we had an obligation to stand up for our community,'' Christopher Nulty, a spokesman for Airbnb, said in a statement.</p><p>  ''There are Airbnb listings in over 100,000 cities around the world and we will continue to do all we can to support hosts,'' he added.</p><p>  How has Airbnb fared in other cities?</p><p>  Despite having legalized home-sharing in 2015, Jersey City now joins the ranks of other cities and towns that have tackled the spread of Airbnb and similar services. </p><p>  Los Angeles, Amsterdam, Paris and Vancouver, British Columbia, have all passed laws restricting short-term rentals.</p><p>  Denver has gone further: The city began filing criminal charges against people who lie about whether their listed property is their primary residence. </p><p>  Last year, Palma de Mallorca became the first city in Spain to ban Airbnb.</p><p>  Airbnb has sometimes pursued ballot measures, in which citizens can directly vote on legislation and money can play an outsize role -- as it did in Jersey City.</p><p>  Airbnb collected enough signatures to fend off a bill in San Diego last year. </p><p>  In San Francisco, where Airbnb is based, the company orchestrated an $8 million campaign to win a ballot question in 2015, but the city later passed legislation requiring hosts to register with the city, causing listings to drop by 50 percent.</p><p>  How does the vote relate to New York City's crackdown?</p><p>  When it comes to Airbnb, Jersey City has effectively become New York City's sixth borough.</p><p>  The city has more listings than the Bronx and Staten Island combined, and about the same ratio of listings to residents as Manhattan. A large portion of the listings are near public transit hubs that provide guests with quick access to Manhattan, just a four-minute train ride away. </p><p>  Some experts say that as New York City intensified its war on illegal Airbnb operators through lawsuits and violations, Jersey City's more loosely regulated landscape became an attractive alternative for investors.</p><p>  Sixty-five hosts who control 527 listings in New York City also operate about 492 listings in Jersey City, according to David Wachsmuth, a professor at McGill University who analyzed data from the analytics firm AirDNA.</p><p>  ''There are plenty of places that are vaguely Jersey-esque, smaller cities on the outskirts of major cities,'' Mr. Wachsmuth said. ''If the major cities are cracking down, it's only natural that a larger and a larger slice of Airbnb activities there are going to these smaller cities.''</p><p>New York City, which has about 50,000 Airbnb listings, passed a law in 2018 requiring home-sharing sites to provide monthly detailed information about their listings, including the identities and addresses of hosts.</p><p>  In January, however, a federal judge blocked the law after Airbnb and other sites sued. The lawsuit is ongoing.</p><p>  How do Jersey City residents feel?</p><p>  For weeks, neighborhood meetings grew heated as Jersey City residents were bombarded with a barrage of mailers and advertisements.</p><p>  Airbnb's critics argued the company ran a misinformation campaign under the name Keep Our Homes, labeling the regulations a ''ban.'' Its supporters said that the ordinance was influenced by the hotel lobby's special interests and that Airbnb hosts were being harassed.</p><p>  The vote was fraught up until the results came in.</p><p>  On Tuesday night, the Keep Our Homes campaign posted a video that seemed to show Mr. Fulop encouraging a resident, standing by a voting booth, to cast his ballot in favor of the new restrictions. It is illegal under state law to electioneer within 100 feet of a polling place.</p><p>  ''The entire video would clearly show that I didn't approach anyone, didn't have any literature and didn't electioneer,'' Mr. Fulop said. ''They ran a dirty campaign the entire time and should release the entire video, not an edited four second clip, followed by a press release from them.''</p><p>  At the heart of residents' frustrations were deep-rooted concerns about the impact Airbnb was having on their neighborhoods.</p><p>  Beyond quality-of-life complaints -- noise, trash and safety concerns -- many residents worried that Airbnb was being used to remove entire swaths of apartments from the rental market, potentially raising rents in a city already grappling with the pressures of displacement.</p><p>  ''The secret is out that rents here are skyrocketing,'' said Corey Klein, a real estate attorney who lives in Jersey City. ''Airbnb, for every unit that is rented out to the budget traveler, that's one less unit available to a working family.''</p><p>  The vote, he said, was ''a way of Jersey City saying to the big tech giants that an election can't be bought here.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Owners can still rent out part of their homes, but they have to be there, a direct slap at large operators.
